the people at abc forgot to do their biographical research... so many scenes were just plain wrong! the actor playing jpii was very rigid, there was no personality there. it is very very obvious that this movie was on the bottom of the programming totem poll, the move is so low budget. the script is terrible. conversations like: "you must follow the rules" "no, the people are starving." lame. plus, the movie was jumping like crazy from event to event in order to fit it into the two hours. terrible! a better use of your time would be to watch a pbs documentary on jpii. also, cbs put out a miniseries on jpii that is better than abc by far. jpii was a wonderful man, and it bothers me to think that my grandkids might get a hold of this abc movie and think that that is what he was really like!
