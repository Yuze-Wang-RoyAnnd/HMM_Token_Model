i have read each and every one of baroness orczy's scarlet pimpernel books. counting this one, i have seen 3 pimpernel movies. the one with jane seymour and anthony andrews i preferred greatly to this. it goes out of its way for violence and action, occasionally completely violating the spirit of the book. i don't expect movies to stick directly to plots, i gave up being that idealistic long ago, but if an excellent movie of a book has already been made, don't remake it with a tv movie that includes excellent actors and nice costumes, but a barely decent script. sticking with the 80's version....rahne
