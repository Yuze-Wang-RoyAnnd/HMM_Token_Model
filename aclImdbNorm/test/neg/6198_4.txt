the movie is nice well pictured, but no originality...<br /><br />this movie is directly copied from "the hitch" where salman plays like a date dr. like will smith, and govinda like some fat jerk, who is desperate to get in love with her boss by the end the movie comes to an old indian flimi style, the bride's father doesn't like the bride's lover and gets some other groom, and govinda the bride's lover comes in the end and saves her from the new groom and a fancy dance and stuff.<br /><br />the comedy was real good, no doubt when the hitch meets hindi would be more funnier....<br /><br />ultimately worth a watch but when it comes on tv after few months...
