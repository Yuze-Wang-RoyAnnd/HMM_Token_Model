i actually own this movie which is the mst3k version called "cave dwellers" which is really the only way anyone could really watch a movie like this. if it weren't for joel, crow, and tom servo constantly making wisecracks, it wouldn't be possible to sit through this piece of crap. you have a hero called ator who looks a lot like jeff spigoli in fast times at ridgemont high and appears only slightly more intelligent, just without being stoned. he takes on cavemen (the cave dwellers?) invisible guys, a giant snake (with a bunch of anal retentive snakes that like to line up all the skulls to face the same way), invents a hang glider which suspiciously looks like a modern aluminum one with some cheap vines wrapped around it, and then does battle with the evil john saxon-looking dude. then he rides off on his horse across the tire tracks where someone's been four-wheeling.<br /><br />yes, i got most of that from mst3k, which as i said is the only way to watch this turkey of a movie. if it weren't for that, it would get zero stars.
