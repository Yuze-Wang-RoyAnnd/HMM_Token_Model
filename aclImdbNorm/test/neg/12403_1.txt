this is one of those movies where the acting, set location, direction, and effects were so bad you need to rent a copy get 5 or 6 buddies, a keg of beer, sit down and watch it. to borrow from the late douglas adams, "watching this movie will be like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon... wrapped around a large gold brick.".<br /><br />what is wrong? everything. british actors posing as americans, there have been many that can pull it off like bob hoskins but he isn't in this one. it wasn't even necessary to choose north america as a location why not say it took place in england or something? the director seemed to like taking shots of girls tits and asses more than actually coming up with some kind of character motivation. so at this point you drunken buddies will be saying, "all right! another t&a shot!". there isn't much dialog so feel free to skip off to the kitchen and make those sandwiches. what did i like about this movie? after my friends passed out, i managed to collect $185 off of them and told them they spent it at the strip bar after we finished watching the awful movie.
