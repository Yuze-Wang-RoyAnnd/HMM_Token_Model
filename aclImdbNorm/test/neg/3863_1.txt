film noire is a genre that requires a certain level of tact, cleverness, intellect, and imagery. this movie has none of that, though they really tried hard with the imagery.<br /><br />it's the kind of movie that your cousin marky the dump truck driver, who's always talking about how he's going to make it big in the movies someday, would make.<br /><br />the dialogue is wooden and lifeless. the visuals, while obviously expensive to make, are the work of a director who has tried to be clever and failed miserably due to a severe lack in cerebral ability. the acting ranged from sub-par to just plain bad. the story might have been salvaged by a real writer and director, but i suspect that such people would not have touched it with a barge pole.<br /><br />about 1/4 of the way through, i noticed striking similarities with the scene in sim0ne where viktor, desperate to be rid of his actress, makes the world's worst movie. i figured i'd check imdb to see if a similar effect has occurred in this movie, and to my surprise it has. i'd almost be tempted to give a 2 out of 10 just because it's exposed the pretentious groupies, but i won't. it's that bad.
