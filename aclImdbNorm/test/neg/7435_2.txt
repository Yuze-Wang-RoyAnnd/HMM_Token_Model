ltl is the kind of formulaic, hopeless comedy to be enjoyed by the sort of sheep that stop and listen when they come across a band playing in a shopping mall.<br /><br />i remember murray promoting ltl on larry king's crappy cnn show, where he said something like "if this movie doesn't become a hit i'll stop making movies (or comedies)". he wasn't being nearly as jovial as one might think; he must have felt that ltl was a sure-fire hit and that its failure would mean his status as a star had markedly fallen - hence a sort-of ultimatum live-on-air to his fans to spend their hard-earned money on a dumb elephant comedy. (the comedy being dumb, not the elephant...) or maybe he simply realized during the shooting (or when he saw the final cut) what a turkey this was, so he tried desperately to convince everyone how much optimism he had regarding ltl's quality. "go see it, it really is good!" actors are prostitutes inter-bred with car salesmen.<br /><br />ltl is the sort of lousy project that comes from the "friends" school of comedy; their motto: "if you ever run out of ideas - or if you never had any in the first place - then stick an animal into the plot and that will at least inject an element of cuteness". cuteness = a sad substitute for lack of funny gags. the other motto "friends" had was: "always include pointless, dull sentimentality", which this movie so predictably ends with, when murray rather pathetically says: "what they forgot to tell you is that you never forget an elephant". maybe not an elephant, but i certainly managed to easily forget this turkey, which i saw many years ago. i was suddenly reminded of it when i saw a scene from it on tv today (hence this equally pointless review).<br /><br />murray wastes his talent on this turkey (disguised as an elephant), but he isn't nearly as uninteresting/bad as mcconaughey (or however that man's name is spelt); one would think that m.m. would have an easy time playing himself, i.e. a hick, but he is so painfully unfunny and unconvincing that i could barely stand to watch him make such a jackass out of himself. it was cringe-worthy. to round off this nonsense, we have that generation-x buffoon, garofalo, in a rather useless role. then again, everything about ltl is useless...<br /><br />after ltl, which bombed as far as i know, murray went on to become more of a "serious actor". what is it with these comedians and their inferiority complex? is it all just about getting awards, i.e. "recognition from their peers" (read: votes from their moron colleagues)? this piece of crap marked the end of a string of good and great movies murray made in the early- and mid-90s, such as "groundhog day", "quick change", "mad dog & glory", "kingpin", "what about bob?" and "ed wood". recently we've had the immeasurable pleasure of seeing him in garbage/mediocrities such as "hamlet", "lost in translation" (you just can't get away from these "ultra-talented coppolas"), and "broken flowers". compare those two batches.<br /><br />one guy described ltl "funny as heck". now that's the kind of audience this movie was hoping for... shopping malls and trailer parks...
