creakiness and atmosphere this film has, but so unfortunately does the print i just viewed. raymond massey provides a laid back sherlock holmes, almost comically so in early scenes in his bathrobe, which he trades in for a laborer's garb to investigate the creepy mansion of dr. rylott (lyn harding). what wasn't clear to me was why rylott would have wanted his stepdaughters dead. if as in the case of helen (angela baddeley), he didn't want her to run off to get married, he would have accomplished the same thing by having her dispatched.<br /><br />other curiosities abound as well. after setting an early wedding date with helen, the fianc'ee is no longer heard from for the rest of the picture. the presence of a band of gypsies at the time of violet stoner's death provides merely a diversion, and what could have been an interesting murder tool, a poisonous snake, is diluted by the fact that it was not a cobra, the musical renderings of the indian man servant notwithstanding.<br /><br />athole stewart competently portrays holmes' aide dr. watson, though he takes some getting used to if nigel bruce is more your cup of tea. as rylott, lyn harding is sufficiently menacing, a trait that would be put to good use as holmes' nemesis professor moriarty in two later films - 1935's "the triumph of sherlock holmes" and 1937's "murder at the baskervilles".<br /><br />with repeated choppiness and an unsteady camera, it's surprising that the story line isn't more disrupted than it is. it's integrity is generally maintained, even if one stretches a bit to fill in the gaps. i guess that would be my main complaint with the film, as mentally bridging some of the jump cuts in the picture proved to be a real pain in the asp.
