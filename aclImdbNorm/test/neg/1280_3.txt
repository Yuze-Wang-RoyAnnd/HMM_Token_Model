all grown up is basically a spin off and not much else of the original nickalodeon rugrats cartoon that featured the babies tommy pickles, chucky finster, lil and phil deville, angelica, susie and (later) kimi (chuckies sister) and dill (tommy's brother). i grew up with rugrats and thought it was a great cartoon. it had excellent humor, nice stories and the show's creators, klasky & csupo, were obviously very original and creative with the concept of the adventures of babies. the new show all grown up tries to recapture the magic of the original cartoon. i was disappointed when i saw it. i found the "all-grown-up" chuckie just annoying and the whole "pre-teen-acting-mature/trying-to-be-popular" that applied to (unfortunately) *all* of the characters dull and washed out. there still are some funny scenes and jokes in the new series and it was interesting how the artists would make the whole baby gang of rugrats look ten years from their age in the original show. overall, this show is 'fair' and only watchable if a) you're a die-hard fan of the rugrats, b) have never seen the original show, c) you're a pre-teen that has nothing to do, or d) your so bored that your somehow forced to see this show. this show is not that good. it doesn't compare to the older rugrats episodes in quality, humor, and everything else.
