flipping through the tv and saw that the secret life of was on; gave george duran a shot at being the host. i know that jim o'connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but george was well dull. he really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests. it seemed like he was interviewing guests for unwrapped, and he just happened to be in the shot. i don't know if george is going to get "better" hosting this show, i doubt it because he has hosted his own show now. the show did seem to pack more info in, but only because we saw less of the host. the formula of this show was very delicate, and i fear it has now been disrupted for good.
