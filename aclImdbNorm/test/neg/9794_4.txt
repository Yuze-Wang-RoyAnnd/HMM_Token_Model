after his widower father dies in a horsing accident, young tom burlinson (as jim craig) is left to manage his australian "snowy river" farm, with only wizened, peg-legged prospector kirk douglas (as spur) to help. times are hard, so mr. burlinson goes to work for mr. douglas' wealthy, silver-haired brother rancher "mr. harrison" (also played by kirk douglas). when a big job comes up, the silver-haired (older?) douglas feels burlinson is too young and inexperienced to go along; so, burlinson stays behind, and falls in love with the boss' daughter, sigrid thornton (as jessica harrison).<br /><br />the least satisfactory aspect of director george miller's "the man from snowy river" is a weak storyline. observe, for example, the "jessica is lost" sequence of events. the damsel gets lost in one of those "freak" storms, while running away. her worried father rounds up a posses of drunk men to find her, after predicting bad weather. damsel "jessica" rolls herself on to the edge of a conveniently appearing cliff. father and the suddenly sober men don't check burlinson's farm. hero burlinson discovers the damsel. after building a fire, he decides to kiss her.<br /><br />the "romance" is played too innocently for as obvious an attracted man and woman as burlinson and ms. thornton. to make matters worse, the douglas brothers have a "dark history" which is revealed before any mystery is built up regarding the matter. the main attraction, herein, is the australian scenery.<br /><br />**** the man from snowy river (1982) george miller ~ tom burlinson, kirk douglas, sigrid thornton
