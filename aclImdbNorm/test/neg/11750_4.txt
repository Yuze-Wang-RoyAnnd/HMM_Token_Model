the most disposable movie in the history of cinema?this one is a strong contender!why wasting so much money for such a pointless useless work? the only difference between the hitchcock classic and this poor imitation is color,wide screen and leila's walkman!!a movie which's supposed to generate thrills and fear leaves me completely indifferent.<br /><br />no you' re going to tell me it will urge the young generations to see the original?balderdash!this "psycho 1998" is a giant spoiler.<br /><br />they could have done something different,for instance ,by casting an actor closer to bloch 's bates ,an obese man.they content themselves with an obnoxious rehash!a pox on it!and long live alfred hitchcock!
