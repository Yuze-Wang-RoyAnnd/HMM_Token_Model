there were two things i hated about wasted : the directing and the script . i know i`m opening myself up to ridicule but stephen t kay`s direction is too much like a .... like a .... well like a mtv pop video . it`s shot ( i think ) on digital video against an intrusive soundtrack , often out of focus and often with rapid cross cutting . if you`re not a teenager you`ll find many segments of wasted unwatchable due to the stylistic approach . as bad as the directing was it was the script that yanked my chain . the story is told through samantha , a poor little rich girl who spends much of the film talking through voice over ( strange how the voice over never seems idiosyncratic enough to have come from the same character ) telling us of the pressure of her exams , the pressure of home life , her social solitude and it`s all this that led her to take drugs . it`s for similar reasons like parental break up that her two male friends ( i thought she was supposed to be lonely ? ) to start taking drugs . oh poor little sammi in her nice house and her problems how my heart bled for you and your chums - not . what wasted doesn`t mention is that no matter what someone is addicted to , be it drink , drugs , nicotine or chocolate that person has to work at becoming an addict , they`re not a victim of external forces , they`re commiting an act of free will . both traffic and trainspotting made this point very well , people become addicts because they want to . to portray them as victims in any way is wrong patronising and very possibly dangerous<br /><br />by the way , if mtv are anti drugs will they stop playing videos from stars who freely admit taking drugs ?
