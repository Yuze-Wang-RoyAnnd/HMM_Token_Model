for years i hesitated watching this movie. now, i know why. it was even worse than i'd expected. ashton kutcher makes the worst movie mistake of his career, since 'dude, where's my car?' tara reid co-stars as the girl of ashton's dreams, who asks him to babysit her father (and his boss)'s pet owl for the weekend. the rules: 1. no shoes in the house. 2. no people in the house. 3. the boss' son stays out of the house. 4. don't touch the furniture.<br /><br />well, you can pretty much guess by the end of the first twenty minutes, how the rest of the film is going to turn out.<br /><br />you know, there are films like, "meet the parents", where bad things happen to someone, but it's entertaining to watch, and it's delivered in a way, that you can't wait to see what happens next. this, is not one of those films. you know right from the start that bad things are going to happen, and they're mostly stupid things that would never actually happen. it's an extremely frustrating movie to watch, and there were about three times when i nearly turned it off, because it was so bad. but, i paid the rental fee, and figured i had to watch it now.<br /><br />tara reid was good, and i would like to see her in more films. though, i'm not surprised if this had a hand in hurting her career.<br /><br />the end result is a happy ending...but of course with the kind of film it is, you would expect nothing short of that.<br /><br />don't watch it. you'll sincerely regret it!
