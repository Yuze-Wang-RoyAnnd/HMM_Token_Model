"ninja iii" is not quite as bad as "enter the ninja", the first part of this "trilogy", but it's still a very bad movie. it will hardly please the fans of martial-arts movies, because there isn't enough action, but even the action scenes themselves are often spoiled by laughable excesses and needless violence. as if the film wasn't already weak enough, the filmmakers turn parts of it into an idiotic "the exorcist" rip-off. the only redeeming value is the winning presence of the actress who plays the "dominated" heroine; she is a beautiful and athletic woman, which the director doesn't forget to exploit in various sleazy ways - she just happens to be an aerobics teacher. i don't mind a little soft-core exploitation, but it must not pretend to be something else.
