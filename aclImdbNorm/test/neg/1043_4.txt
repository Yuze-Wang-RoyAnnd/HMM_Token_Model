karen and her boyfriend jerry move into their new los angeles apartment.they discover an old brass bed that karen takes a liking to,unfortunately it has a really sinister history involving kinky sex murders."deathbed" tries to be a creepy supernatural tale,but fails miserably.the action is slow,the acting is nothing special and there is no suspense whatsoever.even the sex scenes are lame.the climax is pretty gory and violent,so fans of splatter should be pleased.however the first hour of "deathbed" is deadly dull and offers some tired horror movie conventions and cheap scares.definitely one to avoid.my rating: 4 out of 10 and that's being generous.watch "re-animator" or "castle freak" instead.
