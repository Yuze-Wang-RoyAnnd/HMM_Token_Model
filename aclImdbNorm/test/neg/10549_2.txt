the toxic avenger, part ii starts with the startling revelation that after the toxic aveneger (john altamura who was apparently fired during production & replaced with ron fazio) had rid his home town tromaville of evil it actually became a nice place to live. this meant that toxie had no use as a superhero anymore & now suffers from depression & a feeling of utter uselessness (just like directors lloyd kaufman & michael herz should feel like after producing this), toxie now works as a concierge at the 'tromaville centre for the blind'. it's not long before trouble rears it's ugly head though, an evil chemical producing company called apocalypse inc. plans to take over tromaville for some stupid insignificant reason or other but to do so they need to get rid of toxie. after the evil chairman's (rick collins) first plan fails he bribes toxie's psychiatrist (erika schickel) to tell him to go to japan & see his father. leaving his girlfriend claire (phoebe legere), his mother (jessica dublin) & his home behind toxie heads for tokyo, japan. once there toxie sets about finding his father & a woman named masami (mayako katsuragi) helps him in his quest. meanwhile back in tromaville apocalypse inc. move in for the kill & without toxie the citizens are powerless to defend themselves. toxie eventually finds big mac bunko (rikiya yasuoka) whom he has been lead to believe is his father, however big mac is all part of apocalypse inc. plans to destroy toxie once & for all...<br /><br />produced & directed by lloyd kaufman & michael herz this follow up to the successful the toxic avenger (1985) basically proves the first film was a complete fluke, a lucky accident to combine the right blend of bad taste comedy, outrageous violence & so-bad-it's-good film-making, the toxic avenger, part ii is a load of crap in comparison. the script by by kaufman, phil rivio & gay partington terry with a load of 'additional material' credits does not contain one single funny moment during it's entire 102 (uncut director's cut) duration. the visual gags are terrible, toxie walking through tokyo with a wig & glasses to blend in for instance, or a scene where he heats up a bath with a bad guy in it & as he cooks toxie throws in a load of vegetable's & spaghetti, a scene where he sticks electrical wires up a woman's nose, sticks an antenna in her head & a microphone in her mouth to which a japanese radio announcer talks into, a bit where a japanese bad guy has his nose burnt into the shape of a fish, a bit where toxie grabs a swordfish head & uses it as a weapon, or the embarrassingly bad overacting & stupid idiotic facial expressions, a guy who literary has a fish for a head & gets turned literary into sushi, the awful comedy music & sound effects & the whole film in general is a pale imitation of what made the original mildly amusing & memorable. the bad taste gags aren't there this time round & the silly childish juvenile humour of the first is also missing, it just feels like a real step back from the original & lets not forget this is troma here so that is most definitely a bad thing. there are a few gory fights & some serious gore & violence, at least in the supposedly uncut 102 minute version i saw, crushed heads with the bodies spurting out blood, smashed faces, intestines, roses poked in someones eyes & thorns wrapped around their throat, ripped off ears, severed arms & a very graphic & gory scene of a man being chopped to pieces. unfortunately the special effects by pericles lewnes aren't particularly convincing & come mostly within the first twenty or so minutes. the acting is of embarrassing proportions as i've already mentioned. action wise there is an ultra cheap looking car chase at the end & a few unexciting, lacklustre fights utilising cardboard ninja throwing stars at one point. horror wise there is nothing a few gory set pieces apart. comedy wise this is very unfunny. in fact the toxic avenger, part ii sucks on all levels really & to top it all off it's atrociously made as well, most of the cast appear to be people plucked from the nearest street corner, continuity is none existent, cinematography is basic point & shoot & the special effects are anything but. one or two gory scenes apart this is total crap plain & simple, do yourself a favour watch the original again instead.
