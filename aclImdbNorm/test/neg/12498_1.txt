oh, dear! this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen. it's unbelievably repetitive; every scene seems to consist of people being gunned down, running round screaming, or being kicked in the face, which quickly becomes very dull. i wouldn't mind if the combat was even any good, but it isn't; the main character phillips pushes the various goons over with ridiculous ease, and no matter how often he stands in full view of the tracker, he never gets hit, even though extras and minor characters are being shot and blown up all around him. i've rarely seen a worse cast of actors (especially don wilson, if you can even call him an "actor") but that's not really surprising, given the dialogue they have to work with (sample line: "computers killed my brother!"). the plot is a sub-par ripoff of the excellent terminator; the special effects are laughable. overall, this film is just utterly dreadful. and why does everything explode?
