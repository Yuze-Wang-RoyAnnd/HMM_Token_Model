when i first saw this movie, i said to myself, "hey what the heck it sounds like a good movie, why not rent it?". so yeah, i rented it and went back home to see it. when i inserted it in my dvd player i was shocked.<br /><br />well first of all, no one told me it was a mexican movie and was spoken in spanish, good thing it had subtitles.<br /><br />second, it was nude, nude nude! since i have no background whatsoever in mexican movies, you could see my shock when i saw it. *gasp! covering virgin eyes, noo*<br /><br />third, predictable to say the least, but actually being it predictable was no excuse to me in liking movies, because i don't seem to care if it's predictable, unless it's way over the top. <br /><br />fourth, how heidi and kike were reunited, so cheesy. <br /><br />fifth, how the movie ended. it was a bad, bad ending. how mr. van der linde's sudden approval to the mayor's election was because her daughter, knew how to throw the party... blah, blah. i was hoping that he wasn't that easy to accept it, the director might have just rushed it. <br /><br />after all of this bashing of the bad stuff, the good stuff's are here to come. the movie was actually quite hilarious at some point with maribel being clumsy in the kitchen and all, heidi's attitude, valentina being poetic with words. what i really also like about it was the song that valentina made with her girl friend. that's all, and for the other stuffs that i haven't mentioned they were just so-so.
