first of all i hate those moronic rappers, who could'nt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads. all they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like clich'e'e version of gangsters.<br /><br />the movie doesn't take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before we're already at the warehouse there is not a single sympathetic character in this movie, except for the homeless guy, who is also the only one with half a brain.<br /><br />bill paxton and william sadler are both hill billies and sadlers character is just as much a villain as the gangsters. i did'nt like him right from the start.<br /><br />the movie is filled with pointless violence and walter hills specialty: people falling through windows with glass flying everywhere. there is pretty much no plot and it is a big problem when you root for no-one. everybody dies, except from paxton and the homeless guy and everybody get what they deserve.<br /><br />the only two black people that can act is the homeless guy and the junkie but they're actors by profession, not annoying ugly brain dead rappers.<br /><br />stay away from this crap and watch 48 hours 1 and 2 instead. at lest they have characters you care about, a sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the cast.
