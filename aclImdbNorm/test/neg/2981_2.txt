i saw that this movie was coming out and could not wait to see it. i have to say i was very disappointed with it. this would have been better as a mini-series. the whole show seemed very rushed. they did not explain things very clearly. at the end they showed john paul ii, alive and well and the next scene he was dead. never any explanation as to what happened. (we all know what happened in real life) i think abc dropped the ball big time on something that could have been great. in all i think this movie was a blur. it seemed like a drunken monkey jumping around from one point in john paul's life to another point never explaining how or why things happened. such as when his older brother leaves, it was never explained that his brother was a doctor and that is why he left home. also when his father dies, all we see is his father lying on the floor and that was that. i was very disappointed with the over all movie.
