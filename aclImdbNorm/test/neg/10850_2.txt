rigoletto is verdi's masterpiece, full of drama, emotion and powerful, memorable music. the maestro must have rolled in his grave when this bawdy travesty of his work was released with its needless frontal nudity and cheap copulating and its portrayal of the naive but principalled gilda as a horny ditz. opera certainly can be adapted to cinema --- look at zeferelli's magnificent la traviata --- but when a work is as superb as rigoletto, it doesn't need cheap gimmicks. it might even have been acceptable if the dubbed in music had been good but it is a mediocre rendering of the libretto with second rate sound quality at that.
