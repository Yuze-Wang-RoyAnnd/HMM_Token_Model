"blame it on rio" is a romantic comedy 80's style, with more than an eye full of sex throughout its 101 minute running time.<br /><br />the plot concerns two middle-aged men in crisis, one of whom is sorting through his divorce, the other dealing with the possibility of that same prospect. both good friends, they decide to take a vacation in exotic rio de janeiro, each with a daughter at their side. complications set in when one of them gets involved with the other's daughter.<br /><br />this potential riot of a story is fairly funny and there are some good lines, however it never really becomes hilarious, as it could have. any attempt at handling the moral issue seriously doesn't work either, and perhaps director donen should have stuck to the humour of the situation.<br /><br />not a bad film, but what really ruins it is michelle johnson's awful performance as the naughty little temptress jennifer. while she uses her body to full advantage, it's the only thing she's got. michelle's acting prowess leaves a great deal to be desired. no wonder we haven't seen her in anything else.<br /><br />friday, january 7, 1994 - video
