this is an example of why the majority of action films are the same. generic and boring, there's really nothing worth watching here. a complete waste of the then barely-tapped talents of ice-t and ice cube, who've each proven many times over that they are capable of acting, and acting well. don't bother with this one, go see new jack city, ricochet or watch new york undercover for ice-t, or boyz n the hood, higher learning or friday for ice cube and see the real deal. ice-t's horribly cliched dialogue alone makes this film grate at the teeth, and i'm still wondering what the heck bill paxton was doing in this film? and why the heck does he always play the exact same character? from aliens onward, every film i've seen with bill paxton has him playing the exact same irritating character, and at least in aliens his character died, which made it somewhat gratifying...<br /><br />overall, this is second-rate action trash. there are countless better films to see, and if you really want to see this one, watch judgement night, which is practically a carbon copy but has better acting and a better script. the only thing that made this at all worth watching was a decent hand on the camera - the cinematography was almost refreshing, which comes close to making up for the horrible film itself - but not quite. 4/10.
