i have to start out by saying that the actresses and actor did a fine job for what they worked with. the problem in dark reality is you had a poor director who tried so hard to be innovative and evocative he ended up trashing up the film. from start to finish you can tell the film reel quality itself is low, but the poor lightning and shaky camera only hurt it further by obscuring what is going on. the sound is muffled and often times not understandable. i'm sure huston (the director) would argue this was to induce a state of panic in the audience, but he had more than ample material in which to do it. having to result to camera and lighting the way he did was a sign of over the top syndrome.<br /><br />the story is good. a basic sadistic female kidnapper story that avoids clich'e by keeping the girl's in a state of despair the whole time for good reason. billy bob from silence of the lambs treated his victims better than netwon. the biggest problem with the story is that dead people constantly harass the lead character in her mind, and by the second time they showed up i was fast forwarding as this was attempting to destroy the only decent part of the film.<br /><br />in the end, the way the director pieced it together showing random blurry things and constant barely viewable scenes (not because of horror, because of the lighting, angles, and camera) ultimately destroyed this film. huston was obviously trying too hard and if anything it resembled a bad film school project. if you want to see a decent story then it's all right, but be warned the film quality is enough for most to turn it off.
