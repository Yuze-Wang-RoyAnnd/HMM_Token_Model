should i have expected anything other than putrid from carrot top? this was on of the worst movies i have ever seen. it is by far the worst comedy i have ever seen. "chairman of the board" did not add humor to my attitude, rather it enraged me. that's right, carrot top is such a bad comedian that i became enraged that this man is making movies.
