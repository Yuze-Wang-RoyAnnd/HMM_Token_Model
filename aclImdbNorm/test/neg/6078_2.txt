let me begin with a personal note as a film and television buff, more on the enjoyment side of life: i love what james woods can do and has done, and i always love melanie griffith, and natasha wagner was very good in this awful, miserable, stinking "true crime" essay.<br /><br />whoever really wrote this film apparently never spent any time talking to real criminals with real criminal talents: yes, some thieves are junkies but they have very short careers as thieves. truly successful thieves are seldom caught because they don't do "junk" or any drugs before going on a score ( job ).<br /><br />the james woods character was true to this paradigm in the beginning of this film, and then the script fell apart completely. he turns into a raging, alcoholic lunatic .... nice work for a high-strung guy like woods, maybe, but not in the least bit believable.<br /><br />most criminals are lazy. if they wanted to work they would work.<br /><br />these people in this film are beautiful, self-indulgent, drug-addled narcissistic losers. they couldn't pull off a real score in the real world, the real world where a big and beefy security guard who beats the living hell out of a skinny kid ( as happens in the early scenes of this "dog" ), keeps him beat down and doesn't let him up. ever.<br /><br />how many ways did i find to hate this film ? many. even totally vulgar people -- like most sneak thieves and junkies -- have a larger vocabulary than these cretins. and the 'rip-off' scenes with the neo-nazi bikers ? puhlease. all rednecks ain't neo-nazis and those who are neo-nazi speed dealers just ain't that dumb !!<br /><br />this film earned a two because natasha wagner was extremely good in her role as rose and because melanie griffith still has 'that something special,' or at least she had it for this brutal and offensively stupid film. i'm not one to sing praises of real criminals for any reason, but the reality of these criminal types in this horrible film is that they'd all be dead or in jail by act 2, scene 1. watching a lousy zombie movie would be time better spent than this .... thing ... and i hate zombies.
