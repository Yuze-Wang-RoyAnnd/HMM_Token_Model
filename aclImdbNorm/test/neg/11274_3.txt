thank god i have fast-forward. i think this is a movie about a guy who rises and falls. whatever: it's a stupid clich'e. it doesn't make any difference. there's this guy, javier bardem, who constructs buildings or something. it doesn't matter. he is handsome, this javier bardem. who cares? i think there is a car wreck but i watched this in fast-forward, so ...who cares? car wrecks and handsome heroes who struggle back from them smells like a melodrama to me. javier likes someone , but he marries maria de madeiros instead.she is magnificently, poetically beautiful, with a heart-shaped face. then javier has an oral-interface with maribel verdu, who washes her vulva, beforehand, for some reason. you would think maribel verdu, with her hand-washed vulva would be sexy. no, she is not. this is a tedious story about a bunch of people who don't interest me. javier, maribel, and maria have a threesome: how boring. this film is annoying. i think this might be a minor theme of (some) spanish-language movies: the rise and predictable fall of a little guy who succeeds against the odds. let me just clear this up: this is a high-class melodrama or perhaps soap opera. it is not worth your time, except for a laugh.
