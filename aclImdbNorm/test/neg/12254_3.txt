although this has to be the nadir of season six, this schmaltzy episode isn't badly written or acted. it's just that most of us looked to the x-files for taut, gripping horror/thrillers ending without easy answers and moving toward dark but fathomable conspiracies. season 6 gave us a stream of tongue-in-cheek comedies that undermined the show's continuity and, frankly, made simpsons' halloween specials look like great thriller tv.<br /><br />in this episode victoria jackson of snl fame plays the long-suffering girlfriend of a man who sets himself up as a rainmaker. however her weatherman boss is the one who truly loves her and mulder winds up having to provide him dating advice in order to get out of town.<br /><br />there's some playful fun with the chemistry between the agents and some amusing but none-too-sophisticated characterization of midwestern hicks. it's nothing you'd want to see more than once!<br /><br />it's hard to figure out season 6. x-files creator chris carter seems bored by the whole 'syndicate conspiracy' story arc and abandons responsibility to the black comedy writers.
