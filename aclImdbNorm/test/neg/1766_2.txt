i was really excited about seeing "cold mountain". alas, like most movies i'm really excited about seeing, it was a letdown! were it not for that miraculous invention called a dvd, i think i would've put my head through the monitor, i was so bored!<br /><br />i closely watched kidman and law when they meet because their characters are supposedly "destined" for each other. yet law's face showed anything but dumb-struck love, while kidman seemed to be counting the seconds until she could run back to her trailer! zellweger's character is pure granny clampett (as if we don't get it, cornball banjos mark her every entrance), and so over the top, it was all i could do not to laugh! ironically, her performance serves to highlight just how stiff-as-a-board the leads are.<br /><br />ada nearly starves because she freed her slaves; we never learn why. more perplexing is why didn't any of them stay on as ada and her father were unusually benevolent, and (as shown in one scene) it was a very dangerous time for negroes (as they're politely called here). why didn't the neighbors teach her how to milk a cow or grow a crop? heck, why didn't she just sell the farm and go home? and for all of ruby's practicality, when she dispatches ada's "evil" rooster, that kind of puts the kibosh on them having any more chickens!<br /><br />by the time her beloved finally returns, ada doesn't need him or anyone else -- which is the big joke! indeed, she may be physically intimate with inman, but her real intimacy is with ruby, who has turned ada into an "uber-babe version of herself. did anyone else notice how they walked down the hill holding hands, happy as two peas in a pod, as they left inman behind?<br /><br />i doubt that minghella recognized this as he was too busy making an anti-bush movie. inman tells us he is "like every fool sent out to fight with a flag and a lie", and ada's father says "i imagine god is weary of being called down on both sides of an argument". these "observations" are historically inaccurate and insulting. while slavery was the basis of the south's economy, the reasons for the war were more complex. it was incomprehensible for a soldier to think that the cause was "a lie" (in fact, most in the rank-and-file were indifferent to it). for filmmakers to stamp their views onto a period where such views were foreign to those who lived in that time is beyond obnoxious.<br /><br />structurally, the film is choppy and episodic. law and kidman are miscast, and have zero chemistry! the script is little more than half-baked dialog, and an egregious bunch of clich'es and banalities. "small moments like a bag of diamonds?" ugh!
