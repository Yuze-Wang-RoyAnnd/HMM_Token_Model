i had already heard of ali g in madonna's music video "music". i always think he's funny. (in fact, he really is.) just last year i always thought of buying a vcd of "ali g indahouse". that's why some months later, i bought it cheap and i started watching it.<br /><br />but the movie surprised me. my older brother and i were expecting it to be a great laugh-out comedy. it turns out that "indahouse" is just a stupid piece of garbage. it was really really bad. it also contains explicit sexuality content and very crude humor. it also didn't made me laugh, even just a big smile. we definitely hate that movie. oh by the way, i have plans to sell it.<br /><br />ali g was really different in his movie compared to his tv shows-- in such a negative way. maybe he wasn't really well-focused and enough serious to make this flick. just because there's some sex scenes in it doesn't mean it's freaking hilarious (because sometimes, too much isn't that laughable anymore). for the first time ever, i was disappointed at him. that really made me sad rather and happy.<br /><br />i gave this movie 1 over 10. actually, i really want to give it a 0 rating. it's one of the worst movies i've seen in my entire life. i wouldn't recommend to anyone who wanna watch good comedies that aren't too explicit or horrible.
