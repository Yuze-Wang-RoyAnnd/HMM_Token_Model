as much as i love trains, i couldn't stomach this movie. the premise that one could steal a locomotive and "drive" from arkansas to chicago without hitting another train along the way has to be right up there on the impossible plot lines hit board. imagine two disgruntled nasa employees stealing the "crawler" that totes the shuttles to and fro and driving it to new york and you get the idea.<br /><br />having said all that, it's a nice try. wilford brimely is at his quaker oats best, and levon helm turns a good performance as his dimwitted but well-meaning sidekick. bob balaban is suitably wormy as the corporate guy, and the "little guy takes on goliath" story gets another airing.
