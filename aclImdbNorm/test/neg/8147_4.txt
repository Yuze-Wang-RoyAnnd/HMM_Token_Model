admittedly, i watched the mst3k version of this, but it's not actually too bad outright, at least compared to others which deserve my cinematic hatred.<br /><br />the story centers around a troubled girl wrongly sent to a "reform school" called girls' town. along way, races, redemption, and wackiness (unintentional) happen. the story and acting are a little flat, as is the action. however, the entire thing is actually entertaining to a degree if you are absolutely bored.<br /><br />overall, just a simple sub par 50's flick, but far from the worst movie ever made, with some bright spots in the movie (the ave maria sequence was good for me).<br /><br />if you get a chance to watch the mst3k version, you won't be disappointed. by it self, not so much, but i can think of worse methods of torture ("spiker" anyone?).
