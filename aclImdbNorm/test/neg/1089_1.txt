we have given this film one star for awful, however, it really depends on how you look at it. we are currently watching this on channel 5 at 3.30am, and we haven't stopped laughing, so perhaps we could give it a 10, just for the entertainment value. right from the outset, with the 'manic' thoughts of the stalker being relayed in comic fashion, we were laughing. is it me or does that chick from knott's landing look like one of the characters from the dark crystal.<br /><br />i'm not going to spoil it for you, however, you would have to be pretty stupid not to see it coming, i don't think its clever enough for double bluffs.<br /><br />this has to be the worst/best film we have ever seen, if we'd been playing the 'spot the clich'e' drinking game, then we be wasted by now.
