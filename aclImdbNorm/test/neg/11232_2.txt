the worst part of all is the poor scripting, leading to superficial acting.<br /><br />dreyfuss' character is intensely repetitive and annoying, and dreyfuss himself has the annoying face to match.<br /><br />holly hunter's character is exaggeratedly self-centered, and hunter herself indulges in serious overacting, as usual.<br /><br />brad johnson was wooden. john goodman made the best of it.<br /><br />furthermore, the whole death / ghost thing has since been somewhat overdone, and now appears rather lame. <br /><br />barely watchable only if you like old aeroplanes.
