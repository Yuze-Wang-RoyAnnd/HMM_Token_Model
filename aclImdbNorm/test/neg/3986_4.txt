poor shirley maclaine tries hard to lend some gravitas to this mawkish, gag-inducing "feel-good" movie, but she's trampled by the run-away sentimentality of a film that's not the least bit grounded in reality.<br /><br />this was directed by curtis hanson? did he have a lobotomy since we last heard from him? hanson can do effective drama sprinkled with comedy, as evidenced by "wonder boys." so i don't know what happened to him here. this is the kind of movie that doesn't want to accept that life is messy and fussy, and that neat, tidy endings (however implausible they might be) might make for a nice closing shot, but come across as utterly phony if the people watching the film have been through anything remotely like what the characters in the film go through.<br /><br />my wife and i made a game of calling out the plot points before they occurred -- e.g. "the old man's going to teach her to read and then drop dead." bingo! this is one of those movies where the characters give little speeches summarizing their emotional problems, making you wonder why they still have emotional problems if they're that aware of what's causing them. toni collette (a fine actress, by the way, and one of my favorites if not given a lot to work with here), gives a speech early on about why she buys so many shoes and never wears them, spelling out in flashing neon the film's awkward connecting motif. at that moment, i knew what i was in for, and the film was a downward spiral from there.<br /><br />grade: c-
