i'd like to start by saying i would not go see this movie again if they were giving out popcorn made of solid gold and the ticket granted me eternal life. this movie was terrible. i can't give this it a truly honest rating because there are no negative stars. the acting is absolutely terrible. this movie is a travesty, based on the classic, "the most dangerous game". if you really want to torture yourself for 90 minutes rent something like gigli. at least j-lo provides some better scenery, ben should pacify the ladies viewing it. i'm not upset about the $7 i paid to see the move, i'd just like the 90 minutes of my life back.<br /><br />"can you give me my time back!?!" samuel l. jackson, changing lanes
