yes, that's true. that movie is a horrible piece of... you know what. almost all fans of sapkowski's books in poland think the same. the truth is that polish cinematography can not afford producing fantasy films. it's a shame when you compare "wiedzmin" and "conan the barbarian" for example. i hope no one outside poland will ever see this nightmare.
