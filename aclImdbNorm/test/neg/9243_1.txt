harmony korine. i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film. if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded.<br /><br />i know that there were big questions raised in this movie like, who are we really, what are we here for, is there really a god. all great questions, but i really don't think that is funny when you have the questions along side such tragedy. i'm all for real life being portrayed but come on. it's never funny when a wife is being raped, someone killing themselves (and family and friends find the body) and people die for unexplained and unnecessary reasons.<br /><br />the only good thing about this movie was the location it was filmed. there is a lot of beautiful places.<br /><br />i'm not a film student or even know all that much on the subject i admit this, but i do know that when i leave the theater with a feeling of disgust, then it was not a film i would recommend to anyone.
