maybe it's because i'm no fan of the comics (but if the comics are of the same "quality" as the movie, it's hard to believe there are any), but this has to be one of the worst movies ever made. non-existent plot, laughable acting, dumb dialogue... this movie is so bad that it hurts. a lot. that some people actually gave this one 10/10 is an insult to any good or at least mediocre (or at least bad) movie. if you hate yourself, then watch tank girl! on another thought, if you hate yourself that much, maybe you should just commit suicide... my rating: -34/10
