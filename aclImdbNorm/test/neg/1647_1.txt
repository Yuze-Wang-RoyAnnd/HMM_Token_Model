on his recent maligned reality-show, mr. shore conceded his filmic oeuvre is best enjoyed stoned. no, he must have said "best watched." while a healthy toke might see you through the end credits, there is little pleasure to be found, save some sporadic chuckling at the picture, not with it. titular hyphenate absence is the least grievance. other hyphenate, wholesome tiffani-amber thiessen (i dare you to rub out that "saved by the bell" patina of purity) is miscast as a rural vamp; she's too round of face for treachery. mr. shore, himself occasionally displays the odd talent for mimicry (i thought i recognized a jimmy stewart in there), however it is never aptly used. the trite fish-out-of-water formula has yet to be rendered with less grace. our hero, crawl has precious little wit to account for expeditiously charming his agrarian antagonists. ultimately, i had to announce it's been ascertained: the worst movie ever. p.s. as another fish, adam sandler fared better with "mr. deeds." it may take a shore to appreciate a sandler.
