it was praised to be a fast paced screwball comedy and the best german movie of the year, so i gave it a try, even though i've already seen some films by dani levy - or at least parts of them.<br /><br />i got what i had expected: no comedy at all, unless you think that heart attacks are funny. it's a fine example of sloppy screen writing, with an implausible plot and characters, loaded with clich'es that might be true, but surely are not funny either.<br /><br />the most annoying character is that of zucker's wife, played by hannelore elsner. she has to behave incredibly strange to keep the plot moving. for example: she doesn't know a single thing about judaism, but by reasons most likely unknown to even herself she gets the idea to play the charade that she and her family are jewish laws obeying jews for her husband's family, who really are, and of the very orthodox and self-righteous variety. to make it a bit more complicated, she invites the four of them to stay at her city flat, because they arrive from frankfurt in berlin without having booked their hotels in advance, something no 60 years old business man, actually no grown-up german would ever do. this gives the viewer a lot to swallow, but still fails to produce any jokes.<br /><br />zucker and his brother samuel haven't seen each other for forty years, but it turns out that his daughter - now a lesbian - and samuel's son - now a militant orthodox - were once lovers, and he's her daughter's father. samuel's daughter - a nympho - goes after zucker's gay son. is this supposed to be a somehow humorous parody of jewish incestuous tendencies? probably it's just a thoughtless way to add some "love action turbulence" every screwball comedy needs. and of course is also fails to produce any jokes.<br /><br />the praise for this movie is purely political. therefore only people who enjoy watching movies that are supposed to be "politically important" will enjoy this one - even though "alles auf zucker!" quite clearly has no importance of any kind.<br /><br />for all the rest: don't watch it without a "fast forward"-option. i really missed it.
