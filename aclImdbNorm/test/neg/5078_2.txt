obvious tailored vehicle for ryan philippe. it seem the studios were hoping he could play a lead tough cop and not look like he's eternally 16 (he can't).<br /><br />heavyweights jason statham and welsey snipes serve as bookends to phillippe, but when they're not on the screen phillippe flounders; his shallow acting style has nothing to bounce off of.<br /><br />the script is a typical late 20th century potboiler good cop/bad cop with a ridiculously predictable plot and dialogue lifted out of 1970s tv cop shows, such as "the streets of san francisco." snipes reprises his role as the eternal black-hat villain, playing a slightly less crazed madman than his demolition man role. however, there wasn't much for snipes and statham to chew on. statham's character announces he'd given up nicotine and caffeine - something this movie badly needed injections of.<br /><br />truly forgettable moment: ryan phillippe expounding on buddhist dogma: galloway: are you a buddhist? dekker: no. it's just something i picked up along the way.
