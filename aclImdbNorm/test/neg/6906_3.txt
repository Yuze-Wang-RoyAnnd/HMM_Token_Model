i took my 4 year old twins to see this movie today and i would not recommend it for children their age. <br /><br />this movie had many fighting scenes throughout it, which i found too violent and my children found scary. <br /><br />the subject matter was way over my kids heads and the death scene was too scary for a cartoon geared towards children.<br /><br />i was disappointed because we were all looking forward to seeing this, but it just did not cut it. if you have children under 7 years old, i would not recommend this movie.<br /><br />also, the utter thing made me crazy during the entire movie.
