harlan banks is thief at the top of his game, but, after a successful career, he has decided to settle down with his woman and retire. however, he decides to take one last routine job in las vegas. all he has to do is drive the car and it seems simple. unfortunately someone tips the police and after a hectic car chase he winds up in the slam only to escape and take revenge on those who betrayed and got him there in the first place. a typical action-fest ensues.<br /><br />steven seagal plays himself (surprise!) wearing a trench-coat and sporting his beloved colt 1911 along with his usual bone-breaking aikido. the colt and aikido have always been with him, but the first i recall him with the trench-coat is in 'the foreigner.' it isn't particularly impressive, but it does add a little notch to seagal's lethal arsenal of badassness. or it covers up those extra pounds he is packing. look at it however way you choose. his main buddy throughout the film is played by treach (another new thing, a rapper in an action movie) and they both uncover a little conspiracy of bad-guys, on both sides of the law, and give each evil-doer his due.<br /><br />the film's main problem is that is it painfully, and i truly mean painfully, unoriginal. seagal just follows a clockwork plot throughout the movie and even that manages to get more and more dull as the film progresses. then it goes from dull to utterly ridiculous in the final scene as people who seemed to be dead on killing each other suddenly, for no reason, start to talk. groan inducing in every sense of the word. the only real positive thing here is the decent opening - a car chase in las vegas complete with flipping police cars and generally entertaining mayhem, but after that brief highlight you've seen it all before. 3/10<br /><br />rated r: constant violence and profanity
