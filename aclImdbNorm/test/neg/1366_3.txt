this is one of those religious horror films which never explain why the forces of "evil" are 10,000 times stronger than those of "good". we've got here a satanic cult which can: 1) "beam away" people (like in "star trek"), 2) kill through little children's dolls, 3) transfer a soul from one body into another, 4) hypnotize telepathically from a bigger distance, and 5) cause drastic car-crashes in which selected persons turn into spaghetti while others (kids, in this case) survive unscathed.<br /><br />on the other hand, the forces of "good" can: 1) sit around helplessly, 2) stand around cluelessly, 3) panic, 4) laugh hysterically, 5) waste time by doing nothing, 6) read comics while people get slaughtered by the dozens, and 7) arrive too late to satanic rituals.<br /><br />in every religious horror movie i have to assume that that movie's world is inhabited by god and by satan. i also have to assume that satan can't be 1,000,000 times more powerful, unless the movie has a world order resembling that of hell. in other words, where were the priests in this film who knew something? the best that this movie's priest could do is guess that there are some witches about - nothing else - from reading all those books in his study. at the first sight of violence this priest becomes catatonic, then laughs hysterically, only to finish in a major panic attack. so this is supposed to be god's contribution to fighting satan? ridiculous. every good religious horror film has the powers of "good" equipped with some form of (more-or-less) supernatural power, or at least some concrete knowledge of how to fight "evil". in that sense this movie is quite idiotic. as is the casting of the droll martin to play the high priest(!) of the cult. there is very little menace or awe in watching the quirky martin lead a satanic ritual. i mean, it didn't have to be christopher lee or langhella, but couldn't they have found someone less funny-looking? also, why does the couple go back to the town after their car is put out of the running? after their "friendly" encounter with the town's folk no sane person would have gone back; they should've just walked on. the man's explanation to his girlfriend (and the viewer) is that "who knows what's in that direction".
