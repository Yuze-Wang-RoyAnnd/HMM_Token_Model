i found the first bit of stop motion animation intriguing and the mostly live action short with the girl going about in whatever country it was kept my interest, but the other 11 odd shorts really didn't pique my interest or make me think of anything at all. the music and 8mm footage all seemed to be so random that it all just seemed random. i would not recommend this to any one unless you get to see it free.<br /><br />as for the music being so in step that didn't come across either. i rented the dvd because i thought it was all stop motion animation or sma mixed with live action and only the first short was sma, the second had a little stop motion mixed with mostly live action. there was paper cut-out stuff in one, and the rest was outdoor shots from an 8mm camera with the music bed. just didn't have any meaning to it i could see.
