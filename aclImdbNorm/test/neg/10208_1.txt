i worked on this atrocity ten years ago. luckily for me, no one knows it because i didn't make the final cut. and when i saw the movie in the theaters, i was glad! my agents were driven nuts by the (apparently first-time) filmmakers, rewriting the script daily and changing their arrangements with the agencies just as often. they later told me that, once back in california (we shot in atlanta), these "professionals" had 4 1/2 hours worth of footage! even edited down to 90 minutes, it's at least twice as long as it needs to be. i found hulk hogan surprisingly charming, but otherwise -- what a waste of film!
