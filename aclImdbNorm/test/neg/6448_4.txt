amanda bynes is an enormously talented actress, and i've really enjoyed all of her roles in the past, especially in the fantastic "she's the man." for that reason alone, "sydney white" was a huge disappointment for me. the real reason for my dislike of this film is the poor use of characters. in a good fun teen comedy, its perfectly alright to have a cast of all fairly reality-based teen characters. in "sydney white," this idea is thrown out the window.<br /><br />amanda bynes makes a fine sydney, but she is really lacking in a lot of what usually makes her sparkle as an actress. i blame this on the script, which makes her character too bland and restrained, and on the hair/makeup department, which gives her a detestable plastic look and an annoying hair style. the seven "dorks" that sydney eventually befriends are far worse. they are so dorky that it's impossible to like them or even respect them as characters. they're essentially repulsive gag fodder. as is the story's "prince charming," who is completely unbelievable as a character and is about as cheesy as can be.<br /><br />perhaps the film's biggest star-to-be (with the possible exception of amanda bynes) is sara paxton, who's actually very good as the conniving rachel witchburn. it's just a shame that the script-writers didn't make her a bit more gray than black.<br /><br />the plot is basically that of "snow white." what kills it is that it is too blunt and obvious a re-imagining. the connections to "snow white" are thrown at us so much throughout the film that they are ultimately annoying and overblown. prince charming is unrealistically charming, the "witch" is far too despicably witchy, the seven "dorks" are too dorky, and sydney is just too pure of heart. now, this is not to say that the movie is all bad. though bynes is forced down by the script, she still has her moments. as does sara paxton, who brings physical comedy to the max in her scenes. sydney's room-mate, named "dinky" is also great fun as a character. it's a somewhat funny film at parts that is ultimately just too cheesy and clich'ed to recommend.
