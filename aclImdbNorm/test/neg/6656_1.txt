i haven't seen ishtar, but i did have the misfortune of seeing kevin costner's postman, this is worse. maybe the absolute worse piece of garbage i have ever seen, and if you look at my review for moulin rouge? that is saying something. bad plot, acting was substandard and even wasted (even though, yes, michael keaton has been in some of the worst movies i have ever seen), and this movie has no redeeming value to anybody with more than half a brain. do not see if you have graduated the 4th grade as you will find this an insult to your intelligence.
