i wouldn't have given this film such a low rating (2) if its average hadn't been ridiculously high, but someone had to bring it down to something more reasonable. i sat through most of this film, watching scene after scene of tagging and shoplifting. no dialog, just tagging and shoplifting. finally the two taggers kissed. something happened. but then back to tagging and shoplifting. i left the screening. i recommend this film only to those who are impressed by pretentious film-making. i disliked the directors previous film (a self-righteous defense of man-boy love) but at least that film had a story, interesting characters, dialog. the graffiti artist had only scene after scene of tagging and shoplifting. i want more from a film than this.
