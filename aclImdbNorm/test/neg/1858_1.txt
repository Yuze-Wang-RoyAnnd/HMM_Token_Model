jerry angell, owner of zombie-horror's finest mullet, returns for more undead action in the sequel to director todd sheets' atrocious home-made gore-fest zombie bloodbath. this time around, jerry plays a sleazy low-life thug who, along with his equally despicable partner-in-crime, some escaped convicts, several teenagers, and a bunch of screaming girls, comes face-to-face with a horde of shambling, flesh-eating corpses.<br /><br />obviously having learnt zilch about improving his craft in the two years since zombie bloodbath, sheets delivers another shoddy mess of a film that somehow manages to be even worse than the original
