this film is mildly entertaining if one neglects to acknowledge its numerous incongruities of plot and sheer lack of believability. bruce willis as "the jackal" never seems to live up to his reputation as a cunning mastermind of the underworld. instead, he bumbles about in broad daylight, parading a mishmash of shoddy disguises. why this man has never been captured before (or even identified) is beyond me. not once is the audience impressed by his cleverness or daring; considering the price he demands for his services (an exorbitant $70 million), his methods are decidedly low-budget and stupid.<br /><br />as for those in pursuit of him, they are at least as ridiculous in their behavior. they show no sense of expertise, instead relying on half-baked conjecture which sends them traversing across the country at their whim. incredibly, these far-fetched guesses (maybe he bought a boat, maybe he's in chicago, etc etc) invariably lead them straight to the jackal, who yet again escapes their clumsy grasp.<br /><br />richard gere, whose irish accent fades in and out like a distant radio station, plays the inexplicable role of an imprisoned convict who is released from jail to work alongside the fbi. he actually makes a compatible partner, if only because his means are as amateurish and inept as his professional pals. at one point, he actually confronts the infamous jackal, but unfortunately the fbi, although they trust him enough to leave him out of their sight, fail to equip him with a weapon or any means of communication. what kind of operation are they running here?<br /><br />the film also appears overly reliant on gruesome violence, which is entirely superfluous and provides no suspense whatsoever. the supposedly stealthy jackal acts more like a demented and senseless serial killer, eliminating people for sport and writing on a victim's cheek with blood.<br /><br />the film's action scenes are both predictable and unrealistic, and many moments are ruined with melodrama. this movie is poorly executed on many levels, the one bright spot being the ever consistent sidney poitier. avoid this movie if you are in the mood to think as you watch it.<br /><br />
