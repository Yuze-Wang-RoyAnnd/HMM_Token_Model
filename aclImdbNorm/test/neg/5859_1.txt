i turned this off about 50 minutes into it! whoever the moron was who decided to steal the idea of koushun takami's book(battle royal), & make it into a pathetic reality tv show scenario, deserves to be shot!<br /><br />it has done the film industry a good turn though. now directors like william malone(fear dot com) can say "well at least it's better than series 7" this piece of crap & dracula 3000 tie for first place in the worst 100 movies ever made! <br /><br />be warned this is not a 'so bad it's good'flick!<br /><br />this is a disgrace to film makers everywhere! <br /><br />never see this movie!
