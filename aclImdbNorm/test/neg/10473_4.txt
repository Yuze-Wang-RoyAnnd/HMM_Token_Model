i really don't know if this was supposed to be science fiction or horror. it was confusing to say the least. what really upset me, however, was the lack of story development between the characters.<br /><br />the sheriff's (bruce boxleitner) 17-year-old daughter (clara bryant) is stuck with him for the summer, and they don't spend 30 seconds on screen together at any one time.<br /><br />the hot native american (jennifer lee wiggins) apparently has the hots for the sheriff, but they don't spend any time together either.<br /><br />the hot secretary (kristen honey) ends up dead and she had more acting ability than the other two put together.<br /><br />the bad developer vs. the native americans is an overused story, but i personally like evil developers getting theirs as i live in florida.<br /><br />the only reason i stayed with this was the creature. it was original. i have never seen anything like it and i am a sucker for new creatures.
