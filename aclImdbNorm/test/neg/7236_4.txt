this is the sequel to octopus.<br /><br />pff... ok. a lot of stock footage, but pretty good. i'm surprised that they actually had a giant robot octopus that actually didn't look that bad! i was actually quite surprised by that.<br /><br />the movie overall was just ok fun. it never explained how the octopus got so big, and isn't linked it anyway to the first. but it was still fun.<br /><br />the ending me and my friend laughed at. basically, after blowing the octopus up once, the two main characters launch a bomb, and five explosions, most stock footage, appear on screen! we joked that they went to the dollar store and bought a 'five missiles in one' toy! believe me, it has to be seen to believe! overall just stupid fun. worth giving a chance, buying if it's cheap.
