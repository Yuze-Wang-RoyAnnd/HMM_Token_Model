this movie had so much potential to be hilarious yet moving but fell way short of either. it had a great story line, it just was not executed as good as it could have been. the weird "hallucinations" during his sleep scenes made absolutely no sense and definitely was not needed, they made no impact nor did they enhance or lend any understanding of what was to come or happen.<br /><br />jon heder's character was ok but could have been expanded upon more. he played the crappy part he was given at his best. the character was funny, but again, it fell short of what could have been.<br /><br />mila's character was perfect and her performance was spot on.<br /><br />in closing, the writing was horrible and more often than not, made no sense and his hallucinations did not fit with the movie at all. this movie, with better scripting and directing, could have been a contender to national lampoon's vacation as far as funny, bad things happening to a person on a trip across america.<br /><br />instead, it was only worthy of a second "flush". if i would have seen this at the theater, i would have demanded my money back and boycotted the film.<br /><br />the only thing that this film did was waste an hour and a half of my life. it also managed to make all those involved in the movie look bad, simply because the movie was a stinker.<br /><br />i do not recommend this movie to anyone! ever!
