no way this overly simplistic script, with basically one character, should be interpreted as feature entertainment. in reality it has about enough material for an eighteen minute short, and even that would seriously tax your attention span. zero characters beyond noble willingham are developed. the never ending closeups of lips and telephones are sleep inducing, and the script is so underdeveloped that a chimpanzee could have written it. in fact this whole sad thing shouldn't have even been put on film. a tape recording would have been more than sufficient to put you to sleep. definitely not recommended. - merk
