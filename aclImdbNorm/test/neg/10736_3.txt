i think this movie lacks so much of substance, it is even not worth a discussion.<br /><br />in the first, the package is really disgusting. especially the stereotype filming and photographing. surely, joe dante's cinematic stile was appropriate and interesting in "gremlins" and "small soldiers", i mean the imaginative and visual pretty story telling of a spielberg-wunderkind (i really loved these movies), but in "homecoming" it was a completely failure. attacks of toy soldiers and hairy creatures is simply not comparable with zombie-invasions (dead, stinky, rotten beings trying to kill the living - without any logical reason, just because they hate them). <br /><br />zombie flicks are characteristic in plain, direct, unconventional and brutal cinematography. nothing to be seen in joe dante's debut. another point is the annoying content: really stupid dialogs between the two main characters, a gruesome exploitation of the "elder brother dies and leaves the younger traumatized" and bad acting. and, by the way "homecoming" is neither scary, nor gory - and even less entertaining. you see, it is even not a horror movie.<br /><br />zombie movies in the decade of their birth - it the end of 60s/ start of the 70s - used to be revolutionary, provocative (espicially through its gruesome, explicit content) and of subtle social critic. the original zombie film was actually a midnight-movie named "night of the living dead" (1968). this one was a low budget movie that covered so many controversial themes, it's hard to name them all: a visual style of hitchcock/raimi, the american lifestyle of the 70s, political aloofness, the upcoming breakthrough of the human rights of black people and the even more upcoming racism as a result on the side of the conservative americans (remember the shooting of the black main character in the end of the movie).<br /><br />if you are interested in the creativity of midnight movies and want to learn more about the most important ones, i recommend you "midnight movies: from the margin to the mainstream ".<br /><br />so steer clear of "homecoming" and even so of romero's "land of the dead".
