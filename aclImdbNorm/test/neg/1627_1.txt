cave dwellers, or the blade mater, or whatever it's called, is in one word: vile! i saw this on mst and i laughed not only at the great running commentary, but at the inept film making that was demonstrated. sunglasses, tire tracks and where did ator get a hang glider? then they lift a few shots from another movie, where eagles dare as tom servo points out. to show just how cheap this movie really is, watch the scene where ator and thong have to battle invisible swordsmen. or even better, look for the giant hose dressed up like a snake that ator must wrestle! and what exactly do those scenes in the credits have to do with the movie?
