reeves plays haji murad, a hero in 1850's russia.<br /><br />this is a badly dubbed movie, with june foray doing some of the voices. unfortunately who ever was suppose to sync the voices to the lips was blind since the words never match the lip flaps. anyone who says that japanese films are bad have never watched this film.<br /><br />the film's plot is instantly forgettable and so i've forgotten it in the time its taken the movie to end and for me to sit and write this down. perhaps it has more to do with the fact that the film is one of the many that reeves made in hopes of moving away from action to more plot driven sort of films. it may have been a good thing for reeves, but its deadly for the audience who have to slug through nooze fests such as this, where its all court intrigue with very little action.<br /><br />in reeves defense, he was a good actor, he just had no real luck in picking films that were any good. they all looked great, but very few of them didn't put the those watching them into a coma for the film's running time.<br /><br />this film will put you in a coma. watch it only if you have the need for sleep and all other gentler means have failed.
