this is a joke, right? this can't be a real film? it's not even a real video? give any harvey milk high school kid a video cam and they could make a better movie than this. the film maker's can't be serious... right? is this satire? comedy? drama gone horribly wrong? the script is about as single-minded and dull as is conceivable. ten monkeys locked in a room with a laptop could come up with a better screenplay. the dialogue isn't clich'ed. clich'ed dialogue might elevate this holiday mess to something akin to camp fun - but it doesn't and it isn't. worst of the worst - a landlady wanders into a dramatic scene in a private apartment dressed a bathrobe carrying a frying pan like something out of a "honeymooners" episode. whaaa??? i have seen better acting from middle school drama clubs. one of the leads is an attractive lunk, the other is not. both can't even manage a convincing kiss. so much for romance. the supporting players are jaw-droppingly over-the-top.<br /><br />everything is underscored by a nauseating soundtrack and the sound seems to have been recorded in a back room toilet. most of the dialogue is (mercifully) unintelligible.<br /><br />this stale cinematic fruitcake isn't even worthy of being the next rocky horror or a gay holiday installment of mystery science theatre 3000. it's just plain bad. in every way. visions of sugarplums will not dance in your head - they will trample your every expectation. have an eggnog and stare at mindlessly at the neighbor's holiday lights - it will be time better spent.
