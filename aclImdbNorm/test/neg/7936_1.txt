you expect it to be juvenile but you at least expect a complete and coherent movie. what a waste. i am extremely disappointed, not at just having watched a bad movie, but at having such a great concept be tainted by a common movie that we've all seen before. if this crud makes $1 over its budget, the studio would be wise to declare victory, round up all available copies, store them deep within the nuclear waste repository under yucca mountain, and then never make another movie like it again. most of this movie will keep you thinking, "this is not what i wanted to see." this film appeals to the unintelligent and maybe to teenagers. it's a true shame because most movies are made for that demographic. i had much higher hopes for this film.
