this movie was a low point for both jason robards and sam peckinpah. major plot points are taken directly from sergio leone's masterpiece "once upon a time in the west" (released two years earlier and also featuring robards): a man finds a watering hole is found in the desert, being the only water for many miles in every direction, he plans to build a 'station' around the hole and to ensure there's a love interest, he falls in love with a prostitute. to this add an intemperate preacher, bad music, silly fast action shots, even sillier t&a shots - and there you go. there is little question why it failed at the box office. the real question is "how did it make it that far?".
