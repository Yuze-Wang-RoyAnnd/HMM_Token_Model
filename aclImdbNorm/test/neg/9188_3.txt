in the aftermath of september 11th in new york, this drama about american firefighters was conceived as a salute and tribute to their professionalism. the story is told with a series of flashbacks, where after firefighter jack morrison (joaquin phoenix) has crashed through the floor of a burning building, and only communicating with captain mike kennedy (john travolta) via the radio. the flashbacks basically show how jack grows from being a recruit, seeing kennedy as a father figure, to being a firehouse legend. of course, in the present day, jack's fellow firefighters are trying to reach him, but they are too late, and in the end, he lets them leave him, and it forwards to his funeral, where he is praised as one of the best firefighters they have known. also starring jacinda barrett as linda morrison, terminator 2's robert patrick as lenny richter, morris chestnut as tommy drake, billy burke as dennis gauquin, balthazar getty as ray gauquin and tim guinee as tony corrigan. the blazes of the film are ultimately all i could pay attention to and enjoy seeing the characters tackle them, the rest is a bit too chatty for my liking. adequate!
