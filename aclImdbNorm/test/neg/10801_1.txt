it's the sooooouullltakaaaa!<br /><br />wow. what a skin peeling bad movie. honestly, this is one of my favorite episodes of mst3k.... just some things to point out...<br /><br />1) the incestuous lesbian mother-daughter exchange was weird. i do need counseling now.<br /><br />2) there is no god, there is just dude.. i love that quote from crow.<br /><br />3) whatever did happen to the nuns that took the bus home, will we ever know? i have a horrible emptiness in my stomach.<br /><br />4) lastly, don't watch this movie un-mstied... it has joe estevez as the main star.. yikes..<br /><br />1/10 for un-mstied 8/10 for mstied.
