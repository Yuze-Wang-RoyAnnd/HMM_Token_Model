this is on my tv right now... but only long enough for me to finish panning it in this comment. the previous comment let me know that this movie will not get any better, no matter how much i hope and pray. i will concur this movie is a colossal waste of my time, and would be of your time...it is not going to get any better! i can't believe this screenwriter is doing atlas shrugged! i hope he has improved a million-fold! i see some other credits on his resume that have had good reviews, but i'm still not convinced. if you are familiar with his work, please post something here, because i really want to see atlas shrugged, and would hate it if this guy turned it into the garbage that this movie turned out to be.
