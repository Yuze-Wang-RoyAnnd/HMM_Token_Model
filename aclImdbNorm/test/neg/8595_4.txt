if you can watch a film without worrying about the plot, or corny acting, then backdraft is definitely the one.<br /><br />however, if, like me, you like watching films that you can believe, then backdraft has some serious flaws. it doesn't offer anything new, and there are hundreds of 90's action films that follow identical formulas, whilst not being quite as clunky.<br /><br />after two firefights, i'm thinking, this has got to go somewhere else, i mean, how many big fires are there in one city? surely firemen do other things, such as getting cats out of trees? well i was wrong, and the repetition continues again and again, up until the end.<br /><br />a good aspect of the film is the fire itself, well filmed, and i must say i felt quite hot while watching it, which suggests that two hours of watching fire without a story or acting would have been more suited to my taste.
