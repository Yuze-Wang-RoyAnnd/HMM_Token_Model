i mean, come on! now my countrymen have started to make westerns! is it not enough that our cinema sucks already? now you need to infect english-language movies with polish acting and no sense whatsoever? please, stay away from this movie, do not waste your eyes on it. a 5-year-old baby could make a movie that makes more sense. i am from poland and i am ashamed this title might actually be watched by you. please, i am begging you, do not watch this movie and if you do, do not judge polish people and polish movies based on what you see there. we had some good movies in our history and we had some bad ones but this one - it is like nothing worse that i have seen in my entire life. keep away!!!
