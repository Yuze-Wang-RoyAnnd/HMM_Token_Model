without a shadow of a doubt this is and probably will always be the worst film i have ever had the missfortune to see my whole life. take 5 wooden actors who got thrown out of acting school because they were so wooden someone sat on them thinking they were a bench.<br /><br />then add a cheap camcorder. you know the old vhs types that cost lb20 on ebay. add a terrible story line with no effects and yes you have this film. what a shocker it was. they couldn't even save it by having a fit girl in it. she was fat and ugly and was the worst of all. i actually watched it all as i could not believe this crap ever got funded.<br /><br />miss at all costs
