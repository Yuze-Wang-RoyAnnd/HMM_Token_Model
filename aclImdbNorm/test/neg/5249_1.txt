this movie is painful. that's probably the best way to describe it. it's 93 minutes of your life that you will never be able to get back. well, actually it's more like 86 minutes because there is no way anyone would want to sit through the credits in this stinking pile of dog feces. immediately you can tell the movie is from the producer of "mortal kombat", due to it's thumping and annoying techno soundtrack. this drains the few laughably enjoyable moments this movie can give you. the rest is drained by the completely uninteresting and annoying characters, the "freddie prinze, jr. school of acting" acting abilities of all involved (including the miscast christopher lambert), and the non-existant directing. did i leave anything out? of course i did. let's not forget about the suicide-inducing script, with it's unitentionally (??) funny dialogue. oh, yes, and let us also talk about how they shamed the original poem with this sad and useless futuristic/medieval translation. the costumes and weapons (were those giant pizza cutters i kept seeing?!?!) are just plain stupid, that's the best way i can describe them. and the last culprit of the night is the always awful cgi. when will filmmakers learn that cgi sucks? when will we see the wonderful effects used in the 80's? probably never, but films like this and "star wars, episode 1: the phantom menace" make us wish that they would bring them back. in closing, avoid this movie like the newest freddie prinze, jr. movie. then again if you like freddie prinze, jr. movies then you deserve to sit through this horrid excuse for filmmaking.
