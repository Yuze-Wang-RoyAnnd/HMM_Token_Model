i'd never heard of this film before i caught it on the telly last night. i do hope it was never given a cinema release as this would be an insult to the silver screen and movie-goers alike.<br /><br />was it supposed to be serious, was it supposed to be funny? why the outrageously basic plot? does anyone actually care?...<br /><br />awful film.<br /><br />2/10
