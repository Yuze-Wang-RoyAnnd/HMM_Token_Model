i went into this movie hoping for an imaginative twist on the second coming. boy, was i ever wrong. bbc are dullards at pacing a movie, total idiots at creating suspense, fools at building intensity. and this movie is no exception to the rule of how much bbc sucks.<br /><br />ugh, the pacing and time-wasting laborious dialogue was just painful to sit through. the first 30 minutes felt like 2 hours. i kept looking down at my watch wondering when the pointless, monotonous drivel would end. they wasted a perfectly good actor in the lead role, because the material is so lazy, and sloppily, written. everything that happens is just to kill time.<br /><br />out of 155 minutes, only 15 minutes are interesting (the controversial ending). what a shame. reading the plot summary is more interesting than watching the movie. the preaching, the "am i god" endless blah blah blah-ing, the dumb as doornails boring miracles... ugh.<br /><br />do not watch this crap.
