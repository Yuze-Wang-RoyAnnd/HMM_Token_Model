when i watched this movie it was an afternoon after i got home from work. i love horror movies and have seen some really cheesy ones, but this takes the cake. the plot presented to the viewer in the beginning of the movie seems a little intriguing, but as the movie progresses the script makes a wrong turn with horrible cliches and bad presentation, which in turn makes the movie completely dull and boring. i don't mean to keep criticizing the script and plot, because believe me that is not the worst part. i have to say as a whole the acting was not terrible for beginning actors, and i was impressed with taylor locke, this being one of his first movies. the worst part of the movie was the special effects. they reeked of low budget, and really ruined the viewers entertainment, even if he had been remotely interested in the plot. i do recommend you watch this movie to understand the power of a bad script and plot. only then can you really appreciate good writers and directors.
