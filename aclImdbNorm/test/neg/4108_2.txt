the acting was terrible, the cheesy, fake, cheap green screen effects were ridiculous, and the creatures were absolutely retarded. the only good thing about this movie was the concept, and the laughs i got from watching such a bad movie- then i became pretty angry because i realized i wasted 4 bucks on renting it. why would a movie like this ever be in theaters? i know this movie came out almost 5 years ago, but does anyone put any effort into making movies anymore? i am just writing random things to fill up space- because i need ten lines of text in order to publish this review. this next line should just about do it. annnndddddd there!
