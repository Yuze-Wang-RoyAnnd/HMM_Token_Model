this is what used to be called a "women's picture" and later a "chick's flick" when times and movies got more juvenile. the plot is just soap opera for women and will only appeal to those types. the only appeal for most guys is if they wanna see a too rail-thin mary tyler moore in leotards. (if you're of a certain age, like me, that might still be enough to give it a look.) otherwise mtm gives another of her typical by-the-numbers performances that she's been giving since the early 70s when she took it to heart that she was america's sweetheart. christine lathi gives another of those abrasive and unpleasant performances that seem a real part of her as a person and probably only appeal to those of that type. (sorry, but it seems true.) ted danson is too young as mtm's husband and usually gives off a slightly creepy appeal unless he has an acting partner who can soften it. and it doesn't happen here. allan burns wrote & directed and probably got it all through because he worked with mary before, wrote it as a project for her, and she had the juice at this point to get it made. there seems no other purpose to it.
