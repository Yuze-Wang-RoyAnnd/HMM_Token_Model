thanks to silly horror movies like "troll" and the indescribably atrocious cult-favorite "troll 2", it has become practically impossible to take movies with kobolds, gnomes and various other types of little green hobgoblins seriously these days. only just recently i watched the 70's made-for-tv movie "don't be afraid of the dark", which is basically a quite terrifying and serious-toned film about domestic little goblin monsters, and yet i still couldn't help thinking back about the laugh-inducing potato headed critters dressed in garbage bags that were running amok in "troll 2". same thing happened to me now. as much as i tried going into "inhabited" with a clear mindset, unconsciously i kept comparing the supposedly creepy and menacing garden fairies with the badly sculptured goblins of nilbog! still, even without all the prejudices, "inhabited" is a remotely entertaining albeit unmemorable straight-to-video horror flick. it's a cheesy, soft and politically correct pastiche of family drama and northern europe mythology. the annoying and murderous little creatures in this movie aren't your plain average goblins; they are "the huldre": wicked little norwegian demons that live underground and attempt to chase happy families out of their houses through influencing the youngest children. this overcomes the russell family as they move into their ramshackle dream house in a remote little town. the cherubic blond daughter of milf-actress megan gallagher starts to behave strangely whenever she hangs out in the cute play house in the back of the garden. she claims her friends are fairies, and even though the sinister handyman also warns for strange occurrences in the past, gina's parents simply think the girl has troubles adjusting to her new neighborhood. when she keeps rattling about fairies, they arrange an appointment with the acclaimed psychologist dr. werner whilst "the huldre" are slowly coming out of their botanical shelter. not much special to mention here. the pace is acceptable and the attempts to build up suspense are pretty cute. you understand this is a family-friendly horror movie, so no bloody murder sequences are graphically being shown here. heck, even the cadaver of the family's pet cat is kept off-screen. this is the umpteenth nonsensical horror movie in which malcolm mcdowell pops up and he practically always depicts an unreliable, greedy and self-centered authority figure.
