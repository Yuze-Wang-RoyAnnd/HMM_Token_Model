i've tried watching it twice, though i haven't been able to make through either episode. for me, it's basically just not funny. i can tell where i'm suppose to laugh, but i can't. i've never seen the original, so i'm not comparing. i also love comedies, including off-the-wall comedies like married...with children and family guy, but this show just doesn't' do it for me. the jokes are lame and flat, and the acting is mostly annoying. the commercials made it look interesting, but it isn't. they're trying too hard to be different, and tying to force the humor. that style usually doesn't work too well. i don't think this show finishes the season. of course, i could be wrong.
