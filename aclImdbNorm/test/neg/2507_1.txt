the opening was a steal from "eight-legged freaks", a film that is everything this one isn't. stilted and pedestrian are the words that apply - along with others that can't be repeated..! drifter type returns to his home(?)town, meets up with old friends etc.... the usual annoying kid, single mother,local loudmouth and so on..bad special effects, alien ship, atmospheric disturbances, (hey, didn't the director see "close encounters"?). good acting? good story? good camera angles? good cutting? not here! do not rent, unless you are sharing the cost and have a lot of beer handy. do not watch on tv, go and drink a lot of beer instead - you'll enjoy it more!
