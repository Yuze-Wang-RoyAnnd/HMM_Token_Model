watched this months ago on netflix instant and left a review there.<br /><br />let me say, most of the other reviews are very accurate. this movie was bad writing, bad acting and bad directing. i too, had liked russell and pare "back in the old days" and was very hopeful for them. in my netflix review, i mentioned that i lost interest in the film and proceeded to wash the dishes and make a sandwich, yet still watching the movie from the kitchen. when i did return to the living room, i was very confused as the last 5 minutes of the film unfolded. i even rewound it to make sure i was not missing anything. this film totally crapped out on how to do a "twist" ending. i suspect that the idea sounded good, maybe the script was intriguing, but the budget was so non-existent that sets were really lacking. and yes, i suppose all those "bad sets" were an effort to give the viewer a clue. all it told me was "low budget."<br /><br />anyway, the reason i came here, was because over the weekend i saw a review of shutter island, and with what the reviewers were saying, or not saying, lead me to believe that shutter island is the same deal, only with a budget 50 to 60 times more! (actually i have no idea how much dark world cost, but i hope they didn't spend more than 1 million!)<br /><br />so, that being said, i kinda thought that if someone reworked the script a bit, got a bigger budget for a better "look" (whether that meant a better scenic designer, or better post coloring, just someone with a vision,) they could remake dark world into a passable product. now it sounds like shutter island is doing that. looks like they got the vision right, but the scripting could still be off. money can't buy everything, but it should in hollywood!<br /><br />ps my 2 star rating is for russell and pare.
