words cannot describe how horrible this movie is. well, maybe they can. i'll take a stab at it: 1 - pitiful. hollywood makes more talking animals set in graphics. apparently script and storyline aren't needed anymore.<br /><br />2 - violent. kids movie but yet one of the characters is viciously attacked and killed.<br /><br />3 - blatantly stupid. the movie is actually depicting the farm animals as having human abilities. in nemo, the fish could talk, but for the most part, they are still fish. we only hear the english as a translation. in barnyard, the animals are actually speaking english that other people can understand.<br /><br />4 - unintelligent - no smart story line or even any smart humor. (ok, the 13 year old dog on crutches was funny).<br /><br />5 - culturally insensitive - the "black" cow is actually played by a black actress. the pink cow is played by a white actress. the black cow was playing a stereotypical black person.<br /><br />6 - ignorant - no such thing as a male cow that i'm aware of. i believe we call them bulls? if we are going to expose our children to drek, it might as well have the simplest facts correct.<br /><br />7 - boring and borish. my 4 year old had us leave after 45 minutes. he practically fell asleep.<br /><br />i'm sure this movie will make millions, which is unfortunate, because it only proves to hollywood producers that the american public at large is just filled with suckers waiting to pay 8 bucks just to get some peace and quiet from the kids for an hour or two. an unfortunate circumstance. why should the producers spend real money when the returns will be the same either way.
