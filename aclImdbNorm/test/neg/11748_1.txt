first of all,the whole idea of remaking a classic such as "psycho" is nothing short of ludicrous.a lot of time and effort was wasted here.i am sure they are smart enough to know that they could not improve on the original,so they must have had a tribute to alfred hitchcock on their minds.however,the idea that began as a well intentioned tribute, results in being a slap in the face to the horror master.this movie is poorly produced,poorly acted,and unnecessary to begin with.the original classic stands well on it's own,even after 40 years.the event of hitch returning from the grave and coming after the people responsible for this piece of trash is unlikely,but if i were them,i would sleep with one eye open just in case.don't waste your time.
