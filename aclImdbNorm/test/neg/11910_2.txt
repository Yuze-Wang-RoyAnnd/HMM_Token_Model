jack lemmon was one of our great actors. his performances in days of wine and roses, the apartment, some like it hot, missing (to name the first ones that come to mind) were all worthy of best actor nomination. his only win was for save the tiger, and that's a shame. he gets melancholy down to a science, but never brings it into balance with the driver in his character. he actually did a similar character much better toward the end of his career in the one-note glengarry glen ross. <br /><br />as for the movie, wonderful supporting work by jack gilford as lemmon's partner and thayer david as an arsonist, go for naught because the rest of the script is a muddled jumble of cliched vignettes, angst, neurotic nostalgia, and pointless moralizing. worth seeing once as a time capsule into 1970's style experimental direction by avildsen.
