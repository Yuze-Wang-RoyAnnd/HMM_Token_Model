i once heard this movie described as either you'll love it or you'll hate it. from reading some of the other reviews and the ratings, i would venture to say that this is true. i am placing myself in the hate it crowd. i have seen some truly bad movies, boring movies, and even low budget movies. this movie is bad on all three fronts.<br /><br />this island earth's exeter (jeff morrow), returns to his sci-fi/b-movie roots as dr. les (minus giant head prosthetic). the doctor and his assistant arnie (george o'hanlon - aka the voice of george jetson), along with les' girlfriend assistant vera, are tracking a meteor. this is the crux of the cast and is almost a double date. les has vera and arnie has his "susie" (synchro unifying sinometric integrating equitensor - aka the computer). lets just say the relationship between george and his robotic maid, rosie, (and his relationship with "susie") is more believable than the cold, clam-like feelings vera has for les (and vice versa). the object of their all their interest is no ordinary meteor, however. it is really an alien art nouveau/art deco energy storage device, which moves around like a 3 legged dog. there is also the little alien "energy" being that controls dr. hubbel (aka, the chief scientist there). the alien is obviously and from the get-go, malicious and evil. is this the kind of science we are handing out? no wonder the aliens from the explorers were afraid of us. from watching some of these movies, we shoot first. there's no need for questions afterwards. <br /><br />the whole movie is synonymous with watching some really boring science experiments, like boiling an egg or adding food color to celery. its not the fact that this is a low budget sci-fi movie or thats its a bit cheesy and outdated. it is really, really, really boring. the whole movie is about trying to figure out what is going on. that is it. most of the things we learn about what's going on are through monologues and self dictation. now add crappy dialog, cardboard acting and cheap-sets and you have the makings of an ed wood clone (by the way, ed has made some really boring movies as well - please avoid the orgy of the dead). the dialog ... oh, the dialog. jems such as :<br /><br />"..from under 2 miles of ocean ?<br /><br />why not ?! it came through a billion miles in space."<br /><br />or<br /><br />"do you think you'll be able to respect a husband who's probably pulled the scientific boner of all time ?"<br /><br />this movie is obviously trying to pull a forbidden planet, this island earth, magnetic monster or in the same light as the outer limits, twilight zone. namely, a low budget sci-fi movie (or tv episode) that is compelling enough to get past the technical difficulties and strange situations. at the core, these movies are enjoyable on some level (the story, the underlying meaning or the sheer comical nature of the dialog or situations). this movie has none of that. it is just 90 minutes of boredom. i couldn't even enjoy this on a ed wood level. i definitely recommend skipping this one and seeing one of the movies i mentioned above instead. it is so bad, that if my name was dr. forrester, i would never think of showing this movie to anyone ... except frank maybe.
