as kids movie it is great. for the family it just sucks. i was truly hoping for something like the goonies which is a great film for all ages. this movie was just geared too much to the kids with the silly script and characters calling each other little names like booger breath. ??? alan cummings was however a delight. and why do people compare willy wonka to this movie...just because there is a theme song closely resembling the willy wonka song doesnt make this film anything like willy wonka.
