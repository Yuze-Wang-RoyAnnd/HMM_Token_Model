when i first saw this show i thought to my self " what is this!!!!!?" its one of those shows where there is a perfect fake high school world with stupid problems that are considered "huge". then there's sadie. this complete misfit for her friends and well her family. shes completely obsessed with nature not that thats a bad thing but she compares high school students to animals! like what is that!? also they made her another lizzie miguire clone ( yeah because the world definitely needs another one of those!) shes also very perfect like most tv girls are which makes me sick! so please this is a stupid show it makes no sense just skip it unless you liked lizzie mcguire or any other shows like that.
