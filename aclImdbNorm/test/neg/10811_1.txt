that's how i was when i walked (staggered) out of this "film". i couldn't leave, because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people. i was stuck in the middle. trapped.<br /><br />the tiny fragment of original footage which attempted to bind this film together features some of the worst acting ever to grace the big screen. the daughter was a stand out performance - stand out in the bad sense.<br /><br />thge cinematography was hideous, consisting of disjointed framing and some of the oddest lighting i've witnessed.<br /><br />as for the stock footage... well at first one...<br /><br />wait.<br /><br />why am i reviewing this film? why do i acknowledge its existence? please, don't watch it. do something useful with two hours of your life and go watch some paint dry.
