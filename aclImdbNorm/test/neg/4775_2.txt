i was really disappointed with this movie. i had heard some great reviews about it and unfortunately missed seeing it in theaters. as a result of this, i was really excited to see it when it came to dvd. i thought that it was going to be a high-paced horror movie with a lot of scary surprises but instead it was a snail-paced predictable movie. it dragged and dragged without a climax in it and after all the difficulties that those people went through to try and escape, the ending was completely frustrating. i gave this movie two stars for one reason. this is not your typical horror movie with one central bad guy slashing a bunch of people to death. the story makes this movie unique and provides a change for people who watch a lot of horror movies. even though i don't like this movie, i recommend that all horror fans do see it at least once. you may surprisingly like it. as for this horror fan, all i can say is that i hope there isn't a sequel to this forgettable movie.
