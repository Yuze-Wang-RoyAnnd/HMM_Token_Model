i saw this movie yesterday, and like most allrdy wrote "i also expected a steven movie", god i love this guy just because his fighting style is unique and very humerous. in had a little doubts cause i read that "ja rule" was playing in it, but i thought hopefully they give him a smal role, so i don't get irritations by watching him. and offcourse the opposite happend, goooooooooooooooooooood steven what the heck were you thinking going to join a sry *** crew like this. steven was broke and needed cash? bah =( what a big dissapointment. if you like steven movie, pleaseee skip this one its pure drama, you only get a few special effects that made me vote 3/10. but the "acting?" of ja rule screws up the whole movie aswel for his buddy kurupt with his irritating hood talk.<br /><br />my beer went from tasting fresh to water we do the dishes in. the story didn't had any "good" about it. to me it felt like a 3 year old produced it.<br /><br />hopefully steven makes me happy again in a future movie. people this isn't even worth renting simpel as that.<br /><br />to bad and pitty :-)
