ever watched something so awful you just have to keep watching to be sure it really is as bad as it looks? this is one of those films. it was slammed by the critics on it's release, not least for the way it was funded. i caught it on tv last night and gave in to curiosity.<br /><br />in the event, it is what it says on the box, no more nor less: low level humour, crudity, very much in the 'carry on...' vein but with 'adult' language. indeed, it harks back to the 60s/70s uk porn industry, cheating punters by promising real sex and not delivering (spot the nipple?) that whole tawdry era is lovingly recreated here but with modern cinematography.<br /><br />it has the benefit of mackenzie crook (the office, pirates of the caribbean and much more) and also johnny vegas. the chip shop girl is genuinely sexy. beyond these unexpected positives, it does leave me wondering what happened to england. junk food, low paid work, council estates, desperate lives. as a bonus, there are some nice shots of leafy birmingham. foreigners might find it informative about british attitudes and aspirations. overall, though, i still feel disbelief that i sat through it.
