the dvd version we bought had sandra bullock on the cover, but we've discovered it was a picture of her from another movie. unfortunately, she is in this movie very little. you can, however, see how far she has come.<br /><br />the one other bright spot in the movie, besides her very small part, were a few of the location scenes, shot in nyc and new jersey in the 1980s.<br /><br />the sound is terrible. sometimes the background noise is so loud that the dialog is difficult to hear. sometimes the dialog has been redone without any background noises at all, which is disconcerting. for example, sometimes when they are in the car, the noises from the car are too loud, and then suddenly there is absolutely no extra noise at all. the director is fond of close-ups on faces, and then it's clear that the movie has been over-dubbed because the words don't match the lip movements. through most of the movie, the voices sound like the people are speaking into a tin can.<br /><br />background music, when there is music, is distracting instead of adding to the movie.<br /><br />the direction is laughable. goofy camera angles and sound effects make the movie look like a joke, especially during times when there is supposed to be tension, like in the middle of gun battles. the writing is terrible. there are some subplots that make no sense, and most of the characters come off looking very stupid because there is no explanation at all to their motivations. the writer/director tries to explain some of the relationships between the men that were together in vietnam, but none of it makes sense. these top assassins and former soldiers don't seem to be able to see other people's shadows or hear other people moving. the actors go from calm to panic and back to calm again without any warning. it's simply a combination of bad directing and bad writing.<br /><br />the production values are so bad that at first, we thought we had stumbled on someone's student film that just happened to have sandra bullock in it. if you like laughing at really poorly done student films, then this movie is for you. otherwise, avoid this movie.
