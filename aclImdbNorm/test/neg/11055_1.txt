the screaming is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video. it features passable acting, poor lighting, a weak story, and some of the worst monster effects i've ever seen. the plot has a college student being pressured to join a cult by his attractive landlord. the cult is a parody of scientology with a book similar to dianetics. this would have been a funny shot at that group were it not for a dumb script and the cheapness of the production. the monster effects look awful and the picture quality makes it feel like you're watching a home video or a public-service announcement. i think anyone who sees this will agree that movies should be shot on film.
