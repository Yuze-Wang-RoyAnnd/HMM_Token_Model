... but had to see just how bad it could get. the plotline was thin to begin with, but it just kept getting worse. a female genetic engineering grad student uses her research on accelerated mitosis to artificially create a male, because a biological weapon used in ww3 killed off 97% of the worldwide male population. the surviving men are either high prices gigolos in back alley clubs, or crazed lunatics in run down football stadiums plotting to overthrow the 'lesbian conspiracy'. the entire process resembled the microwaving of a large bowl of jello. press a few buttons and ding you get a baby. not only that, but he will age to mid 20's in a month, and then begin to age normally (how convenient). eventually poor adam gets bored with the secluded cabin in the woods where his creator had raised him and steals her car to 'see the city'.<br /><br />this begins 90 minutes of unlikely chases, convenient plot twists, and several subplots that we never see resolved. as adam quickly learns, what men did survive are treated as outcasts/criminals, because they are dangerous beasts that cannot help there genetic predisposition to violence. the propaganda machines have been in full swing, scaring women into believing all men are rapists and murderers. this has led to lesbianism being the norm, the fall of christianity, female only reproduction via cloning, and oh yeah world peace among other implied results. all of which seem unlikely given that only ~30 years had elapsed since the war. adam stumbles from one bad situation to the next, all the while being genetically programmed to be non-violent and unable to really do much on his own behalf. with the fbi on his trail, madams looking for fresh meat, and his creator trying to recapture him (for herself it seems), he learns that violence is not limited to the male species after all.<br /><br />all in all, i would not recommend this movie.<br /><br />i did however enjoy veronica cartwrights portrayal of the 'love to hate her' director of the fbi, and julie bowen didn't do bad as hope the 'closet hetero' geneticist either.
