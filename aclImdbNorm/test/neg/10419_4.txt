"yesterday" as a movie, is hard to rate. the cinematography is excellent and deserves a 9/10. the story is gritty and real and does not compromise. but the translation of the story to the screen through the actors did not match the camera work.<br /><br />as a person who was born and raised in central africa, i appreciated the authenticity of the film's look and the honest depiction of daily life for the zulu. but this and the camera work are not enough to recommend the average viewer should see this film. it takes an appreciation of true cinema and not just a love of movies to see the purpose and strength of "yesterday". <br /><br />unlike the 1980 film "the gods must be crazy", which was a comic look at one african culture encountering modern technology, "yesterday" has no intention of appealing to any crossover audience. the movie simply is not fit for the common western mind - and i doubt it was intended for the western mind. the scenes are long and slow, the editing is not paced for a 60mph+ instant gratification world. the dialog is not cleaver or witty, it is real. movies about health crises do not make the best entertainment and this movie is not entertainment, it is education.<br /><br />this movie is best viewed by those who know, appreciate and love the way of life and the culture in sub-sarah africa. if you lack a broad enough world-view to understand other cultures, especially african cultures, should skip this film. do not waste you time with it. go see "talladega nights" or "larry the cable guy" instead for your cross culture viewing.<br /><br />i give it a 4 for most who might want to see the movie but have no accurate understanding of african cultures. for the viewers with an appreciation for films about the human experience anywhere in the world, i would give it a 7.
