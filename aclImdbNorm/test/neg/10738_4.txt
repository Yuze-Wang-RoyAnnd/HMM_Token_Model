okay, it features one lovely blink-and-you-miss-it-joke (when the dead are rising from their tombs, the names of the old time "horror" directors like jacques tournier and jean yarborough are featured in the tombstones) and the smashing of morally bankrupt repu/con/rightist villains is on-target: whorish skanks preaching morals etc. but why these soldiers are anti-republicans? because they have gone to the war, most of them should be republicans, right? why they don't go to killing the enemies who killed them or something? why they all want to vote against the republicans? why this story has made of a movie? questions never answered...
