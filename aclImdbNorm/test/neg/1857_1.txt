when i say worse, i mean less entertaining. todd sheets seems to have learned some stupid camera tricks since the last zombie bloodbath, which makes the movie even less tolerable. in the last movie there were no special camera effects, where in this one, we are treated to shaky cam, and constant switching to black and white. also, this is called zombie bloodbath, despite the fact that the zombies are barely in this one. the movie starts in 1945, where some satanists kill a violent burglar and put him up as a scarecrow. back in modern time, some kids have a car problem and go to a house, the same house in which the satanist murder happened. some mean people try to rape the kids (or something), and they bring the scarecrow burglar back to life, who comes back with some zombies and now talks like darth vader. mr. sheets amped up the language and lessened the violence. if you want to see what a bad movie is, check this out! <br /><br />my rating: bomb/****. 96 mins. not rated, contains violence and language.
