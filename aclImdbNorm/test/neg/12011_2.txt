"problem child" was an okay movie, but did it really merit a sequel? i don't think it did. the original movie's only redeeming asset was gilbert gottfried, and he wasn't even good in this sequel.<br /><br />i can't really put my finger on why this movie was bad. for starters, it just wasn't funny. even when i saw this as a nine-year-old, i didn't sympathize with junior (michael oliver) at all. his character came off to me as whiny, self-loathing, and perhaps most importantly, a rebel without a clue. he appeared to hate every woman that his father ben (john ritter) dated for the sole sake of hating them. it also doesn't send a good message to kids with divorced parents (who constitute over half children in the u.s. these days) when the one woman ben decides to (almost) marry is a southern aristocrat who is vindictive and who happens to hate children as it is.<br /><br />and as cool as i thought it would have been to see original snl cast mate laraine newman come back to the big screen, she couldn't even save this movie. i also found it strange that she was a white southern d'ebutante whose name was lawanda. that sounds more like an african-american woman's name. but of course, that has nothing to do with why i disliked this movie.<br /><br />i think the movie didn't work because you had antagonists you were supposed to hate, along with protagonists you weren't supposed to hate. john ritter's character was supposed to be a good parent who tried desperately to teach his child right from wrong without conforming to authoritative parenting. instead, he came off not only as a wimpy parent, but also one who was desperate to find a wife in a matter of days, regardless of how well he knew the woman. did i mention this sends a bad message to children of divorced parents?<br /><br />in a nutshell, the rest of the things that went wrong with this movie included amy yasbeck unnecessary and unexplained return to play an entirely different character, that young girl who was even more obnoxious than junior, completely uncalled for toilet humor, and even more outrageous and outdated homophobic humor (involving the dog catchers). the movie was just a mess, and really doesn't deserve a dvd release if it hasn't been given one already. it should just rot on vhs along with all the other bad, forgettable 90's comedies.
