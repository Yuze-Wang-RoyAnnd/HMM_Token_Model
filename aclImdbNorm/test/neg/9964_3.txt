a paranoid scientist creates a wolfman by transfusing wolf blood into a meek, quiet, but very large gardener, in order to prove an hypothesis. so the gardener begins nightly rampages and the scientist tries to use him to reclaim his credentials, but is rebuffed by his former colleagues for tampering with nature. island of dr moreau, frankenstein and various wolfman films all blended together into a terribly dated, goofy, morality play.<br /><br />though the subject matter is pedantic and unoriginal at best, this film is not too poorly made, and interesting to watch as a representative of horror film making of its time. like most mad scientist films, this is a weak warning against fooling around with mother nature. it doesn't have the power or intellectual challenges of frankenstein, but it doesn't ever extend its reach anyway. the acting is passable, as is the cinematography, and the film moves along at an entertaining clip. some of the dialog is utterly ludicrous, but hey... it's just a movie - and a b minus one at that. there are also a few nice shots of a wolf, and a smattering of humor tossed-in to prevent the film from appearing to take itself too seriously - always a plus for this genre.
