not having any idea what this film was about, but based on the fact that john leguizamo was appearing in it, we decided to watch it. well, it turned out not to be the wisest decision. in fact, as another commentary in this forum puts it, we felt embarrassed for the actors that participated in this movie.<br /><br />while the film is by no means horrible, it doesn't make sense at all. the over the top performance by william baldwin doesn't help the situation either. john leguizamo is a multi-talented actor who deserved better. the basic problem it seems to be the film was a project that started with good intentions in making a little comedy and the people in charge ran out of ideas along the way. the result is an uneven film.
