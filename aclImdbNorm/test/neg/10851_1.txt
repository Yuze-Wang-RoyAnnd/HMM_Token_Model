publicity for this film suggests that it is shocking and sensational. well, we opera lovers see some strange sights in opera houses so we are not shocked by the duke of mantua urinating during his reprise of la donna `e mobile, nor is it sensational to see gilda sing caro nome in the bath. it is just crass and boring. what stands out about this film is its lack of imagination. director corina van eijk sets the duke's palace in a seedy swimming pool. in fact, he is not the duke, he is just a character named duka, so it's difficult to see why he has lots of hangers-on and his own jester, rigoletto. rigoletto lives in a council flat that is furnished with the orange sofa and decorated in the spotted wallpaper that is de rigeur among avant-garde directors.the duke's, sorry duka's heavies ride around on motor scooters (yawn). <br /><br />concepts imposed on an opera like this can produce unexpected, and unintentional humour. what can we make of the fact that gilda has a maid, even though she lives in a council flat.? when the call goes out that monterone is being taken to prison we see him being marched out of the swimming pool by two attendants in pink shorts. one imagines that he is going to be charged with urinating in a public swimming pool.<br /><br />it was common for opera films to be lip-synced 20 years ago but there is just no excuse for it today. a dubbed opera is like soft porn. you don't believe in what is happening because the performers are not making enough effort. the actress in gilda's role does not seem to have learned her lines properly. she barely moves her lips when she is supposed to be singing. when she sings caro nome in the bath she lies back with her legs slightly parted. it is difficult to tell which orifice the sound is supposed to be emanating from. the duke, later caps this by singing while engaging in cunnilingus with maddalena, giving a new meaning to the phrase yodelling in the canyon.<br /><br />the ambiance of the sound never seems right with the orchestra sometimes sounding as though it is being played through a transistor radio. fairly slow, rumpity-tumpity tempi are preferred so that the overall effect is of a karaoke in your local pub.<br /><br />this is a film of a production by opera spanga. spanga is a village in friesland in the netherlands. they normally perform in a tent in a field. if i had been watching this performance in a tent in a field in friesland i would have been fairly indulgent. by filming this production and giving it a worldwide audience, the villagers also hold themselves open to worldwide ridicule.
