not well done at all, the whole movie was just the grudge going around and killing random people out of nowhere. random people that have nothing to do with the story get killed, like the 3 school girls for example.<br /><br />the family at the beginning has nothing to do with the story either, i believe them to be a random family that never went in the house, and never had anything to do with the killings of the grudge.<br /><br />did not impress me at all, i was not scared, i didn't jump at any parts, and the whole movie was just a random piece of crap to get more money off of. makes the gridge 1 look like crap also, which was actually an alright movie.<br /><br />i believe that the grudge 2 is like a leading movie to the grudge 3, if they ever make one. they shouldn't have even called this the grudge 2, they should of called it the prologue to the grudge 2, and you will see if you watched it, because i am not going to spoil anything. not that it would have mattered anyway.<br /><br />1/10, not scary, bad story, and is just completely random.
