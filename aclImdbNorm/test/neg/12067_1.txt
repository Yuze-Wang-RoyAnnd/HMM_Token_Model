the cover case and the premise that write there is so promising. as slasher maniac i expect much from this. but, what the heck is going on. the movie is awful. the direction, the plot, the suspense and the act of the casts is so amateurish. i even thought that they are using a home video camera to shot it. lucky that it still manage to deliver some good moments to me that make me have to like it. thanks for the bad package of so-called "camp blood".<br /><br />1/10
