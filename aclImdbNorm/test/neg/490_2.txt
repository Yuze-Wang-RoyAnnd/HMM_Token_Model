first of all, the genre of this movie isn't comedy, it's more of a drama.<br /><br />i had low expectations on the movie, and still they didn't come up them. as some of the other reviews point out, there are some nice music in the movie. but if you want to listen to good music i suggest spend the time looking at some concert recording with bon jovi, or m"otley crue, it'll be more quality time.<br /><br />last, if you want to watch a good movie in this rock'n'roll genre, i recommend "almost famous".
