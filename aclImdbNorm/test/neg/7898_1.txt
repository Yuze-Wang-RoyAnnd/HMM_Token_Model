hmph. soul plane supposed to be a "black comedy" spoof of a much well known movie, airplane. this movie, is black comedy done at it's worst. stereotypes can be funny, and a lot of times they are. but in this picture, it's disgusting. okay, you have clubs, sex, drugs, everything crude that people associate with "urban" culture today.<br /><br />tom arnold's appearance in this movie, is this movie's saving grace if it ever had any. dl hughley should have never accepted the script. kevin hart makes a poor leading figure here... his appearance in this movie will probably grow annoying to many. method man and snoop's appearance were by far, their worst.<br /><br />i am just happy that i didn't pay to see this movie...
