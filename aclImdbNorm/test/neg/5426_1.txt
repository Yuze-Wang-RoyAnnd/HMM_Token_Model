oh my god, this is so idiotic. completely pointless, offensive, and repulsive. why do the writers have such a problem with actually getting zoey and chase together we all want them too! in normal shows, there's actually more than one plot conflict in the show, wow, what a concept. also, you cant even tell the zoey 101 episodes apart from each other because the same thing happens every time. quinn exploits dustin for some weird thing, nicole is giggly and stupid, zoey is just kinda there, chase slobbers after her all the time but she amazingly fails to notice, and logan is a jerk. repeat. quinn exploits dustin for some weird thing, nicole is giggly and stupid, zoey is just kinda there, chase slobbers after her all the time but she amazingly fails to notice, and logan is a jerk. repeat. it's like a shampoo bottle. and the end of the movie, omg again. so pointless nothing happens. it's like they specifically designed it so that the movie could fit between any two episodes of the show and the show would go completely unchanged after the movie plot.
