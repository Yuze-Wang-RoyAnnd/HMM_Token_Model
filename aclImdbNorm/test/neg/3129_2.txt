scenarist frederick fox's sometimes memorable dialogue and a study cast of old-pros cannot save this lukewarm western about whites pinned down in the desert by a band of bloodthirsty cheyenne indians. other than his occasionally catchy dialogue, you won't find any surprises in fox's screenplay about this run-in between whites and indians. the characters in "dakota incident" generate only minor interest, certainly not enough to make them stand-out as much as some of fox's choice dialogue. unfortunately, good dialogue is fox's only contribution because this conventional little sagebrusher withers with a lackluster ending that contradicts its previous 80 minutes. the ending is as contrived as they come and lacks credibility. most of the characters are sympathetic, but some just plain lack common sense.<br /><br />dale robertson is appropriately tough and leathery as outlaw john banner, one of three bank robbers who has to shoot it out with his low-down, no-account partners. veteran western character actor john doucette (rick largo) fares the best of the badmen, while skip homeier, wasted in an inconsequential role as banner's brother frank banner, later dies from an indian arrow. doucette tries to gun down banner at the outset of in the action, but our left-handed gun-toting hero fakes his own death, tracks down largo down later and slaps leather with him in a town called christian flats. naturally, largo bites the dust this time, but banner makes an interesting discovery. one of the passengers on a stagecoach from christian flats to laramie turns out to be none other than the bank teller from whom he stole the money. not only is john carter (john lund) on a quest himself to find banner, but also he wants to clear his own good name with the bank that has issued wanted posters for his arrest. evidently, the authorities have mistaken and enlarged carter's role in the robbery. carter is prepared to take banner to laramie and turn him over to the law, but banner has other ideas about laramie. banner's ideas change when he crosses paths with amy clarke (former twentieth century fox beauty linda darnell) who wears a bright red dress and still packs quite a bosom. as everybody else here has mentioned in their reviews, republic studio's truecolor brings out the red in everything, from darnell's fetching outfit to the blood spilled on the ground. the problem with director lewis foster's handling of this run-of-the-mill oater is that everything bogs down after the stagecoach loses a wheel and our heroes hole up in a dry wash to defend themselves against the cheyenne. the good guys and the cheyenne eventually run out of ammunition, but "dakota incident" never runs out of clich'es. ward bond has several interesting moments as a politically correct politician who defends the way of the redskin. by the time that this 88 minute dust-raiser concludes, you'll feel like you've been trapped in a gulch and menaced by marauding cheyenne yourself.
