the salena incident is by far the director, dustin rikert's, best film --- which isn't saying much. in his past films (and i use the term "films" loosely), the director takes ideas from hollywood blockbusters and severely marginalizes them. the salena incident is no different. the movie is basically con air meets aliens done with the semblance of your average film school production. the film is riddled with out-of-focus shots and plagued by special effects that would have trouble rivaling most high school computer animation classes. for example almost every on-screen explosion is the same fire effect matted over the screen.<br /><br />the weak effects and production value are only compromised by a flawed plot and rocky dialogue. in a sentence, the story strings together like an exposition of overused hollywood clich'es. the movie begins with the worst cgi alien ship ever made crashing into the worst cgi earth ever made and a team of army somethings going down to investigate. next a bus of prison transports, carrying the worst of the worst from across the state, is overthrown by the prisoners with the help of their blonde girlfriends armed with silicon implants. the prisoners escape and run into the town of salena where they encounter the aliens who... shock... have escaped from an alien prison transport carrying the worst of the worst from across the galaxy. the prisoners, and their captive police armed with only guns and sad puns have to fight off the aliens and escape the town before the international space alliance *rolls eyes* bombs the city into oblivion.<br /><br />the only real enjoyable parts of the movie are when the actors (who are clearly undermined by the script) are given the freedom to improvise and also when they fight off the smaller of the alien creatures in a flurry of gun fire. other than that, the movie really isn't worth anyone's time let alone the plastic that the dvd is made out of. how awful was it? let's just say the secretary of defense is about 90 years old, works in a room that is about as high tech 1950's real estate office and is wearing a looney tunes tie. yes, if that wasn't clear enough before, the man in charge of the pentagon is wearing a tie with bugs bunny and the road runner on it. the movie basically culminates (hahahahhaaa did i say culminates...) with the last remaining soldier running into the group of prisoners and guards and the new formed team fighting their way away from the vicious aliens --- which for some strange reason leads them straight back to the alien ship? yeah...<br /><br />the movie has heart but is riddled with horrible direction and even worse camera work. someone seriously needed to slap the dp and tell him there is more to cinematography than repetitive, stagnant, chest-level shots. this movie really isn't worth renting (if it ever makes it that far) being that it's not as horribly bad as the last films made by the director which reduces the laugh-ability, but it's nowhere near watchable cinema.
