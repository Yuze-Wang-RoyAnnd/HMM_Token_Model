there are good-bad movies and bad-bad-movies and enjoyably bad movies...this isn't one of them. this is a movie that doesn't realize just how bad it is.<br /><br />i saw this at a screening on november 14, 2006 at the new beverly theater in los angeles as part of the "grindhouse cinema" this theater puts on every month. hopefully presenters eric caiden & co. will think twice before letting writer/director lawrenece foldes anywhere near them again. what a con man. the guy got up to speak before the film -- you would think he was orson welles talking about "touch of evil" or some other lost classic. hardly. nice of him to take up 20 minutes of the audiences' time with his incoherent rambling. <br /><br />"young warriors" has been described as a cross between "animal house" and "death wish" but if you are expecting something along the lines of imitations like "revenge of the nerds" or "the exterminator" you will be in for one sad disappointment. the script makes zero sense. the direction is so poor the actors looked embarrassed and what can you say when the best thing about the movie is watching a car blow up?<br /><br />poor richard "shaft" roundtree. in this movie he plays another character with the first name of "john" but that's about the only similarity his character here has to the aforementioned classic. i hope this film allowed him to pay the rent for another month. other actors who look like they wished they could be anywhere else included ernest borgnine and linda day george. <br /><br />this is a complete waste of time. even the audience did not seem that into it (except for the one spazz-boy sitting in the back who yelled "whoa" every five minutes and his girlfriend who giggled with the fervor of a lobotomized talking barbie every time he opened his mouth).<br /><br />for real films about vigilantes, i would suggest the following:<br /><br />death wish i, ii, iii, exterminator i, vigilante force, ms. 45, rolling thunder, the no-mercy man (the latter two being a pair of films presented at this theater a couple of years ago -- probably the same budget as "young warriors" but both were a million times better!)
