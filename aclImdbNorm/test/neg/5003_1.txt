this movie was terrible. it was so very terrible.<br /><br />most annoying was the way the trial was conducted. the defense attorney is allowed to ramble on and on when questioning a witness without the prosecution making any objections. he attacks the children brought to give testimony with cruel ferociousness and repeatedly yells at them that they're lying. these just aren't things that they subject children who have been sexually abused to. the trial is silly and it ruins the whole movie...(law & order has spoiled me for courtroom accuracy-ness).
