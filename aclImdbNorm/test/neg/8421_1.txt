one of the worse gay-related movies i have ever seen. since these are not characters in this story it's hard to comment on the actual film. therefore, since colton ford (aka glen) laid his life open for all to see, i guess he's fair game to criticize. and that's not hard to do. here goes. 50 something glen is a big time porn star who wants fame and fortune as a big time singer. (i guess 11 films makes him a "star") being gay and forty, i have seen porno and i did not recognize him or his lover. personally they all look the same to me with different hair styles. face it, guys, he's no jeff stryker, jim bently or casey donovon. that's ok, though. the purpose of these films takes place in about 6.5 minutes, so they all pretty much have the same requirements, if you know what i mean.<br /><br />so glen wants to be a serious (legit) singer after he dumps the porno industry but he can't get anyone to take him seriously. i wonder why? was he so stupid to think that he could whitewash taking his clothes off and having sex on film. and according to the film it's not just porn flicks he indulges in, it's living in a house with other "stars" where people can hook into their bedroom, the bathroom and where ever via webcams . it's 500 dollars an hour to entertain at a private party. strip gigs at clothing optional "hotels". doing something called meth which i presume is a drug. and then you have the balls to get angry when someone at a club gig tries to touch you ---- because he's "legit" now. oy!<br /><br />the only interesting, non-cardboard character is the academy award winning gay screen writer who wouldn't give his name. and considering this is a documentary, well, porn is as porn does. you can tell he's most amused by the dumb-bunny porn star.<br /><br />glen has one hyper-nellie manager (kyle) who wants to "sell' him as a porno-participant in hopes of getting him gay-club gigs. he tries to do the svengalli-routine. "wear this" "don't smile" "say this" in what amounts to controlling issues. but our anti-hero will not be controlled or told what to do. that's the first mistake. i'm not saying kyle was right but if any budding singer starts questioning the manager, they're not going to get far. kind of like: he who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client.<br /><br />all of this wouldn't have been bad if it weren't for one small tiny bit of information. drum roll, please. he's bad. he sucks. his singing talent ranks up there with ashlee simpson. it's hard to root for someone who -- while trying make his dream come true --- at 50! --- doesn't work like normal people. no job. can you say lazy-ass? and the whining, and the "why don't they accept me." song and dance. and after a few months of scraping the surface of the music industry, he spouts off, "why don't i have a record deal by now." what? actors are waiters. writers work in low-level newspapers or mags -- whatever. this guy is above that. it's true. he wants his success now merely because he decided he wanted it. whine. whine whine. his lover leaves him to return to nursing but i tell ya i wouldn't want that moron dispensing medical care to me. both of them were useless. airheads. the movie is useless. unless you really like whine and cheeesy people stay away. do not waste your money on the crappy lives of useless people, there are far more interesting things stuck to the bottom of your shoe.
