as a writing teacher, there are two ending i never allow my students to use: "then i woke up" and "then i got run over by a truck." i am now going to add, "then i got a bump on the head." i feel it's utterly unfair to use these tricks to cover up a lack of imagination. the whole issue of transmigration could have been handled with some intelligence and craft, yet, in this film, they either couldn't or wouldn't do that. i'm not saying it's totally worthless, but it is so predictable in its progress, except for the stupid ending. there are even gangsters who go to the police to get help from this guy. they should have done him in immediately. it's just a forgettable, borderline horror/sci fi film, with nothing new to offer.
