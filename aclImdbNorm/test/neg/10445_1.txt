a really awful movie about a 30 meters long shark. bad story bad discussions bad characters bad plot even a confusing ending a complete. a waist of time in my point of view i thought it was a tv movie, but then i saw it was not i cant imagine having paid to see this load of crap please avoid this movie at any cost. even if u liked jaws, which i averagely did, don't see it even if you have interests in paleontology, don't see it even if you like corny movies with corny actors, corny plots during corny tv time, do humanity a favor and do not, i repeat, do not pollute your mind with this ridiculous excuse for a sci-fi animal thriller still, some people gave it a ten ranting... don't know if they were serious or not (but sincerely expect they weren't)
