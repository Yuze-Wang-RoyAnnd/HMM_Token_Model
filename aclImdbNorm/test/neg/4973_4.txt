now that's it's 2008, who really has a care in the world about a guy like db sweeney, even back then he wasn't a big deal.<br /><br />two tickets to paradise is an outlined story that's well and true where three friends hit the road under each of their personal circumstances. again, a proved plot. the problem with this film, other than it's 'so bad it's compelling' title, is the script.<br /><br />clich'e after clich'e three guys do the same things you've seen in every other road movie... and blow up vanna white's house.<br /><br />john c. mcginley's acting job is superb, especially compared to that of the late db sweeney's. (his career is dead, hence the late. though i hear he's moving to tv, good for him). also, john c likely has the least awful character in the film.<br /><br />the score is so generic it actually feels like you're watching a third rate film from 1993, or jeff anderson's movie now you know (also set me back a few years, but at least that was more entertaining.) i mean, yah, i guess i enjoyed parts of it. but, the nerdy guy is annoying, db tries to be this cool failed guitar player (with some rough influences, like some of the worst of classic rock) who has some strange relationship with a stripper, and john c is a gambler who's wife and kid leave him after the death of his father as well as a visit from one of his bookie's henchmen.<br /><br />i keep thinking up ways to make this movie better. but i think burning the script would have been a healthy start.<br /><br />but, as i've hinted this whole time, it's not the worst movie ever. and any chance i have to see mcginley in a starring role, i'll take it. hopefully he starts getting some better projects.
