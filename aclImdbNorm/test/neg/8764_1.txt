i watched the first show of each series just to see and what a waste of time. the girl from emmerdale she was fat so yeah she should be in fat friend but no one every lost weigh.<br /><br />like itv made a big mistake with this.<br /><br />bad girls is 100times better.<br /><br />i feel that the whole show was just about large people trying to loose weight but never did then they tried to have love storyline oh my god what a a waste of time and also air time. this show has not been repeated on itv2/3/4 yeah thats how good it is.<br /><br />i would say do not by th box sets just a waste of money.<br /><br />beware
