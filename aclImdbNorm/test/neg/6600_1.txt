i am speechless, honestly i cannot understand how anyone could have conceded to a script like this, cast anyone in the film let alone direct it. the fact that i am writing this review feels like an insult to my fingers, this film should be thrown in to the dustbin rather than be reviewed. i am disappointed in flex alexander for even thinking about accepting such a poor excuse for a script let alone essay the role. omg! i think i just insulted the word "essay"...uh yeah i did. y'know what, the less said about this mindless drivel, the better. you have been warned, nobody warned me i had to experience the horror myself. watch at your own risk.
