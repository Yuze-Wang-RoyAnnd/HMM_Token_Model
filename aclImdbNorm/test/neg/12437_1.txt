i recently had to watch this for a project in a sociology class and thought it was absolutely the worst movie i have ever had to sit through. it was like bad a bad cinemax movie with all the "good bits" taken out. bad acting, the fake documentary set up, nonsensical plot, and rudderless direction all combine to make a terrible, terrible film.<br /><br />the female characters are basically only there to be sex objects. consider this exchange: "he's hot." "he has a girlfriend." "do you have a girlfriend?" "no." *girl takes boys hand and leads him behind some bushes. boy comes out and sits next to other boy, girl saunters off* "did you hit that?" "no, i didn't want to take my pants off." "you're stupid." another girl shows up when the boys are going to beverly hills, gets in the trunk with one of the boys, and when they get pulled over by a cop, you see the car bobbing up and down.<br /><br />a homosexual pervert, a trigger-happy clint eastwood look alike, and what seems to be a luchador mask all add to the inanity. one of the boys gets caught by a cop, no one cares. one of the boys gets shot, no one cares.<br /><br />someone said the dialogue was mostly improvised, and it shows. just awful. i would never recommend this film to anyone.
