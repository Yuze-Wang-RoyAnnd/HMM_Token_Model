well well, at last a view of this underrated flick. but you can't find a good copy of it, terrible copy full with green drops, the editing isn't syncronized, the sound do has sometimes that terrible hiss and sometimes you even can hear the camera recording. overall it's too dark, a waist of time you should say but it isn't. it's a bit slow, the first half part of the movie it's all talking and making love to each other. it is even still weird that the girls in movies from the 60's never wear any bra's. when they enter the sleeping room it's full glory. anyway, banned in the uk since 84 and still on the video nasties list. the reason is simple, it's gory for their time being. it really has some nasty dismemberement's and it's creepy in some way due the fact that it is filmed handycam way. so every shot the image is moving, things they do these days with the steadycam. the ghastly ones could have been better if the quality of the film was better but still better then other films of the time like schoolgirls in chains.
