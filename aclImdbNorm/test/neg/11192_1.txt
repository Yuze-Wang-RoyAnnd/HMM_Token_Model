if you'd like a great april fool's joke, then please by all means show this film to someone. however, it is important that you in no way criticize the film but instead talk about what an artistic triumph it is and how "they just don't make great films like this any more". as your victim watches many disconnected and nonsensical scenes (such as a cute dog getting punted for no apparent reason, a cow standing on the bed, a woman licking a statue's feet or jesus apparently raping a woman), make lots of comments using words like "brilliance", "juxtaposed" or "transcendent"--all the while acting as if the film actually makes perfect sense and isn't a complete waste of an hour of your life. also be sure to keep a straight face and feign shock when (and if) they say that they either didn't understand it or thought it had all the artistry of a cow patty. then, to further mess with them, show them all the comments on imdb, as nearly all (except for a few trouble-makers like almagz and rooprect) talk glowingly about what genius and artistry this film is! by the time you are done with this little charade, they'll most likely think they are idiots and will make an appointment with a psychologist. <br /><br />this, to me, is the only possible reason to watch this horrid mess of a film!!! that, or you could show it to the prisoners at guantanamo in order to get them to talk!<br /><br />if you ask me, the famous painting of dogs playing poker or a velvet elvis painting are superior artistically.
