a made for television version of the heart of darkness seemed like a good way to add more insight to the book, well, that was the wrong assumption. the movie made it even worse. i was highly disappointed about almost everything in the movie. i hoped that the movie would possibly help put the pieces of the book together that i didn't comprehend, but it did no such thing. it still left me confused and hanging. it is one of those movies that makes one feel like it would be more fun to watch the grass grow instead of watching the movie. not exactly anyone's cup of tea. it was an overall dreadful, boring, and slow movie.<br /><br />to begin with, nicolas roeg must have been pretty desperate when he decided that he wanted to undertake the task of making the already boring book into a movie. it's a guaranteed loss. it's like going into a knife fight, but forgetting the knife on the kitchen counter. the knifeless person is going to lose; and in the case, the knifeless person was roeg. all i've heard about the movie are bad things, and the movie deserves those bad things to be said about it. from watching the movie, i got the impression that the people who made the movie, just skimmed over the book to get the key points.<br /><br />furthermore, although the movie did follow the main story line of the book, it left out quite a few details, and it also changed the ending. i am not a fan of that. roeg left out when marlow and his crew came across the russian sailor's camp, and at that camp they found the book. also it didn't show when at the camp they came across the sign that says, "wood for you. hurry up. approach cautiously" (conrad 110). also, at the end of the book kurtz dies on the boat, not at the inner station.<br /><br />on the contrary, nicolas roeg did one good thing while he was making his movie; he managed to hire some pretty decent actors to play in the movie. for instance, he acquired tim roth and john malkovich, both of whom would later go on to have successful careers. in doing so, he added a little something to the horrible movie. also, though i am ripping his book to shreds, i do have some respect for him, because it takes a lot of courage to try to take on the heart of darkness. it isn't exactly the easiest novel to portray into a film. twus a valiant effort, though! in conclusion, if for whatever reason someone actually wants to watch this movie, i suggest the reading of heart of darkness first. this way, you'll get all of the scenes that were left out of the movie and you won't be completely lost when you watch it. but i really suggest you don't read the book and that you really don't watch the movie; both will be a complete waste of your time. trust me. i was forced to do both by my english teacher, and now i wish that the book and the movie didn't exist. if either the book or the movie are pursued, good luck!
