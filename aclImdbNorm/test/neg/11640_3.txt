our story: two u.s. navy deep sea divers search for silver coins hidden beneath the ocean off the filipino coast. our proof: extremely dull entertainment at its best, with no plot in sight. jim brown is completely wasted, provided his help in producing this 70s war turkey. richard jaeckel is in his usual form. don cornelius and richard pryor are among those who gave special thanks in their contributions! bombs away!!!
