this film is terrible - honestly. the acting is terrible, the script made me cringe, the effects are completely lousy (which i usually don't mind for older films, but this was made just two years ago), and everything about it just annoys me. a few friends go out on halloween into the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son. of course, before that it has the clich'e "you really believe that? ha ha ha, it's just a story" routine dragged out for a while. the witch's cannibal son was made a retard (i don't know if it was for comedy or to make it creepy, but this film failed at both). it has minimal gore and no nudity, which made a bad film even worse. heck, the only good thing about this film is the leg eating scene, and even that could of been better.<br /><br />honestly, don't even waste your time watching it on cable, and certainly don't consider buying or renting this, else you'll be kicking yourself for wasting time which could of been spent doing something more constructive or entertaining.
