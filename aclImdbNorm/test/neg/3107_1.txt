do not rent this movie. i ended up buying the "previously viewed" tape of this for $4.00. that was close to the price of a rental, so thought, i might as well buy it. i'm tossing it out after i finish this review. the movie which stars lowe, is a music video with few lines of dialogue, slow moving shots and poorly done editing. i thought i'd be seeing a mindless action flick, which is what i wanted to see, i didn't even get that. this movie is an exercise in slow moving shots, no script, close-ups, terrible edited, and a poorly developed plot. i can't believe that is actually ends with a scene in which they think the audience cares about the characters. by the end of the movie, we still don't even really know who they are. believe the hype, stay away.
