i rented dark harvest (the first one) because it looked like a cheesy monster-on -the-box type of thrill ride. scarecrows also freak me out. the movie had an effective title sequence, but what followed was pretty lame (flat, bad lighting, acting, editing, direction...). recently, i noticed that dh 2: the maize had a pretty extensive ad campaign. i thought maybe the first one was marginally successful, so they upped the ante on this one a bit, possibly delivering some bigger budget scares and fx from the killer scarecrows. well, there are no scarecrows in the video... not a problem. the problems start in dh 2 with a title sequence that looks like an unfinished concept, with strange shapes and bars wiping away titles and whatnot. as far as the actual photography... every time the sun shines in a shot, you'd have all these blown out whites, confirming that you're watching some ultra-low budget mini-dv project that some midwesterner filmed at his uncles farm. the acting was not acting at all. the cheap rip-off of the shining twin girls was below freshman film student standards. the editing was extremely amateur and lazy. the sound was jarring and choppy. (e.g.- every time the editor would cut to a new shot, you'd here the sound change perspective with it). it's as if someone gathered their friends and family (actors), took a video camera out in a cornfield for three days, put a light on top of it for the night sequences (no joke - that's what they actually did), burned through some tape, stuck the footage in their computer, cut a (very) rough version, tossed in some music, bypassed any imaginative sound work or mixing, burned it directly to dvd, and threw it on the video store shelf. any horror fan should be insulted by this type of direct to video work that is void of any skill or style. just because a person owns a video camera and is able to get somewhat of an image on tape, doesn't mean it should be released to the public. if i could give this a rating lower than a one, i would.
