problems: 1) although billed as "a loving tribute to poverty row," a lot of the old footage is not even from poverty row films-- much of it is from rko's "the most dangerous game," (1932), with some from the silent (!?) version of "the lost world" (1926)! <br /><br />2) much of the old footage is just used as filler (the old shipboard footage) or as silent shots (for example, of bela walking, looking or staring) often repeated; <br /><br />3) where is the pantheon of poverty row master thespians (bela, boris, lon chaney, jr., george zucco, john carradine, buster crabbe, tom neal, etc.) emoting their lines as punch lines to the 'new' characters jokes (as in woody allen's "what's up tiger lily?" or steve martin's "dead men don't wear plaid")? even mike nelson's feeble commentary on the colorized "reefer madness" is funnier than this. <br /><br />high point: the long but extremely enlightening lecture by gregory mank which makes you give new respect to and admiration for bela, john carradine and george zucco. that's worth the price of the dvd alone!
