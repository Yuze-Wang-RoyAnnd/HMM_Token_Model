this is by far the most awful movie i have ever watched. i have never before rated a movie 1 out of 10. my advice is don't watch it. this doesn't even classify as a movie.<br /><br />you'd be better off sitting on the couch bored rather than watching this movie. acting was terrible but what was worst by far was the storyline. highly unlikely sequence of events which aren't even funny. they are actually very lame and stupid. very foolish choice by ashton kutcher and tara reid to act in this movie. might even upset their careers a little.<br /><br />when i walked into blockbuster, the main focus was on this movie , so i decided rent it. i sincerely regret it.<br /><br />once you're 10 or 20 minutes into the movie you could basically predict what was going to happen. i was hoping it would get better , but instead it got worse.<br /><br />i am not exaggerating this. the movie is terrible. don't watch it. hope this helps.
