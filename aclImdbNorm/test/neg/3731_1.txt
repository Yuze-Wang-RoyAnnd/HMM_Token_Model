feeling minnesota is one of the worst films i have ever seen, it is also one of the most disgusting films ever made. it has to do with a woman who is forced to marry a disgusting mob man. at the wedding she meets his brother jjaks. they have sex in the house after they eat the cake than decide to run away together. the other brother of course comes after him guns blazing and he kills his wife. jjaks wakes up to find her corpse in the bathtub and buries her. he than seems to become friends with jjaks and they try to get money together because someone is blackmailing them because he saw them and the body. this loops about and several characters dies or come back to life, but it never comes together with anything that could be called a good plot. the performances are horrible by pretty much everybody. cameron diaz, keanu reeves, and dan akroyed. the direction, dialogue, and visual effects are just horrible. a disgusting and horrible movie.
