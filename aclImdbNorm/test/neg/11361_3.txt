i don't understand why some of you (or many) have given this film upward of 8 stars out of 10. do you understand that there are lower ratings for a reason? sure, this may be a zombie flick with some splatter, but thats it. i'm not a hater on zombie films, but this was awful. really, actually, i should call it more like a zombie-soap, because thats how the acting is. production is... well, okay. barely an attempt at plot development, awful acting, silly effects, clich'es, and an abrupt ending. go ahead and like zombie movies, but don't ever give this above a 5.0. honestly though, the only reason you should want to watch this movie is to laugh. seriously.
