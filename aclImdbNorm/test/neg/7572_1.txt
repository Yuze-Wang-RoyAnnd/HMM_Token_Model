and abysmal, over-the-top acting, you might enjoy this rubbish flick.apparently atomic bombs makes life mutate in about a day or two (or according to other viewers, wake them up). or so it seems. and apparently massive atomic explosions off the coast of spain doesn't make anyone ask any questions at all. coming to think of it, the plot doesn't make sense in any way whatsoever (why would evil sock puppets attack lighthouses?), so the nukes going off for no reason at all doesn't stand out too much.<br /><br />ok, getting past this, and the fact that the "monster" is a glorified thing you make of socks in kindergarten, you may actually be able to stand this. but for once the complete lack of gore doesn't help, leaving the monster attacks in all their naked rock-bottom-budget "glory".<br /><br />i doubt you'll be able to watch this though, so better stay well away.
