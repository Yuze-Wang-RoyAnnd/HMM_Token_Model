i love the book. it's full of passion, romance, tension... and the movie drags along taking two spunky stars with it. kylie minogue was already a major star in australia, having starred in neighbours and releasing her first single. the decision to cast her in the delinquents was surely a marketing ploy. for me, it didn't pay off.<br /><br />kylie may have been great in neighbours, but she was far too sweet and innocent to play the feisty lola... and, she wasn't of asian descent as lola was. charlie schlatter was an excellent brownie, but there was no chemistry between him and kylie.<br /><br />by and large, the movie was boring. it dragged on, it lacked the passion of the book, it focused heavily on kylie and in general, was completely disappointing.
