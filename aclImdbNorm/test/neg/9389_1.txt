this is the worst movie that i have ever seen. at first i thought that it was going to be good because i'm interested in the bermuda triangle, but instead it was terrible. all it did was offer a bunch of lame explinations that didn't make sense (if time moves differently there how come the woman didn't age, and her son aged rapidly), and have a horrible sappy ending. next time the guys who made this go to bermuda they should take all copies of this movie with them. please everyone vote for this movie so it can get on the worst movie list.
