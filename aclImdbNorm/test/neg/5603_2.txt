pretty.<br /><br />pretty actresses and actors. pretty bad script. pretty frequent "let's strip to our undies" scenes. pretty fair f/x. pretty jarring location decisions (the college dorm room looks like a high-end hotel room - probably because it was shot at a hotel). pretty bland storyline. pretty awful dialog. pretty locations. pretty annoying editing, unless you like the music video flash-cut style.<br /><br />this one isn't a guilty pleasure - this is more an embarrassing one. if you must watch this, pick a good dance/techno album and turn the sound off on the movie - you'll see the pretty people in their pretty black undies, and probably follow the story just fine.<br /><br />the cast may be able to act - i doubt that anyone could look skilled given the lines/plot that they had to deal with.
