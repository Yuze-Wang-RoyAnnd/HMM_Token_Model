four young grade-school girls witness the murder of one of their classmates during what they thought was just an innocent game. the killer is a strange young boy named milo jeeder. sixteen years later, the four survivors of the event re-unite under happier circumstances in the same town where it happened. they believe that milo drowned in a river shortly after the murder, but soon learn that the demonic killer milo has also returned, still a young boy, unchanged even after almost two decades.<br /><br />the cover for this movie makes it look really cool (yet i still expected a bad movie to come out of it). when i pop in the dvd into my player, the menu comes up and makes the film still look cool. sadly, this movie isn't all that it got my excited about. the movie is your average attempt at a slasher film and when i say average, i mean just like all those other small-budget slasher movies that have never been welcomed with open arms into most members of the horror community (i'm talking about you, the horror fan). in other words, you could walk up to any horror fan and the majority of responses would be "this sucks".<br /><br />what mistakes did the movie make? first of all, the dvd cover art makes milo look really dark but they blow it all by showing his face in the movie in many different scenes. he had the potential of being a very freaky character. secondly, the back of the cover art tells freddy, jason, chucky etc to pack their bags and move on out because milo is so much better... why in the hell would you want to say something like that when it comes to a no-name, low-budget slasher film that has obviously failed? i mean, it just raises your expectations of the movie, making it harder to impress itself upon you. in a last ditch effort to attract attention, it says (in very big letters) "from the creator of anaconda". just shows you how low they're going to get as much attention as possible for the movie.<br /><br />the gore in the movie sucks, the director gives you some hideous angles when milo attacks someone. the music isn't all that bad and i never once fell asleep during the movie (congratulations). i'm still trying to figure out what milo actually is. my best bet would be that he is a zombie, if anyone else knows, tell me. rest assured, i won't be losing any sleep over thinking about it.
