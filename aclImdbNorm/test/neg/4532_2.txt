this is a poorly written and badly directed short film, pure and simple. what is interesting and keep me watching, to some extent, was the production values. shot on video it appears, with a bad script and bad direction, one would think it would also have horrible production value. that is what the viewer expects when they watch a film that is terrible and shot on video. but not in this case, they spent some money and it shows. it keep me very mildly interested to see what was coming next, just to see!<br /><br />probably the worst short film i have seen that looked big budget hollywood even though it was shot on some sort of video format.<br /><br />instead of spending the sum of money they must have spent for some rather impressive set design, it would have been nicer to see a better executed story with some good direction. but then again how can we expect new filmmakers to do this when even hollywood won't.
