i had high hopes for this one after reading earlier reviews but it was so slow and the plot so basic that well i wondered if i had read the wrong reviews. <br /><br />please, a boy meets girl next door at 11 and both aspire to love and being basketball legends. grow apart, but watch each others progress. guess what! both get scholarships to same university and become lovers again until his father is caught out playing around with a younger woman. our young hero unable to cope has lapse in court concentration but some how decides to go pro and drop studies, and guess what is picked up by lakers. dumps the heroine because she was not there for him during this emotional period. so for 5 years they go their own way. she returns from spain having lost the zest for the game and our hero is getting married in two weeks. mom tells her that she should fight for her love so she professes her on-going love and challenges him to a basketball shootout. he wins he marries she wins he loves her. well he won but decides to dump other girl for our girl. the end has her playing basketball and he has baby duties. sorry 2 is my high score. my partner she scored 0 for a soapy story for those who read mills and boon
