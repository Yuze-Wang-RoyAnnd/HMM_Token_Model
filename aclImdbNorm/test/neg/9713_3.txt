pete's meteor. i seen this referred to as "authentic" and a "gem." i caught this movie on a saturday afternoon. i kinda wished that i didn't.<br /><br />apparently this was noted as being mike myers' first dramatic role. unfortunately it had to be this movie. the first thing you'll notice that pete's meteor suffers from is a complete lack of plot. or rather, a bunch of little subplots that aren't really connected and don't go anywhere. young orphan mickey lives with his younger brother and sister with their grandmother. a meteorite lands in their garden and is eventually collected by a scientist named hugh. despite the title of the movie, mickey is the one who lays claim to the meteor, and the "storyline" actually has little to do with the meteor in any shape or form. from here on out, several other characters and subplots are introduced. but like i said before, they don't really go anywhere.<br /><br />things go from cute family movie to dark thriller pretty fast, when pete (mike myers) is introduced and starts to play a role. micky blames him for the death of his parents, though we're never really told what happened or why. hugh has romance problems because his girlfriend can't get past his cosmic fascination. and pete's drug-related past starts to catch up with him and temporarily draws his own girlfriend and the rest of the cast into the mix when shady characters start trying to kill him. this would seem to be the main plot, until you realize it doesn't even have a role until halfway through the film, making everything else feel like pointless filler. hugh's girl problems, mickey's bad behavior, the meteor...what on earth do they have to do with this? not much.<br /><br />so the 'plot' is disjointed and half of it is pointless. but a good cast of characters can save it, right? keyword: good. the majority of characters are terribly unlikable people, most of which you'd like to see die horribly. at least, i know i would. despite the title, mickey seems to be the main character, which is a really bad move once you see him in action. he is one of the worst little kids i've seen in a movie, with an extremely bad attitude problem. he 'borrows' a car, harasses and talks trash to hugh (an adult) for taking the meteor, actually attempts burn the man's house down when he doesn't get his way, and even tries to stab pete with a knife. you'd think a kid like this is on his way to the jail house. unfortunately, one of the worst things about this movie is that mickey never gets what's coming to him. i'm not sure at what point you're supposed to be sympathizing with his character, because he's always a nasty little brat. he's the ringleader for his brother and sister, so they predictably end up taking and backseat and just following whatever he does. amazingly, they're pushed back so far that i can't even remember their names. they might as well not even be there.<br /><br />their grandmother is pretty much a borderline alcoholic. she tends to be just as nasty to hugh as mickey, and likes to push people out of her house and give them evil glares when she's not chugging down liquor bottles and drinking herself silly. pretty ridiculous when you take into account that she's supposed to be taking care of three children. her issues with alcohol are never really addressed, though she does collapse from time to time in the movie.<br /><br />hugh is one of the few likable characters in the movie, but that's only because he's the punching bag for the majority of characters and takes their mess without giving it back. the kids treat him nastily but he always comes back and tries to teach them and do nice things with them. he's got a taxi driver girlfriend who seems to take every aspect of his life as a scientist as a personal offense, attempting to leave him several times in the movie when he goes off into his cosmic lingo or does something to prove that he isn't exactly on the same wavelength as the rest of the characters (thankfully).<br /><br />then there's mike myers as pete. pete, despite having the only solid purpose and plot in the movie, is extremely underused and doesn't play any kind of role until the second half. it's unfortunate that myers got stuck in such a position for a dramatic role. even when pete is getting screen time, half of it is just myers running through dark alleys and hiding in small corners. and even though he was the only real point to this movie, when his plot line brings the movie to a close, it's a strange, unfulfilling conclusion that has all the characters laughing on a good note with a quick and strange explanation behind the title of the movie, making you wonder if they were just performing in the movie you were just watching.<br /><br />the only thing worth seeing in pete's meteor is mike myers' role as pete, and that's if you can wade through this disjointed mess long enough without lashing out at another human being due to the extremely unlikable characters and nonexistent plot line. no sir, i didn't like this one at all.
