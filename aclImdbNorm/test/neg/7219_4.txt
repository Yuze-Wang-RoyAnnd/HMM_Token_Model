let me start by saying you know a film is poorly run when extras make the cover. with that said, anyone who says this is the worst film ever is being dramatic, and anyone who says that the film is great is completely delusional. the film "is what it is." and what is that... a modest budget ($4 million, i estimate) studio sequel. the film isn't terrible, but for road house fans it will be a disappointment. and that brings me to problem one, just as dirty dancing wouldn't been what it was without swayze, road house isn't the same without him. the lead lacks depth, character, and likability to carry the film. i feel that the lead was poorly cast and the producers should have bent over backwards to get patrick to do it if they were gonna do a sequel. the other cast was uneven with outstanding actors like will patton along side day players who couldn't act there way out of a paper bag. busey, who i have seen do great characters seemed like he just mailed it in. ellen was played well, except for not being believable at all as a bayou raised chick. sherri, the dea agent at the first bar was hot and a good actress, yet her part was awkwardly small and undeveloped. the writer totally missed all opportunities to add depth and interest to the story and characters. instead opting for a base one dimensional film. which leads me to the biggest problem, the script... i got a bad feeling when the credits rolled and there were three script writers separated by an "and" and an "&." it looked very amateur. and that is what the writing was. i heard the original script was better and then a rewrite was done and the hard core sucking began. some cheezy parts of the film to watch for are... during the first undercover meeting, the obvious drug deal under the table. "hey lets meet at a crowded nudey bar, i will pull a block of coke out of my jacket and you pull cash out then we will slide them under the cocktail table" wait! "make sure to look cool when you look left and right to make sure no one is looking!" second, i love it when someone gets shot in the chest and then you see him sitting up happy as a lark 10 minutes later. there are some nasty editing cuts towards the end of the film especially during fight scenes and when the main character is chasing thru doors and runs into a patron. which brings me to the realism of the dea training, i won't both to get technical... but jumping thru doors isn't standard training... nor do typical female agents, who bust their butts to make it in a male oriented field, act like weak characters... boring! thanks for the chauvinistic view heir director. there is other stuff i could teach a course at a school about it... the sped up fighting, the cheezy dialogue, the recycled story... etc... but aside from all that you just cannot like ex-mr. applegate, he totally lacks the humble zen coolness that made mr. patrick swayze such a bad ass. he just strikes me as one of those 5 foot nothing actors who think they are a bad ass, but just like van damnit he runs into a real bad ass (chuck zito in van don't case) and he gives him a lesson about "badassdom." therefore, that i feel is the major linchpin of the film, if you are a bad ass you are a bad ass, you don't have to try. example: swayze! if you are a pretty boy who tries to hard to prove you are a bad ass among other things... then well... you are why your audience, the average joe... will not rent this film, and if they do they will write reviews like this.
