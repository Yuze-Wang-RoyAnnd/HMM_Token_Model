although i am a fan of heather thomas and i have a few of her old bikini posters around here somewhere, i can honestly say that if the only movie i had ever seen her in was "cyclone", i would never be able to guess why she had made it as far as she had in show business.<br /><br />directed by fred olen ray (about as good an omen as seeing buzzards circle over head in the desert), this tale of a woman (thomas) who must protect a high-tech motorcycle from unscrupulous types is about as "b" movie as it gets (or in fred olen's case, "b minus").<br /><br />the cast itself should tell you something. it's not every movie that combines thomas with actors the calibre of beswick, hall, combs, donahue, tamblyn and landau (!!). if you're lucky, very few movies do. and even though they seem to be having fun, shouldn't some of that fun be passed on to the audience? i vote yes, seems they voted no.<br /><br />of course, if you ever wanted to see heather deliver an uppercut to another woman, use the "f" word and get hooked up to battery cables, you've probably been looking for this one. myself, i'll be content with old "fall guy" reruns.<br /><br />one star, given in hopes that when another "cyclone" hits town, heather runs for shelter. i know i will.
