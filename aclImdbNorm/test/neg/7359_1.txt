horrendously acted and completely laughable haunted-house horror flick that has an out of place anna paquin playing a neurotic teenager fighting off the "things-that-go-bump-in-the-dark" that are plaguing her and her family shortly after moving to their new home in spain(?!). little more than a geographically re-planted rip-off of "the shining" and most notably "the others", the weak-plotted "darkness" is basically your typical run-of-the mill b-horror feature with a few predictable lame scares that can be seen by audiences a mile off (so to speak)! in retrospect i suppose i shouldn't have set my personal expectations quite as high for this movie to actually be good considering the well-known fact that it was shelved for nearly three years before finally being released around christmas of last year in american cinemas across the country to what was ultimately lukewarm ticket-sales and very harsh reviews from critics. when will filmmakers ever learn that there's more to making movies (be it horror or otherwise) than just the fey possibility of a little financial gain?
