a coach who used to be good, but has had to move to a new area to get away from what he once did; a team of no hopers; the star player who has a row with the coach; the assistant coach with an alcohol problem, the little guy who gets kicked around scoring the winning basket; the whole town against the coach (all except for the leading lady). it's the old story - right out of the british comic books, where a team of speccy geeks and fatties take on the brazilians at soccer and win.<br /><br />this film, admittedly well put together, is full of these clich'es. the only part i didn't predict was when at the town meeting, the star player suddenly decided to side with the coach. no reason was ever given. it seemed like a very strange thing to do seeing that everything was going his way hitherto. maybe he just felt sorry for the poor guy.<br /><br />gene hackman plays a locker room popey doyle. i am sure that an actor of dennis hopper's calibre found nothing particularly challenging about his role. the same can be said about barbara hershey.<br /><br />all in all, a film full of clich'es that might have been done a lot better than it was.
