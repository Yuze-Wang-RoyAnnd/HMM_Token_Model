i'm sick of the "open mind" argument. i'm generally quite open-minded, but this sort of line is basically made by people who enjoy things that should not be "enjoyed." you know what, there is a reason so many people are disgusted by this. and just because someone out there isn't doesn't make it less so. there is, after all, a reason for the existence of the feeling of disgust, and no amount of "open mind" or "pushing the envelope" should eliminate that feeling. otherwise we're no better than senseless living things.<br /><br />back to the film. another argument is that this film puts women in the roles normally reserved for men, which may be why men don't like it. but just because it proves revolting for more men than would otherwise doesn't make it great. maybe men shouldn't be turned on by what's dominating the movie industry, but is the answer for women to do the same? maybe, if you don't like movies, tv, and entertainment having so much sexual objectification of women, so much violence, don't watch them.<br /><br />and if you're a director, don't make them.<br /><br />otherwise, some day someone will ask for an open mind when what happened in this "movie" happen in real life.<br /><br />heck, some people seem to like it so much.
