hopper has never been worse as if he felt as this movie is worthy of only a grade b performance and he delivers a rather good one. outside of madsen and hopper the acting is horrid; you've seen better at your local high school. the sound and at times the editing and camera shots are low end of b-movies. the scene with the peeping tom is of movies greatest gratuitous nudity scenes i've ever seen (it doesn't even come close to fitting in the movie). the script was probably a great 10-page outline, but when it comes out to a full-length movie there are more holes in it then the dead bodies madsen left behind. i do have to say hopper dressed in a nice suit driving the hummer had me laughing out loud, but i don't think that was the intent. yes there is a little style, and hopper can always draw my interest. however the interesting plot concept never pays off and you are left wondering why you wasted your time watching this.
