leni riefenstahl would be embarrassed by the disgusting propaganda moore tries to call "humor". that this movie, and moore's other prevarications, actually attract admirers proves that, alas, it's possible to fool some of the people all of the time.<br /><br />let's see if we can bait foreigners. let's see if we can extol obsolete factories. let's see if we can add to the sum of hatred in the world. let's see if we can pretend we're funny. let's see if we can out-isolationist charles lindbergh. the only thing moore lacks in comparison to lindbergh is a medal from g"oring.<br /><br />admittedly, in this film, moore had a bit of self-deprecation to his schtick. in this film, moore mocks roger smith, ceo of general motors, as an aloof, uncaring elitist. moore could do that in 1989, but now that moore has surrendered himself to aloof, uncaring elitism, this characterization of roger smith has an ironic twinge. who really wouldn't rather be roger's buddy than michael moore's?
