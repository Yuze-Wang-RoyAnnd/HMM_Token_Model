i realize why people hate this film. and, i hated blair witch project,so go figure? this is about as staged as it gets & yes they do insult your intelligence by trying to make it seem real.i really liked the madame lalaurie storyline though it's more than likely made up. but, the main reason i like this film, is fake or not when the ghosts start attacking & kidnapping them,i get chill-bumps every time & have to look behind me as it feels like something's there with me.i know it's my imagination, but hey more than half of the drivel that is horror in today's cinemas & dvd's doesn't give me goosebumps,so that makes this a creepy delight.not for everyone, as skeptics will hate it & not for gorehounds as with a pg-13 rating there is no gore. and, the females are very annoying!you'll wish the ghosts would take them off & experiment on them before it's all said & done. ** out of *****.
