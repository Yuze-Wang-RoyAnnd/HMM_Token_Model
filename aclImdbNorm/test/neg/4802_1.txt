i obtained this little piece of scuzz on the videoasia "tales of voodoo" dvd label. quite where the voodoo is supposed to fit in, i have no idea. indeed i would not usually connect voodoo with indonesia anyway (let alone with wips).<br /><br />i know and love wip movies. i have seen most of them. i could not therefore resist this little known gem from the description given to it on the cover.<br /><br />it is appalling. you cannot have a wip movie if the women keep their clothes on (even in the shower!). although it gives a nod to the exploitation genre, wip without nudity is like a big mac without the beef.<br /><br />as my gym teacher used to say, on the whole, i'd rather be at the disco....
