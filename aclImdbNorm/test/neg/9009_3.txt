i've been trying to write a plot summary for several minutes now and can't seem to do it. but with a movie as bad as night of the blood beast the plot hardly matters. an astronaut crash lands and is believed dead. his body later reanimates, but is found to be carrying the embryos of some strange alien life-form. but how did they get there? and where's the alien that implanted the strange creatures in maj. john corcoran's body? <br /><br />imdb lists the runtime for night of the blood beast at 62 minutes. is that right? 62 minutes? it had to be longer than that. it felt interminable to me. even with the mst3k commentary (which was very funny by the way), the actual movie felt much, much longer. and it's pretty much a snoozer from beginning to end. i like a lot of these alien invasion type movies of the 50s, but not this one. it failed to grab my interest on any level. the baby aliens were too silly looking to be taken seriously, the titular blood beast was pathetic, and none of the characters did anything for me. add to that the usual low-budget roger corman trappings and you've got a real loser of a movie.
