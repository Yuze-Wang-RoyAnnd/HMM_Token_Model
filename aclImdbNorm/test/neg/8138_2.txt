this movie was cheesy and it was more than that. it was about this guy who gets a curse on him and he turns into a gorilla. i had to see how bad it was because of the title. before this guy turns into a gorilla, he gets married. i was a little upset because she wasn't a bride of a gorilla: she is now the wife of the gorilla. she should have married him when he was a gorilla then the title would have made more sense. there are all these people in the middle of the jungle too and they all want to leave. this isn't just a b movie, it's more like a z movie. i didn't even see any bananas for a wedding gift. oh, right he wasn't cursed yet.
