i am testing myself to watch 3 bad movies in a row to find out if watching 3 bad movies in a row could give me amnesia i have a dubbed to english version of this movie. now let me go down the points music score: bad quality but at least it suits story: it's about a guy who goes to a town and he meets his sheriff brother and they fight for farmers land from a major and he allies with mexicans to drive them out and trinity and his brother try to teach them to defend it - the final climatic fight scene will confuse anyone about who the #### are the good guys conclusion: better than i thought but i need to continue with this i am next going to watch the dolph lungren and jean-claudde vanne damme movie "universal soldier" pray for my sanity
