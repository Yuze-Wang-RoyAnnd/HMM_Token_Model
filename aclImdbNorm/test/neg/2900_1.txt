i saw this movie a few years ago, and man i never want to golf again. i mean ninjas apparently have no respect for the game of golf or the way it has evolved. and i'm not talking about "victimless" stuff like forging a scorecard. no no- based on what i've seen here, they shamelessly massacre policemen and golfers alike on hallowed country club grounds. judge smailes would be spinning in his grave. and do they repent for said sins? no no, based on what i have seen here, the typical response by a slain ninja is to take over the body of a buxom female telephone repairwoman and seek revenge. i find this morally reprehensible, and needless to say, after viewing this nonsense, i not only stopped golfing and talking on the telephone, but also decided to stop feeding the homeless.
