this noisy, dizzying football film from director oliver stone seems to have everyone in the cast - well, everyone except william h. macy, who could have tackled the role played by mr. stone, the team doctors, or the "fruitcake" selling cereal. if you're a fan of the foul-mouthed, there are some great, profanity-laden knock-down, drag-out, put-down phrases you can try-out on two-faced friends and way-ward lovers. the film is sometimes good as lively background party atmosphere, especially during the first two hours; it even features some mtv-styled music video scenes.<br /><br />** any given sunday (12/16/99) oliver stone ~ al pacino, cameron diaz, jamie foxx, dennis quaid
