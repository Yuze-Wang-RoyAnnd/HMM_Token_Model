i would like to say something different about this movie. i saw comments how beautiful is russia and the views from russia have been great. hey guys this is not russia it's bulgaria more specific the capital sofia. so this is not russia it's my country. about the movie - well in bulgaria, maybe except the grey zone - all movies from american directors are in one word awful like this one of course. it's a shame that patrick swayze has to play in such a low budget movies. most of the actors are bulgarians but really this movie has no plot twist has no energy what can i say-weak and boring movie a clich'e not more. hey people remember it's not russia in reality it's bulgaria.
