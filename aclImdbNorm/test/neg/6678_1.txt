ordinarily, i wouldn't waste the time on reviewing a film like "human pork chop" (the 2001 version, not to be confused with the earlier film of the same title, which is probably better known in the west as "the untold story"), but since the reviews already here are quite vague as to what it actually consists of, i figured i'd best post something more detailed, so as no one actually gets tempted (as i was) into buying it because of the film's mystique. i honestly would just say stay away.<br /><br />**** major spoilers are contained below ****<br /><br />"human pork chop", i was expecting to be like a chinese interpretation of the popular japanese "guinea pig" films. anyone who's watched enough of that series can see where its makers are coming from. there's a strong sense of humour running throughout it - you can't watch the ludicrous "he never dies" without laughing and "the making of guinea pig" is a fabulous turning of the whole thing on its head, proving it was just made, with some glee, by fairly good natured gorehounds. all the gp films have a punk rock, diy, shot-on-video aesthetic, occasional flashes of genuine artistry ("mermaid in a manhole"), an angry political agenda and a warped, deranged zeal that sets them in a league of their own.<br /><br />"human pork chop" has none of the above.<br /><br />it's shot on 35mm film (with disarmingly good production values), it's 90 gruelling minutes long and it's utterly devoid of anything redeeming. the plot tells, in flashback at a police interviewing of the suspects, of the systematic torture, death and eventual dismemberment of grace, a heroin-addicted streetwalker who is kidnapped and brutalised by her pimp and his henchmen when she steals money from him.<br /><br />despite its fleeting attempts at being a morality play, the film possesses a detached, inhumane feel to it and one can't help but dwell on the mindsets of those behind it. although it half-heartedly paints grace as an innocent victim, the mean-spirited nature of its screenplay and the protagonist's constant, vicious dialogue veers towards a shocking, utterly unwelcome "she deserves it!" point of view which makes the whole thing almost impossible to watch. far more time is spent detailing grace's degradation and when her captors are eventually deemed guilty and jailed, it seems like a hurried afterthought on behalf of the writers who've long since stopped caring less.<br /><br />what makes it boggling as to why anyone would want to watch such a film is that even the kind of people who do really get off on mindless sex and violence in the movies would be severely missing out. the torture is just a continuous stream of kickings, slappings, verbal abuse, psychological abuse and then increasingly bizarre displays of power on behalf of the captors use grace's heroin addiction to make her do their bidding. and when i say that, don't get me wrong, incidentally. unlike "guinea pig" with it's frequent barrage of nudity that gives an almost teenage feel of mock-titillation to the proceedings in spite of the ultraviolence, "human pork chop" has no such sexual overtones. there isn't any actual nudity in the film and the violence is performed purely out of malice by the odious protagonists (who early in the film are seen stuffing a dog into a bag and banging it against a brick wall - don't worry, not real, just a cheap special effect!).<br /><br />the only actual bloodshed in the film is towards the end when they dismember grace's body and boil the bones, all very poor special fx (nowhere near "guinea pig" level) and, by that stage, you'll probably be already feeling too miserable and sick to even care what's going on.<br /><br />the film is depressingly bleak and uncompromising along a similar line to buddy giovinazzo's "combat shock" and i guess could even be compared, at a push. both movies deal with the gradual physical decline of an individual who exists in a nightmarish environment devoid of any social or morally redeemable characters and both movies 'climax' in a particularly visceral manner with the individual's inevitable, inescapable doom.<br /><br />in fairness, neither 'glamourises' it's violence (whereas "guinea pig" could easily be accused of this) but one can't help but wonder where the place is for a film like this. it fails to many any real points in its frank presentation of such brutality and with a leaden-pace, a virtually non-existent plot line and the aforementioned lack of any entertainment value, i just can't understand what would encourage anyone to watch something like this. i only made it to the end, purely for the purpose of being able to review it fairly... which i hope i've now done.<br /><br />overall score: 0 of of 10. welcome to the bottom of the barrel.
