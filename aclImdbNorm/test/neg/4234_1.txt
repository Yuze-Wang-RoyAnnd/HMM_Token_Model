european films may be slower-paced and less plot driven than american films, but this takes it way too far. it also show a whole bunch of incompletely drawn characters doing inexplicable things. it's not fantasy, it's not even surreal, it's just awkward and bad.<br /><br />what's the message here? that people in france are pensive and gaze morosely a lot? that they like to watch other people having sex? they they spontaneously scream or touch a stranger on his neck? do not wear a watch when seeing this film, as you will be astonished at how little is explained or learned over huge stretches of time.<br /><br />this is the story of a "police superintendent" who is deeply troubled by the brutal murder of a little girl, though actually he seems troubled before then. he is not merely upset at his own personal tragedies, but apparently mentally quite slow, behaving very much like a learning-disabled six-year old child. he stares blankly a lot, walks with arms rigid like a little kid, speaks in meek, simpering, tones, behaves quite oddly in all of his interactions (though no one seems to notice or care, even when it is supposed to be police business). he's not a troubled cop, more of an outpatient. picture andy kaufman's latka character on taxi, but without the humor. he is not only not believable as a policeman he is not believable as an adult. that he won an award for this interpretation of his character is truly amazing -- unless he was playing the part exactly as written and the fault lies with the weirdos who scripted this thing. the plot is clearly secondary. do not expect to see anything remotely like what police would do if a little girl was found murdered. this not that important, though the implausibility of their behavior is sort of insulting. the problem is that the rest of the film makes no sense either. that leaves the long lingering close-ups of fields, vegetable gardens, people's faces etc. the ending struck me as especially ridiculous -- totally unsupported by the events leading up to it -- unless you think, "what's the worst way this film could end?"<br /><br />there is lots of sex and nudity, which is supposed to mean something. you want vaginas? you'll see vaginas. not to worry, it's art. it has deep meaning, what i am not sure. and the protagonist, despite his innocent weirdness, seems to have some sort of homoerotic neck or jowl fetish.<br /><br />finally, the subtitles are in white and frequently appear on a white background -- very hard to read many of them. on the other hand, there isn't much dialogue, so this isn't a big problem. there is also very little sound -- not even ambient sounds you would expect to hear -- in the film, contributing to the emptiness of the whole experience. the old woody allen would have had a field day parodying this work.<br /><br />that this is an award-winning film is sad. i would hate to see the losing films.<br /><br />enjoy.
