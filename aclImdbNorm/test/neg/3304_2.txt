i have no idea who these others are but this movie is plain awful. they have to prop up joe pesci when he is a minor character. bait and switch movie just like the studios did with adam sandler and jim carrey, etc. the dvd i watched states "this obscure gem revolves around joe pesci's mob character who is a hothead that start a war" etc. etc. joe plays the part of joe, he does not even carry a gun, plays a whimpy character and gets spoiler - (whacked). so much for the movie revolving around pesci. the only halfway memorable scene was a bad attempt at comedy when they passed gas while waiting for a score. if you watch this movie after reading this, i warned you. please stop and do not lose 87 minutes of your life.
