too fractured to be enjoyable, too loose to be interesting and too clumsily photographed to be tolerable mr lonely is an interesting idea ruined by really bad film making. like a ken russell film at its worst, or day of the locust remade by amateurs, mr lonely might have seemed like a good idea on a few scraps of paper (no script, you see) and a free holiday to somewhere, but in the end we have a widescreen film that seems as if it was made by film students whose parents told them that everything they did was a brilliant creation. or did i get the film maker right? mr lonely is a waste of resources, trying to be (gawd!) quirky and deliberately off kilter. it ends up being annoying and indulgent.. and pointless. what's the point of going to a commune in scotland? what a stupid idea in this film about hollywood delusion. maybe korine wanted to remake godspell ... well the result is god-awful. oh and there is some subplot like leftover footage from fitzcarraldo including werner herzog, nuns and a plane. add slo-mo drifting and violin music all wistful and melancholy, add james fox who seems to hope he might be seen as daring (like in performance) and the result is amphetamine fantasy alphabet soup in widescreen. it might have been fun to film but the result on the screen is a mess. imagine american pie band camp with food poisoning.
