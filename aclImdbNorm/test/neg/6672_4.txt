well acted, yes. very well, i must say, even though i don't speak chezck. nice cinematography. but the script is lame, really lame. a predictable soap opera, in which you know exactly everything that is going to happen. ok, maybe the ending isn't as predictable, but is it any good? it is one of those films that you have the feeling that have seen already, and forget about the day after.<br /><br />i just got a note from imdb saying that my comment was not long enough. that's really sad, because i have no idea of what else to say about this movie, which actually says a a lot about it, don't you think? the thing is.. .it has no soul and no originality. compare this movie with barrio, or riff raff, shot more than ten years ago (or the extraordinary recently shot the child). it's sad to see that this is a much worse film.
