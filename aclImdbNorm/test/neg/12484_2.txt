yeah, what did i expect? i thought this would be a film about young adults at their turning-point in life, something like "sonnenallee" or "american pie", which i liked a lot. i wanted to see a funny film, perhaps with an ironic look on idyllic wuerzburg. and what did i get?<br /><br />attention, spoilers ahead!<br /><br />this film starts with a lengthy dialogue which gives you a good hint of what will inevitably follow: more lengthy dialogues. sometimes i thought moritz bleibtreu might have forgotten his text and trying to hide that fact by improvising and just repeating what he was saying before. but as i think of bleibtreu as one of the better german actors, i believe that this effect really was intended. i think the author wanted to show how boring talking to close friends can be - especially when they are stoned. but really, i don't need cinema to be bored by stoned friends' talk. boring dialogues make up most of this film.<br /><br />but okay, that's one thing. i can cope with that, i have seen nice films with abominable dialogues, just think of schwarzenegger's life's work. but the next thing is that characters are cheap and flat and that the storyline is as foreseeable as anything. just one example (spoiler!!): why, do you think, does someone take a garden hose to his hemp-plants deep in the forest? to water them? of course not, usually you don't find water-pipes deep in forests, do you? the only reason this water-hose is there is that a hunter who happens to come by while the two protagonists are harvesting their dope can be drugged, maltreated and finally filled up with three bottles of jaegermeister. i truly hated this scene, because it's really violent. usually, i don't mind violence in films - slapstick-comedies are full of it. but in that sort of comedy there is a silent agreement between the film and you that people don't get hurt if they fall on their faces or get beaten with chairs or things like that. but if that happens in a film which is otherwise realistic enough, slapstick-scenes also seem real. in this particular scene in "lammbock" i really thought that this hunter must be badly injured, if not dead - the final scene really invoked in me the impression that he is left to die there, totally filled up with more booze anyone could handle. and the protagonists just walk away. it would have been otherwise if the author had consistently followed one style; the scene could have been quite funny.<br /><br />talking about being consistently - that's what i missed most about this film. the whole film seems to be a listing of small episodes that came to the author's mind. things just happen without a apparent reason - yeah, i know, that's life, but that's not cinema, because cinema is meant to tell a story, not to show boring episodes without any significance. i found myself asking "where's the point?" all the time. characters besides the two main ones are not elaborated, you never get to know why the protagonist's sister wants to sleep with his best friend kai, in fact, she tells you but i could not buy it, not at all. i think she just was there to give kai an opportunity to act this childish aids-test sketch, which you sure have seen a thousand times before, and mostly better. the protagonist's girlfriend you meet once, then she leaves germany (what you don't even see and the guy doesn't seem to care) and finally it is mentioned in one sentence that she has met someone else in america and splits up with the protagonist. it seemed to me that the author wanted to tie up a few loose ends. he actually didn't, you never really get to know what's so bad about studying law, being daddy's son (daddy fixes everything in the end and serves coffee in the middle of the night, which to my mind made him one of the nicer characters in the whole film) and living in beautiful wuerzburg. even the dinner with daddy's layer-friend, which maybe was intended to show how horrible it is to have to live up to dad's expectations, seemed flat, just another nice dinner with the family's friends (except for the trip the guy is on later, but i think showing that eating dope before you dine with parents isn't healthy was not the point of this scene, if there was any). i have experienced far worse dinners in my life than this one and still finished my exams. i couldn't understand one single character in the whole film, they just seemed flat and implausible.<br /><br />all this made it a not-so-good film, but not one i wouldn't watch again on television. it really had a few good scenes (most of them were not new, though, like the one with the nice and understanding policemen), some were really funny, some dialogues were nice and i like bleibtreu's play, although he repeated his well-known stereotypes again this time. not good, not abominable, that's what i thought after the film was half over.<br /><br />but then came this incest scene and this i really found repulsive. incest simply isn't funny. i don't even know if this was intended to be funny, some people in the audience laughed, so it could have been meant this way. this scene spoiled the whole film for me, i couldn't feel sympathy for the protagonist any more - i can't feel sympathy for anyone who f**** a helpless person, to me, this is rape and rape isn't funny. so it might have been a hint of drama or so, but the incest is never again mentioned (although we thought this could have been one reason for the protagonist to leave germany in the end, but as it is never mentioned again, we don't know.), it is even totally unnecessary. i almost expected the sister to become pregnant in the end, which would just have added the finishing touch to this tasteless story, but not even this final cliche is fulfilled, just as nothing is really solved or thought through to the end in this film. it isn't really funny, it isn't really a drama, it isn't at all a road movie a la tarantino despite desperate tries on violence, it is definitely not enjoyable.<br /><br />skip this film. watch "final fantasy", that's also bad, but at least with beautiful pictures and not that tasteless.
