4 out of 10.<br /><br />this film was neither funny as a whole nor was it even worthing investing any kind of emotion into the characters. eugene levy is probably the most funny.... the rest of the cast do their jobs, but the story never really gets very deep and there are a lot of holes in the plot that never get filled. this just wasn't very much fun, despite being funny at times.<br /><br />
