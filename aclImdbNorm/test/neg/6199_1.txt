i watched this movie only coz it was expected to be yet another entertainer by david dhawan. <br /><br />bad bad comeback by david dhawan.he has made lots of funny movies in past which made no sense but none of them was a crap bag!! what a waste of talent and beauty it was?donno why actors agree on doin movie like this.<br /><br />there was not a whit of practicality in this movie.the movie is below par and not at all justifies the standard and potential bollywood has.<br /><br />the only thing worth watching in this movie was katrina but we don't need to watch a movie like this to see her! being a remake of hollywood flick hitch its clear that bollywood directors cant even make a proper remake. i consider this to be the worst ever movie i hv seen. awful 1/10
