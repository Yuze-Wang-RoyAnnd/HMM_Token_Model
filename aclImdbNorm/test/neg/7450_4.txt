'ernest saves christmas' is comedian ernest's christmas special film. in this film, ernest has to find a successor to santa claus in order for christmas to continue. along the way, he meets a young girl who is a thief and who ends up stealing something very important of santa's (i won't tell you what that is; you'll just have to watch the film for yourself). like most ernest films, there is a lot of slapstick humor involved.<br /><br />this film is probably one of ernest's best films. it's funny, and it has some important lessons to learn regarding friendship and family and not being afraid to show love. it's not the best christmas film around, but it is a good one to get you in the christmas spirit. it's a little bit sad that the film is a little dated now.
