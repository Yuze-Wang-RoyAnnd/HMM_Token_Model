sigh... what can i say? <br /><br />why does a horrible script such as this gets approved in the first place. its not wrong to have a complicated plot but its not explained to the audience properly!<br /><br />to have the wife explain the plot via flashbacks is bad bad bad. to have such a tight editing for the fight scenes is bad too! such fanciful editing only appears in trailers. it cheapens the whole look!<br /><br />and who are the russian guys at the top of the movie? who is the guy being tortured? is he with the cia? <br /><br />this film deserved not to be released in theatre. but it doesn't deserve to be produced in the first place. its a joke to hollywood.
