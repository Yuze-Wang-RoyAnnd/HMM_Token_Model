well , of course everybody is entitled to have an opinion about a thing ...everything. the presentation was interesting : black and white movie , the year 1968 , students manifestations , general strike , youth , ideals, love.....etc. sorry but i did not sense love , romance . a lover who is all right that his girlfriend sleeps with no matter who ? that is love ? but not only that , the movie is very long and for no reason , i had to stop watching the movie several time because i simply lost interest. i waited for something to happen but .......nothing. the only thing i was impressed during the movie : gypsy fiddler playing in the streets , yes that was nice. i do not think that art should be complicated , encrypted , hidden in secret meanings , confusing .big disappointment and waste of time !
