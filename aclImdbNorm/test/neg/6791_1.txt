walker texas ranger is one of the worst shows produced in the past 10 years. the script for james 'jimmy' trivette, walker's sidekick, is about as pathetically written of a part as wesley crusher on star trek tng, and is played with about as much conviction.<br /><br />on this show, people don't respond the way people respond to things in real life--everyone is polarized--everyone is either a completely good guy or a completely bad guy (unless walker himself has a 2 minute talk with them and then they change instantly). that's not how life works, that's not how people are. this show doesn't take place in this reality.<br /><br />the plot lines are about as realistic as murder she wrote, a show where an arrogant old lady can just walk into people's houses without them getting angry, and she can demand that police officers do what she wants and they bend over backwards for her. with walker, everyone on the show, including the "bad guys", act like he's the sort of hero that myths and fairy tales are made of, and time itself bends to his whim. the lines that sometimes come out of people's mouths on this show are beyond ridiculous. it's as if the scriptwriter for the part of wesley crusher (for the "serious" parts) and the scriptwriter for bob saget's funniest home videos (for the "humor" parts) got together and wrote all the scripts for this show.<br /><br />this show is for people who think that good always prevails over evil. it's for the elderly. it's for wishful thinkers. it's for people who want to be guaranteed to always have a happy ending. it's for people who want to drift away into oblivion. it's for people whose drug of choice is their television.<br /><br />i cringe every time i see even a commercial for this show. my opinion is that it is the worst show to be on television in the last 10 years.<br /><br />i used to like chuck norris, but this show has forever tainted him in my mind. i can't even watch his older movies without thinking of this show.
