people may say i am harsh but i can't help it. the movie is so bad i was absolutely stunned. the first movie was bad enough if you ask me. it was greatly exaggerated and silly but this one, despite the creepy scenes, has a seriously ass-stupid story. they actually went deep into investigating kayako's past and found out that she had a mother (who miraculously speaks english) who was an exorcist and "fed" evil spirits to her daughter. stupid? yeap. ok, it started out with kayako who was an ordinary housewife who had an affair with some bloke and got herself dead. this part is still ok. because of this moment of rage, she became a vengeful spirit who kills anyone who enters her house. acceotable. now, her killings began to stretch a little where she actually had the opportunity to travel throughout tokyo just to finish her victims. (her victims were travelling, weren't they?) this struck me hard. now if a ghost could actually do such a thing like travelling throughout a country without paying public transport fares, i wouldn't mind being. ask someone to come kill me then *snorts*. and to crown things all up, the ghost who was once depicted as a very vengeful one (in ju-on: the grudge, which was way better than this trash) is now depicted as some spectre who truly enjoys herself and felt that it is her mission to finish of people. things became worse (for me, the viewer) when the ghost became coming in forms of large strands of hair. i mean, ??? if a ghost had such power, i seriously dun mind being one. i never really liked movies depicting ghosts as monsters cause they're not. the overall results is just plain bad. like the grudge 2. with a better storyline and less exaggeration, this show would have been better
