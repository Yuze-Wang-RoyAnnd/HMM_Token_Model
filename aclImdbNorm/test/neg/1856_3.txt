in following dylan moran's star from the charming misanthrope bookstore owner in the surrealist sitcom black books, i could see his comic potential begging to be utilised in theater or larger cinematic avenues. this first big screen outing in a starring role (he had a cameo as rufus the thief in notting hill) had oodles of promise, but like the strained steve coogan vehicle, the parole officer, has too many creases which should have been ironed out in preproduction.<br /><br />the plot is so convoluted that i shan't bother repeating the finer details (the script has every character do that for us), and the laughs are sourced from show business in-jokes. michael caine is a pompous has-been running a production of richard iii - updated to nazi occupation (one of the few genuine laughs, a satirical jab at ian mckellen), in which everyone is forever doing the hitler salute every time they take the stage. convincing dylan that acting should be a conceptual act unto itself, the two plot to steal money from some fairly harmless gangsters by way of their acting prowess. confusion ensues (both on screen and in the audience), there's a romantic sub-plot between dylan and the daughter of one of the gangsters blah blah blah and dylan gets to dress in odd clothes and do funny accents. michael caine delivers some choice lines, and dylan's comic timing is on the money, so why isn't it any good? it does have a certain charm that you would expect from film 4, but it also has a precocious little girl acting as compass in a muddled and irrelevant plot - a no-no in screen writing 101. exposition overshadows everything else. you just want to see moran and caine acting as comic foil to each other the way the were at the beginning, but when they're together toward the end, the the pairing has lost its charisma.<br /><br />the actors is an amusing, albeit underwhelming effort. should it come on telly during a rainy tuesday afternoon, then have at you. otherwise you would be better off watching your old black books videos, or renting withnail & i.
