i really wanted to like this movie, because i love troma and loved the trailer and loved "ghouls," another of ferrin's films. it did have some almost-good moments, like the oldies love song playing over the car crash scene, and a scene near the end where the protagonist gets some closure. but on the whole, it was just boring and mildly unpleasant.<br /><br />the "unimaginable" shocks that ferrin came up with were really predictable and worn-out. poop, murdering prostitutes, incest. could have still been good, but poorly done. unsure whether it was trying to offend, amuse, or both. ultimately did neither.<br /><br />in conclusion, we watch troma movies because we want films with heart. this film did not consistently feel like it had heart. there were some good scenes, but ultimately it was dull and unpleasant.
