this is a weak throw-together of just about everything: refugees, croatia-slovenia relations, globalization, sexual orientation.. a very big clumsy metaphor about slovenia being at the cross roads between its past, which is symbolized by everything "virgin" becoming queen of the household, and its future, which is symbolized by listening to music in clubs and being a lesbian and never having kids.<br /><br />it plays on a rather recent slovenian legend involving a virgin and a "forest king" assuming the shape of a goat (zlatorog beer's imagery is also based on that legend), but unfortunately, the treatment is very incoherent. weiss seems to think the end justifies the means: she can use all kinds of "dream-like" sequences, and then pick and choose which ones true, and which ones are imaginary. how can the ride in the jeep with the "forest king" be real for all three girls, but the scene outside the tent be real only in simona's imaginary ? the ending just drags on and on (i can't believe the movie's runtime is only 98 minutes, have i been watching a director's cut without knowing it?), with the three girls having to look at the camera for about 10 seconds while looking afraid and happy at the same time (so obvious).<br /><br />i never thought i could spot bad acting in a movie whose language i don't understand, but it didn't take long to see that "simona" is over-acting most of the time, as if she was playing in a silent movie.<br /><br />it wasn't so bad as i kept thinking the director was just starting and wanted to capture what she thought her generation was all about on film by doing a half-experimental movie, until i realized that the director was actually 37 years old when making the movie and that her work is probably "serious".
