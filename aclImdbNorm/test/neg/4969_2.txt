i finished watching mandy lane about an hour ago, and felt the urge to come straight home and get up here to warn anyone that's about to spend money on the dvd - don't.<br /><br />the supporting characters are shallow, the failure of acting is higher than that of matthew mcconaughey movies, and up until the end twist, the plot is everything but obvious. in nine out of ten, you can see the next scene coming 5 minutes before it starts. the whole movie is more or less without motive or message, and the half-way revealing of "the murderer" just plain out kills what little interest you might have left at that point. what could have saved this shallow, tedious movie is some decent splatter, or at least gore worthy of the genre "slasher" - it fails there as well.<br /><br />if you need a background movie to a party that you can jump in and out of without missing anything, i recommend buying all the boys love mandy lane.<br /><br />if you're looking to sit down and actually concentrate your eyes on the screen for more than 15 seconds, i don't.
