worst.film.ever nothing more needs to be said. aaron carter is utterly repellent and the rest of the cast should fire their agents immediately. it really is a terrible terrible movie from beginning to end. i wish i could be more eloquent in describing the movies many (oh so many) flaws however i cant be bothered/get too angry to form proper sentences. <br /><br />in short i absolutely hated everything about this movie and not in "so bad its good" kinda way...<br /><br />it was unadulterated drek.<br /><br />gavin
