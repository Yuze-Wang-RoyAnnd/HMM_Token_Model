spoiler alert.<br /><br />this movie will spoil your afternoon or "wee small hours of the morning" viewing slot.<br /><br />i like marc singer. he has portrayed good characters in the roles i have seen. until this movie.<br /><br />what starts as a promising movie soon disappears up itself with the disastrous cgi'd background and the extreme close up on the person about to die...<br /><br />then it gets worse.<br /><br />a lot worse.<br /><br />to describe it as hammy acting would insult pigs. this movie goes to the bottom of the ham barrel and scrapes the acting off there.<br /><br />apart from marc singer's overcooked hamming it up, mike dopud stomps and plods around the scenery looking as if he is afraid he might fall on the rocks and his wide-eyed 'manic' bad guy just makes him look like a moron. he isn't menacing at all.<br /><br />george stults looks like a deer caught in the headlights. he claims to have been threatened by the other two but his character would have been threatened by a cashier offering him "paper or plastic".<br /><br />this is really a vehicle for nicole eggert as an independent woman getting her life back despite attracting the wrong sort of man... she was unremarkable.<br /><br />this is not a remake but this is remarkably similar to "cliffhanger" - seasoned guide, loses someone in a fall, conscience pricked to help out someone else, a missing treasure worth oodles of money and a gang of n'er-do-wells who exploit the guide. except cliffhanger was a great vehicle for stallone and lithgow. i must admit, lithgow stole the show.<br /><br />even the unintentional comedy was poor. there were times when i wasn't sure if they were using a rubber-faced model as a stand-in for singer as he tried in vain to storm the weather station (no pun intended). pressing his face to the door post and his clumsy manner in general did nothing to help his character.<br /><br />avoid.<br /><br />no, seriously, avoid it. save 96 minutes of your life and do something else more constructive like watching paint dry or grass grow. or just close your eyes and examine the backs of your eyelids for 90 minutes...
