save some very early norris, "breaker, breaker" has nothing to offer which can't be found ten fold better on any broadcast channel. a pathetic attempt at film making, this is one of the worst films i have ever seen. in spite of that, i did watch it, thumbing the fast forward button, because the acting was so awful it was comical. of course, the film is supposed to be an action/drama but turned out as a treatise on how not to make a movie. everything which could be wrong with film is on screen in this "dog". if you happen across it, give it a peek. it's so bad, it's funny.
