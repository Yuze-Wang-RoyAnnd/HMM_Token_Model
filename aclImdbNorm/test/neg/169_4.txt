i think i watched a highly edited version because it wasn't nearly as graphic as i expected - based on the other reviews that i have heard.<br /><br />other than 1. being written by the same person who wrote the original "emmanuelle" (1974), emmanuelle arsan, 2. the lead character being a sexually free spirit, and 3. being set in the exotic locale of asia, "laure" doesn't have the same flair as its predecessor.<br /><br />i just found this film way too talky with philosophical topics that i'm really not that interested in, i.e. the voyeuristic, open relationship between laure and nick, "i'm just happy with whatever brings her pleasure"...something along those lines. i cannot relate to this mentality and the film/characters don't really shed any light.<br /><br />the second half about finding the mara tribe just seemed as though it were a completely separate film. one that i didn't care for. by that time, i was just hoping that it would turn into a porn so that at least it would keep my interest.<br /><br />maybe i just didn't get it.<br /><br />i'll leave it at that.
