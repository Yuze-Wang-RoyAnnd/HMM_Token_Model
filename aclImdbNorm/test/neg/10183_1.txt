i happened across this movie while channel-surfing and it seemed to be yet another poorly- made christian film about the end times (which i find rather entertaining because they take themselves so seriously). to be fair, i only saw the last 30 minutes, so i missed the part about ufos and the sci-fi stuff. but it was long enough for me to categorize it as an embarrassing and appalling representation of the christian faith, as well as a rather pathetic film in any artistic sense.<br /><br />as a film, the script was terrible, the acting was mediocre, and the pacing was poor. the cinematography and direction were sub-par: no interesting visuals, no layered plot line, no creativity. don't just blame it on the budget- films can still be interesting without special effects. this wasn't. christian films cannot excuse their mediocrity and unoriginality in the artistic sphere just because of their message. and the message here was hardly "christian."<br /><br />**disclaimer: the rest of this comment is targeted towards christians**<br /><br />first off, it is unethical in any business to bait-and-switch your customers. i don't like being told i can win a free ipod only to realize i have to spend $300 at participating stores first. nonchristians don't like being told they're watching a sci-fi film and then get bombarded with christian propaganda that has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. hidden agendas don't win you any friends, much less converts. <br /><br />secondly, you should not use overt threats to convince people your beliefs are true. the actors who represented christians came off as callous, smug bullies when dealing with the skeptical "unbeliever"-- they even go so far as to stage the rapture in order to scare him into believing. representational dialogue: "turn to jesus- or go to hell!" "fine, don't believe me- but you'll be sorry!" "the day you die, i can guarantee you'll wish you paid more attention to this jesus stuff- when you land in the belly of hell!" ok, i may be exaggerating, but it certainly came off in the same manner. if you think this is a "clear message for christ," you're wrong. i don't recall jesus using threats and coercion. and i don't think people can make an authentic decision to believe in him out of fear. so christians, please don't use this as a "witnessing tool" for your "unsaved" friends. it is heavy-handed, offensive, and inaccurate in portraying a true christian message.<br /><br />thirdly, the theology was bad. apart from characterizing jesus as a means of hell-insurance, it gave no room for debate or discussion and didn't attempt to engage the issue of whether ufos or alien life could exist. instead, it offered one pat answer: "ufos are the devil's scheme to deceive people when the rapture happens," which is neither biblical nor widely-accepted by most christians. as the bible doesn't mention ufos or aliens, you can't use it as a source to draw conclusions one way or the other. the rapture isn't necessarily even a widely-accepted, sound biblical concept, though nowadays most evangelical christians seem to believe it because of a popular book series. if you do your research (as so many of the supportive reviewers are suggesting), the idea of two comings of christ (the first as the rapture) is a relatively new phenomena in church tradition, popularized by some traveling evangelists around the turn of the 20th century. the majority of orthodox christians will probably find this film's message to be a pretty big stretch that rests on a lot of unsupported presuppositions.<br /><br />basically, this film misses the mark both as a worthwhile piece of entertainment and as an accurate representation of christianity and its beliefs. i wouldn't recommend it.
