i thought sliver offered the most boring and trivial "trick" ending in movie history, but of course i was wrong. i had no disillusions that this movie was going to be good. unfortunately, it was worse than i expected. the worst part is that the obvious ending is so ridiculous and horrible that you can't believe it until it actually happens.
