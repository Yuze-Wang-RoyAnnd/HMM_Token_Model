this movie is overrated, to say the least. it's not good as a comedy, and it's not good as a "serious" film either. the pacing is far too plodding for the former, and there is too much lame slapstick for the latter. the only laughs come from some of bud spencer's reaction shots when he becomes exasperated by his brother's behavior. the dubbing is excellent but the full-screen framing is appalling.
