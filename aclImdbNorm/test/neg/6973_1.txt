whew! what can one say about this bizarre, stupefying mock-u-mentory about ed wood's cross-dressing fantasies?? well, one word that comes to mind is incoherent! wood uses raw slabs of innocuous, incidental stock footage, and then builds a "story" around them - and what a story!! wood himself stars as glen, a regular joe who just happens to enjoy lounging around in his fiancee's lingerie and sweaters. i think what wood wanted was a plea for tolerance for all the glens of this world by showing that glen is just like all of us underneath, only in angora. ummm...ok. but then, we get this very bizarre montage of some horny devil, a chick in bondage, some rude, pointing people, some moore stock footage, and finally an emaciated bela lugusi,playing some kind of twisted, invalid puppetmaster. lugosi is a howl, spouting out such rubbish as "beeevaaare...the beeeg greeeen dragon that seeets at your doorstep: he eeeets leeetle boys, puppydog tails, and beeeeeg snails!" um, ok, bela... :=8/ there is a strange, twisted type of wood logic going on here. afterall, he does remind us that "7 out of 10 men wear hats, and 7 out of 10 men are bald". hmmm, must be that alien/cross-dressing/habidashery cowspiracy-thang!! glen or glenda stars a plethora (whatever that is...) of reliable wood schlock-actors, including lyle talbot, delores fuller, and timothy farrell, and wood manages to coax every bit of wretched, amateurish non-talent out of each one. everybody by now knows bela's sad story: by the time wood used him for this flic, he was probably jonesing for another fix and needed the moolah, but even for him this is depth heretofore unreached. one of the moocow's favorite wood mooments comes with the stock footage charging buffalo scene - it is sooo loopily demented!! the moocow says "puuuull de schtriiiiings", and git yer hooves on a copy of glen or glenda - you won't believe it! :
