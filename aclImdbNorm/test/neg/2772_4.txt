what i liked best about this flick was the chance to see joan woodbury, who awe-struck me as one of the several beauties in the charles boyer classic "algiers", in a leading role. she does well as rita, an orphan who rises to make good as a lady crime boss. her ascent to the top reminds me of joan crawford's characters, e.g. mildred pierce, who realize their ambitions by fierce determination and willpower. if you're looking for a film noir classic, better look elsewhere. at several points, it's difficult to know where this story is going. i first got the impression that it was going to encompass rita's plot for revenge against the father and son who tricked her into taking the rap for a drunk driving death perpetrated by the playboy son. but payback time ended up being only a minor point, and a springboard to the somewhat confusing second part of the film, where rita becomes increasingly involved in city corruption. anyway, it's only 72 minutes, so a second viewing should clear up any haziness. my copy is from a platinum box set called "mobster movies". the picture quality is good, but the soundtrack sucks, constantly skipping fragments of dialog. there are eight films in the $5.50 box, making each movie a fair 69 cents. look for anne archer's father, john archer, as rita's childhood friend bob. alan ladd doesn't get much screen time. it's definitely joan woodbury's picture.
