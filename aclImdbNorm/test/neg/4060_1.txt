[warning: some spoilers included, though it is a documentary.]<br /><br />i bought this documentary because i like the work of the directors d.a. pennebaker and chris hegedus, which includes moon over broadway, startup.com and the war room., all terrific documentaries i would highly recommend. watching this ultimately boring and uninsightful account from depeche mode's 1988 tour, i realized they had nothing to work with when they went to edit this film together. the band members were certainly less than forthcoming on-camera; hence, undoubtedly, the contest to add fans on a one-week bus trip was added to liven things up a bit. really, now, i mean, c'mon. who thought a concert film of a synth-pop band with three keyboardists and a singer would be a good idea? granted, i like depeche mode's music, and martin gore writes good melodies, but seeing them in concert never seemed like it would be interesting, and this movie is proof positive. unless you are a huge fan of depeche mode, stay away from this documentary....it's a complete waste of time.
