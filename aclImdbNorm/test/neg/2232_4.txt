if regarded as an independent feature i can't say it's too bad at all but from where i'm standing this sequel and the original "lady and the tramp" don't agree with each other! they are two completely different movies with different style, different voice personalities, different narratives and about the only thing that they share with each other is the visuals (e.g. the town-house of jim dear, darling, lady and tramp) and none of those have changed.<br /><br />if you're seeking any kind of continuity years after the release of the original for those memorable songs like "bella notte" and "the siamesse cats song" this sequel won't give you any at all! just about every song has a little pop to it and those good old characters like jock and trusty, jim dear and darling and aunt sarah and her cats may well be seen but they're seeming to be somehow replaced by new characters, not to mention peg not appearing at all, whose voices are quite annoying. even lady and tramp don't appear often enough and as for scamp?! he is so spoilt! and treats his father tramp with utter disrespect, then runs away with no remorse even after hearing how much he's being missed at home! and they called his shameless getaway an adventure! i'd say scott wolf truly brought out the abusive bad boy in scamp wiping out the typical cute disney animal. even the old characters just drive you mad in this; trusty sounds like goofy sick in bed, jock (jeff-stupid-bennett) - and his voice - sound neither scottish nor worth hearing! zap him off as far as possible to free our poor ears from his voice and as for the dumb, feather-brained, exasperating junkyard dogs!!!!!! somebody put them down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />"lady and the tramp 2" isn't completely bad if you're not already having a tough day but i expect a lot more charm from a sequel to a true classic - scamp is chavvy, so is his girlfriend angel and there is a feeble storyline. still, i think you should try it at least once because, as i say, there are much worse movies around.
