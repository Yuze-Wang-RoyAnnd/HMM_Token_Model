mr seagal has apparantly lowered his (already low) standards even more and has now outdone himself in making bad movies. the foreigner has no substance what so ever in the script. it's director has made an even worse job and the music and score is so cheezy and malplaced that you just don't know whether to laugh or cry. already 10 minutes into the movie, you just want to turn it off. however, considering steven seagal's past movies, you think 'hey, there might be some cool action-sequences at least worth watching...' ...you are wrong! it only gets worse as the movie progresses. everyone (with a few exceptions) seem to kill every person that they talk to, good or bad, innocent or not. the only good thing with the movie is that it that it has an end and that it has a rather short running time. summing the movie up in two words: stay away!
