this morning, i found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed. i found myself thinking, "oh yeah, there was a mr. magoo movie, wasn't there?" this is more surprising because i remember following the controversy surrounding this movie (advocacy group for the visually impaired said that this movie was demeaning). i even went to see this movie on the day it opened, because i am a fan of both mr. magoo, and mr. nielson, and thought he would be an excellent choice to play mr. magoo. i even remember the opening animated credits, because i thought that they were pretty amusing.<br /><br />after that, though, its all a complete blank. i think its a pretty sad statement about any movie that it is so lame, so bland, and so utterly without merit that you can't remember anything from it. i understand that leslie nielson isn't always known for appearing in first class comedies, but i saw him in "spy hard," in "scary movie 4," and "police squad 3" and none of these were great movies, but i came away at least remembering *something*. mr. magoo, though, is a complete blank.<br /><br />i find myself wondering now if all the controversy surrounding the film wasn't actually generated by the studio that produced it, in the hopes of generating at least some small amount of interest in an otherwise totally worthless movie.
