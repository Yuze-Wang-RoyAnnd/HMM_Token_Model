i got this movie from the library, and saw it had a lot of actors i like in it(john cleese, ian holm, ralph richardson, etc), so i got it and watched it. i expected cleese to have a large role since he had first billing, i was surprised to find out that he had about five minutes of screen time, along with everyone else i liked. this movie is amazingly pointless, the characters are nobodies, the plot is non-existent, and the ending is one of the worst endings i have ever seen. there were a few funny parts, but that's about it. stay away from this movie if you want to prevent going "what?" and "huh?", a lot. and if you don't want to waste your time. ignore the people who say this is a very funny movie...it isn't. just stay away from it at all costs...please.
