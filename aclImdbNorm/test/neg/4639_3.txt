the new celebrity deathmatch is terrible. they kill off the popular people and make the low budget celebs win. i mean...andy milonakis? lil' flip? lil flip and lil wayne should of both died.lil' flip sucks. the fight between lil' jon and lil' bow wow and lil flip was mad corny and short. they should of just kill off all of them. why did tobey lose to jake and christian lose to adam? they are better actors and superheroes. they also spend too much time on talking rather than fighting which can bore the viewers. everything seems rushed for some reason, they can't just make a long fight? the old deathmatch is way better.
