ben affleck, about to be married, is shaken up by a plane accident and gets involved with one of the other passengers (sandra bullock, forcing herself to act insane). who is to blame for this inept, ugly morass? it is so badly edited, when i looked in the credits it wasn't to read the editor's name--it was to see if the person actually took the credit! rife with clich'es, contrivances, and sandra bullock in raccoon eye-makeup, the movie doesn't even concern itself with creating chemistry between the two main characters. laughs are non-existent: the scene in the gay bar with affleck might have gotten a big laugh if it weren't so stupid (the bar patrons--a big rowdy bunch of them!--shout for affleck to strip and start digging out their cash). it's not supposed to have any significance other than getting ben to loosen up a little, but the direction of the whole scene is wrong-headed, and the outcome is unseen because the idiot editor cuts away...or was that all the film he had? it's a small moment but it's typical of this film, an amateurish piece of pop-goods that wants to be an edgy modern comedy but doesn't have any guts. it is tailor-made for the bottom shelf at your video store. * from ****
