this movie is awful. at first i thought it may appeal to children, due to the cuddly ewoks, the fury little people from stars wars. after sitting through this monstrosity of a movie, i am certain that not even a 4-year-old would find this movie interesting. the special effects are by far the best of this movie and compare well for other 80ies tv movies. the script is bad, the actors, especially aubree miller and unbelievably bad and the flick is so predictable that i still can't believe i was able to not touch the forward button on my vcr. however, i came close to switching this mess off more than once.
