this tale of the upper-classes getting their come-uppance and wallowing in their high-class misery is like a contemporary mid-sommerish version of an old joan crawford movie in which she suffered in mink. here, people behave in a frightfully civilized manner in the face of adversity. a well-heeled london solicitor, (tom wilkinson), discovers that not only is his wife having an affair with the local gentry but that she has also killed their housekeeper's husband in a hit-and-run accident. he throws up, but otherwise his stiff-upper-lip hardly quavers.<br /><br />written and directed by julian fellowes, who won an oscar for writing "gosford park", (this is his directorial debut), from a novel by nigel balchin, it's quite comical although i am not sure how much of the comedy is intended. it's like a throw-back to british films of the forties where characters all behaved like characters in books or plays rather than like people might in real life. however, it's not all bad. wilkinson is terrific, even if you never believe in him as a person while emily watson, (the adulterous wife), and rupert everett, (the highly amoral high-class totty), are both very good at covering the cracks in the material. tony pierce-roberts' cinematography ensures that no matter how hard it is on the ear it's always good on the eye.
