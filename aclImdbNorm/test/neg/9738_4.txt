perhaps it's just me, but this movie seemed more like sequel or follow-up than the separate project. why? when it was filmed (just few years after the war) most of the viewers probably knew why rommel was so famous, why his death was so important to allied, why he was hitler's favorite general, but now, 50 years later, it isn't so obvious anymore.<br /><br />"desert fox: the story of rommel" is a decent war movie, but it's just isn't in any way explained how rommel did get his nickname, what was he doing that allied considered him as their best general, why their soldiers were so afraid of afrika korps? that's what is missing in this movie - we see his fame, his character, his way to treat soldiers and enemies, but f.e. we also see that hitler was complaining about his achievements in africa, calling him coward, etc. so, we're missing the big picture here - it is "the story of rommel", but unfortunately the "desert fox" part is missing.
