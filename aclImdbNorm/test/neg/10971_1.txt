this film takes a lot of liberties with the known historical facts.even little things like flynn licking one stamp after another, when he almost certainly would have used a moistened sponge, is one of the annoying things. flynn was never tried of manslaughter or murder. he is not known to have caught his mother making love to another man, and is not known to have had an homosexual relationship with anybody, and he did not end up on skid row in sydney. he did not get his twopenny-halfpenny role in in the wake of the bounty by imposture and this role did not turn him into a well-dressed film star. <br /><br />this is just a mediocre film where the name of errol flynn has been tacked on just to sell more tickets and more videos.
