i thought maybe a film which boasted a cast including peter o'toole, susannah york, michael craig & harry andrews might be worth watching. alas, i was wrong. utter pretentious nonsense from beginning to end with both o'toole and york overacting wildly. i watched it twice and still have no idea what is was about. i've a feeling o'toole plays the laird of a scottish castle who has a drink problem and likes reliving childhood games with his sister (york). he is also barking mad. but apart from that, your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />the film has no redeeming feature whatsoever. i can only assume the cast and director were blackmailed into making this dreary, unimaginative, stagy piffle. clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director. risible.
