i have been collecting iron man comics since the early 70s and always enjoyed the character who is far far from the average clean cut hero and his many and varied enemies. there have been no less than three attempts at an animated series for iron man and only the original and part of the second have ever done the character justice. so i was somewhat hopeful that this newest version would be good. boy was i wrong! the dvd art is very misleading and presents an image that is not the movie. fist off the good, what little there is... the art and animation are well drawn and the writing and dialog are generally good, though with notable exceptions. character voices are very well selected and each character is distinctive and well acted. now for the bad... unfortunately the writers opted to totally screw around with both iron man's origin and especially the mandarin's. on top of that they decided to do iron man and his opponents all in cgi. bad cgi. this makes them stand out almost as badly as live actors would in a cartoon. the cg work is often repetitive and glaring shortcuts are taken at times. the cg battles are clumsy as well, further enhancing the fact that cg and line animation do not mix well. the movie would certainly have fared better had they opted to actually draw all the characters. another problem is that iron man is in his traditional red and gold suit for all of one battle! and its not even the big fight at the end. all this drags the movie down and it never picks up.<br /><br />************ spoilers (or warnings) may follow ************<br /><br />the movie starts off with an interestingly unusual stop motion credit sequence of machinery, welding and gears. then we are introduced to what looks like a chinese temple in the process of being restored, and prominent is a statue of what fans will recognize as the mandarin. things go strangely, impeding progress in restoring the temple. overseeing it is james rhodes, tony stark's long time friend. seems they plan to actually raise the temple up from the earth, despite opposition by a group who insist that raising the temple will bring about a terrible disaster. rhodes is captured in a raid. stark, shown in a hot tub with a lovely lady, is informed of the problems and sets out to personally oversee the project and rescue his friend while in the background his father deals with board executives who are pushing to have tony removed. tony arrives only to have his armored escort ambushed and blown to pieces. tony later awakens mortally wounded in the heart and a prisoner of the rebels. he is saved only by quick action from rhodes and a scientist. eventually stark must build the prototype gray iron armor and makes good an escape, but only after some loss of life. while with the rebels he meets a troubled girl named li mei, and the two fall in love. the temple is raised and four elemental beings (all done in cg) appear and proceed to start collecting hidden rings of power. stark and rhody find trouble back home but manage to confront the elementals without success in really stopping them, first using the aquatic armor, then the more classic red and gold armor and finally everything returns to the temple and stark is back in the bulky gray armor for a final showdown and a run in with what may be fin fang foom (also in cg.) here the story takes a major twist as it turns out that the mandarin needs a host body to manifest. this leads to a somewhat tragic final battle marred by the fact that the mandarin is little more than a ghost and isn't seen till the last 5 minutes of the movie. ugh...<br /><br />if you are an iron man fan then you will likely not enjoy this outing. and even non-fans may well find the movie somewhat lacking or not.
