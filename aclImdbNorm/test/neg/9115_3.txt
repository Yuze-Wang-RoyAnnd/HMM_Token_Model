the setup for "nature of the beast" is ingeniously simple, and fraught with limitless potential for suspense: harried salesman jack (a very domesticated lance henriksen) picks up trouble in the form of hitchhiker adrian (eric roberts), who seems to be in possession of incriminating information against jack. oh, and over a million dollars has been stolen from a casino and someone dubbed 'hatchet man' is dismembering people in the desert. sounds great, right? sort of like "the hitcher" meets "psycho." one or both of these men has a secret, and nothing is as it seems! well, unfortunately, writer-director victor salva (of "jeepers creepers" and "powder" fame) doesn't have enough ideas to keep the movie going, the scenario arouses no tension or suspense (poison for what is supposedly a 'thriller'), and the inclusion of an underlying homo-erotic tone seems out-of-place. henriksen evokes an unusual, not-quite-earthbound everyman (even sporting an ample gut), but roberts is about as threatening and scary as an extra in "death wish 3"; we're never sucked in to the point where we actually care about what's happening, and the conclusion slides into improbable territory (i kept thinking it was going to be "fight club" all over again, but i was mistaken). too bad. "nature of the beast" could have been something else...instead of nothing else.
