i have seen this film 3 times. mostly because i kept thinking while watching it, "have i missed something here?". is there some reason this film was made? was it trying to say something and i just missed it? well after 3 viewings i failed to come up with an answer.<br /><br />i guess the worst thing i can say about any film is that it bored me, and i did not finish it. i will admit there is plenty of eye candy and fast editing and hip music to keep my attention all the way through but is that all a movie should be? <br /><br />i am not against extreme violence, it is almost non-stop, but it seems there should be some sort of inspiration. something that is highlighted by it. the word gratuitous comes to mind but it is worse then that somehow. in the first part of the film we are all given insights into the motivations of the characters. and yes the 3 principles are very good in their roles. but the roles are completely unbelievable. so in the first part we get to know the characters, and in the second part most of em die and use sadistic glee in killing others. that seems to be the whole movie. and the first part has nothing to do with the second.<br /><br />for example. how could a nice smart guy like zed agree to join a bunch of junkies and amateurs to do a job like this? it makes no sense. he is portrayed as smart, yet he goes ahead with this suicide mission. the fact that he survives is totally inconsistent with the rest of the hyper-real violence and mayhem. so what are we watching here a hollywood romance with a happy ending or a super real, super violent blood bath? i recall having the same reaction to two other films this director was involved with: true romance and reservior dogs.<br /><br />needless dreck!
