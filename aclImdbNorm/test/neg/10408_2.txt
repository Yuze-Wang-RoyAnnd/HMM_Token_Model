whomever thought of having sequels to iron eagle must be shot. in this case once was enough. iron eagle was a good movie to watch. even though it is unrealistic, it is still entertaining. iron eagle ii has a senseless plot and can be used to as a cure to insomnia. i didn't even bother to watch iron eagle iii, but from looking at the r rating, i assume it's more violent than the past 2 movies. well, iron eagle iv is probably the most inane sequel. lou gossett jr. returns as the always delightful "chappy" sinclair. another jason returns to fill the role of doug masters (canadian jason cadieux, who looks just like jason gedrick from the first iron eagle). but wait(here comes a possible spoiler).....wasn't doug killed in iron eagle ii? the writers must've been desprate for a story so they revived doug masters by saying he was a prisoner of the russians. this movie was the cheapest done of all the iron eagle films. why do movie makers find it neccessary to make sequels to unappealing movies? (ex. police academy movies). i have always liked gossett jr.'s work in these films. he was the only one holding this turkey together. let's hope this was the last of the iron eagle sequels. let it rest in peace.
