i remember thinking that due to the cast, the subject matter, and the director, i was going to love this movie.<br /><br />stepping into the theatre and taking my seat, i was like a giddy schoolgirl as my anticipation for the opening scene built.<br /><br />i was not disappointed with the opening and felt that i was truly going to love this movie.<br /><br />if you haven't seen the movie and feel that anything that gives away scenes might be seen as a spoiler, please stop reading. i'm not going to give away anything really important, but it might be seen as such, so that is the warning.<br /><br />spoiler may be included below, beware.<br /><br />i think that the first scene that really hit me as just utterly ridiculous was the russian space station scene. i mean honestly, refueling a shuttle with no real prior warning, and then to simply show the station as being so fragile that a simple little mistake can cause the entire thing to just explode.<br /><br />while all of this is possible, it seemed to me to be way over the top. i'm not sure if it was just the situation or if it was the cheesy acting, the silly view of the russian technology, or just the campy attitude of the scene itself.<br /><br />it only got worse for me after that because then we endure what seemed like 2 hours of constant super loud explosions in space...you know, that place where there is no sound because it's a vacuum.<br /><br />but the coup de grace for me, honestly, was the gun scene. (spoiler possibility) - earlier in the movie, we see bruce willis tearing apart their land vehicle (the vehicle that they will use to drive around in when they get there and to help them drill) when he is told that this is what they will be using. he is taking pieces off and complaining about it because much of what's on it is heavy and not required for what they are doing.<br /><br />so then, as we are wandering onto the asteroids, we see that they have opted to add a massive gatling like gun to the vehicles...you know, standard nasa fare is to have heavy weaponry on all space missions in case, you know, aliens or something.<br /><br />i could have taken the explosive 2 hours, the silly russian space station refueling scene, the cheesy love scene near the end, the bruce willis character being nothing more than most of his other past characters, but the steve buscemi going mad and shooting the space vehicle's gun all over the place and causing havoc/damage, well that threw the entire thing over the top for me.<br /><br />save your money and time and avoid this movie. if you want a good meteor movie, see deep impact, if you want a fun space movie with awesome special effects, see space cowboys, but no matter what, avoid this flick.
