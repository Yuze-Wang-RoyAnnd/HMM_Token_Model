i really don't know why i'm writting this. i think most people agree that this movie is bad. well, let me say this:<br /><br />when i first get done watching some movies, i like them. then as time goes on, my opinion changes about the movie. this happened with end of days. i liked it the first time i saw it. i thought it was entertaining. but, a few weeks later, my opinion has changed. so, to resolve this, i watched it again at a friends house. well, it's bad.<br /><br />i'm a logic person. if i see a logic hole in a movie, i try to ignore it. if i see two, then i start to get annoyed. more than two and i'm p***ed off. end of days made me p***ed off after my second viewing.<br /><br />first off, the movie is a bit depressing. everything about it is sad. everything from arnold's acting to the movie's colors. but dark looking movies don't bother me, but some thing else did...<br /><br />if satan can regenerate his wounds, how can you possible kill him in his mortal form? if you shoot him, his skin grows back. if you cut off his head, a new one should pop back up. so question: what's the point of even trying to kill him? i'll tell you why: because this is a stupid movie that has a recycled villain. this isn't the devil my friends. this is a human being reminescent of those bond villains who give away there entire scheme to the hero.<br /><br />like i said it's worth a look, but don't see it twice, because it's crap.
