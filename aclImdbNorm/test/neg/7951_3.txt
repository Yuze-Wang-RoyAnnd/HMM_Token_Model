have you ever watched a film, when after it's conclusion, your left pondering what in the world it was all about? well, say hello to "scream, baby, scream". it's not that the story's complex or anything like that, it's just that it plays out in three completely different modes...1. a fun 60s drug movie...2. a much overplayed soap opera...and 3. a horror flick (with very little to "scream" about). much to my surprise, i've found out that it was written by one of my all-time favorites, larry cohen. well, i guess even the best have to learn through trial and error.<br /><br />playing out much like something from h.g. lewis(only with lesser fx), this "bad" film does have it's perks. for most of it's short running time there's a pretty cool jazz score to be heard, and there are a couple of memorable scenes...one of those being where a group of kids decide to experiment with acid and take a nice long motor bike ride to the zoo. the camera tricks the director uses to indicate their hallucinatory state is just plain retarded, but amusing. trust me when i tell you, there's no need to run out of the house to catch this one!
