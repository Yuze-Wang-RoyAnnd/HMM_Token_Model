this is another film i missed out on italian tv as a kid: notable for its quintet of ageing stars, most of whom had never made a horror film in their life (fred astaire, melvyn douglas, douglas fairbanks jr., john houseman and patricia neal), it deals with the men's long-concealed past crime coming back to haunt them. it takes the form of a ghostly dead-ringer for the girl they all loved (alice krige) but whom they were forced to dispose of after an unfortunate incident when she humiliated their egos! fairbanks, who was the one responsible for the deed, has twin sons (craig wasson) and so krige directs her revenge upon them as well. soon one of the latter, fairbanks himself and even douglas and houseman all wind up dead. therefore, the remaining wasson and astaire decide to confront the ghost at the scene of the crime where they also have to contend with a couple of sinister tramps who somehow do krige's bidding! i was looking forward to seeing these veterans on their last legs (douglas died before the film had even premiered though, by that time, he had already completed another role, while it proved astaire's own inauspicious swan-song) but ghost story went through too many changes of mood - while maintaining a sluggish pace throughout and emerging overlong into the bargain - to be anything but a failed curio. having dollops of sex (including full-frontal nudity from wasson!) and gruesome make-up effects muddled the waters all the more and marred the old-fashioned elegance inherent in jack cardiff's (another notable of long-standing) cinematography.
