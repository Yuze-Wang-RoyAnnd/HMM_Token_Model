this is the most boring, pretentious, and stupid film i have seen in a long time. i saw it at the academy in beverly hills, and there were quite a few people in the lobby who had left the screening and were seeking refuge there. all were solemnly shaking their heads and looking as though they had been to a funeral. what a waste of time and money. even worse are the critics who gave this pretentious blimp good reviews. what's with them? are they just afraid they won't be considered "hip"? were they bribed? this film is staggeringly bad. don't take a date to it expecting to have an in-depth chat at the cheesecake factory afterwards. if going to see this film was your idea, she'll browbeat you and hold it over you the rest of your life.
