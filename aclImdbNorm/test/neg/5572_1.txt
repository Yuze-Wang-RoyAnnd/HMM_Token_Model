rented(free rental thank goodness) this as supposedly filmed in ct where i live....could have been filmed in a tunnel for all that matter! dark ninety percent of time, and just an awful attempt at a low budget flick, which can be good if done right. in a nutshell about a bunch of young adults who witness meteor fall, and subsequently fall prey to aliens on a lighthouse island, assisted by keeper and wife. analysis:<br /><br />- acting = dreadful<br /><br />- writing = uninspired<br /><br />- story = done a million times before with different settings<br /><br />- production values = okay (lighting) for budget<br /><br />- effects (creature, digital, other) horrible,very cheap looking<br /><br />so, you get the gist of it. to add insult to injury, end credits has bloopers of filming - really now......who cares! distributed under a universal company, shocked they would even do so after viewing.<br /><br />finally as alternative, try "creep". low budget, but well written, well acted, and fairly, well, creepy!
