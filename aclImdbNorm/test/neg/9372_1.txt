eliza dushku is a very talented and beautiful actress. she manages to be the rock-steady centre of "tru calling" but that's not enough to rescue her tv series from mediocrity. it's a real shame that a woman as attractive and talented as dushku should go from a meaty supporting role in "buffy the vampire slayer" to this clunker. <br /><br />unoriginal and desperately trying to be hip, "tru calling" fails to excite on any level above hormonal. the eponymous heroine spends a lot of her time running hither and yon across what must be a very small city, in order to avert the deaths of good-looking corpses-to-be that she's already met in the mortuary where she works. despite all the running she does, she always arrives looking like she's just stepped out of a portable air-conditioned dressing room. <br /><br />in every episode, eliza dushku and the rest of the cast struggle to breath life into the bland, characterless screenplays but it's a pointless exercise. "tru calling" just lies on the slab, gazing lifelessly at the ceiling.
