is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this? there's a bunch of apes wandering about, mumbling b******, acting supposedly silly and we are supposed to laugh? there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place. even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep. beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period! i can't believe there's even a sequel to this!<br /><br />1
