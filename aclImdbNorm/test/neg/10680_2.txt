as main "character" lillith silver likes to point out - "you know f**k all about vampires". it is evident that this statement was aimed at the cast and crew, who create an exceedingly bad image of everyone's favourite bloodsucking undead. according to the misguided director, vampires are all caked in white foundation and crammed into latex similar to a piece of meat in shrink wrap. with fangs resembling bannana's and a bad case of asthma our main character lillith creates a slapstick caricature of the "modern day" vampire.<br /><br />the plot consists of a 9 year old boys' playstation collection jotted down on a piece of paper, then blended together to concoct this horrible tale. lillith our pale protagonist is a vampire bounty hunter who makes a living from snubbing out members of everyone's favourite cult, the illuminati! rather than incorporate the classic assassin methodology of stealth and precision however, lillith waltzes in through an open window and then proceeds to chomp her targets necks before shooting them point blank with a handgun (that apparently doesn't leave bullet holes thanks to the shoddy continuity). pc plod is then assigned to solve the murders, he comes to the grizzly, yet strikingly obvious conclusion that lillith is actually a vampire and proceeds to hunt her down armed with the usual vampire dispatching tools including a cross, garlic and a sharpened piece of wood. meanwhile, lillith, who has gotten into the habit of bonking her boss, is distraught when an old nemesis kidknaps him and demands a ransom to be delivered personally. as you may imagine, this doesn't go according to plan. i'm not going to put myself through the pain of the following scenes however, so i'll skip to the end. lillith and her "nemesis" have a showdown, and after lillith obtains victory it is then revealed, with all the extravagance of someone being told they have cancer, that the two are century old lovers and the whole plot was some kind of twisted game. yes, that kick in the balls was the actual ending of the film. in my eyes, this joke of a conclusion is the icing on the latex clad cake, and seals this film in the "never ever watch this" vault.<br /><br />as far as cinematic techniques go, the film merely doesn't bother creating any style. the director tries to rescue his disasterpiece from the brink, by throwing in some close ups and a few multi-angular shots, this however is not the saving grace the film needed.<br /><br />you may be screaming "but this is a b movie, its meant to be crap!". i however do not take pity. i have seen some cracking b movies, such as evil dead 2, and jesus christ vampire hunter, and therefore this disgrace cannot hide behind excuses. the budget was low, this is obvious by the lack of location and good actors. maybe however if the director was more creative and spent less money on paying for makeup and fake blood, he could have done something decent with this sickening attempt. the seedy sex scenes are not beneficial in any way and merely served to give me a few chuckles at the obscene acting skills throughout. half the budget must have been paid to the female cast merely for getting their tops off for lesbian romps. if i wanted to watch a vampire porno, i would have bought muffy the vampire layer.<br /><br />the cast are bad, the story is worse and the effects are cripplingly fake. this film had some potential, however its seedy undertone and embarrassing portrayal of a classic horror character merely served to be its downfall.<br /><br />if you want a laugh with a few friends, i recommend you watch this mockery. if you are looking for a more serious vampire action flick, try blade or underworld to sooth your raging bloodlust.
