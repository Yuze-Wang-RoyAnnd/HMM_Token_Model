a great cast, a fantastic cgi monster and a brilliant script. if this film had had any of those things then it might not have been amongst the worst films i've ever wasted an hour and a half on. infinite chimpanzees with infinite typewriters have not yet written the complete works of shakespeare but along the way this has appeared in their waste-paper bin and somehow it got made into a movie. you can tell the the actors regret signing those contracts with every word they mutter directly into camera. the cgi is amateurish in the extreme and they might have created more tension of the cast had been attacked with the sinclair spectrum it was created on. i wanted to like this film, it has nice cameo appearances by gil gerard and walter koenig so i expected a fun horror movie that didn't take itself too seriously. it actually does try to take itself seriously but is about as much fun as trip to the dentist. do yourself a favour. don't watch this movie, you'll only encourage them to make more.
