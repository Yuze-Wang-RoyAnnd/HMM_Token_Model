i bought this because it was $1.99 and harry carey was in it and a friend of mine was in it, and for $1.99, how bad could it be? then i read some comments here on the film and began to get excited -- maybe this really was a lost gem, one of those terrific little b-movies everyone had forgotten about but which deserved to be resurrected. wrong! i'm not sure how anyone else can give this thing the praise it got from some quarters here, but i found it one of the most tedious and blatantly bathos-filled movies i've ever seen. and i'm not talking about richard carlson's hokey texas accent (straight from the georgia part of texas, i guess). it's just dumb. no one in the film behaves like a real human being. no one. and no one does anything believable or interesting. it's not even a clich'e-fest. it's just 80-something minutes of frames going by. it even managed to make harry carey, maria ouspenskaya, and c. aubrey smith boring. now that's unbelievable.
