this movie really sucks, sucks really really hard, this movie should be in the bottom 100, but it is so bad that almost nobody has seen it to vote for her so many times that it should be at the same time of "manos - the hands of fate." i should have him position 1 (awful), but the reason for which i put him 2 was for eve, the girl of the town that, besides some scenes of nudity, besides, i thought of voting for 3, but like they killed eve, i returned at 2. it is that movies like this they should not be financed by anybody, since not even they took to the fame or other productions to the actors main, great falsehood, jaja, the history of a mining ghost that kills to "mansalva" and after they put an end to their misdeeds, it reappears, because with the end they shitted it very ugly. <br /><br />final score (vote): 2 (for the nudity and the performance of the beautiful eve)
