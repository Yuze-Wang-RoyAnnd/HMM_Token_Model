a by-the-numbers exorcism exercise with a disappointing non-allegiance and usage of the term 'blackwater.' the cinematography appears right out of basic cable mow land which removes any semblance of swampy, murky atmosphere from the proceedings. in addition, there's not nearly enough gore, sex or attractive young things to satiate the majority of the film's targeted viewers. that being said, the lead actress who plays the possessed has a sexy olive-skinned presence. what else needs to be said about this non-winner? don't rent unless you've got a thing for middle-aged adults bemoaning their past and rants with clich'ed priests, shrinks, hispanic stablemen all regretting their past actions.
