this feels very stilted and patronizing to a great extent. the whole plot is extremely forced - especially the "gallant" effort to save the college from ruin, and the moralistic overtone (especially by the leading lady) grates a bit.<br /><br />but there are one or two comic moments that do help relieve the boredom, and the dancing is quite fun (especially for alleged amateurs - ha, ha!)<br /><br />the shop proprietor and the young guy doing spectacular tap dancing were particular highlights. and i liked peter hayes impressions of charles laughton and ronald coleman as well.
