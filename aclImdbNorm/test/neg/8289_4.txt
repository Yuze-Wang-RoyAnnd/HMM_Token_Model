high school female track star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community in an uproar against coach george michaels(christopher george playing him as a major butt-head who is very demanding of the athletes under his watch). he'll be canned after school lets out providing the flick with his motive as a possible killer. some twisted psychopath in sweats(much the same as what michaels is often seen wearing), using a stop watch to time his executions, murders the members of the track team the dead female runner was a part of. soon disturbed parents call principal guglione(michael pataki)wondering why their children didn't come home after a prom party. inspector halliday(carmen argenziano)begins snooping around campus at worried parents' request. instantly a beleaguered michaels becomes a prime suspect after the body of a gymnast is found in a locker. ensign anne(patch mackenzie)returned home from her base in guam to receive her dead track sister's diploma and soon confronts the killer herself in the climactic chase scene. kevin badger(e danny murphy)is the weary boyfriend of the lost track star.<br /><br />rather leisurely paced slasher spreads out the death sequences quite a bit trying to mix humor within and rather failing miserably. low-quality kill sequences only increase the laughter such as a sword embedded within a football thrown into the stomach of a football player or a pair of garden shears used to behead a poor soul taking a leak. linnea quigley has an amusing role as horny student dolores who sleeps with her music teacher for a higher grade and always chases after a male stud(the recipient of the garden shears before he has a chance to bed dolores outside of the prom party). vanna white has an early role here as a ditsy blonde who discovers the dead gymnast's body in the locker. virgil frye has a silly role as an inept officer.
