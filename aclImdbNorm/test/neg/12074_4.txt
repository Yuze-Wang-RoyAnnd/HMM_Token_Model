this film follows the life of a great guitar player, who wants to make it big but acts irresponsibly almost to the point of self destruction.<br /><br />i was expecting the usual woody allen witty dialogs, sarcasm and humour, but "sweet and lowdown" failed to provide any. the main character, emmet ray, is an egocentric, rude, irresponsible and hurtful man. he is so unlikeable, that i do not want to now about him, or care about him. i wonder why a film about him has to be made. the pacing of the story is slow, making the film a terrible bore. even sean penn's great acting fails to revive the film to a watchable level.<br /><br />i like woody allen's films a lot, but "sweet and lowdown" is a major disappointment.
