what should i say? i only saw this flick for curiosity, and this is truly a shame... i grew up in brittany with stories of celtic legends, and spent 5 years in rennes, the town in which this film is said to take place... shame that not any actor nor camera from this flick ever arrived in rennes. they could at least have chosen a likely town, or a likely forest, but nothing even seem like brittany nor rennes... and calling it a film about celtic legends is really making a fool of the audience. besides those details, it could have been a good film, but it's crap. silly scenario, silly characters and no originality. definitely to avoid.
