this is possibly the worst of the cockney gangster genre that has blighted the british film industry since mockney guy ritchie unleashed lock stock and two badly acted barrels. this "true life" story of carlton leach (who?) has everything that is wrong with this genre, a truly awful script that consists of people screeching "cant", "fahcking cant" and "i'll kill ya, ya fahcking cant" ad nauseum. the acting is uniformly dreadful with the two most recognisable cast members being two former soap stars quite visably out of their depth. for some reason the film assumes we have heard of these people and i can assure you anybody north of essex hasn't, and that we should be interested in some low lifes story. why? this isn't goodfellas despite the blurb on the dvd cover. the story centres around a football hooligan turned bouncer turned gangster who's friends end up getting shot. boo hoo. the fact that these people are totally unsympathetic is the only minor plus for this film. in all of the action scenes it seems that the camera was tied to a piece of string and whirled around while people pretended to fight and the story of somebody most people have never heard of and nothing really interesting happens too is a complete waste of time. people talk about how violent the film is as though it's the sign of a great film and, although many great films have violence in them, this is just an excuse for the fx man to show what he can do. overall this film is a reminder of why the british film industry is defunct and the sooner we stop funding these pathetic abortions the better.
