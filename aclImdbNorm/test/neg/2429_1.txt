it pains me to see an awesome movie turn into some lame, repetitive and lazy series. it is filled with plot holes and the plot is confusing, in a bad way. whoever the prick writers were that decided to turn such a great movie into this garbage should have done some research, instead of filling it with one-liners and hollow new characters, and the classic jokes from the first movie over and over and over and over again. sure they get a little creative, but its like seeing the same episode with a small twist. pretty much like listening to creed, or nickleback. kuzco has to prevent himself from failing, yzma has a complicated plan, but decides to go the easy way to save time and just use a potion, someone questions the monkey and the bug, bucky appears in the background, kuzco flirts with malina, she disses him without sounding like a bitch, yzma disguises herself as "principal amzy" and she calls kronk, and he forgets that she is yzma. i admit, this show does have it's moments. another problem is the fact that yzma looks younger and pacha looks....weird. also, no one can replace david spade and john goodman! their the ones who made kuzco and pacha kuzco and pacha! sorry, but i give this show two thumbs down.
