renting this direct-to-video film, i was not expecting an amazing piece of cinematography. (not to say just because a film is in cinema it will.) only very loosely following the story retold in the epic poem, this film provides a unique take on the tale of monsters and super humans. the general photography can be summarized as conflicted, with its mixture of mediaeval and post-apocalyptic (reminiscent of mad max). with a rock and techno soundtrack to boot, one comes away feeling a bit off. the fight scenes, though unbelievable, are entertaining, and christopher lambert possesses some of the most interesting weapon combinations i have ever seen on film, though often a tad unfathomably inefficient. the special effects used for the monster grendel are surprisingly effective and are one of the few highlights.<br /><br />christopher lambert delivers an average performance as beowulf. it will be nowhere near as memorable as highlander, but at least it wasn't as poor as fortress. the supporting cast is rather neutral.<br /><br />if you're looking for a good action-adventure story with a complex and engaging plot, i would not suggest this film. however, if you want a flick that is of little substance, full of campy battle scenes, and a somewhat predictable plot, find a copy of this.
