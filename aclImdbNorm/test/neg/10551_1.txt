this series and elon gold were being hyped as "the next big thing" in sitcoms for nbc. well, they weren't. dennis farina was terribly miscast as the father in-law. he just seemed so uncomfortable and out of place here. the term, "private 'convo' time!" was supposed to become the "dyno-mite!" catch phrase of the 21st century. well, it wasn't. people were asking then, as they still are today (when his name comes up.), "who the hell is elon gold?" i saw him on an episode of "the mentalist" this evening. i mentioned his name, and my girlfriend asked, "who?" not funny. total waste of airtime. nbc had really high hopes for this show, but it just fell flat.
