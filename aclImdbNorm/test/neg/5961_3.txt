the back of my dvd describes the plot of "el chucabra":after his capture in the wilderness,the legendary bloodthirsty creature chupacabra escapes into the city creating mayhem and panic.as they pursue the deadly beast,an animal control officer and scientist dr starlina davide realize that a vigilante with his own suspicious plan is also tracking the elusive killer for a mysterious research facility run by the diabolical dr goodspeed.this putrid horror flick is somewhat amusing,if you watch it under the influence of alcohol.the script is completely silly,the acting is wooden beyond belief and the direction is amateurish.two rubber chupacabra suits are easily the best thing about this movie.3 out of 10 and that's being extremely kind.
