the plot: a group of young people with ridiculous names (hutch, swink, phineaus, and october)are brought together by the death of their equally ridiculously named friend loomis. after the funeral, they decide to divide up their late friend's belongings. among them is a video game called stay alive. the group decides there's no better way to show their grief than to all partake in a little virtual bloodshed. but the more they play, the more they realize the connection between the game and the death of poor ol' loomis.<br /><br />the production: this film is just another entry into the latest hollywood craze of low-budget pg-13 horror aimed at cashing in on the junior high school crowd. the direction is sloppy to say the least with quick, music video style cuts that make the action difficult to follow. the dialog is so bad that it actually kills brain cells. the plot itself is so full of holes that we never even learn where the game came from or why those who play it die.<br /><br />the idea behind this film, although not entirely original, had some promise. but the poor execution on both sides of the camera make this one big dud.<br /><br />if you've ever got a craving for a "killing someone in a video game makes them dead in real life" horror film take my advice and skip stay alive for the superior brainscan.
