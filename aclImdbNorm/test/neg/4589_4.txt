another awful movie about hockey. i if never watched hockey and saw hollywoods version, i would hate the game. this movie doesn't make canada look that great either. i can laugh at it and not take it too seriously. all the same this movie is awful, with every thing you can put in a 80's movie. in the end don't even watch it on tv. 4/10
