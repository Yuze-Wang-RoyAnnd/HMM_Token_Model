the game of hockey i play and watch has something called "speed" which the actual hockey scenes in this limp movie never even come close to capturing. add to that a storyline that is clich'e, predictable and stupider than stupid with some of the lamest '80s music numbing your senses in every scene and you have "youngblood". oh, keanu as a french canadian, yeah, whatever. gimme dunlop, braden and the hansons anytime... one out of ten.
