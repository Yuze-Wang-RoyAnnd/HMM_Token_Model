this show can most accurately be described as tv bubble-gum: it's chewing, it has a good taste to it, and it lasts a long time. but, like bubble-gum, it can leave a bad taste in your mouth after a few too many chews.<br /><br />this show features very simple questions that take the form of simply games, like hangman, guessing a simple phrase or guessing items on a short list. callers are the contestants, and anybody can play.<br /><br />the questions, though, are terribly easy. there's some techno music pumped into the background that's fashioned into a continuous loop. it never seems to get old, but it never adds much to the show anyway. the hostess, however, regardless of which one that it, is extremely personable, pleasant enough to watch and can make some very amusing facial expressions. i rather enjoy that british woman.<br /><br />but there's nothing to this show. it's simplistic and uncompelling, although it can be entertaining if absolutely nothing else is on.
