this is one of those movies that is so bad it is awesome!!! it has everything an early eighties movie needs: flared pants, big moustaches, chicks with farrah hair, and most importantly, ninjas!!!! i have a few choice moments to recant for you. cole's army buddy has a strange monkey-like face and always seems to speak without moving his jaw. he gets his ass handed to him about every other scene by the thugs wanting his land so he gets drunk through the entire film. at one point his farm workers finally return after being run off by the gangster guy's hired goons and frank, i think his name is frank, is so moved he shouts to the whole group "lets have a cock fight!!" and they all gleefully move to the cock fighting area of the farm to begin the festivities. this is funny on every level possible. whether you take it dirty or literally it still warms my heart. another funny thing is sho kosugi's little grunts and over animated ninja style movements. i remember this dude from when i was a kid and he used to say he was the world's only real ninja (he had ads in martial arts magazines) if i remember correctly. my friends and i were a little ninja crazy during the time this movie came out and i can recall seeing it in the local theater many times. i was wondering as i watched this on starz last night why every sleazy american gangster type always has a stronghold in the phillipines and wears a white steve martin suit. as a matter of fact this guy goes way beyond that in requiring all of his thugs to wear white steve martin suits. there is a scene where it looks like 20 steve martin impersonators are attacking a 1970's sears underwear model (cole). as we wind up for the final battle cole very clumsily breaks into the bad guy's headquarters and is immediately spotted by a secretary who in turn alerts a guard who fires off a round from his pump action shotgun not 30 feet from the bad guys and no one seems to notice or care. cole, wearing a completely white ninja outfit, proceeds to sneakily ascend a staircase then does a flip right into the area where all the bad guys are. the second in charge tells him he didn't need to kill everybody as they were expecting him, then gives him a ride to the bad guys huge cock fighting arena. don't ask me why cock fighting is a huge part of this movie but it is. when they arrive cole is still wearing his ninja mask even though everyone involved knows what he looks like without it. the final battle is approaching as cole has killed everybody and now sho, as i like to call him, reveals himself to have kidnapped cole's lady aka frank's wife, and they meet in the snazziest cockfighting arena you ever saw. sho then, very politely i might add, releases said lady and the battle is about to start. they do their bowing and start circling each other, both masked by the way. when they join in battle it appears cole becomes someone else intermittently ala "finishing the game" a funny spoof on completing bruce lee's "game of death". cole eventually comes out on top, kills sho, who dies with honor by being decapitated and all is well. next we see cole, after ruining everyone's life is about to split town again but not before foreshadowing the brutal death of a fat guy with a hook hand and then he inexplicably winks at the camera, freeze frame, credits, done.
