i am furious! it has been a while since the last zombie movie i've watched so i was really looking forward to watching a good ol' gory zombie movie. hotd2 was a major disappointment. a reasonable story but awful acting, filming, dialogue, and nauseating clich'es and punch lines. i didn't even see the first one which is supposedly worse than this one...now i am curious about how bad could that one have been! the film is full of mistakes and goofs. who on earth analyses dna using a blood sample!? why are these "special forces" who "have been to hell and back" fight like spoiled 6 year old girls? we see ferocious zombies who would take a bite at any chance they get then hundreds of them that wave their arms at our two "heroes", take them down to the ground, then let them go without even a scratch. i could go on and on about this but life is too short and i have already wasted a couple of hours watching this pathetic movie which is an insult to the movie industry.
