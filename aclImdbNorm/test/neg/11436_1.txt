i can't figure out what jon voight could possibly have been thinking when he got involved in this tenth-rate, incoherent, pretentious, mind-numbing slop. he helped to write the alleged "script" himself, and he should be damn well ashamed of it. the film (i can't call it a "movie" because it barely moves at all) is rambling, embarrassingly pretentious drivel--sort of like a really bad oprah winfrey show, but worse. it meanders senselessly back and forth from medieval times to modern-day los angeles, with voight as a television producer who thinks he is the reincarnation of a medieval prince who must save the kingdom from the machinations of his evil brother, and somehow this gets transferred to modern times where voight has to save the country from the evil machinations of an oil company executive. if the bizarre casting (wilfrid brimley, frankie valli (!), kaye ballard and armand assante, among others) isn't enough to kill it, the stupefyingly inept direction, the washed-out photography (it looks like it was shot with a really cheap 16mm camera), the almost complete lack of editing (scenes either go on and on endlessly or are chopped off in the middle of a sentence), and voight's embarrassing, apparently stream-of-consciousness "acting" are enough to bury it, which is exactly what should have been done with it. a jaw-dropping experience. avoid this dog at all costs.
