that movie while slightly flawed was entirely entertaining. about half an hour into be cool, i started to have hollywood homicide flashbacks. but guess what? this is worse. even the dance number is bad. i like most of the cast in this movie, so that makes me feel bad about writing a negative review of it but i feel obligated. the rock, andre 3000, and vince vaughn were in a comedy. no one else seemed to decide what movie genre they were acting in. i feel bad for travolta because he brought the same chili palmer from get shorty to this movie. he was totally consistent in the role, but this movie is so different from the original that the character sticks out like a sore thumb. i was going to give this movie 4/10 because i like the actors so much but there is a conversation in the movie about a certain song that is so asinine i couldn't believe the performers actually said it. if you want to go to the movies this weekend there should still be some oscar contenders out there. that would be a much better way to spend your time.
