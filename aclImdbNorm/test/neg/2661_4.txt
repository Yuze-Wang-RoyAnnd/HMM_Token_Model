unusually cold and silly drama from director sydney pollack. soapy plot revolves around adulterous couple perishing in a plane wreck, leaving their spouses to find eachother and connect on their own intimate level. romance-novel writing gets sluggish treatment, although i thought the performances by leads harrison ford and kristen scott-thomas were fine. slick production holds interest, even though the plot keeps covering the same ground, and never builds any emotional momentum. as a result, the climax in the airport is a big 'so what?'
