first off, the initial concept of a lost fortune in gold bars discovered in a new zealand lake, inside a downed world war 2 plane is a great opening. what follows is nothing but cartoon like drivel. men chasing men, cars chasing men , helicopters chasing men, helicopters chasing boats, boats chasing boats, for the better part of an hour, the most boring nonsense, with absolutely no advancement to the story. special mention must be made of the chop shop editing, as many scenes seem to have been spliced together in random order. the acting by all concerned is an embarrassment. one last thing, the picture quality and sound quality is so bad on this dvd that you will be appalled. - merk
