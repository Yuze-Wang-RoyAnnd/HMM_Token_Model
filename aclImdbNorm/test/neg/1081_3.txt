a ridiculous, badly acted mini cooper infomercial. includes cameos from pepsi, dell, etc. <br /><br />absolutely nothing worth rescuing here. particularly bad are donald sutherland, the music score, scene transitions, etc. an embarrassing production.<br /><br />hey, they should pay you for watching this one.
