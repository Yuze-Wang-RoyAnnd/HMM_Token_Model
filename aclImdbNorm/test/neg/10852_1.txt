hi! i'm sheena, an african (yet white!) jungle tribal princess who possesses the incredible ability to transform into the cheapest, unscariest monster in the world (think 60s star trek aliens) by rolling seductively in mud! when i first found myself in this horrible position, i took the only logical action: i made myself a torn-apart jungle bikini in which to perform my badly-acted antics. i enjoy romance novels and tearing apart the occasional unimpressive african warlord. and i would be remiss if i did not mention my (white, of course) sidekick mr. cutter, an american ex-military man who seems to have fled the u.s. after his divorce. can you say "ducking alimony"? anyway, he provides the occasional distraction from my difficult life. i mean, how many idiot blonds do you know who are also an endangered species of flesh-rending monster? despite my many hardships (acting is so hard! *whine*), i haven't given up, and after much soul-searching, i have finally discovered my role in life: to terrorize insomniatic late-night television viewers who are so unfortunate as to not have cable or satellite.
