the acting is generally pretty weak. the dialog was also apparently dubbed in after the filming, so it just doesn't come across well. what do you want for a tv movie?<br /><br />annette o'toole was ok; there were a few strong lines from the parent of the queen.<br /><br />otherwise, these kids weren't quite up to it. didn't impress my kids either.<br /><br />on the upside, it is only an hour long. considering that, it got through plot and character development in a creditable fashion. the settings and cinematography are ok too.<br /><br />some other viewers may like it for sentimental reasons.
