star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning <br /><br />unorthodox journalist mike sullivan (vinnie jones) flits away his time winding up the local constabulary and trying to romance a member of police personnel. but everything changes when the landlady of the thames side pub he frequents is found murdered and a transcript of an unpublished novel cum confession by legendary writer charles dickens is found. as he digs deeper into both mysteries, he is plunged further into mystery and danger than he bargained for.<br /><br />in 1998, former footballer vinnie jones shot out of nowhere and took everyone by surprise with his gangster cult classic lock, stock and two smoking barrels. okay, no one was blown away by his acting ability, but his presence as a hard man looked set to ensure a decent career as a movie tough guy. but it all proved to be a one hit wonder, and all he really achieved after this was supporting role status amongst far more acclaimed actors in films like gone in sixty seconds and swordfish, before descending into the realm of straight to dvd hell, the latest being this muddled and labourous thriller, which might have been okay had he not taken other acclaimed and promising new talent stars like derek jacobi, julie cox, vanessa redgrave, jason flemyng and mel smith along with him. what caused him to fall from the dizzying heights of success so quickly (apart from maybe being a one trick pony) is anyone's guess (a dodgy personal life being a possible guess) but here he is.<br /><br />a script as far fetched and incomprehensible as this would have been a task in anyone's hand, but with a miscast looking jones in the lead, it's even more of a task to fathom. jacobi's juxtaposing roles as a former thesp tramp and dickens himself talking directly to the camera through-out are obviously hints building up to something and the script is predictable in other areas too. add to this cheap looking production values through out and debut director (also writer) brendan foley has made a bad first impression.<br /><br />what exactly did i expect with something that came free with the daily mail? *
