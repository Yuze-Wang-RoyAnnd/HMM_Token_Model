i found this film to be extremely homophobic... the main character doesn't know he's gay until he realizes that he likes barbra streisand and has a limp wrist!!! i was so offended that after the screening at the toronto film festival, i went up and spoke to the screen writer to complain about this film. this is the sort of film that glaad needs to work to have banned.
