big spoiler right here: this film is b!a!d! but enjoy, it's good bad.<br /><br />bugged is the kind of film you can't believe exists, with dialog, plotting, and direction so ineptly handled that uncle ned's carlsbad cavern home video looks like an imax experience. since it's a troma flick, there's plenty of gross-out gore on tap, but its even sillier than usual.<br /><br />most of the production money seems to have gone into buying soda and sandwiches for cast and crew. the brilliant dialog is best summed up in the immortal, "%@#$! what was that?" which is second only to the oft screamed, "now what?"<br /><br />any knowledge of how people act in a desperate situation is alien to ronald armstrong, the writer/director. when one of the friends is found being eaten alive by a grasshopper/termite/chiapet thing, armstrong has the survivors immediately making time with cute, but dumb-as-a-doorknob, "divine." while she's being hit on, divine is cooking up a big steaming pot of a rat-poison/oatmeal mixture on the stove, stirring, smiling, stirring, smiling, never falling over dead from the fumes!<br /><br />the killer bugs are as frightening as pi~natas, which they too closely resemble. the effects used to move them include dragging them across tile floors real fast with their legs dragging behind.<br /><br />the highlight for the film would probably have been the house blowing up, but they were either out of cash or never had any, so instead of seeing even a miniature go up in flames, they simply let the screen go black (eat you heart out ilm).<br /><br />the cast is virtually all black. how can the naacp consistently censor something truly funny like amos and andy (which depicts characters certainly no less similiar than those on 99% of all white comedy shows), but says nary a peep about something like bugged. oh well, it's best they don't know about how demeaning this film is to all involved (as it would be if it were played by any single ethnic group, frankly). before they put the kabosh on bugged, get some friends together and get ready for the plan 9 of bug exterminator movies.
