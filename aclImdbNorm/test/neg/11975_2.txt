normally i love finding old (and some not-so-old) westerns i haven't seen, to be the entertainment for the evening. it's such a great way to sit back, relax and escape the politics and world problems for a few hours. but this was not to be the case with this version of the magnificent seven. the casting and storyline of this series closely follow the hollywood formula for politically correct entertainment; good old get-your-mind-right, revisionist history, where the 'bad guys' must all be white, male, confederate (in this case), and preferably christian (if it can somehow be worked into the script). it's sad, really. the best movies out there, are now and have always been about simply telling a good story up on the big screen - not about forwarding someone's political ideology.
