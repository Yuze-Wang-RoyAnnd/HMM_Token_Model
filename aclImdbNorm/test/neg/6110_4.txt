the one line summary is actually the punch line of a very old joke that begins "what is a jewish porno film?"<br /><br />while this film had its interesting moments, it was far too slow moving and did not do enough to explain to those of us in the audience unfamiliar with orthodox jewish custom, exactly what was going on and why? how many people who came across this film would know that the bathtub the female characters were washing in is in reality called a "mikveh" which is a ritual bath used to cleanse spiritual uncleanliness? the same question might be asked of why the bride was walked around the groom a dizzying number of times while her face was covered just prior to the marriage vows being performed. these two examples are but two of a large number of such moments that remained completely unexplained to the uninitiated audience.<br /><br />this film does have its touching moments along with expressions of great love and emotions. the characters are presented very authentically right down to the number of garments an ultra orthodox jewish male must wear as well as the religious rituals he must engage in upon awakening in the morning to begin his day. the attitudes orthodox judaism has towards women in general and wives in particular is both intriguing and at times maddening. this is another reason why more explanation is needed if this story is to be understood in context.<br /><br />i recommend this film to people who are familiar with orthodox jewish tradition and ritual as well as those who might be interested in getting a brief peek at what the lives of people who practice this way of life is like.<br /><br />the story itself about two sisters who in their own ways rebel against "the system" is of moderate interest at best.
