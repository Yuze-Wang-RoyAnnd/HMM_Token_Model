this tv show is possibly the most pathetic display of crap on tv today. horribly predictable, obscene usage of slow motion photography, cheesy story lines. chuck norris is an abomination who should never have been allowed to be filmed in anything. the way he chooses to make each episode into a public service announcement is really annoying. his acting sucks so bad that it makes a person cringe with embarrassment. i will give the series some credit though...it does get entertaining at times, but not enough for it make any difference. with all the negative points this series has, i still prefer it over reality tv, it can't really get any more worthless than that.
