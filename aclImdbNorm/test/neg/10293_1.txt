i went to the cinema to watch a preview of this film without knowing anything about it. recognizing jennifer lynch's name and seeing the 18 certificate i realised it might be disturbing. in actuality i found the film a farce. i found myself giggling in disbelief through parts of it. the acting is atrocious- bill pullman and his ridiculous twitching face. i do almost pity the actors though as the script offers them no chance of any believable character interaction. after some shocking incident, (there is plenty to "try" and shock the viewer in this film), 2 characters are seen sharing a beer and talking about the weather. everything was overstated, or thought it was being clever when really it was obvious! the performance from the little girl character named stephanie was the best thing about the film. quiet and intense. i really could not recommend this film to anyone. its violent without point, ridiculous characters, bad acting, bad script and plain silly.
