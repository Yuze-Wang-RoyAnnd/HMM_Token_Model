i have had more boring stretches of 80 minutes in my life, but none are coming to mind right now. hell ride is based on the retro cult 70s theme that tarantino brought back, and did right, in movies like pulp fiction and reservoir dogs. the problem with hell ride is, unlike pf and rd, the story is garbage and so is character development. how many movies does bishop think he can blatantly steal from? the brief case in pulp fiction, the air gun in no country, etc. etc. speaking of bishop what the hell is he doing acting in this movie? i couldn't help but laugh at those scenes where he's standing with his pelvis trusted out, desperately trying to seem like some hardened biker. nothing in this movie is believable. and why dennis hopper? did they really need the easy rider motif too? i blame larry bishop, for his horrible plot and dialogue, not to mention his failed attempt at the leading role. don't bother watching this movie, it's a waste of time.
