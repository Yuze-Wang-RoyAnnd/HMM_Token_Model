i did have some expectations from this film because 1. it was a yash raj production 2. when the songs were first shown on tv, they seemed catchy 3. the star(??!) cast was new. well, i must tell u that i just couldn't sit through this movie. uday, (with his red lips-what were the make up artists thinking???!) tries hard to look cool but fails miserably. i won't even get started on his acting (if u can call it that). 'cleavage queen' tanisha with all her screaming and ranting n raving just makes you want to pull your hair out in frustration. i think uday was slightly more tolerable than her! she seriously needs to take acting lessons from her sister. the story is pathetic...the same old tried and tested formula. absolutely no originality. there is nothing worth watching in this movie. makes me wonder why it was made in the first place!
