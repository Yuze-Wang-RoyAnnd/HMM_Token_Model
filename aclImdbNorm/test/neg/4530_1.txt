the audience sat in silence through almost the entire film, with only a few, rare, occasional chuckles. the character of maxwell smart was so inconsistent, i felt whip-lashed. when it is convenient for the plot, smart behaves like a master spy. at other times, he acts like an imbecile. they lift many classic lines from the television series, but they don't work in this version. the classic "missed it by this much" is funny if it is spoken with attempted braggadocio by someone who is an obvious failure - but it loses all humor when spoken by someone who is qualified. to a slightly lesser degree, many of the other characters move at a dizzying pace from skilled to cartoonish incompetent. siegfried, the main villain, would seem to be intelligent, but he makes decisions that make no damned sense at all. still, none of the characters in the film is as incompetent as the writers of this mess. i am utterly depressed that so many imdb users think this was good.
