a malfunction in space sends astronaut neil stryker (glenn corbett) off course and headed to something of a parallel world, called terra, circling the sun exactly opposite earth. as a being from space would pose a threat to this world's order, stryker is held until a determination can be made as to exactly what to do with him. stryker, however, gets suspicious of his surroundings and escapes. with the help of a sympathetic nurse and a old scientist who opposes the government, stryker will try to board a spaceship and head back to earth.<br /><br />stranded in space (or the stranger if you prefer) is another of those 70s made-for-tv movies that was to be turned into a regular, weekly show. in this case, it's easy to see why it didn't make it. first off, there's nothing new about the show's set-up. it was undoubtedly designed to follow the same formula used by the fugitive or the incredible hulk or planet of the apes. you know, a stranger constantly on the move going from one town to the next taking whatever odd job he can all the while being pursued by a government agency or newspaper reporter. it's a formula that's been done to death. the second strike against stranded in space is its lead, glenn corbett. could this guy come across any less likable? i was rooting for him to get caught. without sympathy for the main character, this kind of show would never work. finally, this is supposed to be science fiction. just because everyone is left-handed and someone has hung three fake looking moons on the horizon i'm supposed to jump to the conclusion that this is some distant planet? so it's a mere coincidence that they all speak english, dress just like people on earth, and drive plymouth furies? yeah, right.<br /><br />the lone highlight for me was the inclusion of cameron mitchell in the cast. sure, it's difficult to watch him in something this dreadful, but you know the old saying - any cameron is better than no cameron (yeah, i've never heard it either).<br /><br />as with a lot of these 70s made-for-tv movies, i watched stranded in space courtesy of mystery science theater 3000. i wouldn't call it a great episode by any stretch of the imagination, but there are a few good jokes along the way. so in the end, while i rate the movie a 2/10, it gets a 3/5 on my mst3k rating scale.
