this is a pale imitation of the die hard franchise that just sucks. the low ambitions of the movie are clearly on display when the terrorists hold the vice-president hostage and he has to call the white house to beg them to transfer some money. in most movies of this genre the president is kidnapped or held hostage because after all he (or she) is the most powerful person in the country with finger on the nuclear button etc etc. would most americans have really been worried if dick cheney had been kidnapped? the honest answer is- probably not. why the terrorists would choose a stanley cup final to carry out their operation and why, despite many explosions around them, the audience inside the hockey stadium is oblivious to the situation, are unanswerable questions. let's just say this film is really hokey, not hockey. those who liked the film and found it to be exciting should get a life.
