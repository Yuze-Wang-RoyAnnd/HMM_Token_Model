"eh-heh eh-heh hey, dude - look at these aliens. they're like - biting the humans and stuff! eh-heh eh-heh eh-heh" <br /><br />this must rank amongst the worst movies of all time. it's utter drivel for anyone with a modicum of a brain. sure, you have the reviewers on the payroll who give glowing reviews and vote highly for this abomination but it's easy to tell who these sell-outs are. their reviews are too good. to give a movie like this even a mediocre review claiming it had some b-movie remedial appeal would be a glowing review! calling this a great movie tips the hands of the corporate shills.<br /><br />but enough of that.<br /><br />this movie had about all the bad characteristics a movie can have without being so bad that it's enjoyable just to laugh at. the old japanese 60's monster films had a quality that this movie lacked. at least in those 60's films you could laugh at just how bad the rubber monster suit looked. or laugh at seeing the strings holding the space ships, how the models dangled on the strings and how the flames curved upwards out of the back. those movies made fun of how bad they were. alien express (aka dead rail) seems to actually think of itself as a good movie - which makes it incredibly absurd.<br /><br />the effects were awful by today's standards. beyond awful. however not quite as bad as the 60's monster movies hence they lacked the comedic appeal. the plot and dialogue were about as sophomoric as i've ever seen, made even worse by being every bit as predictable as you might expect. i won't even point out the plot and logic holes in this one; it just wouldn't be fair to this pitiable plot (plus it would take to long to even get started). most of the acting was awful; lou diamond phillips must have been very desperate to agree to touch this one.<br /><br />scifi channel is rapidly becoming the "cheap thrills channel", producing movie after movie without an iota of concept or intelligence in the lot. i can only wonder - why bother?<br /><br />don't bother with this tripe. it doesn't get any worse.
