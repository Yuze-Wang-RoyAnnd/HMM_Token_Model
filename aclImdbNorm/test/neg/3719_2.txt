if this film becomes a holiday tradition i am going to have to hide for christmas for the rest of my life. how do you even think of comparing this with 'a wonderful life'! it was absolutely awful! the boy singing made my toes curl. and what on earth was the deal with his hair?? emmy worthy performance?! please. granted, lucci did ok but an emmy????? i think this film is a waste of money. the fact that they stuck so close to the original story pretending to give it a modern and retro touch made it even worse. it lacked enthusiasm and persistence on all accounts. lighting, wardrobe, make-up, it seemed everybody wanted to go home. just a big no from me.
