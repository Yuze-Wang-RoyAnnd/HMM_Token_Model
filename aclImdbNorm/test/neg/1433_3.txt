this movie was one of the most boring horror movies i have seen in a long time (and i have seen a lot). personally i liked the piercing take on it all that was original but other than that it was pretty unwatchable. i could not stand dee snider as an actor nor as a singer. i seemed that he was trying with everything he said to make it a memorable quote, which they weren't. i can get movies for free and i still didn't think it was worth the time to get.
