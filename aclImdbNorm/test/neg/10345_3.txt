the idea behind dead silence is great: zombie outbreak takes place during an edgy paranoia radio talk show. there was so much going for this film. unfortunately, as soon as the zombies made their appearance, all was lost.<br /><br />the film is ridiculous and only those with a passion for cheesy, b-flick horror will enjoy it. the zombies were soooo stupid! they ran around flailing their arms. they looked like a bunch of people putting on a haunted house for elementary students.<br /><br />i know this is a brief review, but i just don't see the need to invest much into this. it's a dumb movie. you've been warned.
