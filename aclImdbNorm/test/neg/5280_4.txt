stupid horror film about five 20 somethings (3 guys, 2 girls) going to this place in the middle of nowhere. what they don't know is dr. chopper and his female assistants attack and kill anybody who ventures in their woods. they use their body parts for some experiments...or something. also five college girls and two lesbians are thrown in to be killed off and show some cleavage.<br /><br />pretty desperate. the story is confusing and boring; the gore is laughably fake; dr. chopper and his assistants overact terribly; there's some dreadful black "humor" in here and people just stand around while their friends are being attacked or just stand there and let the people kill them.<br /><br />this was pretty insulting. there are a few pluses. a twist an hour in was pretty good and the five young actors are actually good! chase hoyt is great as reese; butch hansen is ok as jimmy; ashley mccarthy is also good as tamara and robert adamson has his moments as nicholas. best of all is chesley crisp as jessica--she was excellent! some of the dramatic scenes between these five were well-acted and interesting. unfortunately the dialogue wasn't really there for them. i'm giving it a 4 for their performances--but nothing else here is worth mentioning. hopefully these actors will get roles worthy of them.
