well, 1st off i haven't seen "silence of the lambs" yet.... but, i think that i would have become sick if i would have seen it before this piece. not from the gruesome violence but, from the lack of everything else. anthony hopkins was very good as hannibal and i really believed that he was as psychotic as he played himself off to be but, from the reaction of the audience around me, the film was filled with cliches from "silence" which left me lost at points where others were laughing at what was on the screen.<br /><br />now, i heard that the movie would be very gruesome and if the director wanted to gross folks out... he did it... but, only in 2 sequences? i mean, if you want it to be gruesome and i mean, so gruesome that you're going to play the film off of that... you need more than 2 sequences.. i always see it as a film has to either become that cinematic jewel which will ultimatley take you to another place and time or either go over the top (which most of the time is done in bad taste). but, this film left me sitting in my chair and falling asleep at times. <br /><br />anthony hopkins and julianne moore are the stars of the movie, right? well, with the exception of hopkins, i didn't feel that way.. who cared about the stupid italian police officer? i definatley didn't. so, really the film is left with a big hole talking about a guy who dies anyway. i mean, come on.. who cares?<br /><br />in a nutshell, the movie is good if you want to see lector and starling once again but, if you're going for a really good thriller... you'll jump once and be grossed out maybe twice. depends on your level.<br /><br />thinking about how much money this movie will bring in... there will probably be another "hannibal" made and this movie probably won't be on video until the fall. if you must see it.. wait and save the $3.50 - $4.00 and get it on video. don't spend the big bucks on this film.
