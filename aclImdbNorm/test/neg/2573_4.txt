since i am not a big steven seagal fan, i thought this was a pretty good movie. it is apparent that his fans are very displeased with this drama that lacks an over abundance of martial arts and brute force.<br /><br />gailard sartain plays a self claimed patriot leader of a militia in a standoff with the atf for weapons violations. he surrenders with the intentions of releasing a deadly virus. seagal is a former cia agent turned country doctor that pressures himself to find the antidote for the lethal bug that has incapacitated a small town. his grandpa's native american herbal remedy figures into the salvation.<br /><br />notable appearances by l.q. jones, camilla belle and silas weir mitchell. my personal favorite in this movie is whitney yellow robe. she is stunning and appears to have what it takes to take on a more challenging role.<br /><br />despite the far fetched ending, this was a decent movie that could have used a lot more action.
