maybe being a government bureaucrat is not the most glamorous way of making a living but it's still a way to make a living. however, after watching this movie, one may come away believing that every government bureaucrat is a lazy, bloated, conceited, paper pusher who lives exclusively to partake of his next lunch break. not exactly a pretty picture, but this is the picture that the audience has to endure when watching what is nothing more than another tedious, noisy, overacted action movie. just what the doctor ordered ... right? how many more of these movies has hollywood made? one thousand? two thousand? the formula for making these movies is so beaten into the dust that by now it should be completely unrecognizable. the locales change but the plots remain the same, and with the same shallow character development and the equally shallow acting as trained performers are asked to devolve into pseudo-cartoon characters and act accordingly. this movie seemed to run-on interminably. "when will this movie end?" i repeatedly thought to myself. leonardo dicaprio was totally unbelievable as a cia operative, but what has to be one of the great gaffs of miscasting, an overweight russell crowe plays a cia bureaucrat. please note that in this movie the on site operative is "lean and mean" while his desk jockey supervisor is fat. this is called stereotyping. what was the casting director thinking? why not have jack nicholson play an overweight office clerk? or nicole kidman play a frumpy department store saleswoman? and the story was so fantastic that no amount of literary license could afford it credibility. an obviously non-arab american (mr. dicaprio) trying to pass himself off as an arab ... speaking fluent arabic ... concocting all kinds of hair brain schemes that are doomed to failure ... trying to out think and outfox real arabs who are completely unfooled by his laughable arab masquerade ... trying to romance a palestinian woman while in the middle of conducting a highly sensitive and complex espionage mission ... etc. by now you get the point. next time try casting an actual arab in the role. not even the most naive movie goer can believe all that. there should be a rough balance between the protagonist and antagonist. in this movie the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that it leaves the story in shambles. next stop for this movie - dvd land and oblivion. and one other thing. don;t let this movie discourage you from working for the government. the pay may not be great, but the fringe benefits are excellent, a critical fact that this movie conveniently omits.
