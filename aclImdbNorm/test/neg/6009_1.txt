this is by far the worst hemingway adaptation ever. rock hudson was badly miscast and entirely unbelievable as a hard-bitten soldier/adventurer drawn to war. jennifer jones was far too old for her part and vittorio de sica seemed to think he was acting in some other movie altogether. they tried to make a large-scale epic out of a low-key romantic novel and the result is terrible. as if that were not enough the whole thing is so slow, overlong and dated that it is practically unwatchable. rock must have kicked himself for turning down "sayonara" and "ben hur" in order to make this ghastly crap.<br /><br />0/10. to be avoided.
