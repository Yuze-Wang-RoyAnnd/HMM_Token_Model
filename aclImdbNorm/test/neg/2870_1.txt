i kind of like bam margera, so i was curious. <br /><br />but watching a home production with somebody elses friends and family, with a decent camera and a sound guy, just isn't good film-making. <br /><br />writing, direction, acting and editing is abysmal at best. but i sat through half of it. and why?<br /><br />this film gives perfect examples of what not to do, it is a film student's dream of what to avoid at every stage of the process. cram it into film school curiculums all over the joint!<br /><br />so thanx bam! now i know jackass is for real - cause you ain't looking to win an oscar, dude:)
