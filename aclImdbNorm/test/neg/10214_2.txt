a new wrestling show paves way for the most feared wrestler ever imaginable, the giant zeus. network president brell does everything in his power to draw wwf champion rip into the squared circle to face off against zeus for the championship of the 'battle of the tough guys'. but zeus is unlike any competitor rip has ever faced.<br /><br />normally i would give hogan some leeway as a wrestler crossing over into a movie role, however this film didn't ask the hulkster to make very much of a stretch, it simply asked hogan to play himself, which he failed at miserably. 'tiny' lister made a good effort as the mighty zeus, but even his work left the film lacking something, namely acting!<br /><br />watch this movie, if you so desire, with a grain of salt and a sense of humor, otherwise you will probably have to turn it off a little over ten minutes in.
