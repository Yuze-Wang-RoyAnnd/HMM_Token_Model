lil pimp is the story of a little boy who becomes a pimp. the animation and voice acting were perfect for this type of film.<br /><br />i laughed out loud for the first 20 minutes or so of this movie; mostly at the concept. after that, the joke wore thin. as a 15-20 minute animated short, lil pimp would have been a classic. instead, this movie consists entirely of one joke that lasts far too long.<br /><br />weathers, voiced by ludicrous, does have several crude and funny one-liners. unfortunately, that is all the boy's pet rat is good for as he contributes nothing else to the story. eventually, i grew as bored with his remarks as i did the rest of this movie.<br /><br />i am a big fan of south park, and other animation aimed at adults. i also play several online pimp games, so i am partial to stories about pimps. the transition from little boy to lil pimp was brilliant; but after that, both the story and dialog became redundant and predictable.<br /><br />i give this movie a five. it is worth watching for the great concept and voice acting. just do not expect much else or you will be quite disappointed.
