bronson took the money and ran with this film; he must have house payments like me! this low budget film made in mexico reminds me of a few of those italians stinkers from over seas. i heard, i do not know if this is true, but companies make these films in foreign countries for tax purposes. i believe this because why else would they make this film, it sure wasn't to make money. we had a whole lot of these canadian made stinkers, because the government gave tax breaks to create a movie industry. i wonder if it payed off in the other countries like in canada. anyway, back to topic this film is poorly made in every aspect, i believe they grabbed charles bronson in order to sell this stinker; that dead body at the end looks very phony. 3/10
