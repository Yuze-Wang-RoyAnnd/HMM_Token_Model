unlike terms of endearment and steel magnolia's, i left the movie theater feeling very disappointed. i started to get into the characters and their complex mother/daughter and father/daughter relationships at the beginning. i even cried. but i had no sympathy for the characters with the ending. the final act did not seem in line with the mother's character at all. so, although the acting was pretty good, i thought the movie on a whole was disappointing.
