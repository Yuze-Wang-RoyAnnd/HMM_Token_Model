while trying to build a major mall or complex or something like that, a wealthy landowner ignores ancient native american artifacts buried on the land, and unleashes the bone eater...a creature who goes around and kills people in search of his fallen friends or something like that.<br /><br />indeed this movie had to be a sci-fi channel original. if it wasn't, then the director should never direct anything again. the effects in the film is laughable at best, and the bone eater monster is nothing but a cgi-animated being added into the frames at a later date. the actors don't even look all that frightened when they see the thing (probably because they really don't, and they're just terrible actors). it's a great comedy, though, even if it's supposed to be pure horror.
