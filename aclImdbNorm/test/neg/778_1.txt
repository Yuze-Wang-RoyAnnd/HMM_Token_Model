i don't understand why so many of the comments here seem to indicate that this is acceptable entertainment. the eye-popping horror of this cinematic monstrosity cannot be overstated. me and my girlfriend just watched it together, and i'm not sure we'll ever be able to have sex again. i'm not sure what was worse, the scrawny, unattractive cast, their supremely unphotogenic genitals, the rancid attempts at humor, the screeching noises that claimed to be songs...<br /><br />no, i know what was worst of all. the girls in the green leotards, with green facepaint, licking alice to dry her off, then proposing, in broken childlike speech, that they suckle milk from her breasts. that was the worst.<br /><br />also, what was with the nurses, and why do they seem to have so much trouble finding each other's vaginas? why are all the male actors gay? why does humpty dumpty waggle a dildo in the air and pretend that it's his penis? why did my eyes have to see this? there are no words.
