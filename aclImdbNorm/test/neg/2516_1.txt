luchino visconti was and is one of the most influential cultural figures of his generation, but adam low (the director of this thing) allows the stronger voice to be helmut berger's! how can it be? what a missed opportunity! we come out of this ordeal knowing less of what made the master great and more about the things one shouldn't care at all. the beautiful images belong to visconti's world, the embarrassing interviews to the likes of berger and zeffirelli to adam low's tiny little world. a must to avoid!
