it is not generally my practice to review movies that i dislike to any great degree. however, one or two times a year, i temporarily set aside my rule to only comment on things i like to give a word of warning. i find it more enjoyable to comment on something i like and boost it than i do shooting at bad movies. but some "movies" cry out for the razor.<br /><br />bilitis is one of them. the cinematography isn't the only aspect that is blurry and out of focus here. an almost indiscernible plot (certainly incoherent, if there even is one) bad acting, cheesy script and awful pacing. those are its major problems.<br /><br />understand, i firmly believe that not all movies are created equal and films should be judged according to their category. it is not reasonable to judge, say, beach blanket bingo against gone with the wind. i judge bilitis against other movies in its weight class. measured against movies like emmanuelle or secrets of a chambermaid, it comes off very badly indeed. even eye-candy has to be entertaining and bilitis most definitely is not.
