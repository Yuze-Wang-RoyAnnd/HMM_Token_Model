i'm probably one of the few people who defend and even enjoy "frisk," the project that put todd verow on the map, if that is indeed where he is. i appreciated that someone had the guts to take on dennis cooper and not back away from the material; verow fairly rolls around in it. judging from what he's done since then he's well-suited for that type of material and should probably stick to it. "vacationland," a would-be "teen coming out" film, is so misguided in so many ways it becomes unintentional comedy, and i'm disappointed i have to report that.<br /><br />first off, our hero, the high school senior "joe" is far too old in appearance to be playing 18 . when we later meet a man who is supposed to be joe's teacher it's confusing, as the sweaty-faced guy looks much younger than the student he's teaching. joe's mother looks younger than he does and doesn't "act" any older either. second, in joe's opening scenes he looked like he was either playing, or actually experiencing, mental challenges. to his credit he got better as the film went on and i figured out he was "playing young," but it just wasn't working--it was weird.<br /><br />it's 15 minutes in before anything is revealed about who, what and where these people are, and why we should care. the second scene in the film is an extended bit of business in a men's toilet room that, considering where the story goes later, is absolutely superfluous; the subplot with the teacher goes nowhere at all, even as a "rite of passage" for our "young" hero...one minute joe is nervously trying his hand at bathroom stall sex (a scene so un-erotic it makes you truly wonder what anyone sees in the practice), the next minute he's an expert at sexual blackmail and violent double-crossing. this is followed by an extended scene with the character we'll later learn is "andrew," and that's about all we learn about him, other than he's apparently gay but not out yet.<br /><br />there's a lot crammed in to the 1:44 running time (which is about 20 minutes too long--i can't imagine how it played with the mind-numbingly long and pointless deleted scenes of joe walking around); a sub-plot copped from "gods and monsters" with an aged patron who spouts rhetoric appros pos of nothing played by an actor who obviously can't remember his lines (he is conveniently dispatched with in a way dickens might have come up with on a slow week); a mix-n-match almost-four-way between the boys and their girlfriends, a gay-bashing toilet tramp, a would-be wise sage in the form of a nellie queen (and hasn't the nellie queen suddenly taken over the role of the "hooker with the heart of gold" as most tired stereo-type?) who exists only to be degraded; blackmail, theft, murder, alcohol consumption and abuse of looping music software for soundtrack recording.<br /><br />what you will not find in this movie are any interior establishing master shots; we're expected to imagine we're in an airport, grocery store office and classroom, as all the scenes in these locations consist of close-ups and poorly edited soundscapes to convey the idea of locales that the production must not have been able to afford. one thing they were able to get appears to have been an actual gay bar; either it's the worst bar in the world or there are only about 5 gay men in bangor, maine, as the bar never has any patrons in it. another good chuckle came when the actors were supposed to be yelling over dance music that very obviously wasn't coming from the speakers, but was just more of the droning loop-music of the "score."<br /><br />plots and characters come and go, emotions are unreadable and the dialog, clearly inspired by dennis cooper, is "film-speak," meaning no humans actually talk this way. since we aren't given any information about these characters it's impossible to care about what happens to them; it's as if joe et al appear out of the ether one day and might simply cease to exist once the credits roll (certainly the character of joe's sister, a wannabee jennifer grey who is bohemia-crazy, seems to just simply "stop," we never know where she is in la or what her problem is...but again...does it matter?). visually the film looks very good at times, more a testament to new developments in hi-def video than anything, i suspect. the editing is pretty clunky though (there was one great edit; joe is posing naked and says, "i wanted to play sports, but..." and we cut to a shot revealing his "butt..." ha ha). composition is also odd at times (i thought i was watching sctv's parody of "persona" when the boys were talking together in bed and visually it looked as if their noses were stuck together for the whole scene!).<br /><br />one senses verow is really restraining himself from making a "naughtier" or somewhat rougher movie like he usually does, and maybe he shouldn't have held back (the frothy toothpaste/sex fantasy worked nicely, i thought, though the tone was out of touch with the rest of the movie)...he produces and directs this "sensitive coming of age" story much like herschell gordon lewis directed films without gore...porn films without sex in them. i got some unintended laughs out of this and it wasn't boring, it just wasn't very good either.
