the plot here is simple. country boy, lem (farrell) goes to the city to sell the wheat crop, falls in love with a waitress, kate (duncan) and marries her, bringing her home to a hostile father and a group of woman-hungry reapers. there are shades of they knew what they wanted and mice and men here. the courtship, taking place in two lengthy sequences set in the restaurant, consume the first half hour and are lethargically paced. lem is so weak he allows his father to mistreat his wife, who is propositioned by mac (richard alexander) , one of the reapers, to come away with him. duncan and alexander are the only good things in this tedious potboiler, which lacks the insights and the cinematic beauty we expect from murnau. farrell's character has no backbone so we wind up rooting for a "real man" (mac) to take kate away from it all. with audience sympathy skewed, the film loses its narrative progression. the father's conversion at film's end is unrealistic and unbelievable, making for a contrived denouement. this film is for fans of the stars and the director only - general audiences need not bother.
