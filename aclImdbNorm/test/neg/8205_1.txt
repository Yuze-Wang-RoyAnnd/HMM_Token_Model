this movie shows what you can create if you have a camera, some spare paint and cardboard,a toy ship, a few friends who acted in community theater, and the incorrect notion you can make a film. the end result is an unwatchable time-waster that you'll skip through, unless you take it out of the dvd player and toss it through the window first.<br /><br />the acting in the opening scene (especially by the rotund lee morgan as 'captain') and the toy ship "crashing" into the rocks before the credits is a good indicator of what you're in for (with all the foam, it looks like this "special effect" was shot in a kitchen sink. i guess boyette figured he save some cash by washing the dishes at the same time). in terms of bad cinema, the funny thing is "dungeon of harrow" seems to have inspired (maybe by coincidence) the twist ending of "manos: the hands of fate". yep, it's the same lame "i was the victim, and now i take the mad villain's place" ironic ending. the bigger irony is that two inept, talentless filmmakers could make two equally-wretched, texas-filmed horror movies and get away with it.<br /><br />monotone nerd russ harvey is a noble in a great family line (why they were great is never broached), boring us while lamenting the death of his family line and crest before his ship even crashes (we're also treating to a droning narration throughout the film). sadly, we aren't so lucky. his family's toy ship crashes into some styrofoam in a sink, and he's washed ashore with his bloated captain and some woman, conveniently deposited on a mad count's island.<br /><br />meanwhile, the count is visited by an evil spirit who, dressed in a blackstone's magic kit outfit, assaults him with various puppets (spiders, snakes, bats. . . all the icky stuff). the count (william mcnulty) overacts worse than shatner and has a visibly difficult time keeping a straight face through the typical madman ranting.<br /><br />i'd be mad too if i had to be in this disaster. the woman is promptly killed by the count's ferocious dogs, and the two jerks are captured by his manservant. the count accuses them of being pirates (apparently his worst fear), he slaps his manservant around a lot (apparently his greatest joy), fatboy gets tortured, there's a woman who's a servant and one who's a nurse, the rotting leper hag-in-a-wedding-dress countess in the dungeon (she digs the nerdy noble and is the only effective & creepy thing in the movie), a lot of inane dialogue at a dining room table, the blubbery captain gets killed while making a pathetic getaway (aking to watching a sloth battle a pack of lions). . . it's all an ugly haze to me. i spent most of my time on the fast-forward button.<br /><br />anyway, the jerk noble and nurse make a getaway and think they're going to be rescued by three guys in a rowboat on the lake (yeah, we're supposed to believe a lake is the ocean). they don't, since the nerd's hair turned gray and he scares the would-be rescuers away. honestly, i think they simply took the opportunity to row away from this hideous film while the had the chance. they head back to the castle, the nurse starts rotting like the countess (and your stomach, by this time), and we end with these two getting ready to descend into the . . . dungeon of harrow!!!! blech!<br /><br />i love old, lousy horror films, but they must have some sort of entertainment value. i feel ripped off, even at the low low price of $5.99 for this biscuit. mystery science theater would have a tough time making this one fun. i was taken in by a few nutty reviewers who claimed this film had atmosphere and some creepy moments. wrong! avoid this tripe at all costs, and don't even waste a buck if you find it in a dollar bin somewhere. this movie makes corman's "the terror" like like a masterpiece of horror and atmosphere.
