lame. lame. lame. ultralame. shall i go on? there is one, i repeat *one* funny scene in this entire, drawn-out, anti-amusing amateur hour special of a film: fares fares' fat father knocking someone over with his beer gut. that's it. the rest of this shockingly mediocre pile of nothingness consists of the usual trademark bored-looking swedish "actors" delivering dialogue which goes into one ear and out of the other, a banal story, sloppy direction and, well, little else worth mentioning. nepotistically cast fares fares is as charismatic as a chartered accountant and his nose rivals even that of adrien brody in terms of sheer ridiculous hugeness. torkel petersson should only work with lasse spang olsen. the rest of the cast is, luckily, easily forgettable, whereas fares' humongous, titanic nose will forever haunt me in my dreams.<br /><br />josef fares helps ruin swedish cinema. don't support him and his nonsense. jalla jalla is to comedies what arnold schwarzenegger is to character acting, kopps would have been much more respectable if it had been a no-budget youtube video, and zozo was simply the most pretentious, pseudo-touching garbage ever unleashed by a swedish director. wake up and smell the roses: swedish movies can be so much better than this, so stop pretending fares' flicks are worth watching simply because they're "good to be swedish". please.
