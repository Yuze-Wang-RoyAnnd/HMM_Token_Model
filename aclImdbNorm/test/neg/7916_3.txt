i'm glad that i did not expect too much when i saw this sequel to one of my favourite childhood films. the storyline was dull and unconvincing as were the characters, and i was disappointed that some of the characters in the original were not in this sequel. i also did not think that the characters themselves were similar from the previous film. charlie had changed, and now, he has a girlfriend. the first film had some good music, but the music in this film was unmemorable. in short, this film just did not do it for me. and, looking at other user feedback, it looks like it didn't do it for a lot of you. it's not worth watching.
