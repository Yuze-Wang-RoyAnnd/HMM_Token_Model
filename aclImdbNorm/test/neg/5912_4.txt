1989 was already a year in where eddie murphy wasn't that longer hot and started making movies that soon would be forgotten. funnily enough, it was also the year in where murphy directed his first film, but it also would be the first and last experiment. "harlem nights" wasn't exactly what you can call a success even if it was great to see the two best black comedians together namely murphy and richard pryor. don't blame it on the actors as they all played their roles like you expected them do, even if you have to face (again) the typical murphy-laugh. the worst thing from "harlem nights" are both the scenario and its terrible decors. everything is set in the roaring twenties and everybody has their profit from the forbidden clubs. sugar ray (pryor) and his adopted son quickie (murphy) are gathering easily 10000 dollar per day but of course soon the mob and the corrupt police come around the corner to claim their part of the cookie. sugar and quickie aren't guys who give their money for free and have their own plans. you can watch "harlem nights" that's for sure, but if you puke from the moment you hear the name murphy you better avoid as after all this movie is nothing but a lame excuse to see some good jokes.
