this movie could have been an impressing epic, but the makers seem to have done their utmost to make it appear foolish. even god himself is not spared in this movie, in that his words are drenched with childish jokes. the result is blasphemous and annoying. only people who don't care to see a cheap parody on the biblical story may perhaps watch this film without embarrassment. the makers of this tasteless production should see 'il vangelo secondo matteo' (the gospel according to mathew), a film of pier paolo pasolini, who shows that it is unnecessary to pervert the words of the bible to make a good story; the most impressing result is obtained by a sincere rendering of the plain text itself.
