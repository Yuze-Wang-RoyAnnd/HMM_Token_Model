the trouble with this film, like so many other films that fail, is the script.<br /><br />the script is so unfocused it flounders around all over the place. what is the story here? ok, it's a biopic but i think everyone will agree there is no way that an entire life can be condensed into 100 or so minutes. some selection and editing is required but this script just didn't select or edit enough. it didn't render hoffman's life down to one or two definable pivotal moments or themes that the audience could identify with and, through them, 'get' the bigger picture of the whole man.<br /><br />the movie wanders from being a straight plodding 'troubled genius' biopic, to semi-docu/mocu-mentary (using new shots faked up to match archive footage), to sub true life sob stories movie of the week (the whole "i'm bringing up a son who doesn't know i'm his dad" shtick), to political conspiracy theory movie etc. etc. it just never makes its mind up what it wants to be, and the half-hearted citizen kane like narrative structure (reporter interviewing people from hoffman's past) is soon abandoned which leaves the film even more unstructured and flabby than it starts out.<br /><br />the movie is full of moments and incidents that contribute nothing to the story and could well have been cut to leave room to expand something more important. the whole scene in the psychiatrist's office after vincent d'onofrio pounds the window screaming "i'm abbie hoffman! i'm abbie hoffman! i'm abbie hoffman!" ("i'm acting! i'm acting! i'm acting!") could have easily been cut. all that happens is the psychiatrist says "you have bipolar disorder here's some lithium.", and the two women in his life say "we could see you weekends more often." and bang! that's it. no more mental health problems. it is such a laughably pointless tokenistic scene it could easily, and should, have been dumped before it was shot. the scene where they all get high and watch newsreel footage from viet nam and hoffman phones god? pointless. tells us nothing about anything. yet, when it comes to a pivotally important moment like the drugs bust, the film making is so hurried the situation just comes out of leftfield and doesn't make any sense to the audience. suddenly he's dealing in heroin? where did this come from? why? what is going on here? <br /><br />i, being a middle-aged leftie, would guess i am sitting well within the target audience for this movie but even i got fed up with the portrayal of 'the man', 'the pigs', 'the fuzz' etc. as brutal, be-suited, unthinking, hippie-hating androids. it may have been like that in 60's america, i don't know, i wasn't there, but in film terms it was cheap clumsy polemic.<br /><br />having said all that vincent d'onofrio was convincingly charismatic as the younger hoffman and i could watch janeane garofalo in anything, even reading a bus timetable, though she just wasn't right for this part.
