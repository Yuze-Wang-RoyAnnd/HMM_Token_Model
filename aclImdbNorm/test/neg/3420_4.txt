recap: not entirely familiar with the shakespeare story of macbeth, but my wild guess is that this is pretty close to the original, only set in present time. it tells the story of macbeth, a member of a crime syndicate in melbourne (?). he is a valued hit-man and in the favor of leader duncan. but he and his lady has higher ambitions than that, and plan the murder of duncan, and any competition of the throne. this is a story of betrayal and cold, brutal death.<br /><br />comments: very interesting idea, i must say. to use the story but change the setting to present time, but still keep the original (?) dialog. it sets a huge contrast between the classical poetic work and the violence. promised to be extremely violent, it is a promise that it keeps, but not in the notion i imagined. it is very bloody indeed, but the violence is slow. not just figuratively speaking that it is calculated, which it is too, but also literally. a lot of action is actually slowed down to slow motion and that is what brings the movie to its knees.<br /><br />what could have been a unique strength, the contrast between the superfluous and poetic dialog and the extreme violence, now turns into something else entirely. now both slow the move down painfully much, so much that it actually becomes dull and boring at times.<br /><br />also i can't figure out the context the three witches act within. set to present time and reality i figure that such magical witchcraft had no place in the movie. apparently it does, but to me it seems completely out of place. not a subplot but a complete sub-story with it's own rules, completely different than the rest of the movie. seems completely out of place. surely it must have been possible to convert that part too to something modern. drug-induced hallucinations perhaps (which i suspect that the director hints at but then he has left way too much witchcraft in it to be believable)? now they only bring stretches of the movie that is clearly beside the story and i just waited for the real movie to begin again.<br /><br />a clear disappointment, but maybe something for shakespearean-buffs?<br /><br />4/10
