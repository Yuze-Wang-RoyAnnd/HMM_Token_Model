the movie plot seems to have been constructed from a disjointed dream. there is not enough realism to hold the viewer's interest. the vermont farm scene was a failed opportunity to show the way farms were set up and farm families lived which would have been interesting and entertaining. there was little if no research into the whiskey bootlegging trade of the period. the costumes of the canadians looked like something from the french revolution, totally unbelievable. the fiddle playing was good and of the time period but chris's motions while supposedly playing were unbelievable. the owl's appearance was a never explained mystery and the train disappearing into thin air was too much. i couldn't understand how a live trout got frozen into the ice and why two men in the wilderness without food would release the trout, a good food source.
