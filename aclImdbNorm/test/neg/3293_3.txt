this show drives me crazy. it goes against everything a family should be, even if it is intended to be a comedy. the show is suppose to follow dave and vicky gold (michael rapaport and anita barone) as they raise their three teenage children: hilary, larry, and mike. a good premises for a comedy yes but it does not mean it will be a good show.<br /><br />i don't think i've ever heard cruder talk from parents to children and vice versa. the only talk that seems to be in the show is control of children by the parents and sex. i know that sexual intercourse is usually a subject talked about by teenagers often but it is brought up in nearly every episode with no point to it. the one episode i was just watching involved the parents giving their daughter, hilary a car, not once do you think they are related in anyway by the way they talk to each other and how the parents talk about how hilary is like "their slave."<br /><br />the show fails on the comedy level the most. i haven't laughed at this show once in the numerous times i have attempted to watch it, and i'm a person who gave such films as animal house and dumb and dumber very high marks. michael rapaport is a very good actor and why he choose to ruin his career by making this piece of filth show is beyond me. <br /><br />parents, make sure your children never and i mean never watch this. teenagers, you'll probably get a laugh out of this just for the blatant sexual references but nothing comes out of it and afterwards you feel rather empty. <br /><br />1 1/2/ 5 stars.
