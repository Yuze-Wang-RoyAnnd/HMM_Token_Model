definitely not a good film but nowhere as bad as some would paint it to be. nightmare in wax tells the story of a man, having had his face disfigured in a typical flashback scene, wreak his vengeance on those directly responsible and those indirectly for the losses in his life - most notably the love and companionship of a beautiful young actress. cameron mitchell plays the artist with his typical flair, albeit limited flair. actually, i thought he gave one of his better performances. what exactly does that mean? mitchell wears an eye patch, endlessly smokes cigarettes, wears a motley tunic, and talks to his creations in wax. they are not your ordinary wax dummies, but rather people still alive controlled by some serum that makes them lose control of all neurological function. they become zombies in effect. i thought the premise here was inventive if nothing else. it has some ludicrous explanation, but does serve the plot. this is a film of the 60s to be sure with some psychedelic camera-work by bud townsend and company. the acting is mediocre but mitchell, scott brady, and barry kroeger give interesting turns. the wax figures of hollywood's bygone era are done very effectively and most of the location shooting was very credible. the end of the film dissipates into something not quite real - either another example of 60s cultural cinema or the end of the scriptwriter's creativity. i'm banking on the latter. despite its many flaws, i enjoyed the film. the opening scene showing an actor being needled was effectively done as was a police chase on the waterfront.
