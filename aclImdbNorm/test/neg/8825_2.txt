othello is set to burn the eyes of the viewers of this film. the bad depiction of shakespeare's characters, and the terrible rendition of the love that desi & john had, made this movie the horrendous filth that it is. by far, othello, directed by jeffery saks, is beyond mediocre and atrocious. <br /><br />the movie othello is a pitiful drama about the love between john and desi. their faithfulness to one another will be tested by the man's friend. in the opening scene of the film, it is clearly shown that the love between john and desdemona is inseparable beyond belief. moments later, ben jago, john's friend pops out into the screen scaring the viewers and showing them right away how much of a liar and power hungry person he is. <br /><br />by far, this movie was much more horrid than the shakespeare novel itself. with that being said, it does have a miniscule amount of good parts. for example, the love that was shown between john and desi, was depicted very well and it looked that the couple was so inseparable; just as it was explained in the book. although the love between them was shown exceptionally well, it still did not show the jealously that othello had between cass and desi as well as it should. <br /><br />love, jealously, deceitfulness, this movie is based on all three of the main topics that were in the shakespeare novel. the novel however, really explains how all of this came together much better than the movie could. for example, the conclusion of this story ends much more differently in the book than in the film. much more detail is also put into the novel. this is why this film is such a disappointment, trust me, those who have read it will find it disappointing as well. <br /><br />in conclusion, this film was by far, the most horrendous depiction of a novel that has ever been put out by mankind. by avoiding to see this film, not only will viewers save themselves an hour two of their lives, but also save themselves an eye or two from the distasteful face of ben jago popping out at them.
