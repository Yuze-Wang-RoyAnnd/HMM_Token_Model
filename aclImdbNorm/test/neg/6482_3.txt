role-reversal remake of 1942's "the major and the minor" has jerry lewis stepping into the part originally played by ginger rogers, but unfortunately this anemic outing is missing a lot more than just ginger. lewis attempts to pass for a child when boarding a train; he's successful, but the deception leads to a string of comic and romantic confusions. sidney sheldon adapted the screenplay, tossing in musical moments for dean martin (playing yet another in his stable of second-bananas) and a jewel-robbery subplot (which is dire). diana lynn, who played the wily teenager in the original film, plays lewis' love-interest here. she's cute; jerry isn't. *1/2 from ****
