i have been living in istanbul for 24 years and i (a 39 years of experience would suggest) do know what istanbul has gone through all those years.<br /><br />faith akin is still quite young (born in 1973) and falling in the great mistake of being orientalist when looking at turkey (just as his other movie gegen die wand did) this movie seriously lack contemporary urban turkish life and misleads the audience when giving out (quite false) clues as to the geographical and cultural spreading of istanbul.<br /><br />anyone who could speak turkish could easily attest that many underground bands & groups depicted in the movie (siyasiyabend for one ) are so miserable and their members cannot even speak a proper language that they cannot be taken as 'representatives' of the contemporary turkish music. much less a piece of crap which many turkish listeners even do not know about at all.<br /><br />we turks have long been accustomed to 'superficious' westerners who look at turkey with some orientalist point of view: trying to fit the actual turkish image into their mind molds.. what is new in this movie is the fact that now a turkish originated director (faith akin) is making the same mistake: looking at turkey with some false western glasses and scrambling to depict it as if he understands better. all of a vain effort.<br /><br />just ask any turkish friend of yours: what sort of a musical documentary is this without mentioning the names : zeki muren, baris manco, ajda pekkan, teoman, muslum gurses, ibrahim tatlises, ferdi ozbegen?.. and many others who have shaped so far the real music we are listening today?<br /><br />faith akin has a long long lesson to learn before babbling away and confusing other people's minds with false images about the contemporary turkish music.
