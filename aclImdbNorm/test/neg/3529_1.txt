hi y'all,<br /><br />i bought this on dvd from england. you see, i have one of those multi-region players. i thought it would be fun to get a cool movie to show to my friends. well, surprise to amy-jo johnson, she's barely in the movie. although she is on the cover. it's really difficult to imagine how a film this bad got made in the first place. perhaps someone has a trust fund.<br /><br />oh... it's about vampires who live at the beach
