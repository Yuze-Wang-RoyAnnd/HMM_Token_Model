this movie sucked on so many levels! ever seen the dentist? this movie made the dentist look like a masterpiece. i do not recommend this movie to anyone, unless of course you are really really really really really bored, then maybe. it was so corny. the killer reminds you of the grandpa from the monsters, except he has goggles on. when jessica said "i want you to meet someone, my inner bitch, i thought she was going to kick his butt, however all she did was throw a frig-gen trash can at him. i was very disappointed. and when the ranger had the crying scene about his wife, i so felt the pain behind his tears.........not!!!!! so before watching this movie, grab a blanket and a pillow, get comfortable because it is very relaxing.
