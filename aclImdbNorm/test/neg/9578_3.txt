they call this film "euro trash horror". <br /><br />well, it's not horror. the film takes place in europe, so yes, it's "euro". trash? ah yes, it's trash all right.<br /><br />you know you're in for a great movie when, right at the beginning, the dvd gives you text on the screen apologizing for the quality of the print you're about to watch. expect crackles, odd jarring cuts, and for the movie not to fit the screen. plus there's the sound -- at first i thought i was watching a dubbed film. then, watching the lips carefully, i realized that, no, it's that the sound quality is embarrassingly bad and out of synch.<br /><br />the plot itself is fairly goofy -- an old, disfigured woman named dr bannister kills a scientist for his youth formula. i'm not giving much away because when you see the "old woman" it's pretty obvious she's under a layer of thick, badly applied make-up. anyone with a lick of sense, seeing the fake old age, knows what's coming next.<br /><br />yes, the "old crone" is miraculously transformed into a beautiful young woman -- complete with face make-up and a long wig of hair! zounds!<br /><br />when i say the old woman is disfigured, i mean she has cornflakes glued to her face. the film makes no attempt to explain how the cornflakes got there. for that matter, there is no attempt to explain anything at all relating to any of the characters. they're never developed beyond the level of finger puppets. <br /><br />the two policemen pursuing our anti-heroine just wander about, apparently baffled by the simplest clues. the murdered scientist was working on a youth serum, the old woman has disappeared, and we keep running into a young woman -- how do these pieces fit together?! what does it all mean?! one of the cops sweats a lot and pats his face with a cloth. the other smokes a pipe. that's pretty much all we get, character-wise.<br /><br />dr bannister (the crone, now a beauty) goes around wearing odd costumes and then taking them off so we can see her flesh. she has affairs with men. she gets in a catfight with a young woman in a nightgown. she goes to geneva so we can see the lake there. she water- skis a bit, then takes off her wet suit to reveal a strange bead-curtain bikini. she takes off her clothes again in a strange ninja costume striptease.<br /><br />the ending? well, without giving anything away, it's just a bizarre, tacked on conclusion that makes about as little sense as the rest of the picture. it's the sort of thing a writer comes up with when the director wakes him up at 4 am and says, "quick! we need an ending for our movie! what happens next?"<br /><br />the writer mumbles something half awake, and the director runs with it.<br /><br />what's good about this movie? some of the music is campy and fun. that classic 60s organ music that's so corny it's enough to make you laugh out loud. there are some odd seduction scenes, bizarre dialogue, goofy moments. <br /><br />it's very close to being so bad it's good. i did manage to watch it from start to finish without gouging out my eyes or sobbing. i guess that's praise, of sorts.'
