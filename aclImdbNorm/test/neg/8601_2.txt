sometimes when a film is panned by the critics one just has to see it to see if it is really as bad as the claim, well in this case it was. i believe it was meant to be a sex comedy but it was neither sexy nor funny, i think i chuckled once when johnny vegas failed to vault a roadside fence and that was it.<br /><br />the film follows the lives of four men who deliver potatoes for a living, each of them has a problem with their sex lives; dave has left his wife and seeks out an old flame who once invited him for a threesome a few years before, ferris is living with his mother in law who treats him as a sex object, tolly has an obsession for involving strawberry jam in his encounters and jeremy claims to be in a loving relationship but is in fact stalking some poor woman.<br /><br />the tone of the jokes varies from tasteless to "i don't believe that anybody could write that" an example of the the latter being when they tell a small child his father has died in a car crash, then for the punch line when the boy asks how his mum is they tell him she is in a coma. the blame for this all lands squarely at the feet of the writers, the actors obviously made a poor choice agreeing to be in this film but i didn't think their acting was all that bad... not that it was all that good either. surprisingly for a fairly sleazy film about sex there is no nudity and the sex is never erotic.<br /><br />i certainly wouldn't recommend seeing this for any reason other than morbid curiosity although judging from other reviews this seems to be a love it or loathe it film, i suspect it would be better watched after a few beers and with your mates.
