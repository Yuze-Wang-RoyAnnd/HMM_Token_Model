this was like watching the trailer of a up and coming movie, except that there was no movie coming up. the film is so unsatisfying and obviously unfinished as to be almost laughable. the subject of this film is over a very short time frame and frankly, nothing much actually happens in the 90 odd minutes of screen time. i was hoping for the definitive australian film about our soldiers in wwii and how they fought against incredible odds in awful conditions.this is most certainly not it. <br /><br />having said that, the acting was great and locations authentic. this could easily have been a great movie given a lot more money and time, instead it isn't even mediocre and i cannot recommend it at all.
