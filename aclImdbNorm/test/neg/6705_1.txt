notwithstanding that "the house of adam" is meant to be a mainstream gay movie; that anthony (john shaw), who is gay curious and a major cutie-hunk and adam (jared cadwell) who is openly gay, and a close second in looks; that there is a whole minute of wonderful, convincing, and naked lovemaking (sorry, no frontal) between anthony and adam 41 minutes into the movie (that alone may be sufficient for many of us) --- notwithstanding all that (to which i give a thumbs up), "the house of adam" is a horrible movie by most any other movie making standard. a big thumbs down.<br /><br />shaw's and cadwell's acting abilities are either sophomoric or else truly suffer from the bad script, direction, and editing, or rather the lack thereof. their lovemaking scene is nevertheless convincing, and may have more to do with their really being into each other, considering the rest of their scripting and acting.<br /><br />writer-director jorge amer's (bonus feature) self-congratulation as to his movie making skills is off the wall.<br /><br />so, the script and lack thereof is a thumbs down. overall, the acting is thumbs down with just the slightest exception for shaw and cadwell. alexis karriker as nina might have been the best except for the limitations expressed above. far and away the absolute worst, and insufferable, acting was by thomas michael kappier as albert ross, anthony's father having not even of elementary school acting quality. he truly represents a colossal casting failure.<br /><br />the actors playing the new cabin owners are worthy of truly bad acting nominations as well.<br /><br />if only the production, editing and post production were as good as the trailer, this movie would have been quite something else. the trailer presents well put together clips of scenes that drew me into renting the movie in the first place. that, and the hope that this gay-centered movie, was supposedly prominently played and touted at gay film festivals.<br /><br />overall, the movie is a big thumbs down.<br /><br />is it worth buying/renting and watching it? only if you have an irresistible yen to see the naked love making scene, and a few minutes of semi-convincing dialogue between anthony and adam. or if you truly just enjoy watching bad movies.
