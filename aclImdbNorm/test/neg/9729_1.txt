wow! i just don't even know where to begin with what made this movie so awful. maybe i should start by just saying that during a "heated confrontation" between the antagonist and protagonist, i had to leave the theater because i was laughing so hard. yeah. the acting really was that bad. the acting was not even the worst part though. the plot was almost entirely shown in the previews. the characters are all grossly underdeveloped. the dialogue and "dramatic moments" are ridiculous. the bad guy is a caricature of an out of control, power drunk, sadist.<br /><br />but hey the actors are pretty, so guess that was supposed to make it all better.
