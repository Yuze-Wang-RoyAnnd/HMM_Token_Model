i sat down through 2 hours of pure boredom. i look here on imdb, even though it is not high on the list, it is in the top 250. i was a little surpised. even though, yes. i am very impressed with robin and matt's acting abilities, they still didn't save the movie. i'm not sure what i really didn't like about the movie. maybe it's because i dispise math. maybe i'm not too much for dreary talking for 2 hours. even though i loved "american beauty", but that was it. i just want my 2 hours back. it was a big waste of my time. if i'm missing something in this movie, please e-mail me. i am curious why this is on the top 250. and don't say "because it was a good movie".<br /><br />2/10
