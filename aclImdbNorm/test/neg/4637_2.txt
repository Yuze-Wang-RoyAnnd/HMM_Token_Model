this movie has been advertised for over three months in greece as the biggest greek production ever. well, it could be, but... when you hear of a big production you expect to see something new, something different. what you get to watch here is a movie with no reason of existence. george corraface looks like he didn't really enjoy making this movie. his acting is so simplistic, that looks almost amateur. the sound, especially when some of the turkish actors speak english (dubbed?), is full of hiss. the, thankfully few, special effects showing istanbul and athens in the late 50's and early 70's are more like digital paintings than computer graphics. finally, we see the same boy from 1959 (age 5) up to 1968 (age 14), but in a miraculous way he becomes a teenager five years later.<br /><br />so much for "the biggest greek production". at least one would think that there would be some kind of interesting script to qualify for such an expensive production. and all one gets is a love story between 7 year-olds, who meet again 40 years later. oh, there is a political side, too. a couple of ironic remarks about the greek "junta" of '67-'74, so childish that seem almost forced.<br /><br />there are, of course a couple of good things in the movie: most of the actors are great, mainly ieroklis michaelidis, the very good scenery and the magnificent music by evanthia remboutsika; but they are so few for such an expensive production.<br /><br />bottom-line: is it so bad a movie? to tell the truth i don't know. i just know that in no point does it justify its huge (for greek standards) budget.
