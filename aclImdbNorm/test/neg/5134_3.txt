ok, i don't want to upset anyone who enjoyed this film but it was a really bad movie. just the way the scenes were edited and the acting, it made me cringe at some points. i really tried to enjoy it but it was like a student film, they must have had the smallest budget. i really liked the story line to an extent and the characters were likable but the film on a whole was just awful. also, why is it that in almost every film with lesbian characters one of them has to either commit suicide or die or turn straight?!?! this is so sending a wrong and unrealistic message. i gave it 3 stars and everything considered i think that was very kind of me. only watch this film if you want to laugh at how bad it is.
