i took my family to see barnyard this past weekend. we had so looked forward to it but had my kids not been there, my husband and i would have left. coming from a farming community we found the fact that all of the male bovine in the film having udders drawn on them was a little disturbing. we felt like we were watching cross dressing cows or something. it was just odd to hear a male voice come from a female body. after checking some of the production notes on a different website, i felt like the animators might have slipped up on this fact. i know this is just an animated, humorous show but by putting female body parts on a male, i had to suspend my disbelief so much that i just couldn't enjoy the movie like i might have. i know udders can be found funny but they were definitely over used. none of the other animals in the movie seemed to have gender specific body parts drawn on them and i would have preferred the bulls in this show to at least have the correct ones if they had to be drawn on at all. the kids however still enjoyed the movie though we took the time afterward to make sure they knew the difference between bulls and cows.
