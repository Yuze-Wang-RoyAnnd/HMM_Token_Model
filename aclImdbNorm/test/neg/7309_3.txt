the figure of empress elizabeth of austria (1837-1898) is, indeed, mostly associated with romy schneider and the sissi trilogy by ernst marischka (1950s) where beauty, gentleness, sweetness but also history are ever present. this was the sissi, perhaps myth for some; however, a powerful portrayal. the spirit of the habsburgs' grandeur as well as the spirit of the bavarian simplicity and straightforwardness influenced much those films. simply, they did have a soul. however, jean daniel verhaeghe's film, though made 50 years later, appears to be a wrong depiction of the empress and her life. it seems to be an attempt to show something different, to reveal some realism as a cure to sweetness; yet, it does not occur to add a lot but rather deprives the whole story of much. let me analyze that in more details.<br /><br />september 1898, sissi embarks at the port of geneva. accompanied by her court maid, she goes to visit dr mayer (didier bezace) whom she is going to tell the whole life story in order to find herself in this tragic life. the action consists of flashbacks to important moments in sissi's life, yet these moments are chaotically presented and, therefore, someone not very knowledgeable of austrian history may get totally misled or confused. much attention is drawn on sissi's bad marriage with the emperor franz josef. the scene of her wedding night is a failure. no one treated an empress like that (i mean undressing and payment). the focus on sissi being misunderstood is right historically, however, the points that her views differ from the rest of the courtiers' are not the true ones. where is her desire for peace? where is her love to her nation? where is her charity? sissi appears to be rather very elegant, modern, liberal (from the 21st century's point of view). she foremost cares for her looks which is not true historically. sissi had an inner life which is not showed in the film. "once women will wear trousers" is a sentence said by her and occurs to be the image of the sissi presented in the movie. sissi detests monarchy, which is the film's noticeable criticism towards austrian empire. moreover, she partly accepts anarchist movements and, to my very surprise, she blames her husband, emperor franz josef, for the death of rudolph, their son. where is any mention in history that sissi was present in mayerling? sissi's relation with sophie, the mother in law, is better shown, however the scene of sophie's death seems barely authentic and the conversation a bit of clich'e.<br /><br />sorry to criticize so much but another crucial aspect of the movie which i find weak here are performances. although arielle dombasle has her moments as sissi, she generally does not suit to the role. she looks more like a "femme fa tale" than a tragic empress. her make up is seriously inaccurate as well as most of her gestures as the empress. malik zidi is a bit better as rudolph and may be regarded as the one raising the value of the performances, in general. yet, stephane audran does no special job as sophie: you simply don't get the impression of why she detests sissi. she did despise her for the sake of sissi's young age while crowned, for the sake of her behavior, lifestyle and her believes. partly it appears in the movie but definitely that is not enough. but the greatest mistake is, i think, julien hans capua as andrassi. andrassi was a count with pride, honor, patriotism...here, he appears to be a sort of libertine thinking only to make love to his queen. and the portrayal is so weak that this performance is very very pale. the accurate choice is tatyana ivanova as catherine schratt, she really fits to the role with her looks and her gestures. but, unfortunately, her role does not require much time on screen.<br /><br />a good point of this movie are some costumes and pretty authentic locations. the port of geneva is well presented and the moment of sissi's death occurs to be a good surprise from the movie. it does not appear to be how it really was; however, the moment is good from the symbolical perspective...the empress walks and knows nothing that this is her final moment. that is how she must have felt about it, that is how one insane man destroyed a part of greatness of the world. another good moment visually was when sissi talks to her son rudolph on corfu. but these moments are rare.<br /><br />in sum, it's not a good film. it distorts a very eminent historical figure, a significant historical time, it tries to cure the sweetness of sissi trilogy but appears to offer nothing creative. charm is gone, grandeur is gone and history is ignored! not very worth seeking out! 3/10
