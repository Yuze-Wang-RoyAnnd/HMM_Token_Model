i actually trawled through the entire set of reviews, searching for the ones which gave this film less than 5 stars. they were few and far between. which is utterly baffling! yes, i know it's a disney film and it isn't directed by christopher nolan, but good lord. this is straight-to-the-bargain-bucket nonsense. they should've had done with it and animated the bloody thing.<br /><br />and what's even worse is the fact that imdb won't let me simply finish my rant there, because my review needs to be longer! <br /><br />the "awesome" in-game camera shots are literally taken from tiger woods pga tour golf on the playstation, the story plods like a sulking school boy, the multi-stranded character and plot development cripples an already weak setup, and the grand finale is plain boring.<br /><br />aside from that, it really was the greatest film i've ever seen in my entire life. <br /><br />good, authentic-looking costumes, sets and sports equipment. there, i said it.
