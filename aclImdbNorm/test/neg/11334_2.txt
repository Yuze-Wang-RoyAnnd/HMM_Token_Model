!!! spoiler alert!!!<br /><br />the point is, though, that i didn't think this film had an ending to spoil... i only started watching it in the middle, after matt had gotten into sarah's body, but then i became fascinated by the bizarreness of the plot, even for a channel 5 movie... and couldn't possibly see how matt wld end up happy. what about his fiancee? at one stage looked like he was gonna get with his best friend, surely icky and wrong... and then the whole 'oggi oggi oggi' thing does not work as a touching buddy-buddy catchphrase, tis just ridiculous... so was going 'surely he can't just come back to life? and yet how can he live as a woman?' and then the film just got over that by ending and not explaining anything at all!!!!! what's that about??? i was so cross, wasted a whole hour of my life for no reason at all!!! :) but was one of the funniest films i've ever seen, so, swings and roundabouts
