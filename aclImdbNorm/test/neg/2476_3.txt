nothing about this movie stands out as either being great or terrible.<br /><br />in the end, that is what kills it. the blandness is just not good. i can't say i expected better from will smith, but i definitely did from kevin james of "the king of queens"-- but, hey, i'm getting used to saying that a lot lately. this film attempts to make its mark as a witty romantic comedy, but it never hits the bull's-eye. in fact, it never hits *anywhere* within the target. the allergy scene is disturbing; the fact that kevin james can't dance is something that wouldn't exactly catch anybody off-guard, and is therefore (in a movie like this) not funny. this movie constantly tries to win your heart, but always with the wrong ploy at the wrong time. some parts are okay (but i'm searching my brain for examples), but i really think this movie should be avoided.
