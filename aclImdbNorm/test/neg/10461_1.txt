i agree with all the comments posted so far: this movie was a waste of time and energy, for viewers as well as those who made it. terrible cgi, awful script, stupid plot and hey, the setting is alabama but it looks like california. but the worst thing has got to be the native american angle on this, which pulls in every stereotype you can think of, from the chief surrounded by smoke, the angry warrior, people speaking without using contractions ("do not do this thing!"), native american pipes playing in thin air, etc. it just shows such a lack of respect and understanding that i was tearing out my hair. a native american with any ounce of self-respect would have tossed their tv out the window at this trash. so in closing, i'd say this movie is pretty much an offense to everyone.
