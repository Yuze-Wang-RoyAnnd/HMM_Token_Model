are you kidding me? the music was so loud in this show i could often not even hear the dialog. and the music was nothing great. anyone know what jake's mother said when he walked in the door??? and the mushroom cloud looked pretty close to have so little instant devastation. anyone research the effects of nuclear fallout before writing this one. i felt like a bunch of sit com actors were sent on location and didn't know what to do with dramatic dialog. and what does a kansas teen know about shopping in soho....couldn't we have had a better line here? was bored to tears and only kept awake by the jarring blare of the over-mixed way to loud music.
