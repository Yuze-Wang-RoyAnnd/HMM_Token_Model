you get an hour and a half of braindead i have to save the world action all the way, one liners and a woman somewhere in the equation. this time he plays a guy who help people in the witness protection program. to quote the cover of the movie. he erases their past to save their future. woppi, this have to be cool :) i bet younger people will like it though but it is a little over the top for my taste. and the one liners are really something else, and i don't mean that in a good way. after killing a crocodile he manage to say. "you're luggage" if you are in the right mood you may enjoy the movie. and as far as braindead action go, this is not very bad. but almost before the movie starts you know exactly what is going to happen. but if you like these kind of movies, you will probably enjoy this one. i rate this movie 4
