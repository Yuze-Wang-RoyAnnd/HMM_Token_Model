being a fan of the series i thought, how bad can the movie be? well i got my answer. some movies should never be made. why call it a remake of the series when the only similarities are that there are three main characters. the pete character in the series wasn't a whiney little baby as portrayed in the movie. the only good thing in this movie besides the music and that clare danes is pretty was that it was short. what's with that dance scene??? the only reason i didn't walk out of this film was because it was so bad it got funny. maybe that was the plan! it's really bad when a cheap 60's tv show is better then a 90's 20 million dollar film. el mariachi cost only $7000 and is a much better film. don't even waste your money when it comes out on tape, it's not even worth renting.
