you may not believe this, but when the credits to this movie rolled, i looked for the director's name. when i saw it, i burned it into my memory and i never forgot it. this movie is beyond terrible. it makes ed wood's films look like orsen welles. at least b movies are entertaining, this was a soul deadening experience. the quality was so bad, i began to wonder who allowed this to happen.<br /><br />i hear uwe boll runs fourteen miles a day. this is because wherever his movies are viewed, the people must run him out of town with flame and pitchfork. the script was terrible, the lighting was like that of a high school football game, and the cinematography was just above the quality of roger patterson's bigfoot video. the acting was executed by people too ashamed of the production to say their lines with any credibility. in the end was a film alan smithee wouldn't have put his name on. i learned that day to avoid any movie by this man despite the circumstances. from what i hear, this is not a bad thing to do.
