i've seen this at the fantasy filmfest in cologne and left the cinema halfway through this "movie" (with a bunch of other people), so maybe i'm not the right one to comment on it, but i think the fact of leaving "s.c." is reason enough to do so. "s.c." is a different film. people who need a coherent narration, characters or a plotline won't find anything in this one. it's supposed to be an experimental film, relying on the power of images. but these images have no power. they are so forced in their intention of simply grossing people out, that they have nothing else to say. the gibberish of the off-narrator is simply boring, the visuals are cheap. ok, the effects are good, but if that's the only thing, why care? husseins film wants to be shocking and thought-provoking - instead it is boring and annoying in its non-creativity. note: not every movie without a story is art and there is absolutely no creativity in breaking taboos anymore - especially not if everything is executed as bad as in "s.c.". i'd suggest director hussein should either visit a psychiatrist or a filmschool, before he mistakes crap for art again. note: i never want to see a baby getting slashed during birth again.
