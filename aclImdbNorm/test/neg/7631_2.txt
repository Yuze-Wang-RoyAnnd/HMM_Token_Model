with so many good movies coming out in 1995 (particularly "mortal kombat" and "seven"), unfortunately, there had to be some bombs as well, and this film indeed falls into the latter category with a boring, predictable plot and a lousy ending. it seems that antonio banderas hasn't been able to find a decent script since "desperado," the only remarkable film he's done. anyone with an eighth of a brain could tell who demornay's stalker was from the beginning. her flashbacks of the death of her mother did nothing but muddle an already paper-thin story. pity that dennis miller was wasted in this film; this part resembles his eerily similar role in "the net." <br /><br />the convoluted ending had me shaking my head, as i pretty much did throughout the entire movie. plus, any film that depicts animal cruelty in any shape or form, no matter how fake it looks, automatically gets the thumbs-down from me. <br /><br />to make a long story short, if you want to enjoy a good thriller, then avoid this at all costs. never talk to strangers...especially those who recommend this movie. 2/10
