enough talent and sincerity went into making this film that i wish it turned out better. everyone is clearly doing their best to be true to an intriguing premise, but it's too deep a vision, too involved attempt at disentangling mental delusion to survive a transition to the screen. it is an attempt to capture the dimensionality of gossamer patterns on celluloid -- the result is muddled and slow. i give it a 10 for effort, but a 5 overall.
