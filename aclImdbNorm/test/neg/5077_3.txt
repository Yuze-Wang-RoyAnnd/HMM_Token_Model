i have just watched this movie on dvd late this morning and was so disappointed that even thought it was a good joke for the audience. in other words - the creators planed to make comedy not drama. howsoever, at the end i realized that mr. tony giglio was earnest about this movie. it's a pity because: the dialogue is ridiculous, the acting is poor and lifeless, the story is a fishy tale! poor ryan phillippe - despite of his efforts his character in the movie remains probably his worst performance! what to say for jason statham - lack of all kinds of skills to develop the role which is an imaginary fiction... for this reasons i vote: 3/10
