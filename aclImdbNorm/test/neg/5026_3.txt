let me state this right from the start. i do not hate this show. i actually quite like some aspects of it. in fact, when i first started to watch it, i quickly became hooked. i was just starting to come out of the whole "anime is for kids" stereotype, and the mature elements of the show had me intrigued.<br /><br />unfortunately, after seeing the whole series through and a few of the films, i can say that my overall disposition has changed, and it falls into almost all of the pitfalls that plague "bad" anime. seven or eight friends and myself started watching this series on tv. by the end, only one friend and i were still watching and neither of us liked it.<br /><br />allow me to explain the plot for you. you can skip this paragraph if you don't want to know. kagome is an average high school student, who one day falls into a magical well near her family run shrine. when kagome comes out of the well again, she has been transported back in time to the feudal era of japan. she meets up with many other characters and they form a group of five or so companions who set off on a journey of revenge/justice/groping in one characters case =). overall, they are trying to recover the pieces of the sacred jewel shard which enhances the power of demons who use it.<br /><br />while there are many, many side stories and story arcs, there is no were near enough material to occupy 167 episodes. the only story arc that is interesting enough to watch is still sort of dull (the band of seven). after the half way mark in the series or maybe even before, it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and whoever made the series decided instead to put in dozens and dozens of filler episodes. <br /><br />these episodes have little to no impact on the story, and rarely even on the characters. in some cases, some characters who had an important role in the story will disappear for dozens of episodes at a time. many episodes follow the exact same cookie cutter patterns as the stories before it. inuyasha shoots wind-scar at enemy. windscar deflects. characters gasp in horror. enemy turns out to have barrier. characters spent three episodes trying to kill enemy before kagome finally fires sacred arrow at him and he turns to dust. <br /><br />also **major spoiler: the conclusion will be revealed** the lack of any conclusion makes it seem like you have waisted 83 hours. <br /><br />**major spoiler over**<br /><br />the animation itself is above average, and in some cases excellent. even so, reused animation cells plague most action scenes, and it is very hard to ignore them when it is clear that the exact same boulder has flown past a character five or six times in a row.<br /><br />on the brighter side however, all of the characters are very well developed and the romances between some of the characters were truly captivating. also, the character designs (appearences) were brilliant and at times among the best i have seen, particularly with the band of seven. there is definitely no shortage of cosplay opportunities here. even so, i found myself hoping that a character would die just so there would be some sort of movement in the plot. and some of the humour in the show between characters is used again and again. one particular joke (sit boy) is found within the first five episodes, and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining 162 episodes.<br /><br />although there are some good aspects of the show and it is easy to see why it has a huge following, the series seems to be dominated by obsessed fan girls who drool over sesshomiru and inuyasha.<br /><br />bottom line: definitely worth checking out, but not worth watching the whole series. the first 30 episodes are very clever, original and enjoyable for anybody. but after that, it simply becomes dull and tedious. watching a tv show should never feel like a chore, but somehow this series accomplishes just that. don't expect much from "inuyasha", because you will only feel let down.
