this story is about a safari in africa that meets some guy named trent--who convinces them to look for a tribe of white babes. naturally, they turn out to be amazon warriors and capture the men. the rest is pretty predictable.<br /><br />this movie has everything you'd expect in a bargain basement movie about africa--the substantial use of often irrelevant stock footage, film of animals that are not native to the continent (such as orangutans, moose, coatamundis and ground hogs),a white actor in dark makeup playing a native, bad acting (particularly from trent--a handsome man with the personality of balsa wood), comic relief (sounding like chico marx), a guy dressed up in a gorilla suit and bikini-clad white women with perms who are supposedly fierce jungle warriors--like a tribe of angry female tarzans. by the look of it, my assumption is that the movie was made for under $49.95--including developing costs and paying for rental of the gorilla suit! but, what i didn't expect was an imdb score of 4.9. this is poor, but not that poor considering that this is a schlock production in every possible sense and there is no conceivable reason why the film is rated that high! now i am not saying the film isn't worth seeing--it's campy and stupid enough to make enjoyable viewing--particularly with friends. just don't expect anything resembling a professionally made or competent film.<br /><br />finally, here's a smattering of the dialog from this jungle classic:<br /><br />"oolama like strong white man. oolama want strong white man..."<br /><br />"oonga-bunga" <br /><br />"me-te-tonga....no,....keeel ('kill') man"
