jack brooks' quirks are, at first, somewhat charming and lend to the deliberately campy feel of the beginning of this movie.<br /><br />i found myself getting angrier and angrier as i was duped into seeing this one through to the end, in hopes that the payoff would be worth the super-tedious wait.<br /><br />the climax can't begin to make up for all the setup time.<br /><br />normally one might expect shallow characters from this genre. but the fact that the wait-time-before-action index is so high, should mean that the meantime would be devoted to some interesting character development.<br /><br />not so.<br /><br />while not without its initial charms, this movie ultimately infuriates, and disappoints.<br /><br />wish i could get all that setup time back, to reinvest it into something that pays off.
