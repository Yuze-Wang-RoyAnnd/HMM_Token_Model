"beowulf" is like a very bad game : no characters, no story, no real dialogues, bad fights ... it's probably the worst movie in the history of cinema. it's deadly boring, a lost of time. i'm really sorry for christophe lambert, who visibly doesn't know how to choose a role. if someone suggests you to see "beowulf", believe me : run like mad.
