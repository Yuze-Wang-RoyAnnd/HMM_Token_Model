if pulp fiction and get shorty didn't exist this might be an ok film.when i say this i mean that nothing from this film is it's own unless it's another bit of terrible dialogue or a clich'e full scene.all the lines like 'i won't say more than i have to if that' from get shorty seem to appear in this rubbish sequel, all the cameos like steven tyler's are acted terribly and are not needed and as for christina milian, man, don't get me started.sadly some of the coolest actors and actresses like john travolta and uma thurman seem like they are trying to be down with the kids and hip and have nearly ruined there reputation because of this film and frankly i think the best acting is from the rock who plays alongside one of my least favourite actors, vince vaughn.the man tries to be funny throughout with him taking the mickey of how apparently rappers talk.cedric the entertainer and andre 3000 play another terrible double act {i personally think the background actors were better than cedric and andre} and the only funny part of the acting of cedric,andre and the rest of there gang do is the way there trousers are down to there knees so you can clearly see there boxers and the only reason i find this funny is because lots of people actually do that.so in conclusion this film tries to be funny and fails miserably, it doesn't have any new material, comedy or coolness throughout as it copies every other film and finally the only reason you should see it is if you want to compare how bad it is to it's brilliant predecessor get shorty.oh yes i forgot to mention there is a big clich'e at the end.
