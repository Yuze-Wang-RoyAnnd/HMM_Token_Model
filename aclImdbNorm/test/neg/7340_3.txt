i was living in barstow ca. in 1968 when the movie the killers three arrived at the local theater. the trailer was enough to get me to pay my hard earned money to see this movie. i was really expecting a bonnie and clyde movie and i got dick clark playing a shy nerdy guy while robert walker and diane varsi played an poor attempt of reinacting bonnie and clyde. needless to say it never went over well. maybe this is why it never made it to video. even as a kid i was left some what ripped off as i left the theater. after all the best parts where in the trailer of the movie. the movie was dull and pretty much pointless. by the way, dick clark gets killed so it wasn't a total let down.
