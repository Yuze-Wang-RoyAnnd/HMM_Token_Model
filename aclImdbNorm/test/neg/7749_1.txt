the director of this waste of celluloid specialises in dreadful exploitation films where pretension is all; the previous year he did "dangerously close" whose good idea (about gangs getting too much power in school and the school paper editor against them) was submerged in a sea of sloppiness, and he would go on to do "cyborg," jean claude van damme's worst film ever (no mean feat). this would-be comedy about a girl - kathy ireland in her film debut - who's a total schlump whose inner babe is only awakened after she falls to the centre of the earth and has a set of badly filmed, impossible-to-follow adventures (chiefly involving a set of dwarves who want her because she has big bones - go figure!) before returning home changed for the better isn't funny, gripping or entertaining in the slightest. and anybody watching this to salivate over miss ireland will be put off too - not because of her voice, but because she spends most of the film buried under tons of baggy clothes, with huge glasses to boot. no wonder cannon, the producers, are out of business. amazingly, kathy ireland has made better films since then...or maybe that isn't so amazing. next to this, "barb wire" is "aliens."
