this movie is not that good at all.its pretty stupid, pretty annoying, and very poorly done.i really only saw this film was because one of my friends said they hated this film.although i didn't hate it as much as them, i still found it to be a pretty bad film.the only thing that is remotely good about this was that it was a little entertaining at times, and also i feel that if it had been done a little better it would have been equally okay.what i mean by a little better is that if it had been totally recast, not have had it looked like it had been shot for a film festival, and if the script had been improved it would have been a okay slasher film.instead it isn't but instead what it is now, a crappy film.the acting is atrocious i felt as if i was watching a couple of teens act for like a halloween show or thrill ride or something.the kills are pretty cheap(as is the film itself), and basically everything else is low-class.overall this film really is bad and you wouldn't be missing out on anything if you decided to skip this film.<br /><br />3.8 out of 10 stars
