no holds barred is a movie that should in no way ever be taken seriously. it sucks hardcore as a serious movie. look at it more in the way that you should plan 9 from outer space. they are one in the same in that they are both so bad they are funny. the funny moments in no holds barred are usually the ones that aren't supposed to be. when rip (played by hulk hogan as only he can play them) grabs the limo driver out of the front after his first meeting with brell (kurt fuller) hilarity ensues and it is one part of the movie that every person should see. it might be the funniest scene ever, i swear.<br /><br />anyway, how someone thought this movie would make money i'll never know and that person should probably be beaten into submission. i hope they at least got fired. this movie earns a 1 out of 5 on my scale and that one is just for the unintentionally funny parts.
