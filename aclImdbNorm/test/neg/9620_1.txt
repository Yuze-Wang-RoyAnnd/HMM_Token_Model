i saw this film when it premiered in la. i think i laughed 2 or three times. the rest of the time i was in shock at how ridiculous/poorly shot and poorly written it was. kirby is in fact the only saving grace in the film. i was disappointed at the performance of larry bagby , whom i usually find entertaining. if you enjoy watching your friend's crappy homemade short films that they shot on their mom's 8mm video camera then there's a slight chance you might enjoy this film. then again part of what makes those movies enjoyable is that it's your buddies playing all the parts. you don't know these people so you'll probably find it as dull and stupid as i did. dear mr. nelson, go back to film school, intern for a while as a pa or a grip or some low level job so you can see how things are properly done in film . then look for as long as you must to find a director of photography who knows what f. stop means, make sure he has nd filter on hand. then try again. repeat as many times as needed.
