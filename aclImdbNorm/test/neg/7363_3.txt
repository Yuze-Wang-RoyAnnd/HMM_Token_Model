as a canadian history major, my first thing to say : historical facts are not accurate! how can a producer do that? the deportation of the acadian wasn't in 1759 when we see franklin in london, but in 1755! how can he pass that in the movie? the scenes in londo were useless too. then for the story for anyone that read "les anciens canadians", you have the story line right there. it's the story of la coriveau, that "witch". add a love story too and a tragic relationship between mother and daughter ending. sure, it brought tears to my eyes. but that's it. then there's the fact it's apparently set up in qu'ebec city, but it's mostly shot at the forteresse de louisbourg. sure it's a historical site and it's accurate to the time, but it was obvious that the scenes were not all set in qu'ebec city. overall, if you're looking for a documentary of new france, go get candad : a people's history, a real documentary on the history of canda and new france. if you want a love story that will bring you tears, a story set up in a wonderful forest, watch new france.
