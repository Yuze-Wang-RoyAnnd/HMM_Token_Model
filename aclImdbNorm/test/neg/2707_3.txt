the laughs are few and far between in this dull movie, and i can't help but wonder about how this mess ever got made in the first place. about the only good thing in this movie is the talent of griffin dunne, but his best efforts were easily overshadowed by madonna's obnoxious performance. i was able to sit through this without getting too bored, but that's probably the nicest thing i can say about this time-waster.
