oh dear. this sequel has a mirror, this time, which houses the evil spirit of a psychopath which murdered an entire family with a shotgun in the amityville home. the mirror captured the entire ugly incident of the horrified family who had no time to prepare for their uninvited guest. the mirror is given to a photographer, keyes(ross partridge)by a bum(..who just so happens to be his lunatic father, and the man responsible for killing the family)and it's evil soon terrorizes those in a loft(..such as keyes' painter pal suki, portrayed by julia nickson-soul)where he lives when they look into it. soon keyes is having nightmares, looking through the eyes of his father as he guns down the family in cold blood, worried that he might follow in his footsteps. soon he sees other occurrences through his father's eyes like that terrible day pops bashed his mother's head against the floor of an institution or experiencing a moment inside the cell as doctor's administered a drug to immobilize him.<br /><br />pretty solid supporting cast who deserve better than being stuck in junk like this, such as david naughton(american werewolf in london)as the proprietor of the loft with which keyes lives, richard roundtree as an eccentric sculptor/artist, terry o'quinn as a psychologist-detective, and especially lin shaye as a hilarious ditsy, rather strange secretary-nurse in the asylum(..the one which held keyes' father) soon to be closed down.<br /><br />rounding out the film, the sexy, leggy lala sloatman as keyes' supportive girlfriend, barbara howard(friday the 13th:the final chapter)as naughton's betrayed wife(..he was on the verge of starting an affair with nickman-soul), jack orend as the sadistic fiend who attempts to provoke his son into killing innocent people as he did, and robert rusler(a nightmare on elm street 2:freddy's revenge)as a rejected lover(..of nickson-soul)who meets an unfortunate demise while ripping apart paintings as a revenge for his dismissal.<br /><br />this film is a poor special effects movie merely using the amityville title as a cash-in. the franchise has never been that great to begin with, but as each sequel was green-lit, it grew worse and worse. after the third film, furniture from the infamous house become "possessed" items tormenting folks. the cast try hard, though, but the material(..a mirror causing chaos and murder through supernatural means)is lacking in quality..and the rather mediocre special effects don't help matters. o'quinn, as little as he has to work with, shows why he's such a great actor, he can even shine in excrement such as this. all's not lost, you get to see sloatman always wearing super short skirts(..or her man's shirt in panties), showing off her legs throughout..hey, you have to find a silver lining somewhere. believe it or not, amityville:a new generation was the seventh film in the franchise! coolest part of the film were the portraits of demons painted by nickson-soul's artist, perhaps inspired by the evil mirror after looking into it.
