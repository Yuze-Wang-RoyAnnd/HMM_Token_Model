if andrei tarkovsky had been a hack, he would have directed mother and son instead of mirror. this is the single most pretentious film made anywhere in the world, i am convinced. a son, without a name, takes care of his mother, without a name. they love each other, i guess. no, they don't, i'm sure. these aren't characters. they aren't even actors playing characters. at least it could be pretty, but even the nature seems ridiculously touched up and changed wherever it was necessary with a macintosh computer. and could sokurov have come up with a technique as hackneyed as a distorted aspect ration? you would have to have been born yesterday to buy this garbage. 1/10.
