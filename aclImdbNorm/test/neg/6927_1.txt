i really wanted to love this film. i have read the book to my daughters and we all loved it. the book is marvelous. this film is very far from the book. the book is splendid - this film is an awful adaptation.<br /><br />in the book, sara is honorable, kind, strong, and never does anything spiteful to get back at anyone. that's the point of the book! she behaves as a "princes" regardless of circumstances. an important part of behaving like a princess is to not return unkindness. it is to behave honorably regardless of how you are being treated.<br /><br />in the book, she endures much and touches the lives of others. other people change their behaviors after they witnessed her kindness and ability to endure without sinking to spite and vengefulness. sara does what is right simply because it is right.<br /><br />outside of the bakery, she comes upon a beggar girl who is more poor and hungry than she is. she has half a dozen hot buns. she is very hungry. she gives one bun to this wild looking little girl huddled on the doorstep of the bakery. when she sees how ravenous the girl is and watches her gobble the bun, she gives her another. she continues to do this until she has given 3 or 4 i think - i don't remember how many.<br /><br />the baker is watching through the window. she is so moved by what she has witnessed, she takes the beggar girl in and raises her as her own daughter. other people are similarly influenced by sara.<br /><br />and in the book, her father has died. the man next door is her father's partner - he has been looking for her. her father did not lose his money after all - the man is thrilled to find sara; he takes her and becky into his home and raises them as his daughters. and sara has her full inheritance, of course.<br /><br />miss minchin is not a chimney sweep. in fact, she remains in her same post at the school. but she is humiliated as sara has told her new guardian of the cruel treatment she received. and sara does speak to miss minchin in the end - miss minchin is trying to minimize her treatment of sara and sara with a calm steadfast demeanor, instructs miss minchin that she had been cruel.<br /><br />there is no comeuppance for miss minchin. she continues on in her miserable existence. it does not matter - what matters is that sara has a home with a guardian who loves her - and her dearest friend in the world, becky, is now for all intents and purposes, her sister.<br /><br />the book is about love and honorable behavior under the worst of circumstances. it is about self control and humility. it is a wonderful book. this film does nothing to capture the true story and messages of the book. my wife was so disgusted with it, she wanted to leave the theater in the middle, but we decided to stick it out. we were not rewarded.<br /><br />i cannot for the life of me think of a reason the film makes should alter this excellent book in such a bad direction. perhaps it was the influence of the ghastly screenplay from the book that shirley temple acted in. i don't know - but this film is so far from the book in character and values that i do not recognize it.<br /><br />don't waste your time - buy the book. it is unforgettable... even for a dad!
