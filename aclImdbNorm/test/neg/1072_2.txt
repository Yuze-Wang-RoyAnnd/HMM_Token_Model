honestly, mr. thalluri.... if you do a drama movie in a high-school setting following a bunch of teenagers through a school day and if you mess up the time-frame and jump back and forth... if you do that, you can't use the exact same visual story telling device of "elephant" which is using a camera that is passing of from one character to the next and having scenes shown 3 times from different angles. you just can't do that because this is such a blunt rip off its hard to believe anyone gave this more than a 5 rating.<br /><br />where "elephant" (which was released 3 years prior to this movie) uses school shootings (or to be exact the columbine shooting) as the focal point for its script 2:37 uses teen suicide and seeing the reviews the shock value of that subject worked. its the same slow story telling, a lot of dramatic piano music all leading to a finale you know from the beginning. at least the characters look like they tried hard to be somewhat different in that department. so you got a untypical gay guy who looks acts like a stoner/skater, a hunky lover-boy who can't deal with his gay side, brother and sister from a rich family who both got their very own problems and here comes the nose dive. <br /><br />you also get a spoiled bulimic chick and one of the most ridiculous characters ever... a guy with medical conditions who wets his pants because of "2 urethra syndrome" who actually never heard of the invention of diapers but rather pisses his pants in the classroom and then change into new clothes and does so every day! wow, as hard as this movie tries to be realistic this is the most absurd thing i have ever heard. he gets beaten up on the toilet and is obviously ashamed of it but doesn't wipe the blood of his nose when going through the whole school with wet pants and a bleeding nose. thats new-age realism directly leading to "the twist" and final character who turns out to be the suicide victim...<br /><br />after watching the "very realistic" life of teenagers (one day including, incest-rape, teen pregnancy, bulimia, parental pressure for grades and appearance and the gay subject mentioned before, kind of like your "very realistic" daily soap... trying hard to be) we watch a girl die we met once in the beginning of this movie and who has no reason but that the guy she had a crush on left the room when she was talking to him (in a thoughtful piano playing sequence btw, seen that somewhere before??). and it gets even better... before slitting her wrist in a painful long scene of "yes" and "no" she asks 2-urethra-guy if he is ok, constantly smiling and then she cuts her wrist with scissors in a school toilet. <br /><br />now you got a movie that is a total rip-off of elephant, fails with some really sloppy story telling (the whole rape-incest thing was pretty unbelievable too by the way) and people call this a shocker.<br /><br />what the heck is going on?? is all it takes to take some pseudo-dramatic music, boring story telling and adding a shock subject on top and people think there is a major deep message here?? i think elephant is way overrated already but that movie was the original while this here is an obvious rip-off failing on many more levels. i have never ever seen a more brazen stealing of a whole movie concept in my life... and believe me i watched a hundred of horror movies so i know how low you can go there. this is a total let down in all departments... its nor realistic, its stolen, its damn slow and by all means i wonder whats more useless... another romantic suicide (many give this point to the movie which makes me wonder if they only watch romeo+juliet all day long because there is dozens of movies which deal with the subject in a clear non-romantic and more realistic way) or this ridiculous set up... come on! i am still trying to work out if 2-urethra-guy or the suicide itself is more unrealistic and ridiculous.
