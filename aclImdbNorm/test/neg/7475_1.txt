when the opening shot is u.s. marines seriously disrespecting the u.s. flag, a movie has a tough road ahead, but unfortunately it was downhill from there. there is a military adviser credited, who is also apparently a retired u.s. marine, making it even more baffling that this incredible breach of protocol, and law, went unnoticed. even more baffling is the way they simply glossed over how a marine is reported kia, then buried, in very short order, without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body, or if there even was a body. the u.s. government is still finding the missing from wwii, and it takes months to identify the remains. military shot down remain mia for months or years and are only declared kia when the remains have been positively identified, or after years of red tape. here we are expected to believe that it happens within a matter of days or weeks. maybe this happens in denmark, but not in the u.s. clearly none of the people involved ever had the slightest involvement with, or respect for, the u.s. military.<br /><br />beyond that, there are a number of other utterly laughable moments when characters come up with zingers out of nowhere. there must have been some really extended meetings between auteur and actors as they struggled to find their motivation for such hogwash. having a script that worked might have helped, but this one seems to have been made up on the spot, working from cliffs notes. there's no way to know if the script was this awful originally, or if it was the auteur, or the middle-management kids at the studio who bear responsibility. either way, this is an awful movie that should have never been made.
