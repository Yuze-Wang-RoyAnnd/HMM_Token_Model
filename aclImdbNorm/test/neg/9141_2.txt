this is a failure so complete as to make me angry.<br /><br />all of the subtlety and structure of reggio's early films is gone, leaving nothing but a hash of digitally smeared images whose sole purpose seems to be whining about bad things humans do. just how do star trek-like wormhole graphics, slo-mo colorized seascapes, mutiplicities of obviously fake computer icons, and shots of athletic competition that, incidentally, show that no one has ever been able to top (or even match) leni riefenstahl for filming bodies in motion, edited together with an overlay of video colorization that a 1980s "dr. who" producer would have rejected as "too cheesy," add up to a polemic against "civilized violence"? there is no intellectual, emotional, or visceral connection between these images as assembled and mutated by reggio and way too many digital effects artistes, and the cautionary tale i assume he wanted to produce. with all of the "dramaturgical consultants" involved, no one seems to have pulled his head out the his own feeling of saying something important and considered that they might all be failing to say something new.<br /><br />only people who watch too much television could make such a film and believe that it's meaningful; this is kindergarten stan brakhage, and ultimately gutless in its relentless obviousness. the only irony and tension evident here (unlike in "koyaanisqatsi" where the relentless beauty and strangeness of time-altered ordinary images forced you to consider their meaning) was when the dvd i was watching jammed and skipped. this is mtv for the noam chomsky crowd, based on reflex rather than reflection and signifying nothing. two stars for the music, which is in glass's best pomo-cesar franck style and features some passionate cello from yo-yo ma. (i hope for his sake that he didn't have to record his parts to a playback of the film; there are some things you shouldn't have to do even for a paycheck.)
