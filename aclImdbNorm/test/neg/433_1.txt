hello people,<br /><br />i cannot believe that "shades" from that thing you do took this role. i don't think cory feldman would have taken this role. this movie was a fuming pile of dung. save your money and time, and see every one of the top 250. i swear i wanted to slap the lady at blockbuster silly for permitting me to rent this. stay away!!!!!!<br /><br />mr. hipp
