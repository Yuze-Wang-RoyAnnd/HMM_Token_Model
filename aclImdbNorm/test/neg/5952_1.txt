i cannot believe i actually set up a 'season pass' on my tivo for this, apparently they had a good preview or something .. i can't imagine it though. after seeing about 5 minutes i thought to myself.. why am i watching this.. it is definitely not reality, and some of the worst acting i have ever seen on television.. i am a total addict of reality tv and there is nothing real about this. the acting.. (if you can call it that) is awful.. the only ones that are almost 5% decent are the girls that are meant to draw viewers to the show.. although they would need to be a lot prettier to save this train wreck.. if they would have more lines they would probably change my mind as they probably have no talent either. this is obviously a very low budget production with 'actors' who are apparently very cheap. there is no way they could get a job in anything else. someone needs to direct these people to a job in food service.. maybe they could do that. oh and by the way, parco p.i. no longer occupies any space on my tivo or tivo's season pass list. definitely the worst show i've ever seen.
