the other lowest-rating reviewers have summed up this sewage so perfectly there seems little to add. i must stress that i've only had the cockney filth imposed on me during visits from my children, who insist on watching the sunday omnibus. my god, it's depressing! like all soaps, it consists entirely of totally unlikeable characters being unpleasant to each other, but it's ten times as bad as the next worst one could be. the reviewer who mocked the 'true to life' bilge spouted by its defenders was spot-on. if anyone lived in a social environment like this, they'd slash their wrists within days. and i can assure anyone not familiar with the real east end that it's rather more 'ethnically enriched' than you'll ever see here. take my advice - avoid this nadir of the british tv industry. it is evil.
