i'm a big fan of thomas harris,i read all his novels at least 5 times and hannibal's the book i really love the most.therefore the movie was my biggest disappointment and i really don't get it why some folks here give it a nine or even a ten.either their demands are very low or they haven't read the book or both.even if i hadn't read the book i'd still consider the movie as absolute average and i'd give it a five. the creepy,mysterious atmosphere from the novel doesn't appear one single time in the movie,when i saw it first in the cinema i even fell asleep.why was margot verger, a very important character, totally omitted? why was barney shown as a dumb ignorant whose only ambition is to earn money? and most of all, why was the psychological process starling went through in the end,caused by the drugs lecter applied to her,descended? not to speak about the fact that the ending was omitted,too,and totally changed? well, the reasons why jodie foster refused to play starling again are well known and i accepted it,although like surely many others i'm very disappointed 'cause i identified starling with her.for stories like red dragon,the silence of the lambs or hannibal that possess such psychological depth, it is very important to identify with a character when they're adapted for the screen,but as the germans say, that's "snow of yesterday". ridley scott did some incredibly good movies but with this one he doesn't live up to his name. jonathan demme had exactly the right feeling for the plot, the characters and their relationships towards each other in the silence of the lambs, he should have done hannibal,too.my only comfort is that i've seen the movie only two times,it's long ago and thank god for that reason i'm able not to see the scenes from the movie when i read the novel. i'm so sorry but i really can't recommend it to anyone.
