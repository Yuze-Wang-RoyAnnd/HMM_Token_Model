how is it in this day and era, people are still dumb enough to think that other dumb stuff is smart? maybe dumb people like watching stuff that makes them feel smart. such as 'the war at home'. 'cuss it's even dumber than the dumb people who watch it. there are no jokes, only half-jokes and slight gags that barely even warrant a tiny internal smile. the acting is your typical, unsubtle, idiotic, standard sitcom flailing-limbs type acting. and why oh why did this crap replace arrested development? well you gotta hand it to fox. they know that they need to have stupid shows to attract all the stupid viewers. you see, the reason arrested development wasn't massively popular was because it was so smart. it was so smart that it made dumb people feel bad about being so dumb. and of course, if a dumb person encounters a smart person, the dumb person will hate the smart person. most of the time anyway. either that, or try and mooch off of the smart person. if you like this show, and are one of the dumb people, i truly cannot fathom what it must be like not to have open eyes and open minds. i cannot fathom what it must be like to be mindless, laughing drones, influenced by every little thing. basically, people who laugh with a laugh track are parrots. trained, obedient, mindless parrots. maybe i shouldn't insult parrots by comparing them to you. you know who you are. (if i seem like a bastar* in this review, it's because i'm so annoyed at ad being canceled.)
