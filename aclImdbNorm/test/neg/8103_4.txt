"black dragons" is a second feature wwii propaganda film popular at the time. it's not as bad as some would have you believe.<br /><br /> a secret meeting hosted by the respected dr. william saunders (george pembroke)is interrupted by a mysterious stranger names monsieur colomb (bela lugosi). shortly thereafter the participants at the meeting begin to turn up murdered, their bodies being placed on the steps of the japanese embassy in washington. colomb is suspected. federal agent dick martin (clayton moore) is assigned to the case and meets saunders niece alice saunders (joan barclay) who tries to assist him. the reasons behind colomb's actions are not explained until the final reel. until all is explained at the end, the story is hard to comprehend. <br /><br /> lugosi who had by this time been reduced to appearing in a string of low budget quickies, is actually quite good in this one. he is not allowed to over act as much as he ususlly did and credit for this has to go to director william nigh. lugosi's character slinks through the shadows and is reminiscent of his dracula even to the point of the full close ups of his piercing eyes.<br /><br /> clayton moore, a one dimensional actor at best, would become tv's lone ranger in a few years. joan barclay makes a good heroine.<br /><br /> although a little dated now, "black dragons" is not a bad way to spend an hour.
