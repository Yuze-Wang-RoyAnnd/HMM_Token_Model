don't get me wrong, i love stephen king! and this is a pretty good movie over all. the rabid cujo is very scary and the movie is suspenseful. but after the first few minutes that poor donna and her little son tad were held captive in their pinto by the rabid st. bernard, i began to wonder why she didn't do something to help herself.<br /><br />she could have stuck her foot out the door and pushed the car backwards (i mean, it was a pinto for pete's sake and they were on a downhill incline) and rolled to safety, but then it would have been a very short movie. when she got the car started, did she pop it into reverse and hope that she could get at least get part way down the driveway? no, she tries to make a three point turn in a car with a bad alternator. she did manage to get out of the car and look around for 45 seconds or so at one point to try and get to a baseball bat that was lying on the ground nearby--what a waste of time! i mean, if you're going to make a run for the bat, do it and at least you'll have something to hit the dog with. but, forget the bat. were there no tools in the car, like a tire iron or something? i didn't see her looking in the spare tire well of the car. really, why wait until you're bitten and weak from dehydration and your son is having seizures before you make a stand against the animal?<br /><br />at the end of the movie she was battered and torn, but by god she was still wearing high heels!
