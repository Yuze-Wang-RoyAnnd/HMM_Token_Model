this movie, "desperate measures", was.... i'm not quite sure how to even put it into words. was this supposed to be a comedy? i couldn't stop laughing at how absolutely ridiculous it was. i love michael keaton, and i cannot actually comprehend that he did this. they did a good job at keeping my attention because i couldn't wait to see how much more ridiculous it was going to get minute by minute. i actually just registered on this site so that i could get this out. i don't review movies. i don't have time for this, but i cannot let this go knowing i haven't done my civil duty by letting people (those who have an iq of 85 and above) know that this is no action/thriller, it is honest to goodness funny. you people that actually got thrills off of this scare me. go watch a good movie like million dollar baby. clint eastwood's acting is not superb, but i was balling at the end. exercise your brain america!
