this movie is terrible, it was so difficult to believe that katie became a heartfelt teenager with the power to save the pity chinese people, the movie didn't show any convincing argument to prove that. and the rest of the plot didn't make any effort to show us more than a cheap common sense... <br /><br />the plot is ridiculous and the only thing we can extract from it is that it demonstrate how arrogant a human can be. katie must have inherited her arrogance from her mother, the most annoying character i have seen for a long time. <br /><br />the acting and scenery were ok, but the plot ruins everything, full of cheap clich'es and hypocritical scenes, i expect not to see this movie again in my life. skip this one!
