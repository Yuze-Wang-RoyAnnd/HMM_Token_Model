move over manos. back off boogens. it doesn't take a baby genius to know that malibu beach vampires (mbv for the rest of this tome) is now and always will be (unless someone makes a sequel to zarkorr the invader) the worst film ever. the only horror in this thing is watching it. i wonder if this was an attempt for someone to meet babes by casting a movie. if this was the case, the babes ain't babes just like this ain't a movie. it's dreck. no wait. i dishonor the word dreck by calling it dreck. ulli lommel (of boogey man fame) would call it "uber dreck" or scheisse. it should be used to torture prisoners. if you find it on a shelf in a video store, back away from it quietly and notify the authorities.
