if good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made. the film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care. it is about patriotism and about patriotism in a healthy way.<br /><br />not quite ten years after the film, i knew air force officers who taught my r.o.t.c. classes at university. they were intellectuals. they thought deeply about their work. they has senses of humor. one had been a crew member on the first plane to drop a hydrogen bomb. i have wondered if any one of them died in vietnam. i imagine that they flew missions there.<br /><br />regrettably, the film fails. the movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative. no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie. her susan holland is a woman that one would flee, not embrace. col. james stewart (who as then a colonel) makes a good stab at this role as lt. col(and later col.) dutch holland. but the most interesting thing he does in the role is bite into a sandwich. i'm not kidding. stewart was good as biting in sandwiches as he did in the spirit of saint louis. <br /><br />one might think of ted williams, but i don't when i watch mr. steward in the role. i do think of william holden as lt. harry brubaker in the bridges at toko-ri . the comparison is not good for mr. stewart, who seems wasted in this film.<br /><br />footage shot from a b-36 looks like outtakes from commercials for an airline. though beautiful, the aerial shots are mundane. for the time, they might have impressed viewers. the crash in greenland involves unexciting modeling you expect the outcome to be good.<br /><br />the undertone--the subtext-- for the film voices the tedium that air force flight crews must have felt during their long missions and the banality that the air force used to make its business--well business like any other business. one imagines how a la nouvelle vague director might explore this theme and then one begins to think about how someone with imagination might have filmed this movie. little moments are missed.when crews returned from long missions, the members of the crew got a shot of scotch and a massage before debriefing the mission. showing that might have helped.<br /><br />banality was the image the air force wanted and mr. mann accommodated the brass. maybe, in that sense, the film works, but not for me.<br /><br />i mourn when i watch the movie, because i think all of us, director, actors, crew, viewers, and members of the armed services might have enjoyed giving and getting much more than we get here.<br /><br />i don't think that this movie had to be dr. strangelove or 2001, both of which it presages, but it had potential never realized. yet, i enjoy watching it. i think of the airmen on their long missions and the ground crews in isolated places. there is a certain sense of honor celebrated here and i celebrate that honor. <br /><br />i certainly understand why people who praise this movie here and other places appreciate it. if there were no intentional fallacy, it would get a 10 from me.<br /><br />.
