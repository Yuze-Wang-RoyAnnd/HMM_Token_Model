i supposed 'scarecrow gone wild' is a dull slasher flick. yes, it have some good point, but it's a rehash from another flick. the acts is so awful nor the plot. <br /><br />the story goes from a legend about a living scarecrow on the cornfield. when an initiation become a prank and cause the life a boy in jeopardy, the scarecrow comes alive and start a killing frenzy. sound familiar, right? it's derived from scream, friday the13th, jeepeer creepers, children of the corn, you name it!<br /><br />'scarecrow gone wild' is so below average film. barely have a scary moment. even the final scene is laughable! sadly, we still could enjoy it as our time killer. but i prefer you to watch something else instead. unless you're a big fan bad and cheesy movies, off course.<br /><br />4/10
