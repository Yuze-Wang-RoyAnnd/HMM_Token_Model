i don't think i've ever gave something a 1/10 rating, but this one easily gets the denomination. i find it hard just to sit through one of his jokes. it's not just that the jokes are so bad, but combine that with the fact that carson daily has zero charisma, can't set up or finish a punchline, and you've got a late night comedy recipe that will really turn your stomach.<br /><br />i have watched the show, never in its entirety, but many times still. it just creeps up on me after conan. i usually watch a minute or two just to see if carson daily is still the worst talk show host ever.<br /><br />actually if you ever do see him interviewing a guest, it's just that, an interview. i feel so sorry every time he has a guest on and their confused smiles try to mask their body language that's screaming, "get me the hell away from this freak!" i do recommend watching the show, not for a laugh, but to ponder, how he got on the air and what he's still doing there. watch as much as you can, i think you will find its complete awkwardness...interesting.
