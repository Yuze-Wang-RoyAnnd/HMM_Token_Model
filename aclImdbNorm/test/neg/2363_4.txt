now any blaxploiation fan will recognise the ingredients: big afros, topless babes, surreally bad fashions and some 'jive' talk. in this case add in a lead who can't act, a plot that makes little sense, editing by someone with no hands who has been blindfolded and the most god-awful fight scenes and you have 'tnt jackson'. not quite bad enough to be good, but not good enough to be bad, this is a wonderful mess from start to finish. i especially loved the endless continuity errors and the lead's white stunt double.<br /><br />this is so '70s bad far eastern martial arts meets black power that it hurts, but boy it hurts so good! i am ashamed to admit that i almost enjoyed it.
