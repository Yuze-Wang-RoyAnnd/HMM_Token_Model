ah the sci-fi channel. how often do you disappoint me? quite often i think, do you ever show good movies? ok you have given me the great 'heroes' and the reasonably good 'the lost room' but they are series, and as for the movie well there really is nothing positive to say. bad acting, bad directing, terrible characters and a shallow story, and that is just for starters. i checked out the director allan a goldstien and was not surprised to find nothing of interest in his resume (in fact i am half thinking that this is a pseudo name). the premises of four motor bikers out motto-crossing in a national park when one of them has an accident that needs a park ranger to come rescue them only for them to get caught in a forrest fire is weak and predictable that you know every beat before it happens. leading man bryan genesse the park ranger is so bad it is terrible. cast as the action hero martial arts boy in the footsteps of so many others this guy makes seagal and van damme look like de nero. the supporting cast are little better and well before the end one was left hoping the fire would engulf them all then the film crew. avoid at all costs
