preposterous twaddle executed in a bewilderingly amateurish and inept way -- or perhaps several since the incredible lack of continuity, tone, realism, plausibility, suspense, and much more combine with walter pidgeon's bovine attempts at charm to produce a cinema curiosity to rank with some of fritz lang's other stupendous failures. (i thought the german ambassador was actually played by lang but apparently not -- they could have been twins.) if you cannot predict the ending from several timezones away, you are not actually alive.<br /><br />i was eagerly awaiting this dvd and was totally surprised and disappointed by such dire crap (even with george sanders and john carradine -- maybe i can wash my mind out by watching viaggio in italia instead and for the umpteenth time).<br /><br />anyone want a dvd used once? (there may be a movie to be made about the making of this atrocious film and how so many talented people could be wasted so completely.)
