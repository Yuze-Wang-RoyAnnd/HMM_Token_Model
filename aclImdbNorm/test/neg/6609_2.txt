the movie is simply horrible (2/10). although actors are trying their best (well sometimes that isn't much) special effects are ...let me put it this way it would be better if there weren't any.<br /><br />the script is based on sapkowski's prose, so it should be the biggest advantage of this movie. sadly it's the opposite. there is nothing left of the original atmosphere. and it's all very chaotic. maybe they just had too much material to show in 2h time.<br /><br />anyway if you would like to see this film i would recommend you to look for the tv series (same title, same actors, even the plot stays the same) that was made in the same time the movie did. it is so much better (9/10) and the story there actually make sense:)
