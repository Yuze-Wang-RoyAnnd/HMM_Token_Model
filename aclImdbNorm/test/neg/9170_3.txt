essentially this is a dreadful film with a few features that may or may not redeem it for you, depending on how much you want them to. in "opening up" "the red green show" for the big screen, the filmmakers jettisoned the rustic charm carefully honed over a decade's worth of episodes set in and around possum lodge in favor of a blandly-photographed "road movie" with a ghastly faux-hollywood "big" musical score and profoundly boring storyline that's not embellished with enough good gags to make it as entertaining as even the most mediocre episode of the tv series.<br /><br />having devised a plotline that keeps most of the members of possum lodge offscreen for most of the film and requires virtually everyone concerned to be despicably mean to the loveable harold (who's the hero of the film, the usually affably crusty red being relegated in this incarnation to nothing more than the role of head harold abuser), the only performers who really get to shine are patrick mckenna and peter keleghan as harold and ranger gord, who deliver satisfyingly large-screen versions of their small-screen characters.
