sadly this film lives up to about 1% of the hype that the game created in 2004 and leaves a very sour taste in the mouth. for video game enthusiasts, book worms and movie fans alike there is nothing more disappointing then a film that is based on an original concept (whether on paper or gaming console) that does not deliver. and not only that, goes well under the mark. far cry the video game released in 2004 created such a cult following that making a movie from the content should have been easy and scores of gamers would have flocked to watch the film. if you are a gamer that has played far cry; do not watch this film. anyone else who hasn't played the game; it'll still seem like a b grade acted / b grade directed movie. uwe boll, hang your head in shame...this should've been easy to make into a blockbuster. the storyline of the game was incredible (think jurassic park meets alien) and yet you still managed to take it and mould it into your own terrible recreation of an instant classic. video game companies be warned - if uwe boll comes a knockin', lock the door. oh & til schweiger...i look forward to seeing you make up for yourself in inglourious basterds. what were you thinking taking this one on? sigh.
