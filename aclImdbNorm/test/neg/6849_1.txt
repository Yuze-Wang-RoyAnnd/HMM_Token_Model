to truly appreciate this film you had to be there (acting?) or have been a crew member.<br /><br />yes, i am "selena", and at the ripe old age of 42, have serious doubts about what we were doing/did.<br /><br />it all started out to be like a "john waters" type thing, friends acting badly in bad films. somewhere along the line,the fun discontinued, people who were supposed to be friends didn't speak anymore, and bad became worse.<br /><br />i regret the bad image i might have projected.(try to fit in size one gold spandex pants,)<br /><br />other than that, the film sucks so badly, i would not even make my mama watch it.<br /><br />to my director, cast and crew i say,<br /><br />"why can't we just all get along??<br /><br />it's been over twenty years, people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
