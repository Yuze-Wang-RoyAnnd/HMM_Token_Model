exceptionally bad! i don't expect much from garcia since he is one of the most overrated actors today but keaton really should have known this movie would suck and gotten out while he could (not that i'm especially fond of him but hey, he did batman).<br /><br />in one scene keaton is transported to a hospital chained down and wearing a hannibal lecter kind of face mask when two attack dogs bark at him (dogs can sense evil you know (puke)) and keaton growls back at them making them back off and whine with their tails between their legs. did the movie turn comedy right there? garcia makes a fool out of himself in an interrogation scene with dialogue only a complete retard could find plausible and the kid is too annoying to feel sorry for..<br /><br />if you are gonna make a movie with as poor a plot as this you need some charm, humour, some solid action. take die hard for example which is great despite its rather crappy plot.<br /><br />even though keatons character was a joke i routed for him all the way. i wanted to see garcia cry over his dead kid and keaton sipping martinis on some paradise island, however! this movie makes for a good laugh.. watch it with a witty friend and you can have some fun as this movie begs for wisecracks in almost every scene. <br /><br />all in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money. greed made this movie and thank god it bit its own ass.
