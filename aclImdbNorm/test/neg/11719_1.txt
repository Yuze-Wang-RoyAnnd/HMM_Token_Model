no gore, no blood, no gratifying death scenes...dumb dumb dumb dumb. dear god sitting through this movie made me sick. sick sick sick. very boring...extremely boring...<br /><br />theres not even a humorous aspect to this film! i cant find a good thing to say about it, other than the lead guy had a nice body...i guess. definitely not worth the fifty cents i paid to rent it.
