this film is just another waste of time. the plot is ridiculous, forced usa drama. the characters were all really weak, especially the uncharismatic goya and the bad interpretation of bardem, who only was alright in his classic interpretation, when acting as french ally.<br /><br />just another chance lost of have spent the money in a good film. i guess it was no a low budget film. definitely not recommended. maybe the director's should think a bit whether the film has sense or not before wasting so that money. maybe they do not bother as they have profits before launching them in the cinema.<br /><br />no more hope in cinema...
