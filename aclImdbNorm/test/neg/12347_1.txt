a friend and i went to see this movie. we have opposite opinions about fujimori but after watching this movie we agree on the following: the easiest way to have an inaccurate documentary is to make it about a foreign country in which you were not present when the events happened, no matter how talented or how much you invest in the film. if you are truly looking to learn about another countries history, watch something made by natives of that country otherwise you won't be able step away from your bubble. and those who try to force their views and opinions about something to which they don't belong are really abusing their power. to make it even worse, the director chose to not talk about the embarrassing involvement of the cia with fujimori's regime. she decides to evade dealing with the only subject for witch her country has much to explain to peruvians. but this is not surprising because, both, the director and the cia are violating the sovereignty of peru by trying to affect the democratic processes at very different levels of course.<br /><br />if the director was really interested in helping peru she would have financed a native to make the documentary. in any case there are numerous peruvian made documentaries, films and books about the subject. such include "ojos que no ven", "dias de santiago", "montesinos-fujimori: las dos caras de la misma moneda", "montesinos: poderoso caballero", etc. the director of the "fall of fujimori" should spend her time analyzing the numerous problems in her own country or at least the involvement of her country in the matters of other nations.
