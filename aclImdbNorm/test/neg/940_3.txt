i wasn't so impressed with this film, finding it quite tiresome and plain. the plot line was interesting, a kid creating his own college and enrolling hundreds of kids, but the laughs were few and far between. the jokes weren't really funny and i didn't bust a gut at any of the scenes. the characters weren't intriguing and i didn't feel for any of them, even the dawky, fat kid with glasses who tried to enter the frat group. it was a good first watch, but it didn't blow me away and its not one that i would recommend. comparing it to other films in the same genre, ie, american pie is just cruel, because there is a film which was laugh-a-plenty. this accepted failed to raise a smile!
