in fact, parts of it i liked a lot. it had some interesting twists. but it just left me with a been there, seen that feeling after all of the saw movies. granted the ending was different from a typical saw, but let's face it...a group of guys, unknown to each other (or so they believe) tossed together in an abandoned chemical factory....<br /><br />but then it loses something. there's no intensity, there's poor group dynamic, there's no sense of urgency.<br /><br />some nice twists at the end, and definitely worth a watch if there's nothing else on your plate, but it just left me empty...it passed the time, but it didn't satisfy.
