family guy. when the show first aired, it was fresh, original, and actually quite funny. now, i have stopped watching it. it has become one of the worst shows on television, combining unfunny jokes, repetitive, drawn out jokes, and the hope that each joke can become funny with the inclusion of the word "bitch." seth macfarlane clearly has issues with himself, and he is obviously pandering to the 13 year old boys audience.<br /><br />i just don't understand how something that started out so funny, so different from everything else, can devolve into this horrible mess of a "comedy" show. i seriously have heard better one liners from a pud comic.<br /><br />it truly is sad to see great shows fail, and watch drivel like this continue on. either seth macfarlane has stopped trying, or he believes that this show is hilarious the way it is.<br /><br />either way, god help us.<br /><br />i hate this show, and will dance an irish jig when its finally cancelled.
