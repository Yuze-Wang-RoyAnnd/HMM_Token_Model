this an extremely horrible movie. and if your thinking you've seen another horrible movie, exactly like this one before, you probably have. you probably saw scarecrow 2 made in 2003. yes thats what i said, brian (the director) stole the movie idea. and not only did he steal it, he actually might have been able to make it worse. i bet the even the actors were scared to tell people they were actually in the movie. also i have to mention that the director was trying to make up for the cheesiness by showing as much tits as possible. also the kissing scenes were put together like a porn movie. in fact that is probably all that the director has ever seen, and tried to put together a decent movie, which will never work.
