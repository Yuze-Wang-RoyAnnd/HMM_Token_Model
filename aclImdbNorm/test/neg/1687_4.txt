my wife and kids was billed as the 00s very own cosby show- but unlike the latter, it was unfunny and unwatchable. in fact, it is so poorly written and some of the jokes revolve around michael mickey taking michael jr's dumbness and the fact that he is such a loser- which got more and more tedious and annoying as the show went on.<br /><br />what was supposed to have been a promising hit, eventually turned into a dumb, silly show later on where the ideas became so ott and ridiculous. and as for the second claire, i ended up disliking this character so much: she became a spoilt, childish and moaning teenage brat, in most of the later episodes.<br /><br />mwak was no cosby show trend setter, rather it was just a poor black sitcom by general standards.
