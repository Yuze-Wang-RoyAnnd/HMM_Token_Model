this is by far the most pathetic movie indian cinema or any cinema has come up with.it is totally a piece of crap.the story line odes not hold any water. it is shameful that such a respectful actor has stooped to such a low on making such a disgraceful movie. the little respect he had is lost forever. he should have retired longtime ago instead of making a fool of himself and loosing all the self respect. i would not recommend this movie to any one. furthermore i would suggest that amitabh should retire already. i wonder how imdb has given some recommendations to this movie. there are no movies so horrible that any recommendations could be made. seeing such movies as devdas in the same line as this movie does a grave injustice to a decent movie. its overall i could say shameless.
