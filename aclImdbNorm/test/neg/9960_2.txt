ok, this movie seems to have been pretty well covered by earlier comments, but there are a couple of items i wish to add. the mad scientist is producing a serum from the blood of a caged animal in order to turn a man into a werewolf. if we suspend our disbelief enough to buy into that, fine. but the animal in the cage is a coyote. that would make a werecoyote. did audiences in 1942 not know the difference between a wolf and a coyote? they're easy to tell apart. that's weak.<br /><br />secondly, this movie was covered in the third episode of mst3k (on the comedy channel). it took joel and the bots a number of episodes to get up to full riffing steam, and they weren't up there quite yet on this one. they did add enough to this snoozer to keep you awake until the end, but it was not one of their better episodes. they never even mentioned the glaring omission of an actual wolf, and that joke was just hanging in the air waiting to be smacked.
