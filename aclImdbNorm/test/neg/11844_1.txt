the defining scene to this movie is when the fat guy quits,but the evil doctor just gives him one more duty,check on the dinosaurs.keep in mind that he no longer has this job and so is absolutely not getting paid for this.also keep in mind it's a goddamn dinosaur and the doctor he's supposed to trust is evil and doesn't like him.but he's still like,yeah okay.that just defined the stupidity in this movie.one melissa brasselle proves that seriously anyone can bolt on some breasts and be in movies.i can go ride a mountain-bike between them,but hey aside from that the people of paraguay are very nice.eric roberts gives his absolute worst performance so far,there's no adjective to describe how bored he is throughout.corbin bernsen saves what there is to save and you start rooting for him,but they have to stick to the formula of course.and i wonder how much your life sucks when you play like,one of the army guys in this one?how low can your acting career go?the special effects are so embarrassingly bad you expect a sign saying "studio 3" to get into the frame.it's not even honest pulp,it's all taken from "carnosaur",which even sucked all by itself.and then i wonder why just anyone is allowed to make a movie.
