i gave this a 3 out of a possible 10 stars.<br /><br />unless you like wasting your time watching an anorexic actress, in this film it's carly pope, behaving like a ditz, don't bother.<br /><br />carly pope plays sara novak, a young college student, who becomes intrigued with a game of riddles, that leads her down into subway tunnels underneath the city - a dangerous thing for even a well-armed man to go in alone.<br /><br />there are various intrigues in the film -- a weirdo classmate who is apparently stalking sara, a cynical shopkeeper who runs some kind of offbeat hole-in-the-wall establishment that appears to be located in the back alley of a ghetto, a nerdish dim-wit that hangs around the cynic's shop, and a woman named emily gray, who is back in prison.<br /><br />sara's father is a lawyer who is handling emily gray's case. <br /><br />a few years back, emily gray attempted to drown a 12 year old boy. emily was put in a mental hospital for 5 years, and for some cockeyed reason they let her out again, even though it is obvious she is still dangerously deranged.<br /><br />the only explanation emily has ever given for her crime is: i never sinned.<br /><br />it's all part of the design.<br /><br />well, my friend, don't expect to ever get any better explanation than that, because you won't.
