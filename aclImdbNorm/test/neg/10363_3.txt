...or better yet, watch fandango if you want to see a really intelligent and funny male college age road flick. rolling kansas sounded promising (in fact the program guide gave it 2.5 out of 4 stars which usually means it's fairly watchable) but i pretty much fast-forwarded through it. usually road trip movies have great music, but i can't even recall whether there was music. the only high point was a small role with rip torn as a wise old hitchhiker/guru. otherwise the jokes and timing missed all along the way. the four main characters are unknown actors and i don't remember seeing any of them in another movie. (oh, yeah, i see that thos. hayden church was in it, but he's in everything, good, bad or indifferent). this movie is about as funny as watching someone else stoned when you're not.
