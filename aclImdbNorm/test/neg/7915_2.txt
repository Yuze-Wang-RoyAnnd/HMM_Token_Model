... because this is yet another dead one. lifeless voice acting, second-rate animation, contrived and un-funny songs (although the bit sung by the devil would have been worthy of tim curry), and a weaker plot than land before time 99: fossils on parade.<br /><br />i have to admit, i haven't seen the first film. i'm not a big fan of movies involving heaven or dogs, especially not in combination. still, i hope to see the first one soon, as there had to be a reason someone would create such a god-awful sequel.<br /><br />if i didn't get this movie for free, i wouldn't have it at all. for a 'heaven' flick, the only good thing in this was the devil. 2/10.
