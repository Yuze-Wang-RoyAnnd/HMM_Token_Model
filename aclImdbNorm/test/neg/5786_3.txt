top gun without the in-house animosity. or class. or money. or cruise. an excuse for an upwardly mobile cast of next-big-thing actors to market their ability to lead a matin'ee this doesn't really have anything anyone can get their teeth into. it's a shame because the opening shot of charlie sheen opens out with great promise which is squandered almost straight away with a preposterous wedding set piece. barking.<br /><br />dennis haysbert is a changeable actor for me but in this film he is fine, particularly the action sequences. michael biehn is a first-class action hero but not a leading man: charlie sheen is, to all intents and purposes, the leading man but never quite an action hero. there's a stunt cast of hundreds who are also mentionworthy. 3/10
