this is a very mediocre jackie chan film and one of his absolute worst james glickenhaus ruined it!. all the characters are decent i guess, but the story is so so, however jackie chan is still amazing in this even if he did look bored. jackie and danny aiello had zero chemistry together, and it was very boring a lot of times, however the finale was above average and managed to be fairly entertaining, and had some good stunts!. i have not yet seen the hong kong version, however i'm sure it's better then this dud, plus the twist is very predictable!. it's really lifeless and bland, and i don't blame jackie for not looking happy in this, and if he didn't star in this it would have been unbearable and completely unwatchable. the opening is supposed to be memorable, but it's nothing i haven't seen before and done better at that, and i thought the whole film was rather lazy and could have been an awesome film if jackie had control of it!, plus i really didn't root for any of the characters. this is a very mediocre jackie chan film, and one of his absolute worst james glickenhaus ruined it!, not recommended even for die hard jackie chan fans. the direction is terrible!. james glickenhaus does a terrible job here, with extremely bland camera work, bad angles, and keeping the film boring for the most part throughout. the acting is so so. jackie chan is amazing as always, however he is not his usual energetic self, and looks bored and ps*ed off throughout the film, had zero chemistry with danny aiello, and i really don't blame him either! (jackie rules!!!!!). danny aiello is ok here, as jackie's partner, but his character is a bit of an ass, and he had zero chemistry with jackie, he did ok i guess. roy chiao is decent as the main villain, but was just going through the motions and wasn't all that menacing, he still is damn cool though. rest of the cast are average at best. overall not worth your time or money. *1/2 out of 5
