alright, we start in the office of a shrink, and apparently not a very good one. the main hero from the first jack frost is in the shrinks office blurting out random rhymes about jack frost. gee, alright my brother is yelling ''turn it off!''. anyway, back to the crappy movie.<br /><br />the shrink has his speaker phone on and is letting his secretary and her friends listen in on this heroic insane sheriff. i suppose he is supposed to be the hero from the first movie, but he looks nothing like him!. yadda yadda yadda, they laugh at the poor sheriff, yadda yadda. now some people are digging up the anti-frozed snowman, yadda yadda, now we're in a lab with some type of doctor people.. i don't quite see how this has to do anything, but their poking the anti-freeze/evil killer mutant snowman with needles, heating it, shocking it, adding strange and bizarre chemicals to it, the whole nine yards. nothing. alright, they give up and leave it in a fish tank. one of the doctors leaves his coffee on the top of the tank. the janitor walks in, cleans stuff, bumps the fishtank and the coffee spills the tank which makes jack alive.<br /><br />behold the power of mocha! now somehow he is in..uh.. i believe the bahamas... but it looked more like hawaii.. but it couldn't be hawaii! unless they spent all of their budget on the dang air plane tickets. bah.. i wont spoil the rest of this rotten movie, so you'll have to rent it and watch it your self... er... i wouldn't suggest doing so though.... sheesh..
