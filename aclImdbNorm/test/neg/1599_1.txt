this is supposed to be the story of the life of a man named wirey spindell from age 8 through to 36 told in narrative by the character at each age point in his life. so for example, when he's eight, it's the eight year old's voice that is doing the narration; when he's in junior high, it's that one doing the narration, etc. that's about the only interesting thing about this movie. it looks like each actor playing wirey is a separate character. not only do they not look alike, their life experiences don't seem to match up.<br /><br />avoid this movie like a bad cold.
