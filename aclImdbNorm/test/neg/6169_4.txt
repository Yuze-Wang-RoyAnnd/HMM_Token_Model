let me first state that i rarely review movies, i only comment if i'm blown away or disappointed in something that i thought was going to be good. killshot was a major disappointment on so many levels. the script was horrible, the acting was sub-par (espically coming from heavy weights like rourke and lane) and the editing and effects were comical, (blowing up cars etc. etc.) rosario dawson had a horrible role, i can't believe would even accept it, it was such a misuse of her talent i can't even put into words. i should have know after i saw the trailer for this movie 3 years ago and it kept being put on the shelve that their was a serious problem with this film.......... b movie all the way.........don't bother unless your really bored........
