this is the worst kind of film.<br /><br />the plot is ludicrous, the characters are unrealistic stereotypes who never look like they believe it themselves. are white people such monsters that they will continue to call two white child rapists in their 20s "good boys" and need to be persuaded that this might be grounds for provocation? are black people universally inspiring? do the ku klux klan really stand outside court rooms shooting at lawyers with nobody intervening? do judges really think that a fair trial can be conducted when the jury can hear a mob outside shouting "kill him"? do black people really stand shoulder to shoulder with the klan waiting to hear the verdict? do wives really take several months to realise that their husband might be defending a man from unfair hanging because he knew might have done the same thing? do juries really acquit people of murder because they feel sorry for them? do lawyers really use a defense of sanity in order to persuade people that their client was temporarily insane? <br /><br />worst of all, any high-minded principles of this film were lost to the completely exploitative and gratuitous use of sexual crime to titillate the audience. was the subject of rape, let alone child gang rape, really in competent hands here? is it really a subject that belongs in hollywood hands? and if so, why the completely gratuitous kidnap and stripping of sandra bullock? and the completely pointless statutory rape charge against one of the witnesses? seems like the director didn't feel that strongly about sex crime after all.<br /><br />this was taking the excellent plot of to kill a mockingbird and making a crass, shallow, tasteless money-spinner from it. shame on them.
