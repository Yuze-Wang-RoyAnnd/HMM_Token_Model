you can only describe this with one word and that would be wow!!! wow, i really did not think piece of crap like this could ever be released. if you watch a movie titled ninja then you expect to see at least some cool martial artists, right? however, none of these guys know any martial arts whatsoever and it seems like they went to china and picked the first people they saw on the street and trained them for a day in martial arts, that's the level of their martial arts skills! the actors are way overacting, the special effects are ridiculous and there is not any plot that makes any sense. this is the worst martial arts movie i've ever seen and i have seen plenty!
