i grew up in the 90s; therefore, you must understand that i witnessed firsthand the premiers of the greatest dcoms. i was there when brink! appeared, zenon, halloweentown, johnny tsunami, etc, these movies constitute my childhood. when these movies came on, not only myself but whoever i was watching them with would stand completely in awe for 1h30, talk about it for the week to come and catch it again the next weekend. i don't think words could express the amount of excitement zoog disney brought. <br /><br />even when i watch them now, the dialog doesn't seem that bad (so effective in fact, that i actually remember parts of conversations literally word per word, from movies i saw over ten years ago). the characters are believable, funny, granted a little stereotypical but that's what makes disney's charm... <br /><br />i sat my little brother down in front of the disney channel to try and convey and make him understand my feelings for dcoms. enter stuck in the suburbs... my brother looked at me slightly puzzled, asking me if i had always been gay. i feel more disappointed and betrayed now than, what could i compare this to?, when han solo found out lando sold him out to vader... <br /><br />half the movie, and i'm not exaggerating, is flashbacks. there is no talent in these young actors (some of which are older than i am) whatsoever. the plot is ridiculous; it feels like a bunch of old rotting corporate people over at disney sat around a table and asked themselves "how can we seem hip to these youngsters?" ok, maybe all the dcoms were like that, but they at least made a little effort to not let us realize they think we're complete idiots. <br /><br />and apparently this type of movie works... stuck in the suburbs is rated almost as much as zenon or airborne. how is this possible? dcoms got even cheesier and people prefer them now? (though apparently the lack of curse words is enough to give it 10/10 for some people) christ, it's a completely different generation.
