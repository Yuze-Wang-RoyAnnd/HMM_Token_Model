"the italian job" is a caper movie done by the numbers. riding on the back of every caper cliche, it rises to no particular heights and will be a movie footnote by about the end of the month.<br /><br />the biggest problem is that "the italian job" possesses no imagination at all. i've seen it all before and done better then. the acting is fine the cinematography is completely acceptable, but this film breaks absolutely no new ground.<br /><br />let's tick off the cliches:<br /><br /> - "old-school" criminal father figure and his protege<br /><br /> - another gang member jealous of protege<br /><br /> - a double-cross<br /><br /> - only bad guys use guns while good-guy criminals don't have to<br /><br /> - good criminals always outwit the bad guys<br /><br />and that's about the first fifteen minutes. everything is so predictable. even the heist and car chase scenes, supposedly the highlight of the movie, seem pretty ordinary. this is especially true since they appeared in the trailers for the film so i already knew what to look for.<br /><br />for me, a caper film works only if it has an element of realism - that maybe, just maybe, it could be pulled off without relying on a deux ex machina or "just because" moments. parts of "the italian job" just throws that out the window, with computers doing things that computers can't do, the good guys not hitting anyone with their driving (especially going down the stairs) and not one single police car responding to street explosions, recklessly driven minis or even a low flying helicopter. must be a heck of a city for these things not to rate a response.<br /><br />the acting is passable, with the crew (seth green, jason stratham and mos def) being at least fun to watch. mark wahlberg is just too smarmy as the "nice guy" hero while charlize theron is about the only actor called on to display some kind of range. donald sutherland is a class act as always and shows up wahlberg's deficiencies every moment they are together.<br /><br />overall this is a pretty uninteresting film. given the imdb ratings, it's the girls that really love this film, which i can understand to some extent, but there are such better caper films out there - even the vapidness of the recent "ocean's eleven" outshines the non-event that is "the italian job".<br /><br />***spoiler***<br /><br />at the conclusion, take a moment to think about what is going to happen to norton's character. are we meant to be cheering the good guys for causing his demise, especially since it would appear to be long and painful? he didn't deserve that, simpering creep that he was.<br /><br />***end spoiler***
