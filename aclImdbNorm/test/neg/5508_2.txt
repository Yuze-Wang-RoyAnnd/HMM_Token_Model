i am a fan of jess franco's bizarre style, and a lover even of his trashier films, and my personal opinion is that he has, besides several very entertaining movies, also created a few masterpieces, such as the brilliant "paroxismus" aka "venus in furs" of 1969, for example. it is, however, an undeniable fact that the 180+ movies this highly prolific filmmaker has directed in his career, also include a bunch of big time stinkers. "sadomania" of 1981 certainly is one of these stinkers, just an utterly bad and plot less movie with the ability to bore the hell out of you in spite of constant sleaze and nudity.<br /><br />sure, the constant nudity will keep you entertained for 20 minutes, but since it keeps going on and on like that one is pretty likely to get bored after a short time. the only thing that really kept me watching this was the intensity of the sleaze which is, generously spoken, slightly amusing.<br /><br />after couple of newlyweds get lost in the desert on some island, they are stopped by a bunch of topless women carrying guns, wardens of a local prison camp. while the husband is banished from the island, the wife is taken to the prison camp, a place of torture and sexual humiliation, reigned by the sadistic nymphomaniac magda and an extremely perverted governor. the prisoners are, of course, entirely hot chicks, most of them blondes, the wardens are entirely topless women carrying rifles.<br /><br />the plot, if one can call it that, is extremely stupid of course, but who is going to watch this for a good plot anyway. the (only) interesting thing about "sadomania" is the high level of exploitation, even for a 'women in prison' film. there are probably two short scenes in the movie where we see a woman actually wearing a top, the sleaze contains all kinds of sexual perversions from rape to bestiality, and some of the torture scenes are really nasty.<br /><br />it is amazing that a film with this extreme level of sleaze, however, can still be so boring. the sleaze will keep you watching in the beginning, but after the first 45 minutes i actually had a hard time not to fall asleep. it also makes me wonder why, out of all pornstars, jess franco chose ajita wilson, who was, according to most sources, a transsexual who had been born a man (well, maybe for exactly that reason). if you really want to watch this, make sure you have enough beer at home to sit through it and watch it for the sleaze and exploitation only (and maybe for the slight unintentional fun factor). don't expect to be highly entertained, however, it is almost unbelievable how a movie with such a high sleaze level can be so boring. i am a jess franco fan and i always will be, but "sadomania" is just bad. 2/10
