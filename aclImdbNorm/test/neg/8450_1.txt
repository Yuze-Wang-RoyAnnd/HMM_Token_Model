like the above poster, i got burned on the title thinking i was getting the other piranha... this movie is everything the above poster said and worse... <br /><br />poor camera, lousy acting and just plain horrid storyline...<br /><br />there was very little here that was even worth watching... how this movie even got released is beyond me. <br /><br />make sure the movie you buy is the one you want... and not this one.<br /><br />the movie i bought was labeled "piranha" and not "piranha, piranha!" which is what it actually is... this is the only way they sold this movie at all.<br /><br />peace out.
