well this was a complete waste of celluloid. the preview was promising but after watching the movie, it looked like the preview *was* the whole movie. no plot, no clear storyline, just some misplaced suspense. it looks like the director tried very hard to create an atmosphere of mystique and fear, but still there are gaps to be filled. why the drugs? why the number 11.11? (btw. as sarah enteres the library, the clock says 11.14) what's the connection to the murder on the parents? what's the role of this rayden woman? is she one of the children or not? who are those children anyway. there is a lot of material lying around to create the ultimate cult movie like "the omen" but the director just leaves them lying on the floor without digging into the story. even "the blairwitch project" was more scary than this one. all the gaps you hope to be filled like in "the butterfly effect" stay open as the credits start rolling.. ok. off to the next movie...
