why it's none other than ator played hilariously bad by miles o'keefe. surprisingly i had the misfortune of sitting through this turkey before mystery science theater 3000 tore it to pieces. i highly recommend checking out the mst3k version since it's hilarious and one of their best episodes ever.<br /><br />the movie on it's own is basically the kind of typical b-movie crud that italian film-makers were churning out in the early to mid 80's. this film was apparently made to cash in on the conan craze, but it fails miserably on all counts.<br /><br />keep an eye out for the scenes where ator fights a giant rubber snake and also manages to make a complete hang-glider during a cutaway.<br /><br />"thong, fish is ready!"<br /><br />rating: the movie itself-1 the mst3k version: 10
