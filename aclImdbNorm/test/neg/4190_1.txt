this movie was so bad i don't know where to begin, apparently neither did the filmmakers. it starts off with a guy in his mid thirties to late forties watching tv. the news tells of a corn maze that's open for halloween. he has a "vision" of god knows what and rushes off the save his kids who are walking into a cornfield maze and are somehow linked to this "vision" how you ask? i don't know, and as i said before neither do the filmmakers. they're simply visions of people's feet. how did he get these "visions"? it's never explained, we're just supposed to go along with it. he enters the maze to find his two daughters who are lost inside, and twice the girls he's looking for walk right past him, one time they actually run into him. what does he do? does he chase after them? no. he stands there like an idiot calling for them when they just ran past. do the girls stop? no. they run off then ask "was that dad?" then someone dressed as demon jumps on the "star" (the dad character) he beats him up in a pathetic fight only to find out he's a worker at the haunted maze. the police are called and after finding the "star" (which is a really bad term to use) they cuff him. they cuff his hands in front of him, so that he can find something to pick the lock with, which he does. first off, anybody who's ever been arrested knows that cops cuff your hands behind your back, and secondly why does this "average guy" seem to know how to pick the lock on handcuffs? well he eventually gets away from the cops who give up and leave after a the "star's" wife sets off the siren in the police car as a distraction. by the way, it's now night time and all the workers running the maze have seem to have left once the sun went down. leaving a man who attacked one of their workers and two missing children in the maze. considering it was a slow night that these are their only customers, why not. besides the cops apparently have better things to do as well. by the way, the "star" who goes by the name of "walker", we figure out it's his last name, a name in which his wife even calls him by. somehow he knows there is something buried in the middle of this cornfield maze and starts digging. i say 'somehow' because i couldn't figure out why he started digging in the first place. he finds a locket, what does it mean? nothing to anyone who watches this, but to him it's some sort of clue to a crime. somebody killed their kids in his "vision" and i guess that's what he's going on, real detective work. and by now he knows there's a killer loose in the corn maze, one he somehow knew was there from the start of the film, which is why he's looking for his girls. every time we see the killer, or rather the killer's feet, we hear a weird robotic sound, like a sci-fi reject toy that changes a persons voice to sound mechanical. why do we hear this sound? is it in anyway related to...anything? again, who knows? certainly not the filmmakers. the peak of all the bad acting and bad dialog was when "walker" yells out "hey you, mr. bad man...i'm gonna get you." another time his wife is attacked by the "bad man" at the entrance to the corn maze, which like i mentioned before is oddly empty of any employees or policemen. the "bad man" calls "walker" on his cell phone to tell him that he plans on killing his wife and kids and him as well. "walker" can only reply with "hey. hey!" before dropping his phone and running off. with no one on the other end to talk to, the killer drops his phone too, he drags the wife a few feet then leaves her alone for the rest of the film, losing the first opportunity to hold true to his treats. if this script wasn't written by a child i'd be surprised. opps it wasn't. it was written, directed, and produced by the same guy. and not only that, he also did so much of the crappy camera work as well, where we get random shots of feet walking through the muddy maze and meaningless shots of the cornfield, that waste 90% of the film time. in the end "walker" uses the cuffs to cuff the "bad man", who also seems to know how to pick locks with the same metal object that "walker" had picked it with. apparently there are lots of small metal objects just laying around this cornfield. but after the killer insists he's still going to kill the kids "walker" kills the "bad man", and everything is right with the world again. now in reality this makes "walker" a murderer, he's killed a man who "supposedly" murdered his own daughters and was trying to kill his. he knows this, not because of proof, but because of his visions. he never found a body, nobody else knows this guy was even in the maze. and the locket? he gives it back to the ghosts of the two dead girls. no proof. so he kills a man without any tangible reason. i can't imagine what the filmmakers were thinking with this one. it must have been a way to cover up a misappropriation of funds for the production company. i would rather watch the blair witch project five times than see this film again. the actors should be ashamed. the director/producer/writer/cameraman should also be ashamed. in fact the entire production company should be ashamed. if there is anyone associated with this film, please reply. what were you thinking?
