stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so i am happy to see any of their films. ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital, and with nothing else to do, stan decides to visit him, and take him some boiled eggs and nuts, instead of candy. chaos begins with stan curiously pulling ollie's leg cast string, and manages to push the doctor (billy gilbert) out the window, clinging on to it, getting ollie strung up to the ceiling. when the situation calms down, stan gets ollie's clothes, as the doctor wants them both to leave, and he also manages to sit on a syringe, accidentally left by the nurse, filled with a sleeping drug, which comes into effect while he is driving (which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen. filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad (although repetitive and a little predictable) classic comedy, it isn't great, but it's a black and white film worth looking at. stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians' comedian. okay!
