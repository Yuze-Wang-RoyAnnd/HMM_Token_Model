two days ago i got a chance to watch this movie on cable (tv-asia). i have been very disturbed since then. the movie "baghban" has been very successful in portraying only one side of the real life. it is highly partial towards parents. have you ever thought of other side (kids)?? there are few parents in this world who just give birth to their kids but don't give right parental care. i am a victim of that. why do you (parents) want to have 5 kids in your life if you are merely making only rs 2000 per month? i was made to work on streets along with my siblings. i have no idea how i managed to reach iit from there. it has been a long time since then but still i don't believe. now i am a research scientist here in usa. i have provided all the necessities to my parents along with care by my two brothers who stay along with them. they could not provide basic things to us when we were kids. i find this movie very resentful. its very partial. it has hurt my sentiments very deeply. i strongly urge the producer/director of this movie to look at the indian society in other point of view also and make another movie. i can be reached at john_simension@yahoo.com
