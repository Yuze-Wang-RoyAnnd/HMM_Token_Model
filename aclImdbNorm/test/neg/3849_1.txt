i was unfortunate enough to see this movie at a friends' house. what an utter waste of time. what an utter and complete piece of crap this movie is! absolutely nothing is funny in it, from the shower scene to the insulting and degrading portrayal of germans. there is no plot, the acting made me gag and at the end, i personally wanted to beat john leguizamo with a stick. i thought john woo movies were bad.....this movie is officially the worst movie that i have ever seen.
