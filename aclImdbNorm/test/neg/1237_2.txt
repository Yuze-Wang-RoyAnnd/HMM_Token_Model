i must have missed a part of this movie... i found myself asking who is this? and, when did that happen? it seemed to jump around but i kept watching for fear i was missing something and it would all be explained to me. i loved lonesome dove but this movie made no sense to me at all. i did love all the actors but what happened to the rest of the movie? it made me go "what"? at the beginning of each part..as far as the scenery - i thought it was fine..it made me feel though like i was leafing through a book and leaving pages out.. the ending had me a little confused too although i imagine the boy was waiting for his father and was meant to leave you wondering if his father would finally come home to his son and be a father since his mother was now gone..i would like to read the book just to see what i missed in the movie..i don't expect this one to win any awards.
