what ever happened to shows with united parental figures? the parents in this show are nearly as irresponsible as the children. instead of punishing the youngest child for being manipulative, they let her get away with murder. they can't ever agree on a course of action when it comes to dealing with the children, and instead they do nothing. yeah, great plan. just ignore their behavior because they're "cute." this show tells the already manipulative preteens that watch it that the "divide and conquer" technique is the best way to get their parents to "cave." the oldest children are constantly running amok and getting themselves into all sorts of impossible situations, but there are no consequences for their actions. yeah, great television all right.
