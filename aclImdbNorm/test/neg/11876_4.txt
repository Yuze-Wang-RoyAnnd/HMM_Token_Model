after an undercover mission in bucharest to disclose an international gang of weapon dealers, the agent sonni griffith (wesley snipes) is assigned to protect the romanian nadia kaminski (silvia colloca), the widow of an accountant of the romanian mafia. however, the cia safe house is broken in by the criminals, and sonni realizes that the information was leaked from inside the agency. alone, trusting only in his friend michael shepard (william hope), sonni fights to survive and protect nadia.<br /><br />the career of wesley snipes is downhill. i have just seen this flick, and it is another disappointing movie of this actor, whose career is presently very similar to steven segal's one. the movie has many explosions, shots and car chase associated to an awful story and horrible acting. first, the afro-american wesley snipes is chased by the police of bucharest, but they never find a black american man. i have never been in romania, but i believe there are not many afro-americans in this country. his character does not like to bath, wearing the same clothes along many days. there is no chemistry between sonni and the sexy silvia colloca, but she freely has sex, falls in love for him and shares her fortune with him. the boy that performs nadia's son is horrible. my vote is four.<br /><br />title (brazil): "o detonador" ("the detonator")
