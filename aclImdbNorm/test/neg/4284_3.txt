man kills bear. man becomes bear. man/bear meets bear. man/bear stays man/bear after meeting bear. the end. seriously, that is the entire plot to this movie. yes, i simplified it to an extreme, but you get the picture. i just wish i maybe had not have seen it.<br /><br />the 'man/bear' alluded to is a native american indian that kills a mother of a cub. and while that can be touching, it certainly lacks to really draw in on the potential conflict between the two parties. plus, there was a certain misuse of the two moose in the film. but that is beyond the point.<br /><br />overall, very much under par. certainly needed a lot more to be entertaining. maybe more laughs from the secondary characters and more drama between the two main bears. thats what separates bad films from the good ones.
