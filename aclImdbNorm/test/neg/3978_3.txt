i have now suffered through parts, the clonus horror.<br /><br />to have the word horror in the title of this movie is an insult to real horror.<br /><br />the story was about a cloning-central owned by the "the man" they grow clones for harvesting organs from the clones later on for the original humans in need of transplants. one clone escapes, the government gets angry and kills all involved, but the story somehow leaks out anyway.<br /><br />it is truly shameful how a movie with potential is destroyed by amateurs such as fiveson. the only thing he genuinely succeeded in doing was to weave in the concept of human rights and the very philosophical aspect, what makes a human a human, and would it be ok to grow clones for organic harvesting? sadly, mediocre actors have been chosen and the plot has left town, until the very end in where a pathetic attempt is made to sum it up.<br /><br />but!! what disturbed me the most was the introducing of new characters lacking actual relevance for the plot. despite that, fiveson feels the need to kill them off in a bad explosion which only sir coleman francis himself would be proud of.<br /><br />the setting was interesting. how fiveson thought that pulling out sheets of plastic and running water over them would make a believable river is beyond me, but i guess if you were to compare the setting to coleman francis' gray pasty oatmeal of a setting, this film would win.<br /><br />perhaps coleman has changed what bad movies are for me. 3/10
