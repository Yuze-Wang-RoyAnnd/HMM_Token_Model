hahahahah probably one of the funniest movies i've even seen. obviously this isn't intentional though. it takes about half the movie for the main characters to realize what the big hilly thing is in the middle of the city is spewing hot red stuff, and the other half spent diverting the lave flow through the city using fire trucks (yer right). it certainly made me laugh. the acting makes arnie look like a rsc thespian. it is amazing that films like this get commissioned. a more interesting version would be someone going near an active volcano and filming it, and would probably cost about lb20 to make. ($40) i can see some guy pitching the film to a film company "well there's this big volcano and it erupts in a city....pretty radical hey" if you can find it in the dollar bins, maybe worth buying as after watching this most other films would look good.
