this has to be one of the worst movies ever to come out of the sci-fi channel. here is how the movie starts, women are the only humans on this planet due to the fact that in the not to distant future chemical warfare is a ok as long as it only targets soldiers (in case your wondering, men) however the virus back fires (big shock)and all the men on earth slowly die. then all of male kind is condemned to die when the madam president is shot and killed by a man. now we are taken around 60 to 70 years from now, two female scientists are working on cloning a female baby and one of them says "hey, why don't we bring men back?" the other one says no the world is not ready for that, but promptly ignores her and thus a man walks the eath again.<br /><br />first off, this movie assumes that all men who are not genetically altered are blood thirsty monsters. secondly, the writer forgot to mention that present day soldiers are a good mix of male and female officers so there is no real reason to have a virus like that. this is the biggest waist of time you can find. this movie managed to insult my intellect not only by the bad story, but with the lifetime style acting. avoid this movie at all costs.<br /><br />i give this a 1 out of 10 but only because i could go no lower.
