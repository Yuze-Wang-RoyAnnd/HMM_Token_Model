eh it's not really as good as the other dragonballs. the villains are actually rip-offs of other z villains like cell, frieza, and even majin buu. with baby being frieza's clone, super 17 being cell's clone, and the shadow dragons being buu's clone(s). the story is also very bad as it deals with goku shrinking. shrinking!! it deals with him shrinking to like the size of an eight year old just to get it going. let us not forget how weak the characters become. gohan can't go mystic anymore and is even weaker than pan.(it's sad i know). speaking of pan she was so cute at the end of z now she's lost all that cuteness and become an irritating,whiny little girl whose sole purpose in this series is to get in the way. goten doesn't even have a purpose in the series and trunks... well i don't know what to say about trunks. gt is just an attempt to milk the popular dragonball franchise. if you really like dragonball then avoid this series. it doesn't even feel like dragonball. i will be fair though as the ending however was really good and is actually pretty sad (at least to me) and the theme songs both ending and opening are better (japanese, not american). might've been better if toriyama san worked on it.
