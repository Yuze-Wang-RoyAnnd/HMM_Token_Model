supreme sanction is a movie about a female assassin who works for the u.s. government. she has to kill a known tv reporter, but spares his life when she sees that he has a little daughter. because she hasn't killed him, she becomes the next target of her employers.<br /><br />the script isn't good although i've seen worse b-movies. a hit-man with remorse, the government killing innocent people in the name of fighting terror,... what's next? aliens rescuing the victim??? no, supreme sanction will never win any award because of the script. and the acting isn't any better i'm afraid. a few better known actors (michael madsen and kristy swanson), who clearly had a lot of bills to pay and therefor accepted to play in this movie, together with some other actors who probably don't even know what a camera really looks like don't do any good to the movie either.<br /><br />so why should you watch this movie? well, if you haven't got anything better to do but to watch some action flick and you are tired of the 10,531st rerun of mc gyver or the a-team, than this might be the movie you want to see. otherwise you better leave it alone. i give it a 3/10.
