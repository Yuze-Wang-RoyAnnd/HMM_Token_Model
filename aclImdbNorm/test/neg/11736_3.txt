norm(an)ally i don't mind remakes. there are some pretty good ones out there, but this one is a stinker! considering it was practically scene for scene, it had a good story and great actors. van sant copied al's direction virtually flawlessly, and it added color (i'm not one of those who think it has to be b&w to be classic). it should have been at least a mediocre movie... but it was pee-pee caa-caa! i don't understand how it could have been screwed up so badly. if you must, watch it as a curiosity, but i would suggest that you not bother.
