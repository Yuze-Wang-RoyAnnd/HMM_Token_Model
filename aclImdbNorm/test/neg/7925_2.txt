this movie is so stupid that i want my $2.99 back that i paid for!! first this movie starts off with a bunch of wooden actor geeks with fill in talent like they got picked off the street somewhere because the "real" actors either did not show up because of the laughable script or they just couldn't get anybody desperate enough to do this movie! the music in this movie is enough to put you to sleep, flute music made for faerie's dancing in the wilderness wouldn't even be good enough for this movie! and the guy dressed up as satan looks like he's all dressed up in a k-mart halloween special costume! there are no dead scenes except a few lame scenes. when i saw what the terrible killers looked like in those bath robes with nosferatu faces i just laughed! this is what the whole town is supposed to be running away from once a year! this movie is one of the worst demonic movies i have ever seen. avoid this one!
