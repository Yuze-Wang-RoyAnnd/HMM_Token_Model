what can i say about the pleasure planet that i haven`t said about umpteen other tedious soft core porn films ? very little . it`s just another movie with a very weak plot used to set up very unconvincing set scenes between male non actors who spend too much time in the gym and bimbos who have obviously had silicon implants . actually the sex scenes in this movie are somewhat less convincing than you usually see in this type of film as the cast members grind their hips together giving pained expressions like they`ve got constipation or something . no wonder a lot of people claim sex is over rated , they`ve probably watched too many of these films on late night cable stations
