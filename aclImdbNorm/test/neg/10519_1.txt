what can be said about a movie about a cross dressing gangster? not that much. with the average indie style film-making, this film has the timing all wrong. editing is just awful. as far as the gangster story, it might have been pulled off if the gangsters didn't lack character. everyone just seemed to be there for some sort of punch line. none of which were funny. the usual suspects in this film are the hooker with the heart of gold, the dying mafia father that wishes his son would make his business legit, the best friend with the "zany" one-liners. but the main character, the gangster that likes to dress up like a girl. only his motivation for dressing up like a girl is that he got mugged by a woman? weird. the ending of the movie had to be the nail in the coffin. it was anti-climatic to say the least. i mean i understand how indie filmmakers don't have the equipment for a proper shot out, but they might as well been using water guns. overall, i would say the hype leading up to it, (red carpet premiere in vancouver), it was a disappointment.
