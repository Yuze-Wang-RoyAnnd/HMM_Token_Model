as the metaphoric flies fled this steaming watery stool of a film i found myself longing to join them.<br /><br />from the opening sentences, you quickly gather that the actors are talentless. the script editor was probably dead and the director should be. to be honest i didn't manage to finish this film because about twenty dismal minutes in the sight of the main actress scuttling across the floor like a shetland pony that has been shot in the ass was too much for me to stomach.<br /><br />i have never, and i mean never, seen a film as sweaty as this one and i watch tons of crap films.<br /><br />turd.
