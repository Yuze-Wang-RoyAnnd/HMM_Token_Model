this "movie" and i say this lightly, is nothing but pure trash. i feel sorry for those people that actually wasted their money to go see this in theaters..i saw a screener of the movie from a friend and i've regretted it ever since. <br /><br />as a black woman, i am extremely embarrassed to have seen this. more so, i am extremely horrified that people of other races may have seen this as well and might believe it to be behavior of black people in general. it's full of stereotypes against all nationalities and genders, horribly vulgar coarse jokes and lame one-liners bleated out by somewhat well known african american comedians who should have known better after reading this script! i must also mention the numerous rap and hip hop singers/rappers that populate the movie like it was an overlong music video---they had absolutely no place in the movie. i guess they were the "jiving & singing minstrels?" horrible. <br /><br />the "writers," producers and whoever had the stupidity to fund this "movie" should all be shot or locked in a room and forced to look at this crap nonstop for the rest of their lives. do-not-watch-this- movie!!! it's time wasted out of your life that you can never get back.
