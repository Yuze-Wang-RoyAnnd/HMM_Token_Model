although this movie (and i use the term loosely) was made in 1997, we just watched it tonight for the first time. my husband commented that a tommy lee jones movie that we'd never heard of made him a little apprehensive. i blithely watched anyway, certain that if jones was in the movie, it must at least be worth two hours of my time. after all, he has been one of our go-to actors for years. although heche isn't one of my favorite actresses, i was additionally reassured by seeing another well-known face. the list of accomplished actors/actresses continued to grow, so i endured more and more of this film, certain that if i pushed through enough clich'es and trite social statements, i would arrive victorious on the other side of the plot. alas, there was no plot. it appeared to be burned by the ever-oozing lava of doom.<br /><br />the characters were paper-thin. the plot was so chock full of holes that it literally distracted me from most of the special effects and acting in the movie. was the fee for a brief consultation with an elementary science teacher too much for this film's budget? no acid rain...no toxic gasses (like sulfur or hydrochloride)...no deadly ash...no skin-searing heat just a few feet from the lava. wow...it's the world's friendliest lava ever! <br /><br />the events were no better than the characters. each incident was so contrived and far-fetched...it's like the writers said "okay, we need to get rid of the little girl now"...and poof, she's splashed by a lava bomb which burns her enough that she has to be carried to safety (not from the lava, but from her own helpless stupor)...but just moments later in the car she is in no apparent pain and soon after is running effortlessly through the (groan!) building that (oh no!) is about to be blown up. after enduring all of this, your reward is the line from the little boy at the end (about all the people looking the same)...which has got to be one of the worst movie lines i have ever heard. even if it wasn't so painfully scripted, it was ridiculous timing for all the characters involved. kid and cop aside, as if the mother would still be in the area and just needs to be pointed out because she just isn't speaking up...what...she's hoping to slink off into the shadows and get away from the little brat once and for all? i don't think so. obviously the child's mother would be missing or dead - or yelling her head off to find her toddler.<br /><br />the token black gangsta tough hoodlum with a secret soft spot versus the chip on his shoulder narrow minded cracker cop with a secret soft spot scene made my eyes bleed. even if such pat characters existed, they wouldn't behave as the movie portrays them given the circumstances. something about imminent fiery death and massive destruction tends to catch people off-guard, ya know? <br /><br />there are too many canned movie moments like these to mention...really, it's just an embarrassing movie to watch. those poor writers...where are they now?
