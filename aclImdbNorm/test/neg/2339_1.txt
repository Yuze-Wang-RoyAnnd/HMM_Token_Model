it's a joke, right?! lynch could not get produced this as a tv show. he was out of money, so what to do? well, he received somehow some dollars and "completed" the pilot and created this mess by just mixing everything together... how can anybody see a failed pilot for tv as an cinematic masterpiece?!<br /><br />and now everybody is guessing about the deeper meaning!? well, wake up, there is none! like in that other tv series by lynch, what was the name again? same procedure there. build up a mystery and then come up with nothing. i guess lynch will repeat this concept until people will realise, the emperor has no clothes. <br /><br />in germany there is a comedian called harpe kerkerling. he dressed up as an opera singer and "performed" some new "art songs". singing complete nonsense like this: <br /><br />"the wolf. the lamb. on the meadow. hurrz!" <br /><br />it's a classic now. <br /><br />anyway, afterwards he discussed it with the audience. and they were talking seriously about the deeper meaning of the wolf / lamb relationship.<br /><br />you people giving this movie a rating of 8.0 in imdb.com, you people could be one of them. <br /><br />so let's say it all together: "hurrz!"<br /><br />0/10 macaulay j. connor
