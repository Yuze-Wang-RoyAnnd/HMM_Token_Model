it's the best film that takes the first place at the sickest and an useful films ever made in this poor country. really u people even don't know what the word cinema means and u cast votes for movies, i'm really curious to know how many movies of p.p.p. or l.bunuel have u seen. the score of this "faield experiment" it reflects a lot of u're way of understanding things and to recognize a good/quality movie when u see it. we the romanian people have only one movie and until this day the status hasn't change & that movie is "padurea spanzuratilor". but i don't lose my time thinking how many of you have seen it. that is a movie that respects all the required quality's's of an movie. from the script to the frames and even to the quality/clarity of the picture even are past over him 41 years. i recommend to the voters to search for better movies and then vote. kudos will see u later .
