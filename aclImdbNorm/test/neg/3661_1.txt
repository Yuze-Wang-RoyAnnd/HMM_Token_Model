my girlfriend and i are really into cheesy horror flicks. especially ones with lots of unnecessary nudity. when we saw the box cover for this movie at blockbuster we thought it would be a perfect movie for the night. we began watching it, already not expecting it to be great, but thought it would at least catch our interest. 20 minutes into the movie we realized that the pace would not eventually pick up and that it was an incredibly boring movie. we tried to get into it, but the plot made very little sense even after reading the back of the dvd box over and over again. the film was shot very dark and it was pretty annoying to try to figure out what was going on in each shot. each violent scenes were very hard to make out, and you never get to actually watch the violence you're expecting. this is definitely a film without motive that was shot poorly and very drawn out. each scene was about 20 minute of the same thing and i felt i got the point after the first 5. skip this film and re-watch another freddy or jason flick and you'll be way more content.
