in my opinion, a good documentary - especially one dealing with controversial political issues - should be informative and as unbiased as possible. the point should be revealing the truth. this means, in particular, having among the interviewees experts on the subject and representatives of all sides. this film is a failure in this regard. most of the interviews included in this film consist of "men off the street" expounding on the question of peace in the holy land. the wall itself, the supposed subject of the film, is given no serious treatment at all. for most of the interviews, the interviewer simply waits to be approached and asks general questions such as "what do you think of the wall?" - she does not approach random people near the wall and ask them how they have been directly affected by it. outside of one interviewee, the israeli general in charge of the wall's construction, we have no "experts" on the subject to provide us with the wall's context (e.g. how and when the project began, whether it has been successful, which groups are for and which against the project, etc.)<br /><br />outside of the interviews, a very large portion of the film consists of extended shots of uneventful scenes, such as head-on shots of the wall, construction of the wall, and people getting off a bus. these shots take up far too much time, in my opinion. it's nice to see what the wall looks like, but the 20-30 minutes of head-on filming of the wall (and only the wall) are excessive. clearly, these shots (accompanied by arabic music that conveys a sense of mourning) are included for the sole purpose of arousing in viewers feelings of loathing for the wall.
