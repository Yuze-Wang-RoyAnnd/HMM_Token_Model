like another user i got this cheap - i thought. 85 kroners (lb8). although not worth that amount of money it is a total classic that i - like the other users - first saw when i was a kid and was looking forward to seeing again some 20 years after. the story is amazingly thin (which is why it might have worked for kids), but all the radio language and trucker stuff makes up for it. it'll look good on my dvd shelf in years to come. first viewing (1980): 10/10. second viewing (2002): 4/10
