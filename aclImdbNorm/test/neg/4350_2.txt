decent action scenes, but the movie is saddled with a slow, convoluted storyline, nearly non-existent dialogue that leads to minimal character development, and a seriously horrible storyline...<br /><br />did i mention that the storyline made no sense? but, in its defense, the action scenes were impressive enough, even if they leave you scratching your head as to why they just happened.<br /><br />there's not much else to say about the movie. it's a slick, mindless action adventure that makes no sense whatsoever. it's like watching a worse version of the matrix and skipping all the storyline and dialogue.
