it's probably a cultural thing---somehow, the natives of this country have been conditioned to find this stuff funny. i have experienced this phenomenon first-hand, during an open-air cinema event, where this film was shown before the feature. most of the indigenous audience laughed, and no, this wasn't in a sanitarium or a clinic for retarded children, this was in a well-to-do area, and the audience consisted mostly of educated adults.<br /><br />so it must be possible, somehow, to find this amusing, but honest to goodness, i have no idea what it takes---maybe it's in the air or the water, prolonged exposure to which causes this condition. something must cause it, obviously, the only thing i can say is that i am quite sure what doesn't cause it: the movie itself.<br /><br />there are no jokes in it. it's brain dead, stupid, nonsensical, unfunny, lame. it's, in short, a waste of time. any tom and jerry is funnier, heck even funerals are funnier.<br /><br />just in case you have been fortunate enough not ever to have seen any of the stooges' performances: it's three guys behaving, running, even talking like retarded infants, causing all kinds of unfunny mayhem, with no plot, no real purpose, and no real conclusion. it's like ugly teletubbies without the cute costumes.<br /><br />sitting in a crowd watching this garbage in this country can be quite exasperating, because you feel like you are at a party with a bunch of potheads and you are the only one who hasn't smoked anything.<br /><br />so unless you are prepared to intoxicate yourself to make this bearable, or come equipped with whatever it is that makes people think watching three ugly old men behave like morons is funny, my advice on this is: stay way. far away.
