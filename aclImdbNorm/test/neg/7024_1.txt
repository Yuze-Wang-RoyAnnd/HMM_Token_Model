i love lucy, but this movie is so wretchedly bad that i was squirming in embarrassment for all concerned within the first ten minutes . . . and it just got worse from there. lucille ball's "singing" is downright painful and the attempts to make her appear more youthful through the use of soft focus had me reaching for my reading glasses. it's bombs like this that give bombs a bad name.
