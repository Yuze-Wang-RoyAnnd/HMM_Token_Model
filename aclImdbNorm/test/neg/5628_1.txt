famous as the british film so bad it had to be given away for free with a newspaper, the quality of this sub-children's film foundation "thriller" can be guessed from the abnormal number of 10/10 votes it gets and the large number of rave reviews from posters with no posting history and no other reviews to their name. the regulars know what this mean, the gullible might be conned. if they do dip into the waters of this one they won't last long before it drags them under. technically inept with the boom mike getting into shot or the reflections of the crew visible it just goes on forever in a forgetful sub-davinci code on $5 a day way. the end is just insulting but don't worry. it's not as if you'll get that far!
