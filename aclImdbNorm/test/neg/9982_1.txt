as a semi-film buff, i had heard of this infamous movie a long time ago. i had heard that it was basically a 15 million dollar film about the tyrannical rule of the roman emperor caligula, complete with hard-core pornography. what struck me was that it was a porno movie yet it had great thespians like peter o'toole, john geilgud, malcolm mcdowell and hellen mirren in it!!?? a week ago i saw a documentary about caligula on the history channel and this film came back into my head and finally my curiousity got the best of me, i foolishly rented the dvd and even more foolishly watched it.<br /><br />within the first 30 minutes i was seeing acts of sex and especially violence that would earn an nc-17 even by todays standards. was it really necessary to have a scene of a man having his urinary track closed and then have gallons of wine poured into him and then have his stomach cut with a sword (all in very graphic detail). and a scene where a guy gets his d*** cut off and fed to dogs (again in very graphic detail)....and this just scratches the surface. the argument for this movie from those who like it seems that it is the only film that honestly portrays pagan rome and it's excesses. when in fact what this movie really is, is sheer exploitation. from beginning to end you see nothing but endless torture, and decapitations and every kind of violence and crude behavior imaginable (sadomasochism, rape, necrophelia, it just never stopped). there is no insight into caligula himself, what might have propelled him to go mad, the horrible childhood he had that molded him into a sadist as an adult. this is not a historic film, it is sleaze. even the porn in this movie stinks, and through much of this when i wasn't gagging i was just incredibly bored. by the time it was over i was depressed, didn't feel much like eating and this movie does the impossible, it actually can turn you off of sex.<br /><br />what were these great actors thinking when they got into this. i did read that the porn segments were filmed after the principal shooting was completed (which explains why none of the main actors are in any of these scenes and why the quality of these scenes is so poor). but still and all these actors must have known what they were getting into. right at the opening credits it says "penthouse magazine and bob gucionne presents". and the scenes that the famous actors actually take part in are completely repulsive in and of themselves. apparently director tinto brass wanted his name removed from the completed film entirely, as did the screenwriter (gore vidal of all people). even john geilgud and peter o'toole were begging people not to see this when it opened at the cannes film festival.<br /><br />for the amount of money the producers spent on this, the movie's quality is terrible. everything is underlit and murky as if the film was dropped in a swamp prior to being developed, and that's when you're lucky enough to view a scene that's actually in-focus. the sound is poorly dubbed, much of the music is awkward and the editing is god awful.<br /><br />anyway, i brought this movie on myself. my advice...don't watch this, don't watch this, don't watch this......as for myself tomorrow night i am going to watch something lighter....like dawn of the dead!
