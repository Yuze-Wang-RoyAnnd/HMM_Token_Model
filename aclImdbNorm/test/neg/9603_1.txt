normally for movie reviews, i try to be constructive and objective, but there is only one word for this, uh, "film" : sucks!!!!!!! the dialogue, acting, special effects, plot, set, and characters all seem as if they were made up by, well, my potted plants. don't see this, for the sake of all that is good and right in this world! :)
