there are so many logical errors in this show it's barely worth me stating. 1) mystic gohan is non existent 2) uub is as powerful as majin buu yet plays absolutely no role in the show, somehow he is easily overpowered by every bad guy 3) the whole super saiyan 4 idea is retarded and it's appalling that he loses to super 17 (which is the worst idea for a db villain ever) 4) super saiyan 4 goku is no match for super 17 but non transformed goku using a move he learned in a movie that wasn't supposed to happen, kills him with ease 5) vegeta is utterly useless 6) no character other than goku has any impact to the outcome of the battles 7) the series ends with a spirit bomb...come on 8) goku invincible? absorbs dragonballs? lame 9) gotenks?...better yet goten??? trunks??? they both suck 10) super saiyan 4 involves a magical transformation into an adult 11) goku is a kid 12) goku is a kid 13) no super saiyan level 2 (characterized by electricity) 14) no imagination with the animation of gogeta 15) gogeta utterly useless 16) big bang kamehameha is the biggest let down in anime history (not really logical but i'm going off on a tangent) 17) shortest character fights ever<br /><br />i could go on longer if i hadn't repressed the majority of memories associated with this show. when i make enough money i am going to fund the remaking of this series.
