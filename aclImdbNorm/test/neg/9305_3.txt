i know everyone said this movie was utter crap and i agree with them. i spent a few years after seeing it telling other people it was crap. i recommended they not see it. but when it came on tv, we saw the ad. i turned to family and said: "i know this is sad, but i'm thinking of watching it". my sister turned to me and said: "yeah, me too." and you know what? it was funny.<br /><br />by no means is this a good movie. it's absolutely a waste of time. but it's a good waste of time. you may still think it's crap and fair enough, but i thought it was a really funny slapstick comedy. i didn't like a couple of bits, like when the fish got hit by the car, but apart from that i thought it was good. i loved sitting there and picking out all the famous australian faces: flacco, elle mcfeast, garry mcdonald etc.<br /><br />so, if you like to waste your time, watch this movie. otherwise, see a drama or something.
