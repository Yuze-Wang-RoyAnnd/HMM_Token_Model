with matthias hues on the cover and only $3.00, i had to buy it. i enjoyed some moments, like hawks annoyance with the pleasure droids, but i only really watched to see matthias hues' scenes. i particularly enjoyed the showdown at the end. it was a cross between clint eastwood's "the good, the bad and the ugly" and "for a few dollars more" (a 3 man quick-draw showdown, with a musical pocket watch used as the countdown timer). apart from that, there's really nothing more i can add. the actors gave good performances, (all except the "assassin droid" whose performance was nothing outside of comical) but the movie really lacked depth and purpose; simply not enough to fill up 1hour and a half of standard movie time, so we're stuck with the main characters aimlessly wondering around from place to place for an hour or so, until the ball gets rolling. for example, the main character returns to the same strip club about 4 times, taking up two-fifths of the movie.<br /><br />the scenery really lacked depth and creativity, probably due to the films budget. i don't think we ever did get to see this "perfect city" of new angeles that was always talked about, in fact, when the main characters finally reached new angeles, its set in a factory or warehouse full of pipes and walkways; hardly the kind of "kingdom" the owner/creator of an entire city would dwell in. the "super-high security" of new angeles was also always talked about, but only a total of 15, maybe 20, security guards were counted, even when the alarm went off; not even close to matthias' approximation of "at least a hundred men out there".<br /><br />if you are a fan of any of the actors/actresses in this film, then you may want to watch it, simply to "add it to the list". however, if you value 1 and a half hour of your time, or $3.00 of your money, you may want to give this one a miss.
