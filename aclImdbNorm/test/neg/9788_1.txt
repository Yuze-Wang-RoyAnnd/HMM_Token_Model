being a former mst3k watcher, even i found this movie unwatchable. the awful attempts at humor-heck the awful attempts at acting. nobody needs to read a harangue on this piece of junk.<br /><br />i just like how all the positive reviews were clearly written by cast members or family friends. just click on their other reviews and wow--they are all reviewing modern vampires. give me a couple of bucks and i can make a movie better than this. one of the most incompetent pieces of film-making i've ever seen and that's saying something. watch at your own risk.<br /><br />rating: 0/10
