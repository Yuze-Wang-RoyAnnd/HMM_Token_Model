oh dear! ohdear!ohdear!ohdear!<br /><br />i love science fiction but this... er... 'movie' just puts space flicks to shame. every sci fi film i've seen over the last year has been disappointing to some degree, and i'm now seriously reconsidering what genre of movies i actually like in future!! (maybe i'll watch romance flicks from now on!) <br /><br />spoilers alert! (and thats not saying much!)<br /><br />this flick is so insipidly dumb it rivals battlefield earth and baby geniuses in sheer badness. the special effects are obviously fake, the big mac truck looked stoopid with its roller coaster seat restraints, the killer robots looked like a more idiotic version of the power rangers, a huge fat guy is sucked out of a port hole window butt first and... space truck school??? wtf?<br /><br />mr hopper can do better than this. what really stunk were the two good-looking young things who accompany him and run around in nothing but their underpants (??) for an entire two thirds of the flick! the obligatory 'sex scene' (snicker!) between our young heroes was so poorly performed i nearly choked on my tonsils laughing at the tv screen.<br /><br />the only character worth mentioning is the pirate ship captain/cyborg/mad scientist. he oozed the word grotesque and was predictably sleazy, but i believe he could've been much more menacing. he does and says things which are quite funny (all the best scenes involve him!) so for the captain i give this movie an extra point.<br /><br />but this flick is so bad it'll make you want to hurl abuse at the tv or maybe throw your tv out the window! it may even kill off a few brain cells and put you into a catatonic state.<br /><br />conclusion? i like the way the captain struggles to walk around on his peg leg when its obviously a fake peg leg!! i would've given it 0 out of 10, but since he cracks me up with his stoopid antics... this flick gets 1/10!
