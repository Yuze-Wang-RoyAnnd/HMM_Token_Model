i had stifled high hopes for this david lynch, whom i really like, film, but the very poor acting by everybody but naomi watts was the first clue that this was a wasted effort. some twin peaks characters are recycled into this film, but it wasn't eerie, it wasn't interesting (except for the topless watts scenes) and the quirks were poorly executed. <br /><br />i will probably give lynch one more chance, but the hype around this film just doesn't pan out, especially for those of us fans who saw eraserhead when it first came out.
