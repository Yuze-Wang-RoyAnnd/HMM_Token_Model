pick a stereotype, any stereotype (whether racial, sexual, cultural, etc.), and i bet you'll find it in wassup rockers. do you think that all hispanic teenage boys are stupid, hairy, inarticulate, and dirty troublemakers? are hispanic girls sex-crazed, easy, ass-baring sluts? do black people all want to start fights and carry guns? do all gay people throw themed parties with pink drinks and ask young boys to model for them? are all white teenage girls rich, stuck-up princesses who are bored with white teenage boys and are looking for something a little more dangerous? if you answered "yes" to any of the previous questions, you, my friend, are a bigot, and you will love wassup rockers.<br /><br />director larry clark likes to shock his audiences (i was 15 years old the first time i saw kids and i think that's why i'm still a virgin), but wassup rockers isn't shocking
