probably the worst movie i have ever seen. it is so cheesily filmed, the focus is not even on this supposed "real half-caste", it is more on the crew coming from hollywood to make the movie. no cinematic significance whatsoever, and if i could take back the almost 1 1/2 hours that i spent watching this film, i would feel much better.<br /><br />at first, it starts out giving you the impression it will be filmed somewhat generically, like an actual hollywood production. however, then they go into the narration of the story, and it's filmed so f***ing terribly. it's supposed to be a take on "blair witch project" really, since they pretty much use what you would think is 'real camera footage', it's not, don't be fooled.<br /><br />worst movie i have ever seen . . . on the positive side, it has like one semi-scary scene in it, and the visuals of the half-caste weren't too bad looking at all. don't rent
