i had the misfortune to catch this on a flight recently. i had the bigger misfortune of having it played on my return flight as well. obviously demi's attempt to get some "arty" cred, the movie is a shambles because of her lousy acting ability. a better actress might have made this work, but a simple look at the face of moore shows the emptiness within. at least she's not ruining american literature this time out.
