i hadn't planned on watching o12 because i didn't like o11 that much. i thought o11 was a nice but slightly boring little bank robbers movie with a sensational arsenal of stars. anyway i was talked into watching o12 one night and i regretted it a lot. the plot is not only boring but also senseless. i honestly don't even know what it was all about. i left the movie after 3 quarters and got some coffee with another girl who didn't like it. much more pleasure i can tell you that. but even the guys who stayed till the end later reported to me that the plot continued being awful and useless. my advice: don't watch. go watch team america (hilarious btw;-)) and forget about ocean's twelve.<br /><br />in my opinion the most boring and senseless peace of crap to be on the screen in years.
