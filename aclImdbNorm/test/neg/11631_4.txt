oh my god! after having such a promising start, critters 2 reiterated the karmic rule of what goes around comes around. clearly, very few things were thought out when this movie was made, and what was up with scott grimes wearing an earing! this should have been the last expedition into the critters saga, but more garbage was on its way. this was the big reason why i didn't watch critters 3, and why is every bad film series has to have an episode in space? (critters, friday the 13th, leprechaun in space, hellraiser, etc.)
