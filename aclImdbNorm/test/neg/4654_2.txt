pretty bad. this film about a grizzled(and frankly rock stupid) old prospector and his dog'shep' i.e., lassie, as well as an annoying kid whose name i can't recall at the moment. at the beginning of the movie, the old prospector has deliberately buried himself in some sand so that the poor dog will have to dig him out. why? did he hate the dog? anyhoo, somehow or other this idiot has managed to strike gold, and goes to tell his partner. but the man has died, and his sleazy other partner is happy to assist old jonathan in digging up the gold. the geezer tries to leave is dog with the dead guy's son, but not even the retarded mutt wants to stay with this kid. there's quaint old preacher(for quaint read smelly), and the oily guy finished off the old guy(surprise, surprise) and tries to steal all the gold. plus he poisons the dog and tries to kill the kid, too. so i suppose its okay that a devilish and crazy lassie..err...shep does this the guy in at the end, although its pretty disturbing in what is basically a children's movie. there are extremely stereotypical(to the point of racial slur) 'native americans' who speak without using verbs(as in, me make camp fire type speech). and that's pretty much the extent of the cast, because apparently lassie's salary was too big for them to hire anyone else. kind of dull. not very interesting, and a tad too dark. not a great movie in any way.
