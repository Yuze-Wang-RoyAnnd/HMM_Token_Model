i don't know if i hate this movie as much as i did when i watched it two weeks ago, but if you're expecting the events described on the box, forget it... that would have been a good movie. the great descent described on the box is nothing compared to the descent into utter dispair that i took viewing this movie. if you've seen hbo's taxi cab confessions, this is the same thing, only fictional, and not even remotely as interesting. if you really want to see something interesting about a cab driver, check out the 20 minute short they run on encore from time to time... it is actually worth watching. i have never, ever asked for my money back for a movie until i saw this ... thing. boring, boring, boring. it does offer one unique trait, which is this: it leaves you to decide what happens to each of the passengers, letting your imagination fill in the gaps. which would be great, if you actually cared about any of these people. instead i found myself yelling at the screen, weeping like a child, praying for either the end of the movie or my own death. the cab driver himself (though well played, considering) runs through emotions seemingly at random, from sarcastic to sympathetic to raging lunatic to apathetic. sometimes it is appropriate, most of the time it's just a display for it's own sake. "dammit, i learned all these emotions in acting class, and i'm gonna use them!" now that i've been thinking about it again, i do hate this movie as much as i did!
