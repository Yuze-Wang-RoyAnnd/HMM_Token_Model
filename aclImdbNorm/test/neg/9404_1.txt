pacino, and maconadump really hit the mark with this stinker. i swear, i am an avid movie goer and fan. i have been a fan of most of the people in this abortion at one time or another. until now. the story-crap the acting- crap(rene ruso-major league was good) the plot-crap the subplot-garbage the teenage attempts to relate to sports betting-junk<br /><br />i have vowed to watch romy and michelle's high school reunion 2 times a day for the next seven days as my punishment for not turning this colostomy bag of a movie off after 10 minutes. i was out of town for a seminar, and this pile of mung cost me $9.99, and 2 hours. i have been cheated. this director should be in jail for fraud.<br /><br />get with me if you have other review questions. i am always right.
