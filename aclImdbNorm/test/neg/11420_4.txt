there are rumours that a fourth underworld is going to happen. if so, than the third part, which is also a prequel, would be in the middle of the franchise. with prequels that succeed the original movies, you always ask yourself in what order should you watch the movies, so that it makes sense ...<br /><br />in this case, i guess it doesn't matter that much. the third underworld movie isn't up to par with the other two. they had their obvious flaws too, but this one lacks a few things and it feels like a cash in. it seems like it's not going full throttle, which is a shame, because the actors sure could've used better material to work with.<br /><br />the story is ok, but it's nothing special. a nice movie, but rhona mitra couldn't fill the shoes of beckinsale (yes she plays another character, i mean the void, that kate b. left) ...
