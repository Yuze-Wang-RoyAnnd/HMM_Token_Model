this movie stinks. imdb needs negative numbers in its rating system to properly evaluate this turkey. the acting is either wooden or over the top; the film was apparently not written by anyone in particular; and the monster scenes were mediocre at best. even as a movie driven solely by the monster scenes, those shots were so disappointing that they could not inspire any sympathy for the rest of the movie. i want the 80 minutes of my life back that this movie stole.
