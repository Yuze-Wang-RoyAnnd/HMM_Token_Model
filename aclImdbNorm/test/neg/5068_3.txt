much like tinto brass ("caligula"), the people who made this movie can't tell the difference between explicitness and eroticism. no build-up at all, just throw naked women on the screen; no, it doesn't work that way. if close-ups of female genitalia aren't your thing, prepare to be looking away from the screen at many points (i often did). the "all women are whores at heart" mentality of the movie is offensive, and the "story" is by turns absurd and boring (the escape is the most boring part!). but halfway through there is a random scene that pops out of nowhere and involves one of the (female) prisoners and one of the (male) guards in a nude wrestling match, which she wins with a couple of judo moves. although the choreography of the fight is bad, the whole scene is undeniably memorable. in fact, that scene and the nice cinematography are the only two reasons i give this film * out of 4, instead of 0.
