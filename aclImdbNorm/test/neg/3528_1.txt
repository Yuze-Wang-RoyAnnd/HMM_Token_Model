i don't know who financed it, or why, but this "want to be" vampire flick is really awful. it tries to be hip, and appeal to the young mtv-generation audience, but it is just downright laughable. the acting is horrible, and the directing is horrendous. i heard the budget was $600,000. i want to know where all the money went?
