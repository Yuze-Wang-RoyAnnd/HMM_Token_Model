being a fan of bela lugosi,boris karloff,and lon chaney jr i had to see this.what tripe the only thing good about this is the clips of lugosi,karloff and chaney jr.along with all the vintage clips,that do not gel with the new black and white footage.not even close to steve martins dead men don't wear plaid,that was done great.with all the technology we have now why was'nt this done better?if you are planning to shell out 5 bucks and some change,be warned this is really bad. but if you like lugosi karloff and chaney jr then watch their movies instead.even ed wood did better then this one.new actor mark redfield is pretty good as an imitation bela lugosi.the clips they use are; the ape,mr wong,most dangerous game,lost world,indestructible man. and devil bat.that notorious bela lugosi classic.i believe this production was very low budget,and it shows.1 out of 10.
