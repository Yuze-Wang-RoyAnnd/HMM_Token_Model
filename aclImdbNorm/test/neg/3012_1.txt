this show is pathetic. i can't even begin to imagine how anyone with an iq greater than that of a can of split pea soup that's past its expiration date can willingly sit through this garbage for an entire half hour. it is one of those rare shows that is so mind-numbingly awful in every respect you can honestly say you are less intelligent simply from watching it. i conducted a study and found that the average person loses 10 iq points for every fifteen seconds they watch this show. that is second only to another comedy network abortion, popcultured (19,863,221 iq points per second lost) and pretty much a tie with girls will be girls. keys to the vip owes each and every one of us an apology. whenever i watch this travesty of a show, i feel sad for society. how is it allowed to continue?
