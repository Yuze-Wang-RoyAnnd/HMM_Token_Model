i would label this show as horrendous if it weren't for the fact that it's on the same network as arrested development. because it is on fox and getting renewed while ad got cancelled. <br /><br />it is absolutely beyond words how atrocious this show actually is. but let me try and describe it. take an extremely low rate archie bunker and have him spout out humor that would have been out of date if it were on married with children. then take great plot lines from ad (son has an ugly, boring girlfriend) and dumb them down so the idiots who watch sitcoms can understand them. <br /><br />if you watch this, i will have completely lost respect for you, as should your family. however, if you are a fan, you should love fox's new comedy 'til death. looks like real funny, cutting-edge stuff. i mean, married couples not getting along ... brilliant.
