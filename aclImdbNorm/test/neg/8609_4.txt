i watched the world premiere of this on the starz action channel. they call it vampires: the turning. the plot was a little confusing. there is a voice-over in the introduction about an 800 year war, and i didn't quite understand. the movie is about a young couple somewhere in asia (maybe in china, i don't think the movie specifies). the couple has an argument and meredith monroe runs off and is kidnapped by a biker gang of vampires. the boyfriend finds a group of vampires that don't kill humans, and enters into a battle with the bikers. a human group of slayers somehow get involved, and the final fight sequence takes place during a solar eclipse. this movie is not related to either vampires or vampires: los muertos. confusing, but decent action. four out of 10 stars.
