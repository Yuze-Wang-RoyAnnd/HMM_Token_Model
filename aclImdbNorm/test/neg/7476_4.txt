again, we're getting a melange of themes well covered by so many previous films. the good and the bad son story, courtesy east of eden. the american marine hero story, who doesn't consider himself to be one due to what he knows. and the grieving wife potentially falling in love with another man story.<br /><br />the mere fact of those stories being that ubiquitous isn't so much of a problem though. because theoretically they could still be better presented and dealt with each time around. no luck this time though, as all three of those threads ultimately fall flat all the same.<br /><br />as the bad son never really gets to talk to his father, so that conflict is never resolved properly. apart from the father kind of starting to appreciate the bad son thanks to the latter renovating the kitchen of the grieving wife. now, how satisfying is that.<br /><br />next, the surprisingly homecoming marine suspecting his wife of unfaithfulness conflict never gets resolved. because he never really talks to the man under suspicion, namely his own brother. so once more we're handed a loose end here.<br /><br />and finally, the american military heroism hypocrisy theme, where the marine is publicly considered a hero when, due to the dirtiness of war he went through, he shouldn't really be called one as to his own standards, that third theme falls flat just the same. because the movie ends right when, for the first time, he's just able to talk to his wife about what he went through. where the real story would actually begin at that very point, namely his process of recovery, how that would look like and how he would finally face the family he'd have some major guilt to admit to. all that, all the really interesting bits are passed over and getting ignored.<br /><br />so while story wise this film is a serious, and i mean serious, disappointment, i'd still give it points for the impressive cast. although no film should use maguire for a voice over, because that belongs to spiderman. especially a grown up gyllenhaal seems to fulfill all the expectations he aroused as a young and aspiring actor. so much that i'd in fact love to see him entrusted with a really deep and demanding lead role of proper profile.<br /><br />so while the cast really seems to do what they can, i consider this film totally forgettable otherwise. a shallow and ultimately pretentious, utterly unsatisfying tear squeezer indeed. message du jour to the writers: we know the wounds already, see the host of vietnam films. you want to earn some credit, show us a believable healing.
