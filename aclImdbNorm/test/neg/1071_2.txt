i don't understand what is hard hitting about this movie! i don't understand why high school kids should watch this! i don't understand why this should have made me think about anything in the slightest!<br /><br />*spoiler*<br /><br />when the un-noticed girl is on her way to commit suicide, was i the only person cheering her on? the clich'e'd classical music, long tracking shots, melancholy emotion of the film by that stage had me in reversal to what was intended. i would have only been happy if she walked into the room and the entire cast was in there with her holding scissors to slit their wrists up. <br /><br />why?<br /><br />cause i went to high school.... and frankly im sick to death of seeing movie after movie in australia with teenagers in it being solely based on terrible clich'es. i've been waiting ages for a younger person to write a movie that im able to relate to and this stereotype driven piece of emo garbage is what i got instead. it was like a dark version of heartbreak high that needed a predictable ending. <br /><br />why are all teenagers in aussie dramas depressed or have really weird problems that just aren't plausibly told? <br /><br />on the plus side, this was funnier then 'blurred'. and i needed a good laugh.
