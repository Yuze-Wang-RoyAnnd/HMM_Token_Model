when i put this movie in my dvd player, and sat down with a coke and some chips, i had some expectations. i was hoping that this movie would contain some of the strong-points of the first movie: awsome animation, good flowing story, excellent voice cast, funny comedy and a kick-ass soundtrack. but, to my disappointment, not any of this is to be found in atlantis: milo's return. had i read some reviews first, i might not have been so let down. the following paragraph will be directed to those who have seen the first movie, and who enjoyed it primarily for the points mentioned.<br /><br />when the first scene appears, your in for a shock if you just picked atlantis: milo's return from the display-case at your local videoshop (or whatever), and had the expectations i had. the music feels as a bad imitation of the first movie, and the voice cast has been replaced by a not so fitting one. (with the exception of a few characters, like the voice of sweet). the actual drawings isnt that bad, but the animation in particular is a sad sight. the storyline is also pretty weak, as its more like three episodes of schooby-doo than the single adventurous story we got the last time. but dont misunderstand, it's not very good schooby-doo episodes. i didnt laugh a single time, although i might have sniggered once or twice.<br /><br />to the audience who haven't seen the first movie, or don't especially care for a similar sequel, here is a fast review of this movie as a stand-alone product: if you liked schooby-doo, you might like this movie. if you didn't, you could still enjoy this movie if you have nothing else to do. and i suspect it might be a good kids movie, but i wouldn't know. it might have been better if milo's return had been a three-episode series on a cartoon channel, or on breakfast tv.
