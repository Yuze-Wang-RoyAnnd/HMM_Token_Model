i was so disappointed in this movie. i am very familiar with the case, having read not only mark fuhrman's book but also the far superior "a wealth of evil: the true story of the murder of martha moxley in america's richest community" by timothy dumas. anyone who watches murder in greenwich should be aware they're watching the mark fuhrman story, not the martha moxley story. this film is nothing more than an ego-trip for fuhrman. just watch his character strut around as if he is the second coming (yes, even being ogled by women). the actors playing the kids look way too old for their roles and the flashbacks to the 1970s are totally unconvincing. if there is any hero to this story, it's martha's family, her mother dorothy and brother john. they kept this case alive for two decades before fuhrman walked into it in order to make a name for himself. they, and martha, deserve to have the true story told.
