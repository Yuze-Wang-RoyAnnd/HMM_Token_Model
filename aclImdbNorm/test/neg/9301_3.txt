this movie stars ben kingsley as frank, a hit man for some russian mobsters based out of buffalo. he is also a raging alcoholic, and this has caused his job performance to decline. after he falls asleep in his car during a would-be hit, his mob boss uncle sends him to san francisco, where he is to attend aa meetings and get a job as a mortician's assistant. if you're thinking that this makes absolutely no sense, you're not alone.<br /><br />it gets worse. well, it actually gets better, but not before getting much, much worse. frank suddenly becomes a master mortician in spite of a complete lack of training, but his reactions with the people in the funeral home and the aa meetings are interesting. the viewer starts to root for him as they notice positive changes in his life. luke wilson is a welcome addition as frank's sponsor, although he is given almost nothing to do (his character does tell us he is gay, but this ends up having no significance whatsoever). the movie plunges headlong into idiocy with the introduction of the tea leoni character. she is completely unrealistic, and her role as a love interest to frank flounders, as the two actors have no chemistry together. around the time she comes into the picture, frank becomes much less engrossing as a character. his characterization is seemingly random; there is no consistency in his behavior. the comedy is low-key and only intermittently funny, especially disappointing considering the comedic pedigree of the cast.<br /><br />problems abound in this one. kingsley's accent is terrible and inconsistent. it alternates between italian, russian, and hispanic. throughout the course of the movie, frank tells numerous people he is a hit man (including an entire aa group), but nobody seems to care, or wants to do anything about it. the movie relies on clich'e scenes to carry it through its final act, most notably when leoni's insufferable character chases frank down at the airport, just when he is about to board a flight back to buffalo.<br /><br />though it has a strong premise and an interesting first half-hour, the movie quickly becomes a total disaster and devolves into complete nonsense. at the end of the film, frank celebrates one year of sobriety. i hope to celebrate many, many years of not having seen "you kill me". <br /><br />my grade: d+
