firstly, let me make it clear that i love aircraft, and usually any film with them in is worth watching - and i've sat through some shocking ones. however, the same is not true of this film. james stewart is an excellent actor, but he is wasted in this strategic air command promotional film. the acting is mediocre, and the direction is weak. i had to stop watching this awful rubbish about half way through. this was despite some really good, maybe even the best, aerial photography. the trouble is, even for an aviation nut like me, making something out of the shocking aircraft featured (b-36 and b-47) just grates on the nerves too much. it's a shame that the film wasn't made when the b-52 appeared, then the superlatives used for the aircraft in this film would have been valid. then i might have been able to sit through it. perhaps i'm missing the point of the film, which may be the angst suffered by loved ones while their beloved are on active duties. in any case, it could have been done much better. recommendation? well worth missing.
