i can't say i was surprised at this atrocity when i watched it a couple months or weeks ago (can't remember). i saw it as a two part episode of zoey 101, because that's how they showed it here in canada.<br /><br />i was incredibly annoyed at the makeover a nerd thing, it's just an example of how unaccepting, unappreciating, superficial, negative, biased, and stereotypical the people in the entertainment business is and frankly i'm extremely peeved. it wasn't at all funny. a nerd is a stereotype and it makes people very offended.<br /><br />secondly, the people in zoey 101 don't have real problems. logan has a big house, he has a famous dad, he has everything and zoey is rich too. they never have to deal with the things that today's tweens and teens have to do deal with such as peer pressure, and stereotype problems. also, the actors are horrific. jamie lynn spears doesn't deserve to be in a television show as successful as zoey 101 (what is wrong with the world?), she doesn't have any talent as an actor. in fact, she's worse than britney! the chase and zoey thing was incredibly predictable, i mean how could the show go on with zoey and chase dating? what other problems could they possibly have? except for the fact that chase doesn't get the girl he wants, everything is perfect! the absolute worse 48 minutes of my television watching life. ever. 0/10 (and that's being generous)
