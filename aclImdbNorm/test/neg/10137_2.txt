my parents may enjoy this show, but i fail to find the humor in it. what is so funny about a dentist husband impregnating his hygienist assistant and the oldest daughter getting impregnated by the captain of the high school football team? absolutely nothing! it's a shock to me sometimes what people think constitutes humor nowadays. blame that on shows like "the dating game" and "the newlywed game" bringing the issue of sex to the forefront in the mid-1960s. sure, the series has its touching moments, still that's no excuse for the content that otherwise went into this series. this is nothing like the family-oriented days of "i love lucy" some five decades before. <br /><br />an answer i would have to why this series plays on the lifetime cable channel is because that channel's brass think women can relate to reba's character! i absolutely dislike the character of reba hart's daughter, kyra. she is best described as a ditsy and bitter teenager! funny, i wonder if the actress who played kyra; scarlett pomers, is like that in real life away from acting. who plays the blockhead ex-husband dentist, christopher rich, is not much better. barbara jean, played by melissa peterman, is ditsy in herself! the characters of van and cheyenne are also very annoying.<br /><br />something else that baffles me is why the dingbat-of-a-series creator, allison m. gibson, decided to set the series in where i live 25 miles away from; houston, texas! reba mcentire isn't even from this state, she's an oklahoman! why is it during one season or more they decided to make the incidental music sound like a pig snorting? what i mean by that is where we hear this baritone saxophone being played with drums accompanying it, but the melodies are basically tuneless!
