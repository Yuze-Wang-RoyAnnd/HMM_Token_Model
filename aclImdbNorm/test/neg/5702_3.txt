it`s funny how instinct warns you of something . for example as soon as the company credits read nu image i knew instinctively i`d seen a really crap film by them somewhere before but couldn`t remember where . nevertheless i just knew judge and jury was going to be crap and it was . maybe i`m psychic ?<br /><br />!!!! mild spoilers !!!!<br /><br />the opening is rather violent with several people getting blown away for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time . i don`t know about you but i`m geting slightly fed up with exploitive violence onscreen nowadays along with bad language , especially if it`s spouted by actors as bad as the ones in this movie . anyway the plot revolves around the bad dude getting executed and coming back to reek revenge on the man who shot his wife . oh did i mention the bad dude and his wife murdered a couple of people on their wedding night ? yeah he`s a serious badass mofo . in fact he`s so bad ( and i don`t mean the acting - i`ll get to that in a moment ) that he`s impossible to take seriously and this is before he`s executed only to return as elton john , elvis , a french chef etc . i wonder if keith david got paid for this ? because he looks lke he`s having so much fun on screen that`s the only reason he`s playing the role . what a pity this reviewer didn`t have any fun whatsoever watching judge and jury . hey maybe the producers could send me keith`s fee ? gawd only knows i deserve it.<br /><br />i disliked this movie a lot as if you hadn`t guessed and my main beef isn`t with the stupid plot or the cheap production values but with its attitude to violence . if like me you`ve had a wine bottle cracked over your head or been kicked in the ribs very hard several times you`ll know violence is an obscene painful thing , but judge and jury will have you believe that if you`re thrown through a window , crash through some bannisters and fall twenty odd feet onto a table not only will you be unhurt but you`ll be able to outrun a couple of rabid devil dogs . it could of course be argued that any film starring sly , arnie or bruce also suffers from this same dishonest showing of violence but with judge and jury it yanked my chain
