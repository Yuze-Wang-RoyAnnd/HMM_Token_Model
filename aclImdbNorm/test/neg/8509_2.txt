if you haven't read tolkien's masterpiece; prepare yourself for maybe the best movie experience ever! if you have however... after having read the books several times, over many years, i have come to love the characters and story, and feel i know it intimately. i have my own personal vision of the shire, hobbiton and the character-gallery. thus for me the movie was a disappointment. why? it dictates the appearance of the characters (unavoidably), it changes events, it removes important storyline, it removes not-so-important storyline. great chunks of what makes the lord of the rings what it is, is simply ignored. even 2001 special effects can't do tolkien's (and your own) imagination justice. peter jackson has made an honest attempt at the impossible, and i don't think anyone else could have done it better! but the fact remains, i regret seeing the movie. the next time i read the lord of the rings, peter jackson's limited vision will leap forward, not my own.
