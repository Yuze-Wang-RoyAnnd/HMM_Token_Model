seagal was way off the mark with this film. i'm a fan of his and come to expect cool fight scenes and sharp one liners but this film had none of this, instead it had injections and cheesy music. even if you're a fan of his i strongly recommend you keep away from this film and watch under siege or even on deadly ground instead.
