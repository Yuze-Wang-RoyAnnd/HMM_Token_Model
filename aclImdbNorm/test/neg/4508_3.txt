victor buono as the devil? surely somebody must have been drunk when that casting decision was made. that's not the worst part of this silly mish-mash of sundry haunted house devices but it gets my vote for being the funniest part of it. while the film is by no means terrible it doesn't even approach other 1970's "haunted house" flicks like amityville horror, the changeling and the legend of hell house. the evil can be entertaining in spots, but don't expect to be scared. it's better approached as what it is: a silly horror film made all the sillier by it's over-serious approach.
