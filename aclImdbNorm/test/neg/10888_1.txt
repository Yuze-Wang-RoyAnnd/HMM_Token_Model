this movie has to rank with "welcome to the jungle" and "the hitcher" and "dream catcher" for sheer god-awfulness. you've got the most irritating heroine in gore history who spends most of her time sobbing and wailing and shrieking--all the time in the most horrendous rest stop toilet ever put on film. why she spends so much time in this ghastly bathroom from hell is never explained. even when the usual killer truck driver is trying to murder her, she refuses to leave the crapper. when a motorcycle cop comes to her rescue, the killer truck driver runs over the cop's legs while the heroine just looks on. instead of grabbing his gun for protection, she drags the poor slob into the crapper and locks the door. then the cop orders her to blow his brains out because of the pain. she does so--while wailing and sobbing and keening--and blows the back of his head off. then--the cop, still alive, beg her to shoot him again because he's still in pain. he says this while the entire back of his head is all over the floor. the sobbing, wailing heroine shoots him again. the movie goes on and on like this, none of it making any sense. the heroine is so dislikable you really want the killer to off her early on. i saw this flick on the sci-fi channel so it didn't cost me anything to watch, but still i did watch, out of sheer fascination as to how a movie could end up so terribly bad.
