this movie is pathetic in every way possible. bad acting, horrible script (was there one?), terrible editing, lousy cinematography, cheap humor. just plain horrible.<br /><br />i had seen 'the wishmaster' a couple weeks before this movie and i thought it was a dead-ringer for worst movie of the year. then, i saw 'the pest' and suddenly 'the wishmaster' didn't seem so bad at all.<br /><br />bad bad bad. excruciatingly bad.
