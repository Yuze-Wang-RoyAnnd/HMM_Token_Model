this was the most god awful movie i have had to sit through. 30 minutes into the film and i couldn't take any more. seriously, do not bother with this one unless you are a sentimental nut job or one of those pseudo-arty types that like this kind of tripe so that they may feel more cultured. boring, although the acting is fine; the kid is just plain irritating. some scenes are a little strange with very weird close-ups. i don't know why they did the whole movie in black and white, but whatever effect they were hoping to have failed miserably. there was just nothing to watch, and although its a sad tale, supposedly, its just so stupid that its hard to feel any sympathy for the characters.
