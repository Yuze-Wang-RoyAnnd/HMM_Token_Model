i have to agree that the movie is not the best i've ever seen, but i would like to make mention that the actors portraying tommy and jimmy dorsey were the actual dorsey brothers. as actors, they were wonderful musicians. the movie, based on their famous split, would have been better had professional actors played the parts. many movies made during this time frame took advantage of the popularity of big bands. most often, the movies were not that good because musicians are not actors by trade. most of the movie-going audience didn't go to see tommy or jimmy dorsey playing themselves; they went for the plot and the music. i've never been much of a dorsey fan, but the music is good even today.<br /><br />i have to comment on a previous post regarding the actors who played mom and pop dorsey and that their accents would be considered extreme by a dublin audience. arthur shields and sara allgood were actually irish actors, both born in dublin. you might remember mr. shields as the reverend mr. playfair in the quiet man and ms. allgood as mrs. monahan in cheaper by the dozen.
