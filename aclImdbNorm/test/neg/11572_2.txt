imagination must of slipped jim wynorski mind when he wrote the script to this one. i don't mind when the animals scenes are almost identical but when the actors repeat lines from other movies is going a little too far. i did enjoy seeing jay richardson and glori ann gilbert get eaten. gloria brings nothing to a movie but her tits (my husbands sentiments). jerri manthey should of stayed on survival island her acting is stiff, unbelievable and she just a plain boor. liked the scene where the cobra comes out of the ocean eats the guy then for added flavor destroys the dingy. at least we know the next plot giant snake man slays komodo before becoming daddy to a nest of eggs. jerri would be great as the mother cobra. sit back with a 6 pact or a couple of joints. it will ease the pain.
