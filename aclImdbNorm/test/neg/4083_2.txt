oh mr. carell! how far you've fallen! after a glowing moment in little miss sunshine, steve carell's choice of films is beginning to contrast starkly with what has come since. although the 40 year old virgin was entertaining, it was dwarfed by his "sunshine" character. hoping to find something that'd get me to spew popcorn from my nose, i decided to rent evan almighty and see what possible guffaws might await me here. not much...<br /><br />given the trite and clich'ed script, the entire film felt forced and unemotional. poking a bit of fun at flagging family values and the current u.s. administration's take on the environment, evan almighty also tries to put a profound biblical moment into humorous terms but fails miserably.<br /><br />nearly every person on earth knows the story of noah and the ark. god's wrath was sent down with 30 days and nights of rain which flooded the entire planet while noah, his family, and two of each of his creatures on earth rode out the wetness in relative comfort via the gopher wood ark. it was a huge moment in human history (if you believe the biblical text).<br /><br />so why would god appear to one man and ask him to build an ark that would only carry the world's animals for a few minutes after a dam break? the simple answer is that he never would. too much emphasis was given to u.s. government policy and not enough on world events, making evan almighty a terribly myopic and ameri-centric film. although designed as a comedy, it really never reaches anything approaching belly laughs. maybe a few grunts and a smile, but little else.<br /><br />john goodman (cars) pulls in another forced performance as the despicable congressman chuck long who's only goals are to create development opportunities on protected national land holdings. even the strong presence of morgan freeman (10 items of less) as god can't help mop up this soaking wet disaster-of-a-film.<br /><br />the only funny moments are between carell and the animals, especially as evan learns what animal magnetism is really like. birds literally flock to him. sheep herd around him. lions take pride in being near him (please forgive the puns).<br /><br />the special effects were fun to watch but were brief (with good reason). the "flood" was interesting in that the ark was obviously guided by his hand and shoved in just the right direction.<br /><br />but other than that you're in for little more than an insult to common sense and intellect.
