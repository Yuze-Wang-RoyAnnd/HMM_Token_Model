i have to agree with the other two comments. i waited over a month to see this great new show a&e had been hyping. what a disappointment!!! the show is pretty much all about ryan buell. his voice-overs are campy, not creepy. it sounds as if he is talking into a can. as of the second episode, which is roughly 30 minutes or so (if you take out the commercials) he is being chased or followed by something that he knows is demonic. he can't say the name, anytime someone needs to convey that name, they write it on a piece of paper and hand it to someone else. not particularly informative or entertaining or believable for the rest of us. why can't he say the name?...supposedly it would give the demon more power. funny, i always thought demons wanted to hide their true identities. if you know the exact name of the demon, doesn't it make it easier for you to cast them out. now the next episode, which airs in just a little while is titled "exorcism". so is ryan in need of an exorcism already? not to say that it couldn't happen but the show so far has not given any evidence or proof of anything. i can tell ryan that if i were a small child, hell if i was an adult, and someone gave me a little bottle of holy water to chase away something that was terrifying me, i would look elsewhere for help!!! besides which, if you don't use holy water & blessings, etc. in the right way don't you risk just further infuriating whatever is already mad at you? i will probably watch tonight but if these episodes are as ridiculous as the first, it will probably be the last time i watch it!
