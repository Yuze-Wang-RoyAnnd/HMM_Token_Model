an object lesson in how to make a bad movie which masquerades as horror. without going in too close i would imagine this is the results of a bunch of film school students all adding bits to the story and then actually acting in it! its like a film workshop of some kind and its a film badly in need of an editor-in which case it would have lasted 10 minutes! the director of this garbage probably had more money than sense. consider the number of submitted scripts or even unreleased films which would have benefited from this. the so called granny who was killing people in some pretty stupid ways looked like christopher lloyd in back to the future-or maybe the musicians johnny winter/edgar winter. it starts off with 20 minutes of crass boring nonsense spouted out by the students-something about paranoia. giving this rubbish 1 is because it can't get any less. it has not one single redeeming feature-and when one of the girls thinks the body on the floor covered in blood is the guy fooling about she has to actually taste the red stuff before she knows its not tomato ketchup! its an insult to the intelligence of an idiot
