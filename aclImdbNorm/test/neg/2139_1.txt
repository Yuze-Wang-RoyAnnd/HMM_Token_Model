i'm not sure what the director and editor were thinking when they were editing this poor excuse for a film, but whatever they thought of didn't help this movie, it only hurt it, and it hurt this film badly. the acting, for once, isn't the problem, it's the horrible editing, scenes will end for no apparent reason, while in the middle of an action sequence or people will be cut off in mid sentence. i'm not sure what the story was, but it didn't really matter, since what i did see was fairly uninteresting. just bad all around, a huge "jaws" rip-off and not a good one at that. the mst version was funny though. 7 for that, none for the film itself.
