in this horrible attempt at a blair witch mockumentary, a bunch of people go to africa to investigate a creature called the half-caste. it's pretty obvious that there was no script to speak of, and that everything was improvised. that can work if you have good actors, which this film didn't. <br /><br />this movie tries to gain points for originality by exploring a more obscure myth and an exotic culture. as a result, there are a lot of scenes out in the bush where characters do "quirky african stuff" like eating elephant dung. there is also some pretty good footage of lions eating (from a national geographic perspective) but there's not a single scare in the whole movie. <br /><br />if you've seen cannibal holocaust or the blair witch project, this movie will hold no surprises for you, and you can probably watch better lion footage on the discovery channel.<br /><br />definitely a half- aste effort. <br /><br />a note to the filmmakers: guys, do us all a favor and next time save the "how i spent my african vacation" home movie for your family and close friends. nobody else wants to see it.
