4 oscar winners, karl malden, sally field, shirley jones, michael caine. great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle. 1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of good lord, what were they thinking?<br /><br />irwin allen was just trying to cash in on the popularity of the original classic disaster film with a grade d minus script, the actors were obviously just in it for the paycheck as well,... the horror, the horror!<br /><br />how insane are the characters that caine, savalas, malden and field are playing? go into a potentially deadly sinking ship that's 1. on fire 2. hot from steam 3. slippery from water and oil, 4. boilers that are exploding every 5 minutes, etc., all for the love of money? greed? 5. they have very little equipment, not even a pair of gloves or work boots in sight, much less a grappling hook, rope, etc.<br /><br />stupidity!<br /><br />what were they thinking?<br /><br />peter boyle overacts so much that i just wanted to smack him! stop it! and what's the deal with the bad toupee? also, there is no way you can believe his character was a ww2 veteran.<br /><br />caine, field and malden find all that gold and money and they are happy--whoopee! we're rich! (we may not live to spend it, but hey...)<br /><br />and yee haw, it's the great character actor slim pickens!<br /><br />survivors galore! jack warden and shirley knight, too!<br /><br />the final dramatic sub plot about that scary plutonium never really went anywhere, it's like they forgot, sort of? lots of holes in the script.<br /><br />this film has an illness that the strongest pill couldn't cure. i'm surprised alan j. smithee's name wasn't on the script, i'd be embarrassed to have penned this one!<br /><br />oh the insanity, oh the humanity! oy vey!<br /><br />the horror, the horror!<br /><br />it's like a bad two hour tv movie.<br /><br />at least the sets were made from recycled material from the first movie.<br /><br />the script needed to be on the compost heap...
