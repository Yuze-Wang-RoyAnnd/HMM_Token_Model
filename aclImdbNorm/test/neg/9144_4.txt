that is the answer. the question is: what is the single reason to watch this movie? i loved her in "my name is julia ross." that is one of the best films noir of all time. noir or whatever one may call it, it's a very unsettling movie.<br /><br />she is fun in one of the worst major studio releases of all time, too. that would be "the guilt of janet ames." this one has a spooky, promising title. it has a good cast. it has a fine director. i was expecting something dark. maybe something a little tawdry. instead, it's an uninspired, routine espionage movie. it's pretty much is a total bore. at least it was to me. ms. foch is captivating. and that is about it.
