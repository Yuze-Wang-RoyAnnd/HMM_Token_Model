i've read plenty of jane austen in my time and approve of several cinema/tv adaptations but this one we just don't need.<br /><br />rating is a 2 as i wouldn't say it's awful just so boring you will feel like you've wasted 90 minutes of your life. dull script matched by even duller acting. i've heard billie piper is ok in dr who (not a fan so can't confirm) but in this she just sucks. there is absolutely no chemistry between the leads. this is austen, it's supposed to be a romance!<br /><br />please don't let this put you off austen or historical dramas. there are plenty of better programmes to view.
