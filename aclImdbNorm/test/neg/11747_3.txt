don`t be fooled into thinking that this is a remake as in this years remake of the time machine is based on an earlier film . it`s not because this is a pointless re- film . that is the director has used the original camera script shot for shot similar to the " remake " of the get away from a few years ago . the scenes are identical to the original , the dialogue is identical to the original , the camera angles are identical , no attempt whatsoever is made to embellish or restructure the original script ,( but with a director like van sant at the helm we should be thankful . he sure ain`t no hitchcock ) in fact i might even be correct in saying the costumes might be the same because the private eye wears a pork pie hat. didn`t they go out of fashion in the late 1960s ? <br /><br />bottom line:avoid
