in the same way lamberto bava was a substandard facsimilie of his father, mario (who was an extremely overrated director anyway), michele soavi is a substandard director in the dario argento mold. "the church" has at least one thing to recommend it--the incredibly detailed art direction--but absolutely nothing else. the film is long-winded, filled with one-dimensional characters, and almost put me to sleep several times. there's a fine line between 'art' and 'pretentious crap,' and while "the church" isn't completely worthless, you'd be better off watching something else.<br /><br />3/10
