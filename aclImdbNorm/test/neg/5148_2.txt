*****spoiler ahead*****<br /><br />i suppose that you shouldn't expect much of a made for tv movie, but this one was especially bad, the plot was a good idea, but badly done, the acting wasn't especially good. and the ending of the film was just terrible. the main character was perfectly normal all the way through the film, and then suddenly when we find out that she was the killer she just turns into a mentally challenged psychopath. it's completely pathetic.<br /><br />there is only one reason really to watch this film, yasmin bleeth, although haven't we all seen her in a swimsuit before ? don't bother even watching this waste of time, if you want a film about the world of beauty contest then watch "drop dead gorgeous" instead, it's only an infinite number of times better.
