i have recently become a huge fan of patton oswalt. i think he's the most deliciously original comedian to come along in ages. he is refreshing and fearless in his routines, which run the gamut of topics from how much bush sucks to the sleazy exploits of 1970s producer robert evans. i'm a longtime fan of maria bamford and her wide-eyed innocent/schizophrenic routine. whenever she effortlessly switches her naturally high-pitched voice to one that is clipped and throaty, i can't help but giggle. i liked brian posehn long before i even knew he was on "just shoot me", and there is something so innately funny about his aging nerd persona. all three of these talented, unique comedians headline "the comedians of comedy", a netflix documentary about their u.s. tour. they truly deserve to be stars, and this tour gave them the recognition they so richly deserve. i thought,no, i knew i'd like this movie...<br /><br />but i was wrong. instead of the three comics each getting their own routine segments, "the comedians of comedy" is bogged down by meandering and dull documentary scenes that contain no humor, no insight, nothing of real interest. i think there is a total of 30 minutes of intermittent stand-up routines total in the 109 minute movie. what a rip-off! come on, is anyone really interested in seeing our stars banter in their rv? where's the humor in seeing posehn in an arcade and a comic book shop? does anyone find random diner scenes particularly funny? if this movie couldn't have shown our comics strutting their stuff, at least make it about what life is like on the road. it's not even about that. worst of all, the comics never appear to be having real fun. oswalt admits how bored he is doing a radio interview, posehn sheepishly admits to how much he sucks at giving a tour of his home, and bamford nervously improvises every time the camera is pointed at her, and her humor there is only sporadic.<br /><br />sheesh, these guys deserve a chance to show the world their unconventional, amazingly crafted humor that is a refreshing change of pace from the brainless entertainment of mainstream comics like dane cook. instead, we have to sit through their mundane, everyday routines on the road in a substandard bore of a movie whose quality could easily be surpassed by any student film. if you can locate any of oswalt's, posehn's, or bamford's performances on dvd, by all means do. their talent should be a joy to behold, not a chore like it is here.
