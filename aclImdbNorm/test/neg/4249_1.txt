i didn't like watching ds9 compared to other star treks even enterprise, but i didn't like babylon 5, and now i know why. they are the same show. i just read the old news that paramount stole the idea from the creator of babylon 5, but they chose not to sue for a reason i don't know or care, but seeing as a star trek series is based off another even nerdier show is just to much to bare, now i will condemn anyone who even mentions the ds9 when talking about the series. original, tng, and voyager are my favorites in that order. before i didn't understand why everyone thinks ds9 is great and i didn't, but know i know. it's also because the captain has a real anger problem, and i hate people that act cool, but freak out, out of no where; and he seems to on every episode.
