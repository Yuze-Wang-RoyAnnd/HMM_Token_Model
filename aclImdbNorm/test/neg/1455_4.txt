overrated mob comedy. director demme makes the actors pause after some funny lines to let audience laugh, and not miss next line. seems odd - this director did "silence of the lambs" - now there's the way to use pauses! casting seems off. mathew modine too young for fbi agent and pfeiffer's love interest! dean stockwell is doing a jack nicholson-thing with a squint, and he gets a nomination for it! plus we have to accept pfeiffer and stockwell as italians? charles napier as a hairdresser and al lewis as a mob lawyer are underused with only one line each - they should be the bumbling hoods. song score by chris isaak is totally out of place - better for a flick like "pretty in pink." re-make this movie, it's worth it, but with proper casting and director and the satire will come through... even the often repeated "forgedaboutit."
