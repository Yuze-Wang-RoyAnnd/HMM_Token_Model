in 1990 i saw kathy ireland in person - i was at unt in denton during the filming of "necessary roughness." strangely enough, the voice she's using in this film isn't too far off from her real speaking voice.<br /><br />anyway, the plot goes like this: kathy gets a letter telling her that her father's fallen into a bottomless pit in africa. she goes and investigates the site of her father's death, only to get sucked into a subterranean world that's part dystopian nightmare, part uninspiring fantasy, and inhabited by rejects from the plasmatics. this movie really wastes the talent of linda kerridge, who, in my opinion, could have been someone had she gotten that one big role that was right for her. anyway, the main hero of the story, gus, is a very lame mark "jacko" jackson rip-off. the original is annoying enough to begin with, but this guy really is torture to watch. eventually the nebbish wanda comes out of her shell and ends up wearing a bikini top and a sarong at the end. if you're going to have kathy ireland in a film in skimpy clothing, it'd better be a bikini. anyway, the film was just all around bad and rightfully skewered by mst3k.<br /><br />avoid this one if possible.
