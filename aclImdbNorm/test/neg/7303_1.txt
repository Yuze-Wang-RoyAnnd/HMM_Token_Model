for many years ed wood's classic 'plan 9' has been considered the worst film ever made. forget it the roller blade seven is infinitely worse. the cast is made up of famous peoples brothers and almost famous or has been actors and actresses. the plot along with the budget and script are non-existent. the running time is made up not in the classic ed wood style of using stock footage. instead there is endless slow motion and repeated action. and as for the roller blade seven aren't even seven of them!<br /><br />you must see this film just to know how bad film making can really be. giving independent film makers everywhere hope.
