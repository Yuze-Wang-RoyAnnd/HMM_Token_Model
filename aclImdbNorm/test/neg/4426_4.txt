yet another lo wei production to completely waste the talents of a young jackie chan, to kill with intrigue is a strange mix of wuxia, melodrama, supernatural action, and plain old-school kung fu fighting that is pretty dull despite featuring several surreal wtf moments and lots of laughably bad dialogue.<br /><br />in an effort to protect his pregnant girlfriend chin chin from the killer bees, a gang of ruthless killers that are about to attack his home, cao lei (jackie chan) pretends to be a heartless cad, driving her away, and thus saving her from danger.<br /><br />during the attack, cao's relatives are all killed, but he is left relatively unharmed by the gang, whose leader, a scar-faced woman, seems to have the hots for him. cao then goes in search of chin chin, whose safety he has entrusted to his close friend chu chuk.<br /><br />during his quest to find his true love, cao befriends the head of a courier company whose precious cargo has been stolen by the leader of the evil 'bloody rain' clan. eventually, after being injured in a fight against members of the nasty clan (a fun scene with lots of silly weaponry), and then nursed back to health by the scar-faced killer bee (who shows her love by burning his face!), cao ultimately learns that he is a lousy judge of character: his friend, chu chuk, is none other than the power hungry head honcho of the 'bloody rain' clan, who has plans to marry chin chin himself.<br /><br />cue the drawn out climactic battle, with cao getting kicked in the face repeatedly before eventually choking his traitorous ex-pal to death with a scarf.<br /><br />even die hard chan fans will find this one a chore to sit through, with only the final fight managing to showcase some of the star's amazing acrobatic abilities. fans of general asian weirdness might dig the spooky appearance of the killer bees at the beginning of the film (with one character inexplicably demanding back his severed hand!), or the moment when three men float through a window to attack our hero, but, for most, this film will have very limited appeal.
