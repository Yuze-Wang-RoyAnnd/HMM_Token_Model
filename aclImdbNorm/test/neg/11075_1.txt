i love movies...and rarely do i see a movie that i hate...but this was the worst movie i have ever seen, or at least close to it. any movie that ends with a rape scene is awful. hands down... i cant believe i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie. i'm really mad, i want my money back and my time back. awful! do not go to see it, the cinematography is awful, the plot is awful, the ending is awful. i didn't know what was going on during half the movie cause i could not see it(and i was watching on a very nice, and big, tv) rent saw, the hills have eyes, or house of wax...any of those are better if u want something scary.
