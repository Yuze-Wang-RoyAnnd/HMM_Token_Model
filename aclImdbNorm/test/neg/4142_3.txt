this movie was a thorough diappointment. there was no development of the story. viewers were thrown into the story without explanation and left to fend for themselves in trying to work out what was going on. the action sequences were okay but confusing. they weren't the matrix and they weren't crouching tiger. this movie is best left to cable tv where you don't have to pay to see it or convincing a friend that they should hire it and then go over and watch it. as a huge jet li fan, i expected more. how can someone involved with once upon a time in china put his name to this one???
