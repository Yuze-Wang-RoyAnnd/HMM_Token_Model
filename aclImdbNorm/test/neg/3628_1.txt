this show sucks. it was put on fridays on roller-coaster, and whilst it undoubtedly destroyed the running theme of friday programming i shall judge it rationally... still i think it sucks. it really is super lame. zoey and her stupid friends are weak characters and the pot sucks and is really lame. <br /><br />the lame continuuity and pot sucks and i reckon the dialogue and joes are weak. the weak humour and lame sucky characters suck, and the whole show is frankly a disappointment not worth watching. it sucks and is really, really lame. it really has to be one of the lamest shows on tv, really not worth watching. i mean how lame weak and sucky can a show get before it gets axed?
