as joe bob briggs would say, this movie relies a lot on the actresses' talents rather than their talent. this early 1990's show-the-babes-in-bikinis-fest has very little to redeem it, other than showing beautiful women nearly naked. joe estevez, martin sheen's little brother, proves once again that his movie career will be nowhere near what his brother's career is.<br /><br />avoid this one unless you like watching beautiful women in skimpy clothing. it's about the only thing that redeems it.
