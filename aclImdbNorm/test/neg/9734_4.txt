oh boy. films like this really bother me. if this movie is supposed to close to truth, then i assume that rommel knew hitler for a time before wwii started. in the movie, rommel mentions how hitler had changed from before. well i can't imagine that rommel wouldn't have known something about hitler's government policies so rommel must share some guilt for the german atrocities. with that in mind, i have a problem with a movie that makes rommel's life at the end a tragic one. he made his choices and we have to feel bad for him? i can't do it. i also can't buy the theory that if the more competent generals were allowed to fight the war, the allies would have had more trouble winning it. if more competent people were in charge, wwii may never have started in the first place. from a movie watching aspect, the film jumps from place to place and most of the time seems like a history special with big name actors playing the historical roles. leo g. carroll has a couple of good scenes with james mason and i liked the fact that everyone spoke english without the ridiculous accents. but other than that not very essential.
