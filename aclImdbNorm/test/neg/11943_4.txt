yes, i spelled that right. this movie is so predictable, the actual word needs additional letters to exemplify the predictability. from the moment the principal characters and situation are introduced, it is paint-by-numbers as to where this plot will take us. the foreshadowing was as subtle as a two ton sledgehammer. you could take numerous pieces of dialogue and anticipate the role it would play in the ending.<br /><br />catherine zeta-jones and aaron eckhardt did decent jobs in undemanding roles and abigail breslin played the cute role admirably. it's just that the movie brought absolutely nothing new to the romantic comedy genre. the romance was tepid and the laughs were weak and few. sure, it's an ok movie if you have nothing to watch, but you won't miss anything by missing this one.
