sex is a most noteworthy aspect of existence. it is perhaps the most interesting activity there is between birth and death. le declin de l'empire americain studies human sexuality in a dry and boring manner. actually, worse than being simply boring, seeing nude 40-year-olds is, well, unpleasant.<br /><br />i guess there is some shock value in having adults as old as our parents talk about sex, but after twenty minutes, this stops being interesting. perhaps if the characters were all 20 years younger, the film would be more visually captivating.<br /><br />le declin de l'empire americain is not worth the time.
