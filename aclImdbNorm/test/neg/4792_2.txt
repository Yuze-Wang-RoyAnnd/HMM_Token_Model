another awful movie from hollywood. this time a female helps the revolution in a central american country. yeah yeah yeah. hey lets make a movie without any sense of realism at all. i am so sick of movies like this one. the actors and actresses are lousy, the effects are cheesy and the dialog horrible. and suddenly i see john rhys-davies as the evil president. from gimli to hugo louis ramos. i bet he is very proud of this. well i shouldn't have expected much of this movie and i didn't. and i am glad cause this sucks bigtime. i wonder what kind of people who like this movie. my guess is younger people aged 12-16. and i guess some people like because of kristin dattilo. well i am in neither of those group and i hate it. rating: 2
