this film was total rubbish. i was sitting watching this absolutely furious that this was funded. they most definitely spent all their budget on the special fx rather than the script writer and director and some of the actors.<br /><br />first the acting was bland and rubbish. the story was not relatable to the audience enough. rather than being from the peoples perspective of the storm, the narrative was told more from government figures and the army, which really isn't a way to connect to them as most of us hate politicians anyway. the writer attempted to add a human element to the unrealistic characters by adding the little subplot about the father and son, which failed completely.<br /><br />as for the directing...oh god, his techniques to try and create tension and unease are repetitive and over the top. the sped up camera movements and then the sudden flash bolt pauses on a characters face when something horrendous has happened was pathetic.<br /><br />the only reason i watched it till the end was to see the special fx. which is a bad thing as special fx shouldn't make the film it should only amplify the story and experience. there was no story.<br /><br />i really wouldn't bother watching this, total trash and an embarrassment to the british film industry.
