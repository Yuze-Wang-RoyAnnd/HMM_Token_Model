i like underground films when they have something to say, or show, for that matter. i tried hard to like "trash". i tried to see some artistic achievement, or some interesting representation of new york city life in the early 70's. or at least being entertained by it? but the movie stinks and can't be called either art or entertainment.<br /><br />"trash" is basically an excuse to expose joe dallesandro's nude body for 2 hours, while he meets other uninteresting, annoying figures (i agree, that's a gorgeous body, but no excuse for a whole movie about it, right?). holly woodlawn, as joe's girlfriend, provides a few good laughs by the end, but then it's too late to save those wasted couple of hours. lou reed's classic song "walk on the wild side" is a better portrayal of those people and that time, even if it's more fascinating than they actually were. 1.5/10.
