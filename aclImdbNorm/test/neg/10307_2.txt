i love this show. i watched every episode last year. i bought the dvds. and i tune into to watch tonight and i see for some reason you have retooled this great show. and you have taken what made it work and ruined it. you took one of the best aspects of the show away which was the 4 friends. sam, sully, lizzy and piper. i love the other characters as well, but they are good in small dozes like derek, darcy and even sully. it is like the show lost some of its family and everyone else is trying to hard to fill in. it is overdose. while things are funny in small dozes when you are exposed to it all the time it goes from funny to annoying. i was so looking forward to the return of this show. so please bring back the charm. even if you could not fit piper into the show at least bring lizzy back. but i loved those girls. they brought the fun. the show was about sam trying to live his business life and handle his personal life and friends as well. that was the charm. and that great dog as well.<br /><br />i hope the network (fox) forced the writers to do this and the writers did not willingly do this to the show. i will give the show a couple more episodes before i give up, but tonight's episodes were bad. i made a big deal out of the show returning tonight and had people over and i felt like a fool, because no one was laughing except 2-3 times. i apologized to them and said i don't know what happened. and about 10 minutes into the episode i realized they were not going to show piper or lizzy and this was no longer a must see tv comedy.
