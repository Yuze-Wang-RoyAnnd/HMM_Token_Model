a whole lot of the people that have seen this are confused, obviously. the original title of "cottonmouth joe" would've put things into better perspective for much of the viewing audience. i have personally experienced the condition of cottonmouth (often accompanied by a really bad hangover after a weekend bender) and it is indeed a lot like the movie skeleton man -- a dry, scummy film that provokes regret for recent choices and begs for a hot shower.<br /><br />it is unfortunate that the choice of "skeleton man" for the title was finalized by the distributor (probably the work of some meddling hollywood no nothing studio exec who just didn't get it) and not "cottonmouth joe." those of us who have seen the film know that the skeleton man is actually cottonmouth joe (a skeletal-manish apparition, not a true skeleton man). the deception of the folks marketing this film is unforgivable, and for that alone, i cannot give this film a high rating. imagine this: when future filmmakers get together to create the true definitive skeleton man movie and need a title, they will be totally screwed and we are all, as serious fans of the genre, diminished for that.<br /><br />cottonmouth joe could've become a horror movie icon right up there alongside madman marz, black claw, mansquito, humongous, "nature boy" billy conners, morty the wooden doll, the boogen, eegah, the moon beast, bloody bill, the driller killer, mickey rooney, and so forth, but he will always be remembered as a sword wielding-caped-tackle dummy skull face-tied to the side of a horse-skeleton man wannabe.<br /><br />that's too bad.
