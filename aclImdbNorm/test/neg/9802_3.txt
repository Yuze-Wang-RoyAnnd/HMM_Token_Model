since i was just finishing the book, `mrs. dalloway' by virginia woolf, i was excited to see that it was on one of the movie channels last weekend. what i encountered, however, is a film that was boring, incomprehensible and non-sensical. one cannot entirely blame the film, it tried the best it could with the material it had, but when the source material is virginia woolf, and is almost entirely written in stream-of-conscience style with extended periods of internalizing and little actual dialogue, one would certainly think that there shouldn't be a film made from it just because a film can be made from it. <br /><br />vanessa redgrave, who plays the title character, does not deserve any blame for the failure of this film, nor do any of the other actors. it is just simply a film that could not intelligibly be made from the story that woolfe wrote, and should not have even been attempted. don't watch the movie, read the book. <br /><br />--shelly
