i really hope the makers of these "movies" read these reviews so that they know that people just dont want their movies. they are just trash and an embarrassment to the killer clown genre of horror. whether or not this was better than the first doesn't matter cause theyre both just plain terrible. i'm surprised they didn't learn their lesson from the first movie. stop now!! warning to horror movie watchers, dont watch, rent or look at the boxes of "urban" horror films, and above all, don't buy them!!!!
