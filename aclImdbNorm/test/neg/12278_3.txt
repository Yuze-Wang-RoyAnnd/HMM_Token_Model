tony curtis and skip homier both are wearing black with white trim canvas shoes in the scenes just before and after the swimming pond and the tank being blown up. must have been too hard on the young stars feet.if the real marines had been on the mission they would have been wearing boots. in the first scenes they took off their leggin's just before starting out on their little trip to find the farmer. when they went to the area where they dug the fox holes tony and skip are wearing combat boots, then later when lovejoy and curtis run into the framer and his daughter tony is wearing the "tennis shoes " but hey have been blacken. the movie in about a true story but did they really need the love interest??
