anna christie (greta garbo) returns to see her father chris (george f marion) after 15 years. he is the skipper of a boat and she stays to travel with him. during this time, she meets matt (charles bickford) and they fall in love. matt and chris don't see eye to eye and anna has a secret to confess.....................<br /><br />what a boring story......it starts badly with george f marion and marie dressler playing drunks in a bar. the scene goes on forever and they are both terrible. its also hard to understand them. in fact, its difficult to understand the whole cast. i missed whole sections of dialogue between bickford, marion and garbo because it is incomprehensible! garbo is obviously something special as you are drawn to her every time that she is on screen and her presence gives this film the 4 stars that i have given to it. but nothing really happens - its a boring story with atrocious accents. you'll do well to stay awake.
