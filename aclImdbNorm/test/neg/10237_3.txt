"the racketeer" stars carol (deprived of the "e" that usually appeared at the end of her first name) lombard as a woman thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert violinist (roland drew) who has since become a down-and-out alcoholic, and torn between her love for him and the interest of new york crime kingpin robert armstrong (top-billed). it's virtually a compendium of what was wrong with the earliest talkies: stiff direction, immobile cameras, stagy acting and ridiculously slow-paced delivery of lines. at the time the sound crews were telling the directors to have their actors speak every line s-l-o-w-l-y and not to start speaking their own line until after the previous actor had finished theirs. done about five years later, this could have been an interesting movie, but director howard higgin faithfully follows his sound recorder's dictates and systematically undercuts the talents we know lombard and armstrong had from watching their later movies.
