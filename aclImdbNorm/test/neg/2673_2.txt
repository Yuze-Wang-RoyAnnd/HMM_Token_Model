this movie is very bad. in fact, the only reason why i've given it a 2 rather than a 1 is because it made me laugh. without giving anything away, a man's head actually explodes in this film. it was so pathetic, i laughed. i don't believe the scene was meant to be funny but it's nonsense. complete nonsense. the original halloween is such a good film, it's a shame they had to go and make such a stinker.
