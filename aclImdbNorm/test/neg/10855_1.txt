this is possibility the worst and most disappointing film i have ever seen. i've spent four years at two universities and know that there must be a good film to be made about the experience. this isn't it. the "acting" is god awful and the plot non-existent.<br /><br />here are a few incidents from my one year in halls of residence.<br /><br />1) a posh lad that unknowingly got off with a transvestite. 2) the best friend pairing of two girls - one with huge breasts and the other with the nickname "the brick". 3) a couple that shag too loudly. 4) the lad who gets all the girls 5) the lad from northern ireland who is very difficult to understand. 6) mcdonalds in bed 7) curry every night for a week 8) student bashing, couple of my mates ended up in hospital 9) the discarded joint that started a fire. 10) the flood 11) the lad who wakes up on his floor to find that every item of furniture has be taken from his room.<br /><br />and if i can come up with that list in 5 minutes and from real life, i'm sure a couple of script writers can do better, a lot better.<br /><br />and for a film named after a sleeper song, where is the britpop soundtrack?
