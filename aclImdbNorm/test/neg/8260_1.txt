okay,. so i went into this loving rupaul. i still love him/her but think a little less. this is one gross movie that shows a lot of male genitalia. this is a spoof of the 1970s black exploitation films and is purposefully done badly. the only fun part about it for me is that all of the voices have been looped with those of drag queens, even the voices of real women. this is over an the top, nonstop, laugh your rear end off it is so stupid, badly made movie. i would never watch this again but i do appreciate what the film makers were trying to do. there is no rating on this but it would be r or even nc-17. rupaul has done much better work.
