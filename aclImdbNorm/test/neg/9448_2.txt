i watch a ton of movies and enjoy the occasional b movie but this movie was awful. aside from the "homemade" quality of the film it was very slow and seemed to make no point. i'm only commenting b/c of another comment i saw here that said it was great! wow! maybe ok to watch on a rainy day when nothing else is available.<br /><br />the characters were disjointed and didn't fit any discernible pattern of reality. the dialog between characters was forced and at times very confusing.<br /><br />i guess if you were very into the whole area 51 and understood some of the nuances other comments reference, it may be good - but for me - the average joe - i don't get it!?
