my mom and i, rented this movie. i mean, we love those type of sci-fi flicks, whether they be big hollywood flicks or indy flicks.<br /><br />but oh, we were fooled!! two journalists are investigating a ufo abduction in a small city in texas. halfway through, all the sudden things get all christain on us. my mom and i believe in god and jesus and the devil, but the way this movie was preaching it, made it annoying. all i really have to say, is that we are christian, but even we like to have fun. so don't blame christians as a whole, just blame the christians who need to suck the fun out of this movie.<br /><br />in fact you can clearly understand the directors stance on ufo's, and that is that he believes it is all demonic. now, i could say some words, but i will not. all i will say is, that do not watch this movie, unless you feel like being preached. in fact many times it states that we must be perfect in order to enter heaven. well, last time i checked, the only perfect person died on a cross.
