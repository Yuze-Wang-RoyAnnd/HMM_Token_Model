sappy.<br /><br />i liked how they went to the "haaavaad baaa" to quote books at each other to impress the ugliest girl there.<br /><br />probably the janitor at my school is a genius too but is waiting to land that big construction job.<br /><br />just because you keep your nose to the grindstone is no reason to try to cut a steak with it. "do you like apples?"<br /><br />the guy nods or something.<br /><br />"well, how'd ya like dem apples!" wow, that is genius.<br /><br />duh, minnie driver would give her number to anybody. robin williams can't paint and keeps the good books on the top shelf. and there's a professor who always wears a priest scarf for no reason.
