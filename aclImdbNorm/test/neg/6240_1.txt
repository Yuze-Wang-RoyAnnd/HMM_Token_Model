how do two great actors foist off a piece of junk like this on film-goers. my only conclusion is that they and their director believe that any film in which they star just must be seen and applauded,<br /><br />now to the film - probably the worst "thriller" i have ever seen. the actors showed minimal emotion; the plot was reasonable for a 1/2 hour time slot (not 91 minutes). the fbi agent was almost a silly parody - his partner was apparently struck dumb and spoke not one word. to paraphrase robert redford, the villain was a meaningless piece of crap! the film was drawn out and meaningless - the only question was whether the hero would die or not. one truly bizarre part of the story - the waiting family seemed to go on for at least several days; the hero and antihero seemed to only take one day.<br /><br />all in all - waste of time
