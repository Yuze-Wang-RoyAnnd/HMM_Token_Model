stanley stupid (tom arnold) and his wife, joan, like to sleep in bed with their heads under the covers and their feet on the pillows. they have two equally challenged children, buster and petunia. one day, mr. stupid notices their garbage is gone again....there must be someone stealing it from the curb. he goes off in roller blades after the garbage truck. when he finally gets to the dump, he is startled to learn not only that "other folks garbage" has been stolen, too, but that there is a secret organization meeting at the landfill. he is determined to defeat the garbage nappers of the world, it seems. meanwhile, petunia and buster visit the police station and a chinese restaurant in search of their parents, for joan comes up missing, too. will they bumble their way through their problems? this is just a stupid, stupid movie, with the culprit being the terrible script. the books by allard and marshall are hysterical and only a couple of situations from the books ends up in this film. arnold is actually quite nice as mr. stupid and the other cast members try very, very hard to make the film work. the production values are very high, with the dog and cat belonging to the stupids adding a little oomph to the film. but, it is all for naught, as the plot is wandering and weak. perhaps, someday, someone will take another stab at translating the very funny allard books to the big screen. therefore, if you love to laugh, rent something else while you await a new production and, by all means, go get the books, too. but, stay away from being stupid yourself, as anyone who watches this movie to the end could hardly be called intelligent.
