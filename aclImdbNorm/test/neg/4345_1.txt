the producers of this film should be sued for the misrepresentation of copyrighted materials, namely the advanced dungeons & dragons players' handbook. fear and ignorance breed the sort of mindless propaganda that inspire garbage like this film. if any of you have any doubts about the innocence of dungeons & dragons, why don't you go to your local hobby store and see about sitting in with a gaming group, so you can see for yourself that d&d is nothing to be afraid of.
