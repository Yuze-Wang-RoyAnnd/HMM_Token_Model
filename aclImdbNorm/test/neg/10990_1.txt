i had a different experience with this movie - it never got charming, or delightful, or funny for me. one big clue that this was not your typical movie was that the label gave no indication of the ianguage(s) spoken in the film. another was the lack of choices re subtitles.<br /><br />i found the lack of dialogue annoying, especially when accompanied by exaggerated facial expressions as it almost always was. the wildly inconsistent development of the feeble plot was puzzling. were there characters, or only vague gestures? was there even a plot?<br /><br />on a separate matter, i'm getting prompted to correct the spelling of "dialogue", with the suggested substitute of "dialogue". maybe this movie in its entirety, including the imdb portion, is designed to puzzle, or amaze, but i'm getting more irked than amused.
