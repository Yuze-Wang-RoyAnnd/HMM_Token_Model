the only time i ever actually laugh while watching this show is when i'm making fun of it. jamie lynn spears only got the acting job because of her big sister, and i don't think anyone could argue with me on that. there is no expression in her face ever (even when she smiles) - just watch the show and you'll see what i mean. now let's talk about the show. zoey 101 is one of the most unrealistic shows i've ever seen! as a lot of people have already said, zoey brooks is absolutely perfect: everyone loves her, she's a straight a student, and all the boys think that she's "hot." pca is a boarding school full of rich kids that gives all their students flat-screen tvs and laptop computers, serving kids sushi from the sushi bar. in one of the newest episodes, zoey is completely clueless and thinks that chase is not in love with her, and acts as if she doesn't even want chase to love her. then, when she barges into chase's dorm room to prove her friends wrong, she finds chase kissing this girl named rebecca. zoey, of course, freaks out, probably because she likes the attention from chase. anyway, only watch this show if you have nothing else to do and the only thing on television is zoey 101. you can at least have fun laughing at how unrealistic it is!
