where on earth do i start with the mess that is darkhunters? firstly the script is one of the worst to ever find its way onto a cinema or tv screen and can only be described as a poorly judged stephen king rip-off. at one point the supposedly fearsome darkhunter jack claims that carol, the girl who is helping the man he is pursuing, is as annoying as "a gherkin in a burger". i would be laughing if i was making it up-but i'm not! just as ludicrous is how carol originally came to have the power to see how people die. a cat gave it to her when she was holding it during an auto accident she had as a kid. what????????<br /><br />secondly, for a horror movie, it has no sense of tension or threat whatsoever. this may not be helped by the fact that all the action happens during stark, broad daylight. not very atmospheric at all.<br /><br />thirdly the acting is truly awful, pinion proves again that he needs to be speaking in his native tongue to be even remotely believable. jeff fahey is obviously on auto-pilot but how can blame him as he runs through a woe-ful humphry bogart impersonation as barlow (marlowe-barlow? we get the joke it just isn't funny). credit should go to susan paterno, an actress i was not aware of, she does her best with the awful part she has and puts the other, more experienced actors to shame.<br /><br />at no point is it even explained how the human character can understand what van husen's character is saying to her. she obviously has some sort of degree in screwy alien languages.<br /><br />on the plus side one moment is well done, the car crash involving susan. the sfx are throughly believable and if it weren't for the hilarious storyline reason for this to occur it would have been applauded.<br /><br />all i can say about darkhunters is that british horror will never recover from its interminable slump if movies like this continue to be made and shown. avoid this movie like the plague, although the plague would be a lot more scary.<br /><br />darkhunters 0/5<br /><br />p.s. the insinuations in other reviews that the film remains too intelligent for some are honestly hilarious. it is a weak defence when some claim "you didn't like it because you didn't understand it". the letters after my name make a fool of you not me.
