i cannot believe i actually sat through the whole of this movie! it was absolutely awful, and totally cringe-worthy, and yet i sat through it thinking it had to get better. it didn't, and i have wasted 2 hours of my life. will smith is much better in action movies - i loved him in i, robot, enemy of the state and independence day - and i don't think he can really be expected to carry off an entire movie as the romantic lead in the way that cary grant could. then again, the script was unbearably awful, and the dialogue was so cheesy. <br /><br />i disliked everyone except for albert's character, and even that i found was done with a heavy hand. if you want to watch a modern feel-good romantic comedy, watch something like how to lose a guy in ten days, or when harry met sally. the 40 year old virgin left me with a smile on my face. i even preferred music and lyrics above this - and yes, i know it's cheesy, but at least it didn't take itself seriously, and was sweet. i also disliked the main female lead - and wasn't convinced of the chemistry between her and will smith's character. <br /><br />in all, i think there were two scenes that i liked (and definitely not the ending, which was nauseating and unconvincing!) - hitch calling sarah when she hadn't given him her number was quite sweet, and - no, sorry, that's the only thing i liked about the entire film. don't waste your time.
