mickey rourke hunts diane lane in elmore leonard's killshot it is not like mickey rourke ever really disappeared. he has had a steady string of appearances before he burst back on the scene. he was memorable in: domino, sin city, man on fire, once upon a time in mexico, and get carter. but in his powerful dramatic performance in the wrestler (2008), we see a full blown presentation of the character only hinted at in get carter. whenever we get to know him, rourke remains a cool, but sleazy, muscle bound slim ball.<br /><br />this is an elmore leonard story, and production. leonard wrote such notable movies as taunt western thriller 3:10 to yuma, be cool, jackie brown, get shorty, 52 pick-up, and joe kidd. this means that we get tough guys, some good, some not so good.<br /><br />it also means we get tight, realistic plots with characters doing what is best for them in each situation, weaving complications into violent conclusions. killshot is no different. tough, slim ball killer rourke stalks unhappily married witness lane. think history of violence meets no country for old men. it is not as intense, bloody or gory as those two, but it is almost as good. if you like those two, including david croneberg's equally wonderful eastern promises, you will like killshot also.<br /><br />director john madden has not done a lot of movies. his last few were enjoyable, if not successful: proof, captain corelli's mandolin and shakespeare in love.<br /><br />diana lane hasn't had a powerful movie role since she and richard gere gave incredible performances in unfaithful. lately she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as nights in rodanthe, must love dogs, and under the tuscan sun. here she is right on mark, balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension.<br /><br />this is a small part for rosario dawson. yet dawson does a good job with it. you see a lot more of lane, including an underwear scene to rival sigourney weaver in aliens and nicole kidman in eyes wide shut.<br /><br />while you are in the crime drama section, also pick up kiss, kiss, bang, bang, and gone baby gone, and before the devil knows your dead. the last has wonderful performances by phillip seymour hoffman, ethan hawke, marisa tomei and albert finney.<br /><br />killshot flopped at the box office. more is our luck. it is certainly worth a 3-4 dollar rental, if you like this genre. 6/20/2009
