oh my god... where to begin? "chupacabra terror" is one of the worst b-horror movies ever made. this crap makes "demon slayer" look like "the exorcist". special note: a horror b-movie needs to have at least one sex scene. don't expect even a hot girl in this one. with that inexcusable mistake, i should begin with the complete bash.<br /><br />first of all, if you're going to make a horror monster movie, you should spend big part of the budget in creating a "cool" monster outfit. the monster in this movie looks like a $10 halloween costume. there is no way the chupacabras (yes, this is how it is spelled) looks menacing in the movie. it's an actor in a halloween outfit please!! it looks so cheap it makes me mad. <br /><br />second, the gore effects are the spinal cord of any direct to video monster horror movie. again, the producers decided not to spend for decent gore effects. the blood looks damn fake! please take a close look at the guy that gets chopped in two. that's probably the best scene in the movie and it lasts for about ten seconds. the ending is a very poor scene that won't leave you satisfied. <br /><br />the acting is the last thing you should expect to have quality in these kind of movies; but in this movie it's beyond terrible. a cast of nobodies with no acting experience make the fool out of themselves for about 85 minutes. special mention deserves a blonde guy with curly hair that tries to convince swat members that he is sick. the coughing he fakes is beyond laughable. he's probably the worst actor ever in a b-horror movie, no kidding. also, captain pe~na delivers a terrible performance in the first ten minutes of the flick. <br /><br />the true story behind the chupacabras is not even told. all you get to know is that the monster sucks goat's blood. why bother with this piece of crap? plesae, do not even watch it even if you have the chance. not even if it airs on cable. <br /><br />i usually support low budget horror movies because the people involved in them at least try to do something "different" than hollywood but that doesn't means that horror fans like me should accept this kind of garbage.
