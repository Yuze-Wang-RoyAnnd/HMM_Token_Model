when i first watched this show on cartoon network, i found it uninteresting. then i read a lot of good messages about this show, and i decided to watch it. the show was so boring. each episode was predictable. more, this show has no logic. hypersmart girls, who are going to school and sometimes do such stupid things, 99% of episodes start with a monster attacking townswille, then mayor (he is a real fool, he is not funny, he is so stupid, that i can't imagine how he became a mayor). professor, yes, supposed to be the smartest person in this show, but actually... he even found no difference between monster and his brother. narrator's comments also make this show boring. because they also have similar lines in the beginning of each episode and in the ending. also the animation is very strange. everything except main heroes is shown in an ugly way. also in every epsode this show is giving you some life-lessons, and it means that it is oriented on little children, but if you look closer, you will see, that there is a lot of violence and even blood(!!!) during their battles.
