some good set design. good songs, though like the other guy said they aren't performed with much energy. bea arthur, trying her damndest to do something with the material, had an occasional good one-liner as mame's friend vera and helped move the song "bosom buddies" along. other than that, there's nothing here that's worth your time. slow pacing, incredibly bad cinemetography, not very good singing (except from robert preston), an awful script, bad acting (except from bea), and a horrible lead actress. who thought lucille ball would be good as the classy, life-loving mame? the heads over at warner bros. were no doubt on crack when they decided to not use angela lansbury, who had done it so well on broadway, and instead use ball, who wasn't nearly as funny by then as she was 20 years earlier, couldn't act the part "the right way" at all, and used a painful croak as an excuse for singing. even if (perhaps because) making the movie was painful for her to make and even if she financed it, she just isn't mame. auntie mame is such a better film and the soundtrack of the broadway musical with lansbury sounds great. for the most part, there's nothing here that's great, engaging, or interesting at all. forget it, unless you're a huge lucy fan who thinks she could do no wrong. hopefully after seeing this you'll realize she was only human.
