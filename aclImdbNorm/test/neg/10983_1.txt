this woman is a terrible comedian. she can't crack a joke. she has no real character. this is another example of typical american rubbish, that people laugh at, because they have no idea how to react, so they say to themselves, "well, it's a comedy show," so i'll laugh, i guess.<br /><br />i cannot stand this miserable woman, and her pi$$ poor excuse for comedy. she does not deserve anything but booing.<br /><br />why can't america dump this kind of turdish delight, and go for something that actually contains humour.<br /><br />she is not funny. not at all. why oh why does even one person like this idiot?
