to be fair, i didn't see a lot of this show. probably because it wasn't as good as the original m*a*s*h, but i seem to recall them moving it around on the weekly schedule. some shows just aren't worth the trouble of following around every week. but i really did try at first, so it wasn't all bad. maybe i just kept expecting it to improve, but i can't give this show a 1. in all honesty, i can't give it any more than a 2 either.<br /><br />it wasn't mash (i'm not going to type those stupid *'s every time). and it was trying to be mash without putting forth any effort, like it would just magically happen. well guess what? no magic. the best i can do here is to compare it to other shows.<br /><br />trapper john, m.d. was a much better show by far. however, they should have called it b.j. hunnicut, m.d. because pernell roberts looked exactly like an older bj, but nothing at all like trapper john. keep everything else the same, just change his name and the name of the show. presto! after mash wasn't the only sequel to completely bomb and dishonor the original. archie bunker's place was a lame follow-up to all in the family. it had no heart, no conflict, no depth
