the only reason i watched this is because of its stars, caspar van dien, micheal pare & eric roberts & catherine oxenburg * & jeniffer rubin, all capable actors & have given good performances in the past,. not this time,, a weak serial killer story, you can guess who the killer is in the first scene. very contrived in all aspects there is nothing to recommend in this disaster, my rating is *1/2 poor
