(small spoilers) i just bought the dvd of this movie yesterday. i saw it with my friends and i couldn't believe what had happened.<br /><br />in the first 3 movies, the critters at least had a sense of humor (especially the 3rd movie), but not only did the critters barely ever make an appearance, they weren't funny! they never made me laugh. i must admit that the story did start off nicely. after an hour had gone by i remembered that the critters movies were always very short. so i thought to myself, "where the $^%#$ are the critters?!?!" they were barely in this movie! if that didn't make me mad enough, the boy named ethan was sitting on his bed after charlie had "murdered the ship" and he knew that the critters were still on board! in the first movie the brown family was scared out of their minds. but here, ethan didn't even care! it was as if the critters weren't even a threat!<br /><br />now what i'm about to say next may ruin the ending, but i'm going to say it anyways. in the first movie, at the end, they had to face the giant critter for a final battle. in the second one, there was the great ball of critter. in the third movie, the critter with his fave burned did a spindash (from sonic the hedgehog) and was going to attack the little kid. but at the end of the fourth one (which is what made me the angriest) the bald critter charges toward ethan, and ethan kills it as if it were nothing.<br /><br />now something that i really don't understand was what happened to ug. he was one of my favorite characters in the first two. then after 50 years, he's evil. that was very disappointing. not only that, but wasn't he a faceless bounty hunter? why was he still "johnny steele?" plus he seemed to have a different personality. he seemed much smarter and not as monotone like in the first two.<br /><br />being someone who actually enjoyed the first two critters movies, and loved the third one, i give critters 4 a 2/10
