every time i by pass this show on tv, i absolutely and truthfully want to claw my eyes out, and rip my ears off.it's so unbelievably horrible.the jokes aren't funny, the acting is completely terrible, and the whole entire show is one major disappointment.i hate charlotte arnold's guts, and i just want to punch her in the face or stab her with a knife every time i hear her talk. she is a no talent, low iq, big waste on society, and i think she would be doing the world a favor if she just shuts the f*ck up and went away for a long time. please, i say this with all my heart, do not even watch one episode of this show!!!!!!it's not even worth 30 minutes of your life, and there are thousands of better things to do, including killing yourself, than watch this show for half an hour.
