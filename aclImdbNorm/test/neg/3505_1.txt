i can not believe the positive reaction to this movie. i had great expectations for it and was disappointed. first of all, they used every cheesy racism clich'e in the book. it was so predictable. for instance, from the second the young latino guy showed up you just knew that he would be a really nice guy because he looked like a gangbanger. matt dillon's character has been played a million times, a cop who had been hardened over the years and would see the light to some degree by the end of the movie. the predictability hardly ended with those characters. a phenomenal cast was wasted on a weak script. the morals of the story were pc to the max. there were a few clever twists but not nearly enough. the dialouge was embarrassing at times. it wasn't all bad.i just can't believe this movies high score so far. it was somewhat entertaining, just a little insulting to ones intelligence. i admire what this movie was trying to achieve but it fell well short.
