i watched this movie a couple months ago when it first showed up on the shelves of blockbuster. it is officially the only movie that i've wanted to undo watching. let me start off by saying that i like "b" movies. i consider "ice pirates" one of the best comedies ever. i'll also note that i'm a writer and that i've met the director/writer of this cinematic marvel.<br /><br />evaluating the acting: if i was going to pick a bright spot i'd have to point out that dion day had an admirable acting debut with his role in this. for those who don't know, dion is a boxer not an actor so we'll forgive him his lame death sequence. why doesn't he fire the shotgun he's holding once? budget? to highlight the bad acting would take pages so i'll stick to the egotistical lead, ryn baskin. ryn (which seems like a name chosen from a comic book because it sounded cool) has maximum face time in this movie, probably because he was a producer. his looks are completely fine, but his delivery evokes memories of snl ripping on soap-operas. i suppose he could only do so much with what was written for him, but part of the blame is definitely his.<br /><br />special effects: not my specialty, but for a low-budget flick i suppose the makeup and gun play was acceptable. it didn't bother me, but it also didn't impress.<br /><br />writing/directing: oscar for best screenplay is not something i can foresee gerald nott ever winning. not only is the plot rudimentary, but the dialog is flat and stilted. i understand stylized hokee-ness, but this was just bad writing. the thing that bothered me most was the theft. nott stole scenes, shots, and viggo's facial hair from a slew of other movies. the scene where russel crow is walking through the wheat field in gladiator, entire sequences from the good, the bad and the ugly, that sort of thing just doesn't cut it with me. i'll choose not to comment on the shooting because i don't know what it takes to establish a good shot etc...<br /><br />conclusion: don't rent this movie, don't even pirate it. it's far too bad to waste any time on. the good reviews may be entirely bogus, after meeting gerry it seems more then likely that he is posting them himself.
