obabakoak is a bunch of short stories with an only common point: the little vasque town of obaba. in this film, the director tries to explain some of these stories by using a young reporter as a continuum. the result is a strange film, as it has any main character (the movie spends about 20 min. to each tale) other than the town of obaba. any story is really well explained and the fact is that they result very boring. it was by far the best film of the year in spain, but, well, that's not saying too much. the only good thing of the film is the precious scenarios. it is filmed in a very precious valley and it is more enjoyable to spend the time watching the scenario rather than being aware of the story.
