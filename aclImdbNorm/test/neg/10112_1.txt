hey guys and girls! don't ever rent, or may god forbid, buy this piece of garbage. i have rarely seen a film in any genre as bad as this one. the acting is actually worse than me and my friends did when we were 7 and in the 1.grade had to act in front of all parents and siblings. in fact, we would have been taken up to evaluation for the oscars, if we were to be compared to the actors in darkhunters. the story is terrible, the makeup is terrible, the filming is terrible, the set is terrible, the directing is terrible, etc. i can't actually find anything worth the money spent to see this film.. maybe except all the cats, which my girlfriend thought were kind of cute. please, use your money on other things than on this film.... i couldn't even see the last 15-20 minutes of the film, it was that terrible.. if anyone really liked this film, i would really like to hear from you, and i will try to see if i can get you some counseling at a psychiatrist's office near you..<br /><br />0 out of 10, actually below if possible.. not worth the dvd or tape it is on..
