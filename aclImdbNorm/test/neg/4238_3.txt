maybe in its day this movie was special. but five decades later it seems quaint, just another cinematic relic of the dreadful 1950s. stereotypes abound in this fluffy story about three female gold diggers who set up shop in a manhattan penthouse, in an effort to attract wealthy husbands.<br /><br />i don't mind the shallow theme. but the film's premise is lame. and the execution is worse. it's a romantic comedy, but i found little to laugh at. the plot point about an extremely nearsighted bimbo is about the only clever element of the story. overall dialogue is flat, and so too is the delivery. and the script structure is disconcerting. the plot keeps jumping back and forth among the three ladies. it's as if the writer couldn't quite blend the ensemble roles. the result is a plot that seems choppy.<br /><br />marilyn monroe was a good choice for her role. but lauren bacall was too old for the role she played. and betty grable, with her squeaky voice and awful hairdo, was just plain annoying.<br /><br />color cinematography is conventional. but there were lots of shots using rear screen projection, contributing to a dated look. the visuals are made even worse by costumes that reek of cheesy 1950's "glamour"; they are just awful. viewers must endure a fashion show, a plot point that amplifies how the film's director was smitten by those trashy glad rags.<br /><br />and then there is that orchestra. in what is arguably the worst film opening in cinema history, the first part of the film has an orchestra playing some dreary-sounding tune. at first, i thought i was watching the introduction to coming attractions. but no, it's actually part of the film. and the orchestra plays on, and on, and on. it has nothing, absolutely nothing, whatever to do with the story. what were they thinking?<br /><br />i enjoyed marilyn monroe, with her breathy voice, as she bimbos her way through the plot. but the film would have been far better if they had dumped the other two ensemble roles, dumped that orchestra, enhanced the comedy dialogue, and downplayed those gaudy, cheesy costumes.
