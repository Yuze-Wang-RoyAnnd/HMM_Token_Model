title: dracula a.d. 1972 <br /><br />director: alan gibson <br /><br />cast: peter cushing, christopher lee, stephanie beacham <br /><br />review: sometimes movies can be time capsules that transport you back to any given time. in this case...our time capsule is hammers dracula a.d. 1972 which transports us back to a time in which austin powers would have felt right at home.<br /><br />the story is about these group of kids (were not a gang! were a group!) that love to hang out at a caf'e shop called "the cavern". one day, johnny alucard (hmm strange last name...wait...it spells dracula backwards!) a new member of the group offers the group a new way to get their kicks. he offers them a night of black mass and black magic. to which they also say "sure why the hell not, it could be fun!". so in no time flat, the find themselves resurrecting count dracula from the ashes.<br /><br />this movie opens up with a swinging party at some rich doofuses home. he knows non of the people at his party, yet there they all are partying the night away in his house. doing drugs, making out and dancing on top of tables. the filmmakers made sure that this sequence was completely engulfed in whatever young people considered cool at that time. everyone says words like "way out" and "groovy" and they finish many of their sentences saying "all that jazz". so yeah, its pretty evident that this is the 70s. to top it all off, there's a band that sounds something like "jefferson airplane"...i mean you'll be drowned in all things 70s. and as i watched this i kept asking myself "how the heck is dracula with his black cape and get up going to fit into all this?" and thats exactly what happens. old dracula feels out of place amidst all the partying and the rock and roll and drugs. many of the scenes in the film are great....but sadly the music they decided to add to the proceedings doesn't fit at all and completely takes you out of the mood of things. something horrifying or scary will be happening on screen and suddenly a bunch of loud trumpets and congos start to beat and your just completely taken out of the horror element. that sucked out the atmosphere right out of this movie for me.<br /><br />but all in all, putting all the distracting 70s music aside (an illness that satanic rites of dracula also suffered) the movie was pretty good. but i will mention this. the story was just a re-hash of what we had seen before in taste the blood of dracula. in fact the story is damn near identical. lets see...a young lad inherits draculas ring and ashes...check. he then decides to bring dracula back to life with the help of some people who know nothing about what they are getting into...check. black mass to bring dracula back in a desecrated church...check. the list of similarities goes on and on. so this movie ain't very original if you ask me.<br /><br />there are a few things that make this movie worth while though. for example the fact that the movie is a time capsule to london in the early seventies makes the film entertaining. i kept giggling and laughing every time someone spoke in 70 jargon. i couldn't believe some of the clothes these people wore and the cars they drove! it made the movie fun for me, but we are here to get spooked, were here to see drac kill a few virgins and take his revenge on the house of van helsing. did we get any of that? well yeah. there's a few good sequences squeezed in there to satisfy old school hammer fans. first off, there's the black mass sequence which was above all things satanic! they mention the name of many a demon and lots blood is spilled. that sequence was awesome but it was messed up by the music in its most crucial moment. then there's draculas actual resurrection which ill admit was great from a visual standpoint. some mist comes out of draculas grave and slowly but surely christopher lees silhouette and face emerge from the fog. cool shot! i loved it! we have a cushing and lee face off at the end. and i couldn't help to laugh at one point when dracula hurls a piece of furniture through the air. i laugh because he has done this in every single film since horror of dracula. its this hammer tradition where the characters start throwing candle sticks and chairs at each other. and i think to myself, aren't their more exciting things to show then a bad guy throwing a candle stick at our hero. oh well, anyhows, draculas demise in this one is very similar to all the other hammer draculas before it, vampire gets slaked and then we cut to a series of frames until there's only ashes left.<br /><br />all in all, an unintentionally funny hammer dracula film. its trapped in the 70s and though that makes it a fun watch (and its not as horrible as satanic rites of dracula) it still doesn't gel well with the dracula universe we had come to expect from hammer.<br /><br />rating 3 1/2 out of 5
