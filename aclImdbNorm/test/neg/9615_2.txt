oh dear - quite how alfred hitchcock (north by northwest, spellbound, the 39 steps) could turn out this nasty, cheapjack shocker is beyond me. don't bother looking for hidden depths or deep meanings - there aren't any. this is just horrid, seedy and cheap. the one redeeming feature is the home-life of the inspector who leads the investigation - his wife fancies herself as a gourmet cook and constantly serves up her revolting culinary experiments to her poor husband. this is amusing, and just about saved me putting the film in the 'awful' bracket, but the film as a whole is one of the most unpleasant i've ever seen. i believe this was hitchcock's next-to-last film - perhaps someone was trying to tell him something.
