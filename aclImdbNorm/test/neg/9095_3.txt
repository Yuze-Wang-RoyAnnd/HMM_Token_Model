this is a candidate for worst films i've ever seen. it wanted to be as shocking as "silence of the lambs," but has neither the style nor the wit of the aforementioned. the make-up is excellent, the acting is pretty good, but the story seems to drag on for years and the murders are so gruesome that they're more disturbing than entertaining.
