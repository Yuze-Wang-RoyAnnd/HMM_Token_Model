this movie reeks. no money, no acting, no nothing. i caught this on on the 3am late show movie tonight and felt compelled to comment on it. this movie has nothing to recommend it. i can't believe it ever got released to us television! nobody in this movie can act their way out of a paperbag. the lame attempts at comedy fall flat on their face, the special effects consist of a worm-like handpuppet "monster"... i can't even begin to tell you how rock-bottom this production is. it looks like it cost maybe $50,000 to shoot, but only because it is on 16mm, and that is probably a generous estimate! anyway, i lost interest rapidly and had to settle for watching "matlock" reruns instead of finishing it. that's how bad this movie is!!!
