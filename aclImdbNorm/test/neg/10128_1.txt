if you wondered whether disney could broadcast a show with a character more spoiled than paris, more shallow than britney, more vapid than jessica and more narcissistic than the girls next door, wonder no more. the amazing thing is selena gomez is, apparently, supposed to be the heroine. she's also supposed to be an outcast from the spoiled, shallow, vapid, narcissistic "popular" girls at school, which is no more believable here than it was for hilary duff in lizzie mcguire. plots range from recycled bewitched & i dream of jeannie to "parodies" of harry potter. the older boy alternates between being a magical genius and being unable to master the complexities of his own shoelaces. the younger boy is just another of the smart-mouth "wisecracking" brats who have multiplied on tv like cockroaches in new york (and with the same appeal). the dad is the stereotypical dumb tv dad, and the mom... well, she's not totally awful. but all pales beside the hideous, loathsome, and yet horribly fascinating (like a bad car accident) spectacle of ms. lopez' smug, self-satisfied, snotty performance . and, again, she's the heroine.
