gold raiders (1951)<br /><br />a dull western/comedy feature with the three stooges (including shemp howard at this point, who i've always enjoyed as the "third stooge") doing their usual schtick, and directed by the normally dependable edward bernds, who also did some of their funniest classic shorts -- so one has to wonder, just what went wrong this time? the most probable answer is that what worked pretty good as a 15-minute two-reeler comes up as too much for a 55-minute feature film. unlike so many of their classic short subjects, gold raiders is not worth revisiting.<br /><br />*1/2 of ****
