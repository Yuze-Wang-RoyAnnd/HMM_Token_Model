this is hands down the most annoying and frustrating game i have ever encountered. every time you turn around the game takes control of your character or creates invisible walls that you can't walk through. the cut scenes leave you in control of your character's movements, but only to a slight degree. also, you have to play the game for about 2 hours just to get past the intro/tutorials. it's terrible! i am afraid if i play this game any more i will end up breaking something. this game sucks. the graphics are good, but nothing special, the game play, however, is awful. to say i hate this game would be a huge understatement. i got it on sale, but i want my $20 back. what a waste!
