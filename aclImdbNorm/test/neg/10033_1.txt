thank god i didn't buy this movie myself! i borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of sheer curiosity and of course after viewing it feel they should be reimbursed! this has got to be one of the worse movies i've ever seen! i do realize they couldn't have had much of a budget but i swear i could make a better movie than this staring my pets! the acting was horrible, so was the editing, the dialogue, everything! it was so bad that it was seriously making me angry as i watched it! i'm looking forward to the real movie about this story coming out soon so that people curious about it don't have to stoop to watch this joke!
