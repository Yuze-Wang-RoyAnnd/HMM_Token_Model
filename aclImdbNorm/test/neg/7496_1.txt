i was ready for a crouching tiger style movie and all i got was the worst movie i've seen in years. it was almost as bad as baron von munchhuasen. dead script. dead acting. dead everything. <br /><br />granted there was some good fight scenes but the positive side ends there. if this movie arrives in your house run screming to a phone and dial 911 and say, "please help there is a movie in my house meant to force people to commit suicide"
