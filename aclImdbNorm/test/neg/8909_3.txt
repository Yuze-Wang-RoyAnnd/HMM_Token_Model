the film quickly gets to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction. the first really bad thing is the guy hijacking steven seagal would have been beaten to pulp by seagal's driving, but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movie.<br /><br />it seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot, so just plan to enjoy the action, and do not expect a coherent plot. turn any sense of logic you may have, it will reduce your chance of getting a headache.<br /><br />i does give me some hope that steven seagal is trying to move back towards the type of characters he portrayed in his more popular movies.
