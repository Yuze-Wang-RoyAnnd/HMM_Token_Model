there are plenty of reviews that describe this movie as the worst ever made. for sure there are plenty of mistakes: lackluster acting, rather boring and cliched and at times paradoxical script, and the stock b-movie sound and "special" effects. as noted, there are plenty of glosses of plot, making _cave dwellers_ a tissue of fantasy film, especially in comparison with the lord of the rings trilogy. however, this movie is not the worst movie ever. most, if not all, (including this review) of these reviews are written by fans of mstk3. therefore, many of these reviews are pretty much summaries of the mstk3 episode of _cave dwellers_.<br /><br />in the episode, joel, tom servo, and crow remark to the mad scientists that this is the worst movie ever sent to them. of course, loyal fans have taken this quote and ran with it. i have found this movie endearing-not in a way that one finds _forrest gump_ endearing-but in the effort put into this movie by some the cast. also, this movie is laughable without its mstk3 treatment. that is because _cave dwellers_ does not take itself seriously, and it is not trying to import into its viewers some sort of righteous theme. for all of the monster puppets, medieval hang gliding, and continuity lapses-this movie does not advertise to be any more that what it is, a shallow depiction of a rather shallow genre.<br /><br />likewise, i can't bring myself to hate miles o'keeffe or lisa foster. instead this hatred is for coleman francis, tony cardoza, jennifer lopez, arch hall, jr., and so on.<br /><br />
