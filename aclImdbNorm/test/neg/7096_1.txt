when i saw this movie i think i was a freshman in high school and i still feel like charging master p for the hour & 20 mins or so that he took from my life that i'll never get back.<br /><br />the guy who already posted is completely right. master p is a wannabe mobster. he, like all the other rappers in this country made his millions off of selling rap cds to young impressionable white kids in this country. it's widely known that the mob was not a black thing and blacks were not allowed to be part of it. unfair as that might be rappers can't deal with. this movie paints master p as a mobster named nino? the script is terrible with the acting to match. completely unbelievable. while searching i came up with a link or something that said he was planning on making another movie called "the black sopranos"!!!!<br /><br />please spare us that and stick to nickalodeon. you are not a white mobster, your not even a good actor master p, please stick to your music for the sake of whoever listens to it these days...
