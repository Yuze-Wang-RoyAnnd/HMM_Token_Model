i have not seen and heard the original version.<br /><br />i am no russian, but i am learning right now.<br /><br />i also have no preferences for russia, bulgaia, the us etc.<br /><br />but what i have to mention is:<br /><br />in the german synchronisation in the whole film all russians speak with russian accent. americans talk "hochdeutsch" (without accent)! i have never heard such a stupidity! besides, this is boring.<br /><br />i hope the original is better.<br /><br />the rest is a simple thriller, not really good ideas. like a cheap version of a james bond film.
