finally got to see this movie last weekend. what a disappointment..it barely reaches "made for tv" level. given the list of actors, i would have expected something substantially more sophisticated. the movie lacks a good story, well, actually any story for that matter. it has no credibility, instead lots of predictability. save yourself the money and the time.
