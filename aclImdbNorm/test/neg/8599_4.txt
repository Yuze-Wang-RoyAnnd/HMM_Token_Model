now i like johnny vegas which is a good start, i also enjoy toilet humour<br /><br />such as young ones and bottom etc. this however failed to bring even a<br /><br />small smile to my face. the story follows johnny around after his wife<br /><br />chucks him out (how he got his good looking wife and kid i dont know) <br /><br />as he attempts to shag anything that moves. failing normally. i was looking forward to this but found it to be totally boring and a waste<br /><br />of my time altogether. unless you are stuck for something to do for 90 mins apart from wash the car then dont bother..... <br /><br />
