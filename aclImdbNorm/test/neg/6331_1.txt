la ragazza del vagone letto, or terror express! as it was called on the version i saw, starts as various passengers board a long distance train. three thuggish idiots, dave, phil & ernie (carlo de mejo) board & it's clear that they're there to cause trouble as they intimidate & verbally abuse the other passengers & staff. as the train speeds along things turn nasty when a prostitute named juliette (silvia dionisio) refuses to have sex with dave, he & his mates decide to hold the entire train hostage so they can have an orgy with juliette &, well not much else actually happens apart from some hero cop & his prisoner who set about saving the day. erm, that's it really...<br /><br />this italian production was directed by ferdinando baldi & is complete total & utter crap from start to finish. the script by george eastman as luigi montefiori could just as easily be described as a really boring porno as much as a horror/thriller. it is tediously slow, it's 35 minutes before anything even remotely sleazy happens & as a whole the film lacks the sort of exploitation elements that italian sleaze & horror was delivering at that time. the film can be compared to another italian production the infinitely better the house on the edge of the park (1980) made the same year, it's a very broad comparison though as everything that made the house on the edge of the park the notorious film that it is is absent from la ragazza del vagone letto, there's no blood, no gore, almost no violence, there's only a couple of really tame rapes, the story has no twists or turns & as it's incredibly boring to watch. italian sleaze & horror from the late 70's & early 80's isn't known for it's strong story lines or great scripts but this films really does scrape the bottom-of-the-barrel on all counts. the character's are awful, the film spends the first 30 plus minutes building them up & giving some background as to why they're on the train but this is all quickly forgotten & comes to absolutely nothing. i hated the lame ending as well & i don't know if i missed something but was any sort of reasonable explanation given as to why these three lamebrains would hijack a train? i don't think there was, was there? i'm sorry but because your angry at a prostitute is not enough of a reason, surely the filmmakers could have come up with something a bit more substantial & interesting if not more plausible. in my opinion this film stinks, it's as simple & straight forward as that i'm afraid.<br /><br />director baldi does an ok job, to be fair he only has one corridor & a few train compartments to work with so i'll cut him some slack, having said that the film does become very repetitive. there is no style & he films the sex scenes like a bad soft core porno complete with awful romantic sounding piano music. there is not one single drop of blood spilt in the entire film, that's right not one single drop. forget about any gore or violence as you'll be very disappointed if you do, like i did. there are a couple of rapes but they're amateurishly staged & have zero impact, the nasty exploitation & sleaze of say i spit on your grave (1978) or the last house on the left (1972) is not here.<br /><br />technically la ragazza del vagone letto is ok & it's quite well made on what must have been a low budget but the setting obviously helped keep the cost down to a minimum. the acting is poor as usual, although since it was dubbed the original performances have been lost. fans of italian horror will recognise a lot of the voices here.<br /><br />la ragazza del vagone letto is a terrible film, it's just my opinion but i was bored to tears waiting for something to happen & when it eventually never i felt cheated, i want those 80 minutes of my life back. this piece of crap isn't even fit to grace the 99p vhs bargain bin in your local blockbuster, one to avoid.
