i wanted to see this movie because i liked "kavkazskij plennik" ("prisoner of the mountains") and "brat" ("brother") with sergey bodrov, jr. and "vor" ("the thief") with vladimir mashkov. well, unlike the other movies, "the quickie" was a total waste of time. the story that makes little sense, very uneven acting (lesley ann warren was especially bad), really awful dialogs, poor cinematography, what else could go wrong? i find it amusing that in practically every american-made movie, when the same-language-speaking foreigners (russians in this case) are left alone, they prefer to communicate with each other mostly in broken english (and when they happen to speak russian, for some reason translators feel obligated to add a lot of "f**ks" in the sentences, which have no profanity, literal or non-literal). at the same time, native-english-speaking actors choose to speak in broken russian. why is that? getting back to the story, most of the subplots of the movie (e.g. betting the house, inviting latin american paramilitaries, etc) either make no sense or do nothing more than confusing the viewers. it is too bad that bodrov, mashkov, and leigh (all good actors in my humble opinion) got themselves involved in this disaster.
