i've never written a comment on imdb before, but this movie was so bad it left me little choice but to warn you not to waste the two hours of your life. as an avid wwii historian, i don't even know where to begin on how historically inaccurate this movie was. carbines with korean war bayonet lugs, k98k's missing cleaning rodes and sight hoods, german uniforms that didn't exist, the list could go on forever. added that it's loaded with flaws, has literally no plot or climax, and acting on par with your local high school theater. the epitome of cheesy. <br /><br />please...there are too many good wwii movies out there to waste your time on this junk.
