i was one of the many fools who were sapped out into paying for this at the theater, even though i payed 4 bucks for matin'ee (before 6pm) prices.<br /><br />the remake's story was ho-hum, the cgi morlocks were lame, the eloi were rastafarian to mimic today's fads (no i did not think the chick was hot at all), the re-killing of the hero's modern girlfriend was somewhat cruel, overall just a sad, bad remake. <br /><br />i'll take rod taylor, weena, and the fat glowing eyed surfer morlocks over this junk any time. my estimation is that many of the reviewers who like this awful remake are young kids, which does not account for either good taste or a true value of the old classics which are largely unappreciated by today's confused and ever-wanting-more youth. <br /><br />when the 60s version came out (i first saw it in the 70s for summer fun) it was pretty damn impressive and still holds up. you don't have to have an over abundance of cgi in a movie for it to be better. too much of this looks fake. i can't say enough of how disappointingly bad the morlocks looked and they ran and jumped around like they were in a child's video game. 3 stars out of 10.
