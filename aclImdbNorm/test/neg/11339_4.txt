stumbled over this film on amazon.com. had never heard of its release but the three reviews gave it five stars and rave reviews so being a lover of german movies i bought a copy...<br /><br />have to say that i was not impressed. the production values are cheap, the story is derivative, the characters are less than engaging and for a comedy it is surprisingly short on laughs.<br /><br />i wanted to like this but i just found it lackluster and dull. or maybe i expected more of independent german cinema than a gay spin on the full monty and a cast of stereotypes.<br /><br />there are bits in the film that make no sense at all, like one of the leather bear's trying to get ecki in a sling --like he'd even look at him twice? or the vengeful ex-wife turning up at the match but ending up cheering for her estranged gay husband? bunkum is not the word! well, at least it explains the movies uk title, i suppose...
