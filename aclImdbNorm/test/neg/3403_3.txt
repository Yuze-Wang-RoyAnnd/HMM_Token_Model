the first film i saw from these people was "children of the grave" and when i heard that this one was coming on i thought it would be good to watch mostly because waverly is a real place that is rumored to be haunted. this documentary/film was awful! there was too much fake commentary from the producers, directors, camera men...they needed to keep their faces out of this film. waverly has been rumored to be haunted for a long time yet if anyone in doubt about it watches this film they will no doubt start to believe that every story about the place is as fake as this documentary. the paranormal proof was horrible and almost non-existent. i have heard better evps from high school students with tape recorders in a bathroom! they tried too hard to make things scary and the end result was that nothing was scary. not the stories, not the blurry too dark to see anything videos, not the pictures, not the tape recordings! children of the grave was bad as well but at least it had some substance and a little bit of a creep factor. the only reason i am giving this a 3 is because the history portion of the show was very good and informative. learning about how the hospital came about, the daily life there,and how it ended was the only thing worth while in this 2hr piece of crap.
