in all the episodes, i never saw any real action or drama or comedy.<br /><br />the plot is so repetitive.<br /><br />****somebody gets something old and then somebody else tells them a little bit about it and how much it's worth and who made it and where it comes from and how much it could sell for and if there was any work done to it.<br /><br />sowhile i watched about 30 of these, i realized...there is no drama....nobody ever loses a limb or life or gets divorced or hit by a car or air-plane.<br /><br />there are no car chases or explosions- not even a horse race with old carriages.<br /><br />all those guns and swords and nobody goes on a violent killing spree...what gives? no pshycos, no axe-murders, no-gun-totting old englishmen in bad suits...just yap yap yap...you have an old tea set and it came from the country of germany back in 1602 - blah blah blah...<br /><br />i'm still waiting for somebody with a time machine to go on screen and ask about it, but no...it never comes to be and the only thing that happens is that some stuffy englishman or woman serves up some crap about something old being sold in boston or china during the ming dynasty - big effin deal.<br /><br />can't anybody ever kidnap one of the leads and hold them for ransom? is there no alien spacecraft that will obliterate the entire floor? who the hell writes this stuff as a series and expects us to stay awake? this is about as entertaining as watching paint dry - only with commentary.<br /><br />there's no sex, there's no comedy or romance, no action, no suspense, no action, no drama, no mystery or martial arts.<br /><br />this show sucks! what ever happened to supermodels wearing thongs and spewing lasers from a futuristic weapon? antiques roadshow - more like grab a blanket and pillow and go to sleep show...
