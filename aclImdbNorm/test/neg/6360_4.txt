critters 3 starts on the open road as clifford (john calvin) his teenage daughter annie (aimee brooks) & his young son johnny (the imdb list two actor's christian & josephh cousins, identical twins perhaps?) are heading back home from a vacation. suddenly the tyre on their van blows & they have to stop at a public rest area to fix it. while there annie & johnny meet a kid named josh (leonardo dicaprio, yes that one) who in turn all run into charlie mcfadden (the films co-producer don keith opper) from the previous two critter films. charlie tells them the story of the critters & the town of grovers bend but they don't believe him. meanwhile back at the van a critter lays some eggs on it's underside, out of sight from everyone. once clifford has fixed the tyre the trio set off for their home, a run down urban tenement block in los angeles somewhere complete with critter eggs along for the ride. upon arrival the eggs hatch & the critters head straight inside the tenement block quickly disposing of frank (geoffrey blake), the caretaker. as the night draws on the few remaining residents, a fat woman named rosalie (diana bellamy), a telephone repair woman marsha (katherine cortez), an elderly couple mr. (bill zuckert) & mrs. menges (frances bay) must come together with clifford & his kids to fight the critters. josh also makes an appearance as his stepfather (william dennis hunt) owns the building. but will the group be able to defeat the critters & prevent themselves from becoming dinner?<br /><br />directed kristine peterson i thought critters 3 was an incredibly undistinguished film, but at least she can say she made a film staring leonardo dicaprio & not many people can say that! the budget for critters 3 probably wasn't exactly a fortune as the whole production looks cheap throughout, there are very few characters, very few critters & i think only 3 ever appear in the same shot at once & it does away with any sort of space angle so there are no expensive spaceship or distant alien planet special effects to pay for. the script by david j. schow is strictly by-the-numbers & very predictable. a group of humans are stuck in an isolated situation with critters & have no means of contacting the outside world for help, that plot scenario sounds very familiar right? well it's same as the previous critters (1986) & critters 2: the main course (1988) & many other horror films so it should. critters 3 does nothing with the premise, it never even tries to add anything to an already old, tired & well used storyline. critters 3 is also very tame for a horror film with only two people actually being killed, the comedy elements are seriously lacking as well with the best joke critters 3 can mange being a critter eating some beans & then farting, very funny if your about 5 years old. the characters are mostly standard horror film clich'es & quickly became annoying. there is virtually no blood or gore in critters 3 at all, just a few splashes of blood & disappointingly critters 3 in fact seems to go out of it's way not to show any violence. the special effects on the critters are ok but they still look like static, simplistic hand-puppets that have very little movement. the acting isn't that good & critters 3 happens to be a certain leonardo dicaprio's very first feature film, to be fair to the kid he's alright & i wonder if any of the other cast or crew had an idea what he go on to become. why on earth does that charlie guy have to keep popping up in these critter films? to give critters 3 some credit it moves along at a good pace & isn't boring, it's generally well made with nice enough production values & it's a bit of harmless fun if your in the right sort of mood & thankfully it only lasts for about 80 odd minutes. overall critters 3 is an ok time waster but don't expect anything deep or meaningful. there's nothing really wrong with it as cheap horror film but i couldn't help feeling that i'd seen it all before. an average time-waster that isn't as good as either of the previous two critter films. critters 3 ends with a 'to be continued...' as this was filmed back to back with critters 4 (1991) which unsurprisingly went straight to video, probably to save even more money. critters 3 is a decent enough way to waste 80 odd minutes if you can watch it on t.v. for free otherwise don't bother.
