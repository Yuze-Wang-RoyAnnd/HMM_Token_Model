thats what this movie really takes. a big piece of cheeze. this movie is about a sister and brother bonnie and clyde type of duo that creates their own party line in order to lure their victims in and trap them and kill them. but for what reason? just for the fun of getting away with it? in comes richard hatch who comes across as a wishy washy ladies man. a real bad version of a ladies man. and he gets involved with finding who's behind all the killings across la. he finally meets a teenager who helps him find the killer and rest is for your fun and amusement. but there are parts in this film that really get me going like the scene with lief garret dressed in his mothers wedding gown acting like a sissy in front of his sister telling her that he needs her and can't live without her and watching as she slaps him across the face dominateing him. i can't believe that was lief!!! well, i guess i could. but it's worth watching but only to see one of garrets worst films that he ever did.
