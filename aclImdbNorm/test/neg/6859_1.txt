i have been watching "lost" with my family since the first episode, it used to be great. the last season it was very disappointing, it seems as if they (writers)don't know what to do with the show, so, they keep trying to make it up for it by stretching one story line in a whole episode. the present season, which by the way i decided to keep watching only to see rodrigo santoro, and also with a tiny little hope that things would get better; has been one disappointment after another; my husband and son even stopped watching. first of all, he (santoro) only appears for 30 seconds in each episode. but the real problem is with the story line, there is nothing really happening, each episode could be shown in 15 minutes. we watch each episode waiting for something that never happens; i am not asking that every secret be revealed at once, but how about some variation in the story lines? in the first and second seasons, we had different story lines, we saw the characters history, a little action, a little romance, now is like one big event that takes the whole episode to unveil. it is almost tiring to watch it, when it finishes you have a feeling that you lost your time. now, it is important to note that the actors still great.i can't believe they killed mr. eko(adelawale...)he was great, jack(mathew fox)is still incredible, the perfect hero, so kind, magnanimous, brave. sawyer(josh holloway), the "bad boy" is kind of mellowing because of kate(evangeline lylli), but that's cool. i miss sayid(naveen andrews), sun and jin(yoon-jin kim & daniel dae kim), they are all an important part of the plot (or should be), but we barely see them. i hope paulo(rodrigo santoro) will have a big part on the show; if not, why did you make such a big deal of him joining the show (access hollywood, etc)? sorry if i've been rumbling for too long, but i feel cheated by this show. when i started watching it was great, i got used to it, and now it is very disappointing to see the way it is going. i'll be here, hoping for the improvements!!! katia
