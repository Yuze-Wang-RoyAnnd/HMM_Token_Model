this movie is silly and very short of being a funny movie. unhappy 'easterners' are not pleased with being out west; so they hire a drunk wagon master(john candy)to lead them back east. sight gags were just not funny enough to carry this one. and richard lewis gets on your nerves very quickly; but then i honestly don't like him at anything he does. ed lauter is hilarious as the bumbling villain.<br /><br />the movie was dedicated to candy. he died from a massive heart attack ten days before the movie was completed. a stand in and digital enhancement enabled candy's character to be seen in the final scenes. candy was a very good comedian and gave us some real good knee slapping, belly laughs in his career. this movie was just not the caliber of his best.<br /><br />also in the film, you will recognize: william sanderson, gailard sartain, ethan phillips, ellen greene and rodney a. grant.
