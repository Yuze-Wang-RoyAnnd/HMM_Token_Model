the movie gets a score of 3 because it dared to be so very different. it features a cast acting while you can hear their thoughts and desires! this is truly a weird film and an experience i won't forget. the only problem is that the experiment, though in some ways interesting, is generally quite dull and unengaging. in fact, it's amazing that a norma shearer and clark gable film could be this dull! the film is based on a eugene o'neill play and it really does seem quite stagy. in fact, it would have been best just to keep it as a stage production--it just didn't translate at all to the big screen.<br /><br />so this movie is only recommended to die-hard cinemaniacs and those who love gable films so much they just have to see all his films!
