i watched this after seeing "death tunnel" (this being, without question, the worst movie i've ever seen in my life) so you can understand i went in rolling my eyes a little at seeing the directors and producers of that cinematic gem being in charge of this one. first of all, i thought the director and producer were the same guy. they both are kid rock meets dawg the bounty hunter. i watched the taps investigation, and i am not a skeptic- i think taps is the closest one will ever get to a scientific method in the field. that was cool and believable- i do believe they are haunted.<br /><br />but this, like the reviewer above mentioned, like taking a tour. okay a tour, fine, but the "investigators" and "group leaders" seemed to make a pretty penny and have a financial investment into whether its haunted or not, so when they have fantabulous stories, i have to take it with a heaping teaspoon of salt.<br /><br />as someone else mentioned, i could make out whatever they wanted me to see in the picture about 50% of the time. the rest of the time, i couldn't make out anything. also without any context to the photos- time of day, type of camera, moisture in the room, dust particles (which 75% are what the orbs are), weather and a ga-gillion other factors, i cant accept them. i also cant help thinking that some might be doctored.<br /><br />why would that band keep the numbers from the door? vandalism? also during the taps investigation, they tried to dig up the death certificates of those nurses- and they only found one which was ruled "accidental" (people didn't want to officially proclaim suicide). yet when one of the guides was mentioning this, he said "yep, and its marked suicide." it really felt like the guides to the haunted houses here in october.<br /><br />i did however like the interviews with the patients and staff from the old hospital(s), that really gave it a lot of perspective and a personal touch. i'm also glad that they mentioned that the staff had the best of intentions, and weren't some ghoulish-wardens. they weren't the best methods, but its all they had. they were desperate to stop the disease.
