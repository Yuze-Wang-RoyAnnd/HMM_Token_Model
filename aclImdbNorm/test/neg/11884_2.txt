my wife and i couldn't even finish the film. truly, it was rather painful.<br /><br />first, the historical accuracy is compromised not so much by the events themselves as the ridiculous one-dimensionality of the characters. for instance, augustus takes the "burden" of power only with great reluctance. indeed, he is portrayed as if he's some sort of great humanist and believer in democracy.<br /><br />second, the camp! my lord, the dialog is horrifically bad. i recall the soap opera my mother watched when i was a child having better dialog than this. the constant exposition and pontificating grates upon the ears like fingernails on chalkboard. ugh. (okay, i exaggerate a bit, but the dialog truly is bad.) the hbo series rome is superior for no other reason than that its characters were at least believable, regardless of their historicity.<br /><br />rome was also wise enough to know they couldn't stage epic battle scenes. the creators of this film did not. when caesar attacks munda, the battle scene is practically farcical.<br /><br />i will grant that the costumes are perfectly good. the sets are fine, though their cgi backdrops can be a bit jarring at times. the sound is bad, though
