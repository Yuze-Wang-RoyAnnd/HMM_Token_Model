---------spoiler alert----------------------------<br /><br />this was the worst of the series, it is horror disguised as political satire and it is as subtle as a sledge hammer, not very scary and not very insightful. did micheal moore have anything to do with this piece of garbage.?<br /><br />i'm really sick of hollywood using entertainment as a political campaign against george bush and constantly repeating the same talking points over and over again. this movie wants to be deathdream, but unlike that movie which subtly poignantly tackled the problems soldiers who came back from vietnam by clever making the main character come back as a blood craving zombie and slowly built on this theme: it was a true horror film that was also good social commentary, because it didn't get sanctimonious, exploitave and preachy.<br /><br />i guess joe dante, thought this was trying to make a horror film to scare republicans, conservatives and libertarians and me being the last in that list found this film to be totally ridiculous, manipulative and exploitave all at the same time and i don't mean the good type of exploitative, that you often find in the " drive-in" type movies, i mean exploitative in the most sickening and vile manner: using the deaths of our soldiers as a manipulative political statement disguised as a horror film. <br /><br />this film assumes that all the soldiers who died in iraq, would vote against a conservative president if they would come back to life as zombies, which is a flawed premise, because as i recall for the most part and going by george romero's rules; zombies are mindless, flesh eating creatures, operating on pure impulse and even though the zombie andy, in deathdream could talk, he couldn't really hold a conversation and he was driven by his addiction to human blood. okay, zombies are mindless creatures driven by impulse and not intellect and obviously they are dead, so why would dead people be allowed to vote in the first place? my interpretation of this film is that the only war a liberal democrat could win is by having mindless, dead people vote for him, i guess they meant to say the people that vote for presidents like george bush are the mindless zombies, while the real mindless zombies, are actually the ones making the intellectually sounds decisions. yeah, whatever. dawn of the dead tackled this idea much better, but user the idea of mindless consumerism. this film isn't dawn of the dead by any stretched of the imagination.<br /><br />the film addresses the issue while the soldiers are alive that a majority of them voted for a bush like president, but after they die they would vote for a liberal anti-war democrat after they are zombies, who are normally considered brain dead creatures and laughably has them destruct after they vote.<br /><br />if you are gonna make a zombie movie mr. dante and invoke george romero's name in it, you better have mindless zombies that like ripping people apart and eating their intestines, not zombies that vote. i also like how the zombies just go "evil" conservatives who support the war.<br /><br />if you want a good movie with social commentary skip this poorly made, preachy piece of junk and watch deathdream instead.<br /><br />the worst of the master of horror series hands down.
