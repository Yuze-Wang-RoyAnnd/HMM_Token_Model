synopsis correction: the ending does not show ben cruising online for guys. he is looking up arabic language courses at the presido military acadamy in san francisco. perhaps to join the war in iraq as a translator, (fyi- many of the dishonorable discharges from "d'ont ask d'ont tell have been translators (they are now it major short supply) ben also spoke russian. this movie is a good time capsule of life in manhatten but quite a bit of non reality here. mostly a good laugh at lame social skills and the sad portrayal of "grown up" twenty somethings not developing beyond the college party mode. also a brief study of the always changing scene in manhatten.(somehow it always stays close to the edge of the same b.s.)<br /><br />watch together the films "englishman in new york"" and the "the new twenty" both good for nostalgia. i think the movie "twenty" shows how far the blur between gay and straight as evolved.<br /><br />these two films are gay time travel for sure!!!!enjoy
