where the hell did vh1 find the scriptwriter for this movie??? out of high school? this movie tries so hard to be sympathetic to michael jackson, but instead, turns him into a horrible, tacky caricature. all the lines are filled with clich'es but surprisingly the acting wasn't bad. as usual, this is a bad movie with pretty good actors. the actor that plays michael jackson, jeez, i feel sorry for him! i think he did the best he could with the weak script. i didn't mind that flex did not look like michael jackson, i thought he did the best he could, but later on when he had all that white make-up on, oh man, did he look yucky! the other actors that played debbie rowe, priscilla presley and elizabeth taylor were pretty good. except that the actress that plays liz taylor looked too young and healthy to be playing liz. the actress that plays diana ross didn't look at all like her and i couldn't figure out who this woman was until much later on in the movie.<br /><br />this movie does a disservice to everyone who is on the side of michael jackson, or against michael jackson. it doesn't do anything to change anyone's opinion. as a matter of fact, the only opinion anyone will have after watching this movie is, oh god, this movie really, really sucks! and where the hell is michael jackson's wonderful music and songs? there are none to be found in this movie. i love the soundtrack to this movie anyway and i'll probably purchase it if i could.<br /><br />on the lighter side though, this is a very funny, campy movie! it's a great time waster if you want to watch something light that won't trouble your brain too much. i'll probably watch it again, because it just is so entertainingly bad!
