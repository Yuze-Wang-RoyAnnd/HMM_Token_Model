now this is a real turkey by the overrated director franco, who gave us such classics as "las vampiras/vampyros lesbos". yes, i think that bad films can be great fun. i adore the hilarious howlers of doris wishman, dwain esper and ed wood jr., but this one proved to be too much for me. it is the first film i rated 1. where should i start? the screenplay is idiotic to the utmost. the dialogue is unbelievably bad. the directing seems to be nonexistent. the best music cue (used repeatedly in this film) was taken directly from the movie "der hexer" (1964). and it's boring! poor shirley eaton and george sanders! in one shot sanders reads a popeye comic while his henchman torture a girl (this aspect is probably the intellectual highlight of this movie). the only thing that baffled me was that franco promptly showed female nudity whenever i thought the movie would gain from it - this is real directing skill! still, i'm afraid that a movie in which actors pretend to shoot with machine guns by shaking them is not really worthwhile.
