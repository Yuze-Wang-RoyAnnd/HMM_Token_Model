celebrity singers have always had a tough time breaking into the movies (the cinema is littered with failed attempts), and one can go on and on speculating why john mellencamp never made it big as an actor. instead of taking small parts in heartfelt projects, mellencamp dives right in playing the lead in "falling from grace", which he also directed, and the results are as awkward and unbecoming as that title. story of a famous singer returning to his hometown in the sticks, opening up old family wounds, boasts a screenplay by larry mcmurtry, but the meandering film goes nowhere slowly. the supporting cast is decent, including kay lenz (whom it's always nice to see), mariel hemingway and claude akins (who share the one really strong scene in the picture). as for john's acting, he doesn't look particularly comfortable, despite apparent efforts to make him look at home; he seems to be ducking the camera most of the time, and he never connects with the audience in an immediate way. *1/2 from ****
