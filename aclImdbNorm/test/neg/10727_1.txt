jim carrey is a particular brand of humour and i personally think he's a great actor (eternal sunshine, for example).<br /><br />however, this movie is presumably intended to be nothing more than a jim carrey vehicle, so be aware straight off that if you don't think his style of comedy is funny, you will sit stony-faced throughout this film, as it has nothing else to recommend it.<br /><br />even if you do like carrey's comedy, i am not sure you will find this film amusing. i went to see it on a saturday night at 10:30pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh. they giggled throughout the trailers, which weren't particularly funny, but when it came to the film, stony silence. i think it raised about five genuine laughs.<br /><br />the problem with the movie is it doesn't know what it wants to be. it can't make up its mind whether it's going for slapstick or serious. if it were stupid throughout it could be forgiven but (i'm guessing) it's also trying to make a point about the relationship between the two central characters.<br /><br />the strong point of the film is the hold-ups, and there was plenty of potential here. but these didn't start until about halfway through and remained largely undeveloped. meanwhile, you have to sit through the first excruciating 40 minutes as the couple's life deteriorates.<br /><br />four separate groups walked out of this film while i was there, and if my flatmate hadn't asked me to keep away from the house (his girlfriend having just returned from a month-long vacation!), i would have done the same. and in my entire 25 years of movie going, i have done that just once before.
