i have seen both the mst3k version and the uncut version. i rather enjoyed it. either way, it wasn't that bad of a movie. sure it moved a bit slow at times. i liked it.<br /><br />as far as mst3k goes, they only did the movies they could get the rights for. not all the movies they ripped apart where bad movies, it was just so easy to make fun of them. take soultaker for example.<br /><br />joe estevez and robert z'dar's characters where so inanimate and boringly silly i couldn't help but laugh. i couldn't take them seriously. it really created a unique feeling though.<br /><br />vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script. a world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today. her role was played well. not too screamy not to masculine but just right. the camera really likes her in this movie. i would have casted her in that role after ready the script.<br /><br />anyways, this movie deserves a bit more credit than it is given. please watch the uncut version if you see the mst3k. it deserves that much.
