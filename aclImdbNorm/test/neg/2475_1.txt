what is wrong with american movies these days? hollyweird keeps making movies that have men acting like women and women acting like men. the idiotic male director and writer of this movie need to have their heads examined. the main problems with this film are its overt extreme feminist portrayals of the sexes.<br /><br />in the scenes of the bar, eva mendez and her friend are swigging from the beer bottles like you may find sailors on an oil tanker doing so at a bar in iceland. mendez continually kisses every girl she sees after that. she also dresses provocatively in every scene, yet curses like a guy. she gets very emotional when she fights with will smith for a while, while trying to 'defend' all women from bad guys everywhere.<br /><br />the men are no better in this movie. what we see is a bunch of idiots trying to do anything they can to win a date. the males in this movie are concerned with getting either sexual favours or unable to speak clearly when face to face with a woman. men in real life do not behave this way.<br /><br />what we see in this movie is a product of culture gone awry. everything is flip-flopped. guys act like girls, girls act like guys. all this is done while keeping the extreme predilections of the sexes very much a part of the story. men are shown as soft and stupid but only interested in sex most of the time, while women are shown as macho and overbearing but only as a veneer for their emotional insecurities.<br /><br />this movie would be good if it wasn't presented obnoxiously to the audience. the content is not the culprit. it is the manner in which the content is presented.
