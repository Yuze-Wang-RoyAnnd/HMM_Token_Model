a tedious yawn of a film that retains nothing of the zing and raciness of its predecessor, "gold diggers of 1933." the production code was firmly in place by the time of this film's release, so the humour is all of the hokey, wocka-wocka variety and gone are the dry one-liners that sounded so cosmopolitan dripping off the lips of the gorgeous dames from the first film. a cast of second-tier stars and character actors go through the motions here, and the "puttin' on a show" motif seems awfully forced; instead of the make or break world of broadway, the show here is a charity event hosted by a swanky hotel. who really cares whether or not the show goes on? the score here is bland too. of course the movie's big number is "lullaby of broadway," which accompanies a long fantasy dance number about a new york socialite's eventual demise from too much partying--doesn't exactly have the same effect as the searing "forgotten man" number used as the finale in '33. busby berkeley directs as well as choreographs this film, and whatever promise is built up in the film's fluid opening scenes quickly deteriorates. unfortunately, no one learned any lessons from this, and there was yet another gold diggers movie two years later.<br /><br />grade: c-
