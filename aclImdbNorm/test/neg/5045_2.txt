you know that mouthwash commercial where the guy has a mouth full of listerine or whatever it is and he's trying really hard to keep from spitting it up into the sink? that's a great metaphor for this movie. i kept watching, even though it was really difficult. but keeping mouthwash in your mouth will leave you with a minty fresh feeling. this movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. i should have spit it out when i had the chance.<br /><br />the premise is corny enough to be fun. for the first time in like a thousand years, gargoyles have returned to romania, and all of the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things are long dead. it's up to michael pare and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before the gargoyles run amok. unfortunately, the premise is completely lost in bad dialog and less than enthusiastic acting on the part of the human leads. the best acting is done by the cg gargoyles.<br /><br />in the end, this movie feels like a poor man's van helsing. if you check your brain at the door, this might get you through a dreary monday night. i gave it 3 out of 10 stars.
