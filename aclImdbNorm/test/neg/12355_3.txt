gotta add a comment to this one!!!<br /><br />first, ironically, one needs to add the "spolier alert" to conform to imdb's parameters, but there is absolutely nothing here to be "spoiled."<br /><br />there are six characters: the good-looking gal whose the a-list mountain guide in the area of the "climb," and apparently among all guides (including mt. everest sherpas) on the planet; her lost love, who disappeared from the titled pass two years prior, whom the party is purportedly seeking, but never find; her store-owner friend, also a guide, who may be better than a sherpa but no match for her; the weird lead actor who engages her services, and says they'll find her long-missing love in the bargain; his one associate, a computer hacker with purportedly limitless expertise, of a level sufficient that gates might seek advice from him; and his other colleague, a bodyguard who apparently has an iq not even near three digits.<br /><br />there are, of course, nefarious goings-on, and the secret quest of the lead actor is to gain recovery of a satellite which has fallen in the "pass," and has world-altering and unique data to bring them untold riches. exactly what is never revealed.<br /><br />overacting abounds, the script looks like something which might get a c- in a freshman writing class (but an f if submitted at a higher level), and the thespians gnaw every piece of scenery like a horde of beavers.<br /><br />the most interesting aspects of this movie for me was juxtaposing portions with three other flicks or roles i've seen.<br /><br />first, the mysterious, undisclosed secret data makes one recall "the spanish prisoner," an a-list/mamet film, surrounding a valuable corporate "process," never specifically clarified, but better for it. definitely not so here.<br /><br />second, the lead biscuit proved perhaps even more resourceful then "rambo" in dealing quickly when menaced later in the presentation.<br /><br />third, i remember a steven seagal flick (don't recall the title) where he was semi-conscious and abed for about 1/3 of the time, and fully-comatose for another 1/3. although i've not sought viewing a lot of his work, i've seen enough to have noted that while comatose, he provided the best work he ever has, and most in-line with his laconic persona. in this opus, while awake, the young hacker may have been the most engaging personality on-screen, but while indisposed and incapacitated during the latter portion, and unable to emote, he provided the best acting during this seemingly unending two hours.<br /><br />take the thin, silly basis for a plot here. imagine it being compressed into, say, a lbit on snl, with gilda radner, bill murray, dan aykroyd and martin short in the four roles. they could get record laughs with few changes to the dialog here.<br /><br />the most interesting aspect in the last analysis is contemplating what information could have been in the spy satellite to be worth "even billions" to any of many nations, and yet rendered worthless (according to the guru hacker) if simply placed upon the internet, with no apparent consequences thereafter? even a turkey like this one should have at least a small trace of logic somewhere. this one is totally devoid.
