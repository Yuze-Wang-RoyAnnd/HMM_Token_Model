an american boy goes to paris after his mother commits suicide, becomes and artist and then discovers himself and returns to the states so he can make things right with his former friends.<br /><br />i have to think that the people who are rating this movie so highly are all x-files fans, even though there are no aliens or serial killers in it. don't be fooled, this movie blows chunks.<br /><br />the story is incoherent, with little or no explanation of what people are doing or why. when you do get an explanation, it doesn't fit the story that went before it. what it does is bore you. for all the acting talent in the film, it just isn't interesting. i spent the whole movie wondering when sex-addict duchovny was going to bang someone. maybe he was doing it behind the scenes; they should have filmed that instead.<br /><br />what comes across is a story of a self-obsessed artist worrying about minor incidents in his life and wanting to make them right somehow - even though they didn't seem that wrong to begin with. there aren't any particularly interesting or shocking revelations, despite the mention of a big secret in the first few minutes. it's just a guy thinking that his life is as interesting to you as it is to him. it's not.<br /><br />i saw in the trivia that duchovny claims he wrote the script in a week, that's entirely believable. the guy can act, there's no doubt, but writing and directing are obviously beyond his talents.<br /><br />why hollywood keeps greenlighting these self-discovery stories is beyond me. i discover myself in the shower every morning but i don't bother making a movie about it. mine would probably be better than this one, though; at least there would be some nudity.
