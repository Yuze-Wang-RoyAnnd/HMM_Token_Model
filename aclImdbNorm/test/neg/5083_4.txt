this is the award that made me lose all respects for the hugos.<br /><br />if such a "distinguished" panel can't see or care about the obvious story-telling problems of battlestar galactica, then what worth is their award? the answer: not much.<br /><br />award-winning shows should be examples of creativity and excellence, neither of which are in evidence in bg, in this episode or any other that i've seen.<br /><br />shooting in drab video is not "artistic", it's just cheap. shaking the camera is not "creative" it's vomit-inducing and lazy as can be.<br /><br />all bg has shown is how corrupt most award-giving "academies" really are and how easy it is to buy awards with a lot of pr money.
