one only has to read the cast list and credits to salivate in anticipation of this david copperfield, but, alas, alas! how so much major acting and directorial talent could have turned one of literature's richest tales into such a monumental bore, is totally beyond me. it's pretty to look at with lovely photography, particularly the yarmouth sequences, but, just plain dull!!! no need to go on! skip it and check out the selznick or the marvelous bbc mini-series from the 1980's.
