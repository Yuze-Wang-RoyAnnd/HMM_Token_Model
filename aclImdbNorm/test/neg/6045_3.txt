i had seen this movie just days before halloween 2004. i noticed it around lunch-time and it was an interesting description in my menu box so i decided to watch it. seriously only a movie only suitable for late night tv...you know, after conan but before the infomercials sorta deal.<br /><br />although this movie has very little to do with webs, it does have a lot to do with spiders, refer to my heading if you need a refresher.<br /><br />i found the idea behind the story absolutely fascinating. a hidden nuclear generator, a scientist and a believable portal...would have been a good start to a cool fantasy but then it goes downhill after 15-20 minutes.<br /><br />the cast is poor with no memorable performances, poor quality queen who has had her breasts amplified...considering spiders don't carry breasts. as well as poor sound effects. an obvious low budget movie though the cast has tried.<br /><br />spoiler:<br /><br />4 electricians stumble upon a hidden nuclear generator while on a job. they fiddle with the buttons and open a portal. 2 workers fall into the portal and it closes...scrambling to figure out what is going on, the party still in our world seeks help while the other party observers their surroundings.<br /><br />help does not arrive so they open the portal and follow through meeting up in a parallel dimension. they encounter a race of human spiders dubbed soldiers. after a death and chase they are saved by survivors.<br /><br />now it gets boring...they hide, talk a bit, try to build another portal then attack the hive. after losing 2 more electricians they open the portal and escape returning to our world...some 200 million years ago.<br /><br />sounds interesting huh?
