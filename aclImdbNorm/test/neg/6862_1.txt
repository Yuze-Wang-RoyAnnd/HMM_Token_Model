i remember seeing this film when i was about 10, one of my friends had it. at the time it was just a film as i was about 10ish and just thought of it as another action film.<br /><br />when i look back now as a complete film buff this is quite a shockingly bad film. whoever produced this film i am sure had a short hollywood career. although the lead actor seems to have done a few films according to imdb, albeit i haven't seen any and don't really remember him too much.<br /><br />anyway, just to say that this film is really bad, in all ways it could be. i would love to see it again though :od
