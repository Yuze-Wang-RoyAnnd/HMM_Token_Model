i had the funny chance of seeing this on mystery science theater 3000, four years ago. i must admit it wasn't as badly done as some other science fiction/horror movies of the time. the plot revolved around an astronaut that came back to earth with alien embryo's inside of him. now the plot is quite weird, well if you can even call that a plot. (seeing a space program run out of one building and an old pickup truck is drop-dead funny!) i'll admit it was horrible by today's standards (and 20 years ago)...but i can see myself 43 years ago watching and being charmed by this movie. it's not even close to the badness of invasion of the neptune men, manos: hands of fate or future war.<br /><br />
