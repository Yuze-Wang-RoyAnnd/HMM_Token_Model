seeing the cover of this before i watched it, my expectations weren't high, especially since it was amongst those other crappy horror movies at blockbuster (alongside films like junior).<br /><br />alright, not only does this movie have the brainless stereotypical characters (the rich douche bag, the bitch, the sheriff, the localer that knows what's going wrong in the town, and so forth), but has such god-awful dialogue, acting, directing, and cg effects. the jeremiah stone dude was hilarious. (*spoiler*) i'll never understand why he bit his finger off out of nowhere when he was holding that chick up hostage.<br /><br />the premise for the movie is just as atrocious as the other flaws. from what i could get from it, jeremiah stone was a gold digger during the gold rush, and a notorious outlaw. he had a crapload of gold, (*spoiler*) and put a curse on anyone who went after his gold before he was gunned down by the locals after he killed some girl, but not only did he survive, he bit off his own finger and ran off. so, present day, a group of clueless morons find out about this gold mine, and of course, they are warned by locals about "the curse of the forty-niner". and what do they do? as expected, ignored the warnings and greedily sought for the gold. they get the gold, and all sorts of s**t goes on. thankfully, (*spoiler*) the bitch gets her head cut off.<br /><br />that's about it. looking at the cover of the film, you can tell what kind of movie it's going to be. it's just so terrible it's hilarious.<br /><br />1 1/2 stars out of 5.
