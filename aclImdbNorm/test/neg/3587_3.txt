we've seen a story like this before: a wife in marital troubles (played by nastassja kinski) engages in sex with a stranger (william baldwin) and then wants to go back to her life with husband and girl. when she returns home she finds out that her husband has finally found a job. everything seems bright. however, kinski finds out that her husband's new boss is actually the stranger who still shows interest over her and seems to do anything to get what he wants. what to do? say nothing?<br /><br />i didn't really like the movie. while it wasn't just bad, it clearly lacked "that something". maybe it should've focused more on what's going inside kinski's head. nothing to say about the actors themselves (i guess baldwin was a good choice for the role of the obsessed boss) but the characters seemed somewhat stereotypical, acting the way you would see characters acting in your everyday tv films. finally, the ending totally ruined what could have been an interesting plot.<br /><br />in my opinion the movie tried to look cool, it had a bit of shaky camerawork here and there, some stills, fast cuts and glamour, but in the end i think it fits spelling productions much better. same goes for the music. otherwise it didn't look that bad.<br /><br />some might like this but it definitely wasn't my cup of tea. to be fair, i don't usually watch much this type of thrillers. this one felt too long even if it was just an hour and a half long, i think it could've worked better as an hour long episode in some tv series. there was absolutely no need for some of the scenes, especially the shower scene.<br /><br />my advice: try before you buy!
