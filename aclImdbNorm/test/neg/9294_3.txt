a very sensitive topic--15 y/o girl abandoned by mother as a baby and who goes to visit her, continues to be ignored, is raped by her mom's boyfriend, becomes pregnant. there was not enough depth displayed of this situation. too much of time is taken up on the chase with the truckers transporting the baby. (interesting, this baby with asthma--you never see him cry-- except once--, be fed, have is diaper changed during the whole truck transport ordeal.) i would have liked to have seen more of the interrelationships, more focus on the fact that this girl was a minor--this should have stood up in court immediately.<br /><br />and this was a true story! it deserved a better telling than that!!<br /><br />if it weren't for the subject matter, i would have given this closer to a 0 rating. i rented this from the library. only later i found out it was a made for tv movie. <br /><br />oh well
