i like to think that i can appreciate a movie that is a bit out of the ordinary, and i certainly love a good movie that makes me think.<br /><br />if you like out of the ordinary movies that make you think, then look elsewhere. this movie is so bad and so disjointed that the only thing you will be thinking after it is over is how it is possible you wasted 90 minutes of your life watching this.<br /><br />a movie of this kind needs a driver to get buy in from the viewer. why are we interested in the main characters? what motivates these characters through their existence? why do they make the decisions they make? this movie makes a very weak attempt at doing these and fails in the process. there is no chemistry between these two actors, both of who are superb in their ability to be comfortable in any role. so why did they fail here? i strongly feel that they didn't know what their motivations were either, and when an actor doesn't know, their audience can't follow.<br /><br />in sum, i have seen macromedia flash videos that offered more in the way of provoking thought, at least i have more interest in the morphed hamster who likes the moon than why this married family man would risk it all for a "code 46" violation.
