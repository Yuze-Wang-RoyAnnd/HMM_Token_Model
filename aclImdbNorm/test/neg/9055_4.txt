eaten alive follows a young woman (janet agren) who searches for her lost sister. turns out her sister have joined a sect that has disappeared into the jungles of borneo. with vietnam veteran mark at her side she sets off to find her sister.<br /><br />as per usual, the acting isn't of the highest quality but you do get cannibal flick poster girl me me lai spending most of the time on screen with her breast bare, female lead janet agren covered in gold paint and abused with a dildo dipped in snake blood among other things. now that's gotta count for something! <br /><br />but, i must say that i find it bit hard to recommend this title. if you are fan of the genre, you will most likely recognize every gore scene in the movie bar a select few. and i mean that literally. a lot of the gore scenes are lifted straight out other cannibal movies, like man from deep river and last cannibal world. there's probably more movies stuck in there.<br /><br />ultimately, this is one for die-hard fans to check off their list. if you haven't seen any italian jungle movies, you'd be better off watching cannibal holocaust and if you're an avid fan, you have seen most of the gore scenes in other movies.
