this is the kind of film that i am wondering why anybody would have considered doing it from the beginning. this is the kind of movie that i cannot understand how people put money in it, how the rental store can put the dvd on its shelves. this is the kind of movie i blame myself for having rented it. <br /><br />there are good class-b movies, and i do not reject the genre. when they are good, they catch the interest with the action, they have characters written well enough, and acted well enough so that you can care about them. the effects in some of these movies support the film in many cases, and you may like them for the originality. almost nothing is true in 'coronado'. the subject and the script is at the level of cheap comics - just a cliche. the effects are cheap - and i do not care that the film is low budget - you can do a lot with low budget, but you need some talent. there are so many continuity and other directing errors as in ten other films. you do not care for the characters, you do not laugh, and at the end of the film you are left wondering if the parody was intentional or not. the only quality i could find is the scenery, there are some good locations, worth a much better film. <br /><br />2/10 on my personal scale. the worst film of the year so far.
