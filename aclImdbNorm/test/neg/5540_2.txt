i loved the original p.h. and was somewhat satisfied with bloodwings (ii)and ashes to ashes (iii), then i saw part iv. oh boy..... as a pumpkinghead enthusiast, i did my best to give part 4 as much credit as i could, but it's pretty bad. the wedding reception fight right at the beginning of the film is a horrendous mess for one thing. the hatfield and mccoy storyline is incomprehensibly stupid and clich'e. how did the producers get away with using that tired family feud storyline? wow, unbelievable. the acting, besides henrickson, is below average. the plot and script are mind-numbing. the actual editing and cinematography are average, as is the directing. i mean, the movie isn't a total loss. as always: i really enjoy watching pumpkinhead, i love seeing haggis the witch, and like watching harley's ghost in action. but all three characters had way too much screen time. i thought haggis and harley would wind up going out to a supper club for an evening bite to eat and drinks, the way the were being so buddy buddy in her cabin. the bottom line is.... is that i wanted all the characters in this puke fest of a plot line to be dead within 20 minutes of the start of the picture. where does sci-fi get these so called "film production professionals" from anyway!? i could do a better job writing a script stone cold drunk. i'm sure there was a limited budget and everything, but come on! see it if your a fan of the other three, but just once. and then go back and stick to the original two. shame on you sci-fi!!!!
