i saw this movie a time ago, because some of my friends wanted to rent it, and i got voted down.. i tried as best i could to get the story, because some moviemag had said that this would be a movie that would be for rob lowe, that pulp fiction had been for john travolta... well.. we can all see that he not only failed, but he fell aaall the way down. this is actually the worst film i've ever seen, and i've seen a great deal of bad movies.. it's just not even worth seeing for free on tv.
