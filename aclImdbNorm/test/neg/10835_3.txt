what a dreadful movie. the effects were poor, especially by todays standards, but that was forgivable. what was unforgivable was the terrible rehashing of every flood/dam breaks disaster movie ever made into this piece of trash. the acting was awful and i mean awful. the point in the story where michelle green stops to rescue a dog from the approaching torrent was hilarious. they see the water approaching and run for their lives. (by the way they had to find a very old fat dog so as to not make ms green look to unfit). they manage to outpace the water for some time before taking refuge. what speed! later, a speeding car is not fast enough to escape the torrent. god, she and that dog did run fast! if you want to watch a good movie about a dam breaking - this isn't it. porchlight entertainment turn out some good family films but this time they just missed the mark.
