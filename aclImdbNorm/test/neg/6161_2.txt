this is a movie with a wonderful concept, but very weak writing. it should never have been released with out at least three more re-writes (assuming it got any). the story is too loosly held together, and there are too many 90 degree turns in the story to make it a cohesive movie. it would be great to see what a decent screen-writer could do with the story.
