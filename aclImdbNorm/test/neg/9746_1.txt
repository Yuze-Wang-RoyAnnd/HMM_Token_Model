this movie was chosen, quite frankly as a pig in a poke from our local video store. it turned out to be quite a pig. the plot line-such as it is-was disjointed, inconsistent and predictable. the actors constantly looked embarrassed to be mouthing the poorly written lines. the only funny moment in the entire film revolved around the dangers of smoking and the inadvertant deployment of an airbag. the remainder of the film lacked the punch to amuse either of my young daughters (aged less than ten years), myself, my wife, my mother-in-law, or even the cat or the dog. my advice, if you are tempted to borrow this turkey, is to save your money and your time. look for something else...
