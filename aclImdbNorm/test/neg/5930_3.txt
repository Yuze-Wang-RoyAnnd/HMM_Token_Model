this movie was ok, as far as movies go. it could have been made as a crossover into secular movies. however, it had little to do with the left behind books that it was supposedly based on. major story premises were removed, and new major story premises were added. <br /><br />what disappointed me most was how nicolae was portrayed. he was shown with supernatural powers that he did not have at this point in the books. antichrist is not satan, is not omniscient and not omnipotent. <br /><br />faith and beliefs were portrayed in weird, surreal ways that seemed to make the movie just silly.<br /><br />non-believers who watch this will have more ammunition to mock christian beliefs.
