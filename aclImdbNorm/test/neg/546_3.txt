the 1935 version of "enchanted april" manages to be simultaneously tedious<br /><br />and perfunctory. it is difficult to show the transformative magic of italy shooting in a studio with only stereotypical italian behavior to belabor. the transformation of the four strangers fleeing london is instantaneous in the cut from the first day to a week later. rather than develop, the screenplay flips a switch and the<br /><br />characters are different.<br /><br />the husbands are boring enough in flashbacks without turning up, even if their presence does not drive the four women back into their shells and/or hostilities.<br /><br />jessie ralph has the most fun (moving instead of entirely chewing up the<br /><br />scenery) and katharine alexander has some poignant charm out of her<br /><br />husband's shadow (and away from his hideous droning). ann harding is<br /><br />unremarkable here (with the production code being enforced). she had an<br /><br />appropriate line in an earlier (pre-code) movie, "when ladies meet": "you're<br /><br />not worth a minute of one anxious hour that either one of us has given you," but in "enchanted april" can only look hurt, rush out, and proclaim fealty to her errant husband.
