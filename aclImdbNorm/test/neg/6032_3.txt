very cliched. quite corny. acting gets worse as the show goes on. don't believe anything that folks say about the "realism" that this movie is supposed to portray. it's just a shoot'em up. interesting twist in that the vc sieging the base were given a human face and weren't portrayed as evil incarnate.
