this movie is a complete and utter waste of time, one of the worst films i've ever seen. and coming from me, that is definitely saying something. in fact, i wish i could have given it negative stars instead of just rating it as a pathetic one-star awful.<br /><br />when i rented this movie, i had an open mind. i find the legend of the chupacabra interesting and i have a fondness for cheesy horror flicks. but i draw the line at this one.<br /><br />the acting sucked. the lead male gives one of the worst performances ever, looking and sounding unnatural as he delivers his poorly written lines. the lead female gives a slightly more palatable performance, but that really doesn't take much.<br /><br />the chupacabra... well, considering how low budget this movie must have been, the creature was tolerable. it does, however, look exactly like someone in a mask and body suit. the mask is fairly detailed and might look cool in person, but not so on screen.<br /><br />speaking of on screen, you'd think they could have at least used a better camera. it looks like it was shot with a camcorder for crying out loud. not a very good one, either.<br /><br />i don't know what whoever wrote this abomination was thinking. the dialog sucks and just... i can't describe what i feel about it. at least not without getting in trouble with the site.<br /><br />my advice? avoid this at all costs. it's just not worth it. if it comes on tv and you have nothing else to do or watch, then *find* something else to do or watch. read a book, listen to music, *anything.* just don't subject yourself to this. if you do, you cannot say you weren't warned. and for lord and lady's sake, don't rent this sucker. it is not worth it, even if you get the chance to rent it for fifty cents. trust me, i know.
