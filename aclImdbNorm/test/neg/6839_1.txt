laughably awful. one might think that all the big-name actors involved in this movie would at least make it believable, but they do not--this one is a stinker.<br /><br />characters either sprint around without having a good reason to know where they are going, or they stand around making constipated faces when they should be running for their lives.<br /><br />check your higher brain functions at the door if you intend to try watching this movie. or, get a bunch of your most clever friends together and give this one the "mystery science theater 3000" treatment. that's what i was doing through the second half of this turkey.<br /><br />and please don't confuse this with the excellent movie "the day of the jackal," a far-superior thriller from 30 years ago.
