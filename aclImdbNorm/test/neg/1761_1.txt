jude law gives keanu reeves a run for his money as the most wooden actor around, renee z's character is straight out of the beverly hillbillies, and the two leads have about as much chemistry as darth vader and queen amedala. the "bad guys" are the worst kind of cliche, and there's not a subtle moment in the film. incredible that some critics actually liked this movie.
