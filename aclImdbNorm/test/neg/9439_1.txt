this film was utterly horrible. stupid premise, and horrible acting by all. whoever wrote this trash should be hanged. reminds me of a hack student film, but worse. who ever produced this should give up now. i know opinions are subjective and all, and some may think this "fantastic" as some think "dune (1984)" was fantastic, well get off your horse and watch some real films. ok, the acting was tolerable, and with better direction could have been far better, but it didn't so it suffers. i don't know how much more i can say about this waste of film, other than to totally trash it. anyways it was horrible and i recommend to avoid it like the plague, if you come anywhere near "dreamland", rent the movie beside it instead.
