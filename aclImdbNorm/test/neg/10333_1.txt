this movie is from the 80s, but it looks like it was made in the stone age. the effects are way too cheesy. my copy has sandra bullock on the cover, which was why i bought the movie. she was in the movie for about 5 minutes of total screentime. she would most likely deny all involvement.<br /><br />in short, there is no part of this movie worth seeing, except to laugh at how bad it sucks. rent this to see the worst film ever made, bar none.
