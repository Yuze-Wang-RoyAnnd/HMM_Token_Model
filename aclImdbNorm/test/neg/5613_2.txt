this movie was made because the concept translates well into a two sentence summary that can be used to lure investors. that is, the premise is interesting and sellable. i mean, i rented it based on the synopsis. the problem is there is nothing beyond the initial concept. there is no coherent plot, no fully fledged characters, no real comedy, no interesting scenery, no surprises, and no good performances (except jon herder, he does something with very little). it's as if the people who green lit this thing never read the script but only the synopsis. and if there were enough people like me, it may even have made money.<br /><br />to the prospective viewer: don't waste your time, there is nothing funny or interesting to see here. to the creators of the film: hey, you got your film made, so what if its not that great. most people never get to see themselves or their work up on screen.
