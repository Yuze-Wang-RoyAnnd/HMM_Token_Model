this movie was obviously made with a very low budget, but did they have to make it so obvious? it looked like they made no effort to make the "future" look in the least futuristic. for example, the first scene takes place in an 80's office building and all the cars that get blown up are from the late 70's (i assume they didn't want to blow up cars that cost more than $500). additionally, its pretty obvious that don "the dragon" is driving his personal car during the movie (after all, he did partially fund the film). finally, they point out at the beginning of the film that all kinds of drugs are now legal in this new "cyberpunk" society. not only does this never become important in the film, but later when don needs surgery without anesthesia, why doesn't he just go out and get some legal heroin or morphine? the whole movie is sloppy like this and completely anticlimactic since don easily blows up an "unstoppable" cybertracker about 25 minutes into the movie. however, if you find this movie cheap or free i'd watch it, the last scene is almost worth putting up with this whole film.
