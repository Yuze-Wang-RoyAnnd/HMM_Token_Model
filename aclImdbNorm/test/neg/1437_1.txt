i don't recommend you watching this movie if you are easily offended. i'm not even easily offended and this movie made me frustrated. it's so disgusting. and it doesn't make sense. all the internet thing is so clich'e, and the producer obviously didn't understand all the "internet rules". when you chat with someone you can track their ip address. really? (see the sarcasm here). it was dumb. pointless. and i didn't even watch the end. i could always say "this doesn't make sense, this neither..." this movie is pure crap at his best. nice comment right?
