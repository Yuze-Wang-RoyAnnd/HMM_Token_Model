i watched this movie to see the direction one of the most promising young talents in movies was going. unfortunately, with this movie, leelee sobieski has chosen a path not only well worn, but completely free of any meaningful destination. this movie used every hackneyed trick in the book to leave the screen, tap you on the shoulder and politely ask if it can have your heartstrings so that it may give them a good tug. romance can be done well, and when it is, the viewer is left feeling the love portrayed on screen. during the emotional climax of this movie, i laughed. heartily. to save you the time and money, i would suggest, instead of seeing this movie, you have a meal of karo syrup and velveeta. it's about the same.
