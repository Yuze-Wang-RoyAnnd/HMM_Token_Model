the hindi remake of mrs doubtfire starring and directed by kamal hassan is a somewhat shoddy version, and not as good as expected.<br /><br />kamal hassan clearly struggles with hindi dialogs, even after all these years, and cannot handle even one scene effortlessly. the guy has aged and should give it a rest. hassan doesn't bring anything new to the role or to the character as say, dustin hoffman does to tootsie, or marathi actor macchindranath kambli does to mavshi's (aunt's) character in "moruchi mavshi" (moru's auntie, comedy play).<br /><br />what was the kid doing playing with firecrackers when it wasn't diwali? most of chachi's romantic 'cross-connections' -- vs amrish, paresh and then johny walker, seem redundant to the main storyline. tabu's bathing scene was unnecessary. the family is north indian but must be reminded of karva chauth night by a 'maharashtrian' chachi. yeah, right.<br /><br />the fine acting skills of not one but four actors namely tabu, om puri, the late amrish puri and paresh rawal have been wasted in this film.<br /><br />watch the original mrs doubtfire -- clean, crisp and crackling with fun, quite unlike chachi 420.
