this movie just stunk. i know that some people will say that anybody who thinks it is no good "just doesn't get it." i like wenders in american friend and wings of desire. but this is utter dreck. the main character is so annoying that i couldn't care less what he does. he is, as has been said in another review bouncing around like a little annoying monkey. i just couldn't stand him or force myself to care. this is the case with most of the characters who just seem to be trying to hard to be goofey or weird. i liked the mel gibson character and the milla jovovich characters and wish they would have focused more on them. milla is of course beautiful, pitiful and you really feel for her and what she has been thru and why she is the way she is. i see gibsons character as almost frankenstien like. i just wish he would have save milla and brunt the hotel down with all the worthless boring characters that lived in it. milla rating 10 movie rating 0
