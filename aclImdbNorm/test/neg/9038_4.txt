while not truly terrible, this movie is still largely a waste of time, and paints an incredibly inaccurate and revisionist picture of beach boys history.<br /><br />basically, this movie would have you believe that mike love was the brains behind the band and brian wilson was just a pathetic psycho. in fact, none of the characters is developed beyond a one-dimensional parody, but this is a tv movie so what do you expect? mike love's foul stench is all over this turkey as he attempts to re-write history with himself in the role of band figurehead and resident genius. yeah, as if...<br /><br />on the plus side, the music is excellent. unlike the previous beach boys made-for-tv bio-pic "summer dreams", this movie actually features real beach boys music, rather than anemic cover versions...also, it features a surprising number of beach boys-related rarities and seldom-heard tracks - the sunrays "i live for the sun" being but one example.<br /><br />this movie was originally shown in two parts on american network tv. part one is the superior of the two and documents the boys early days and rise to the top. by the time part two rolls around, the brian wilson character has become a mere cartoon and the actor seems to be playing for laughs - but how could anyone take this crap seriously? if you're not a beach boys fan you probably won't get much out of this movie except an extremely warped and one-sided view of the band's history. but then again, why would you watch this if you weren't a fan?
