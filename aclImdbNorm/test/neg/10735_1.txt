i can get over the political parody; even if this was suppose to be a "masters of horror" flick.<br /><br />but, what i can't get over is the blatant usage of our war heroes (and their sacrifice) as pawns in some washed up horror maker's political statement.<br /><br />to me it was purely insulting to desecrate arlington, and our heroes. i have family at arlington. the idea that this guy (dante) would even portray the arlington graves being disturbed just makes me want to puke.<br /><br />i'm done with dante, and done with moh.
