saboteur was one of the few hitchcocks i had yet to discover and i was less than half-overwhelmed. the french title "la cinqui`eme colonne" (i.e. the fifth column, a very evocative phrase for underground spying and sabotage organizations) set my expectations quite high as did the images of the finale on top of the statue of liberty.<br /><br />basically saboteur is as much light-hearted as were the 39 steps (note this is another evocative phrase, even mcguffin as a title) but it lacks most of the humor (so the characters are rather down to earth) and it's definitely not as fast paced. as a chase movie across the usa from la to ny saboteur drags its feet from sequence to sequence. the sequence at the villain's lovely ranch? lovely ranch, lovely villain but pretty tame on the whole, it doesn't really add up to nothing. the meeting with the blind man, the mixing with circus people, the soda city sequence, the ny ball sequence? they fall flat, bringing in more characters with very little added suspense value.<br /><br />one big problem i can point out is the relationship between the leads robert cummings and priscilla lane which is not building up as with robert donat and madeleine caroll in the 39 steps. hence the whole narrative structure is floating, depending on the addition of new scenes. and new scenes only bring us nearer the end since it's not clear if the hook is the hero's escape from the police, from the villains or his action to stop the plotted sabotages. in the 39 steps it was clearly scripted as 1/escaping from the police (so you know the hero can't just go to the police) then 2/running for his life and after the villains to prove his innocence.<br /><br />if you want a better hitchcock from the 40s wartime propaganda i would advise you to chose foreign correspondant over saboteur. they are both chase movies with a catchy finale, well really a gripping one and not just sightseeing in foreign correspondant as well as beautifully efficient scenes (the umbrella crowd, the tulip fields, the strange mills...).
