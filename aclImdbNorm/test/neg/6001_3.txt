i normally love jackie chan movies but this one was terrible. there are only 2 or 3 fight scenes all of which are up to normal standard more or less. the bad thing about this movie is it focuses a lot on car chasing/racing. the car chase isn't so bad (though not as exciting as fighting) but the car racing at the end is exceptionally boring. basically it takes all of things that make a jackie chan film a jackie chan film and leaves out everything except jackie chan. even the traditional outtakes at the end lack their usual humour.<br /><br />i suppose to a certain extent it was made worse by the fact i saw one of those horrible dubbed versions. i usually try to see the subtitled version...i wish i could understand chinese.<br /><br />i've only seen one jackie film worse that this one and that was one of his early forays into hollywood films that didn't turn out so well.<br /><br />avoid unless really curious or a lover of motor sports.
