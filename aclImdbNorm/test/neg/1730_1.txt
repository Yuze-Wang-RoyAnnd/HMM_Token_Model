horrendous! i'm a teenager and i don't mind teen movies but this is horrible! aaron carter plays this popstar named jd mcqueen and to keep his grades up or something, he works together with the 'nerd', jane whateverherlastnameis. but the 'mean girls' are too predictable and such the clothing most of the girls wear in the movie isn't realistic. how would any of those girls get away with wearing no bra, tube tops and shirts that expose the belly? in high school? at my school, we'd be sent home for something like that.<br /><br />and one part of the movie where jd texts jane, she says 'sleep tight? he must think i'm an idiot! i didn't know texting was so stressful!' how is texting stressful? and how obsessed jane is with jd and how he 'falls' in love with her is very stupid. the dialogue is cheesy and stupid, the acting's terrible. the music is somewhat enjoyable and the plot is little to none.<br /><br />for tweeny-boppers who still love aaron carter, you'll enjoy it. if you're a casual watcher like me, this is not the movie for you
