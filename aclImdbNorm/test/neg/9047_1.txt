a snore gore. i saw this piece of horrible, stinking, worthless, junk at the cameo movie house (now the famous crobar night-club)on washington avenue on south beach in 1980 or 81. i was 17, and my three buddies and i laughed at this horrible, gross, piece of trash. the theater was on it's last legs and there were mostly drunks snoring and sleeping in the place. they didn't miss a darn thing. the worst acting ever.these actors deserve the academy award for the worst, and i mean worst acting roles in the history of the cinema. joke was, the theater was showing another mi mi lay(a great name at least!) stinker...barf city. enough said. if you're under 12 years old you might get a few chills. over 12, you will be snoring after the opening credits. it's just amazing that anyone spent a cent on making this movie. and to think, it's considered a "cult" classic. yuk!!!!
