i absolutely despise this film. i wanted to love it - i really wanted to. but man, oh man - they were so off with sara. and the father living was pretty cheesy. that's straight out of the shirley temple film.<br /><br />i highly recommend the book. it is amazing. in the book, sara is honorable and decent and she does the right thing... because it is right. she doesn't have a spiteful bone in her body.<br /><br />in the film, she is mean-spirited and spiteful. she does little things to get back at miss minchin. in the book, sara is above such things. she does stand up to miss minchin. she tells the truth and is not cowed by her. but she does not do the stupid, spiteful things that the sara in the film does.<br /><br />it's really rather unsettling to me that so many here say they loved the book and they love the movie. i can't help but wonder... did we read the same book? the whole point of the book was personal responsibility, behaving with honor and integrity, always telling the truth and facing adversity with calm and integrity.<br /><br />sara has a happy ending in the book - not the ridiculous survival of her father, but the joining with his partner who has been searching for her. in the book, she is taken in by this new father figure who loves and cares for her and becky. and miss minchin is not a chimney sweep - that part of the film really was stupid.<br /><br />to see all this praise for this wretched film is disturbing to me. we are praising a film that glorifies petty, spiteful behavior with a few tips of the hat to kindness? sara in the book was kind to the bone and full of integrity. i don't even recognize her in the film... she's not in it.<br /><br />good thing mrs. burnett isn't alive to see this horrid thing. it's ghastly and undeserving to bear the title of her book.
