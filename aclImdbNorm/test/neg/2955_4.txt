mild spoiler in the second paragraph.<br /><br />anna christie was garbo's lackluster 1st talkie. she and dressler look like the only people who know what they're doing in this movie. the old guy who plays garbo's dad (george f. marion) in the film is soooo ah-noying!! all he does is stumble around drunkenly in a totally fake way and yell about "dat old dah-veel sea". he blames garbo's "past", his whole life, and everything on the sea! he comes across as stupid x 10. charles bickford is matt, the rough 'n' tumble sailor garbo falls in love with, and he's fine in his role, but nothing really outstanding.<br /><br />the best part is when garbo unleashes her "terrible secret" on bickford and her dad. finally, marion stops talking about the evil of the sea and beats his head and fists on the table in perfect time with bickford. then soon he goes on a tirade about the sea.<br /><br />i had to practically force myself to finish anna christie. it's too melodramatic in many parts and creaky. there are many good early talkies but this is not one of them. if you haven't seen garbo before try something else before anna christie, like camille or grand hotel.
