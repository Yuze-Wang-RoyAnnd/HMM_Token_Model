by strange coincidence i've started to watch this move straight after brice de nice and the good thing was that not many movies could be worst than brice de nice, so i was really looking forward for something better which would make me forget this horrible flop.<br /><br />unfortunately oss-117 again left me disappointed - i don't know, maybe it's just problem with translations, but since "diner de cons" i haven't seen any french comedy that i would call really good. even when i look at the reviews on imdb only people from france are giving the oss-117 high notes...<br /><br />for me this movie didn't really work - in some parts is as funny as real bond movies, in others jokes were a little bit too predictable or too corny.
