superhero movie (2008) is the most recent in the long line over "parody" movie movies which i despise so much. i wish this movie could be the death of the genre, but i know that it isn't awful enough to put the final nail in the coffin.<br /><br />if meet the spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel as far as hollywood movies go, than superhero movie is probably near the top. unfortunately meet the spartans was actually miles below the barrel, and this movie just barely makes it in.<br /><br />superhero movie has a decent cast of c-list celebs. it's got drake bell (the kid from disney's drake and josh), leslie nielson (airplane!), tracy morgan (snl and 30 rock), and a few others scattered throughout. although it has the star power to light a 40-watt bulb, the movie fails to utilize any humor.<br /><br />this movie is about 80 minutes long, most of which is dedicated to following the spiderman plot, and not one single joke is funny. i didn't laugh or chuckle or smirk the entire time.<br /><br />don't see this movie. don't even think about it. for the love of cinema, just skip it and maybe they wont come out with another one.<br /><br />...oh, who am i kidding? they'll probably come out with another one by fall.
