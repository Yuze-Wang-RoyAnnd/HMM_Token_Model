a lot of the negative reviews here concentrate on the historical accuracy of this film. ok, it had about as much to do with the actual nfl as your average war movie has to do with an actual war, or a western has to do with the true "old west". so, i think we should give them an artistic license pass on that one.<br /><br />the problem here is, the director (clooney) apparently thinks that making a screwball comedy means a) do stupid things, b) mug for the camera, and c) take stupid scenes full of mugging and stretch them out way too long. screwball comedies need a fast pace, not necessarily frenetic, but moving briskly along at all times. here, things drag, and drag, and drag. after you watch this movie, it will make you appreciate how brilliant mack sennett was when he pretty much pioneered the genre with his keystone cops. after 90 years, you would think that directors would have studied the old masters and learned a thing or two, maybe even improved on things a bit. but no, it's as if someone had watched an automobile pioneer build a duesenberg, and nearly a century later, paid homage and "improved" on the concept by cobbling together a child's wagon with square wheels.<br /><br />i've enjoyed several of clooney's movies, i consider him a gifted actor. but very few actors can competently direct themselves; clint eastwood notably took a while to get the hang of it. clooney is clearly at the bottom of a very steep slope. the movie becomes more watchable during the very few times he is out of the frame, but when he's in the picture, he makes himself the centre of attention. in the fight scenes, his mugging is so obnoxious you wish somebody would thump him for real.<br /><br />if you are making a screwball comedy and want some romance thrown in, you need to develop some chemistry between the male and female leads. clooney and zellweger have all the chemistry of pair of dumpsters sitting in a parking lot. no spark, no sizzle, not even a post-mortem twitch. zellweger, who has also turned out some pretty good movies, must have traded her botox injections for oak tannin, giving a stunningly wooden performance. she might just have pulled off the "tough broad in a man's world" act if just once, while trying to out-testosterone the guys, she had looked into the camera with a little half-smile and twinkle in her eye. but no, she kept her jockstrap cinched up tight to the very end.<br /><br />of course, the biggest sin here is that the movie simply isn't funny. doing stupid things is not the same as slapstick. doing stupid things very inventively, like the stooges, or very athletically, like buster keaton, can be hilarious. but otherwise it's boring and, well, stupid. i think i got one good laugh out of the entire movie.<br /><br />avoid this one. i saw it for free on cable, and still wanted my money back.
