this is 1 hour and 24 minutes of pure boredom!!<br /><br />in this 'action'- movie, even the gun baldwin uses (hk g3a3) sucks. it was sent to recycling by armed forces worldwide in the mid eighties, and is now only used by terrorists, bank robbers and military museums.<br /><br />if i had known this movie was this bad, i would rather watch 10 episodes of macgyver saving the planet.<br /><br />no groove, no drive and no feel. watch the tupperware-channel
