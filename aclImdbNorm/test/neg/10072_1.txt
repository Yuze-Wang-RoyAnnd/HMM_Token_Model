this movie was perhaps the biggest waste of 2 hours of my life. from the opening 10 minutes, i was ready to leave. the cliches there slapping you in the face, and the plot was not only predictably stupid, but full of more holes than swiss cheese. i am considering suing for that lost 2 hours, and $6.25 along with the fact that i am now stupider for watching this waste of film. the t-rex's must be flipping in their graves, so to speak.
