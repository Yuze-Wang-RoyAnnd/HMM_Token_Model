...without anything to walk away with. this movie starts with scenes in china with the finding of a newborn. while this is not a new concept, i wasn't going to give up right there. then there is a flash forward to adolescence. the man's wife and biological child are fed up with the father who has neglected them. while this did not seem culturally accurate, and the movie made no move to develop these characters or the purpose for the adopted father's devotion, i pressed on.<br /><br />next, we're in malibu where we are bombarded by poorly constructed classroom interaction and terribly low-budget (fill in the blank: acting/camera work/lighting).<br /><br />i won't give away any more of the plot, because i suppose the synopsis is accurate: the movie is meant to show how a malibu girl who (though she seems to innately have the compassion and interest to help others when she immediately asks her teacher about the trip to china) is spoiled and inconsiderate, finds herself as being a healer and helper of both body and spirit.<br /><br />lame. lame, lame, lame.<br /><br />now i, admittedly, am a harsh critic, so maybe take one of those lame's away and you'll be on the mark.
