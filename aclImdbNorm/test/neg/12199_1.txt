acting 10, script 1. "hurlyburly" is from that unfortunate postmodern school of theatre that has declared anything resembling a story or plot is forbidden. while people may get away with this on stage, on film it becomes deadly -- or at least deadly dull. we're left with a bunch of great actors spouting dialogue that, while brilliantly written, adds up to nothing. even worse, every character speaks with the same voice despite their backgrounds. the only attempt to differentiate is to have teen-waif anna paquin use the word "ain't."<br /><br />never mind that the characters are unsympathetic losers to the extreme, the camera work is plain sloppy and (for la residents) the attention to geography is laughable. (hint: the view out sean penn's front window is about eight miles away from the view out his back window, and you can't drive south through hollywood and wind up in glendale pretending to be burbank.) okay, suspension of disbelief and all that -- and normally i wouldn't pay attention to little things like that, because they are just vagaries of production. but, the fact that they did stick out so much despite the thespian pyrotechnics on screen says a lot about the weakest element of this enterprise -- the script.<br /><br />in short, skip this one, even on video. rabe picked the wrong quote from the scottish play for his title; hurlyburly would have been better named "a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing." a bit long for the marquee, perhaps -- but at least it would be honest advertising.
