this movie was one of the worst i've ever seen, it did not left out a single clichee one could imagine about a hollywood-so-called-thriller. the protagonist is a loving father & a private investigator who is engaged in a special task: finding out if a suspected "snuff" movie is real.<br /><br />certainly, he get's involved deeper & deeper, smeary pornoshops (run by mexicans) & sex theatres are his field of investigation as he's searching for the murderers of the woman in the "snuff" movie. assisted by a "smart" (he read a book) sexshop employee, he's catching up with a murderous bondage-film producer and his personal perverts who are responsible for the film... ...and what do you expect? they are portrayed as the simple evil, no need for explanations, backgrounds, history: they are the bad ones, and he's the purifier. boom. killer of the killers. end of film. is it that bad? yes, i'm afraid so.<br /><br />ironically, "machine" (the mega-pervert who did the killing) is even pointing at his ridiculous character: in the last scene, our hero forces "machine" to put off his leather mask (yep, of course he's wearing one) and recognizes that "machine" looks just like the normal 08/15 guy from the street. then "machine" says: "blablabla i'm not a monster, my parents never abused me, i had a nice childhood, i just love to do what i do!"<br /><br />i just love to kill people. yeah, sure, "everybody loves killing people" (bender). it's not only the total lack of character what made this film so boring, it's also it's ugly "i have to kill these people"-attitude which makes you sick. in one scene, our hero has tied up one of the killers and tries to shoot him...but he can't. so what does he do? he calls the mother of the killed woman, says that her child is killed and asks her whether she loved her child so much that she wishes to see the killers dead. the mother cries yes, she'd love her child, he goes back to the tied killer and slaughters him.<br /><br />to come to the point: this film is breathing the foul air of lynchmob-supporters (certainly the police does not play any role in it), moralizes in a ridiculous form against pornography, does not take it's characters serious and wastes your time with a stupid plot. probably the only good thing about this film is that it does not try to pseudo-psycho-analyze ... even that would be too much plot.<br /><br />don't waste your time with this.<br /><br />
