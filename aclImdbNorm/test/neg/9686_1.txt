who wrote the script for this movie, the staff at disney studios?! this is the most inacurrate adaptation of any story ever! i wanted to laugh at a few scenes and cry at others, and that was only because of how pitiful it was. i'll have to hand it credit, it did have a few funny scenes, but i could've spent better time with my evening. very seldom do i turn off a movie after only a quarter of the way through.
