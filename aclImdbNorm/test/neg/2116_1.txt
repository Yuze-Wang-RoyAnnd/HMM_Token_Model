i think this movie can be called the movie of misdirected rage.<br /><br />the characters of joe and bob were relics of the wwii generation who didn't quite understand their kids opposing the war, taking drugs and listening to rock and roll. but i think their real rage was at the fact that america was beginning her long decline from the heights the war left her at.<br /><br />"joe" himself is a low-rent archie bunker, ranting at all the things that have made him angry, living his life of quiet desperation, until he teams up with compton, a guy who wants to avenge himself on the hippies who ruined his daughter.<br /><br />honestly, most of the movie looks silly, the characters are worse than one dimensional, they're laughable. peter boyle was capable of better stuff.
