this movie, although well shot and superbly acted, was awful. i felt as if i was watching a car accident--sure i kept watching but i really wanted to turn my head. the plot leaves little to be desired, was extremely disjointed, and the ending was abysmal. although, it did fit the tone of the movie, i was hoping for something to improve this movie. i still don't understand what the references to rabies and the child get bit by the fox at the beginning of the movie. fifteen minutes of plot that really didn't do much. it's really sad to see a movie with fine actors and a beautiful set wasted on such an awful, awful, story. there's not much more to say about this movie. save yourself the time and watch c-span. it'll be more uplifting.
