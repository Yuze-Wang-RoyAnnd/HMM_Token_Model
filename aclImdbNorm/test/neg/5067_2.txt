this music is totally out of touch with the film, showing up now and then as wagnerian bombast and lone ranger hurry-up, otherwise nonexistent. the acting, outside of the two principals, is nonexistent. it would have been an excellent student film. the russian soldiers are just models trying to act. the constant interruptions with wow-explosive-camera angles and monocolor clips of pieces of people were quite irritating, but that's just a personal feeling. the story line isn't worse than others, actually not worse than most, completely ignoring logic and reason and reality. at least nobody walked in front of a machine gun for three minutes without being hit. the three top-level bad guys were campy.
