ru paul plays a secret agent called starrbooty. she teams up with another drag queen agent to fight the evil annaka manners (candis cayne)and get her kidnapped niece back...or something like that. seriously-- i had trouble concentrating on the plot! the movie is seemingly directed by somebody with severe add--quick camera cuts nonstop that make it impossible to focus on anything. the dialogue is incomprehensible at times and when you can hear it you wish it remained incomprehensible! the acting is actually pretty ok except for ru paul who overacts to an embarrassing degree. also the film is full of disgusting bathroom humor that is just revolting and not even remotely funny. after 30 minutes i had to leave because i was bored, sick and just couldn't stand it anymore. i pride myself on sitting through anything but this went way beyond my limits! people are comparing this to the early work of john waters. i disagree. waters' work is sick but good--this is just sick. avoid.
