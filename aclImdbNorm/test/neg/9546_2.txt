the bone collector is set in new york city & starts as one of the world's foremost criminologist's & crime scene experts lincoln rhyme (denzel washington) is involved in an accident which leaves him a bedridden quadriplegic. jump forward four years & alan (gary swanson) & his wife lindsay rubin (olivia birkelund) are kidnapped, soon after new york cop amelia donaghy (angelina jolie) is called to a crime scene & finds the buried & mutilated body of alan. amelia notices some unusual crime scene evidence & makes a note of it which impresses rhyme when he is asked to work on the case, he quickly realises the evidence are in fact cryptic clues to the whereabouts of lindsay. having cracked the clues the cops get there too late to save her but this is just the beginning as a sadistic serial killer continues to kill & leave forensic clues for rhyme & the police...<br /><br />directed by phillip noyce i watched the bone collector last night & i have to say it's one of the worst big budget post the silence of the lambs (1991) & se7en (1995) serial killer thrillers i have seen, in fact it makes friday the 13th (1980) look sophisticated & realistic! the script by jeremy iacone was based on the book by jeffery deaver & is so poor on so many levels i hardly know where to begin. for a start it takes itself deadly seriously & that makes all the other flaws seem twice as bad. the character's are truly awful & i didn't believe any of them were actual human beings. first we have lincoln rhyme who is paralysed from the neck down & there's just not a lot the script can do with him, in fact he quite literally can't do anything but lie in bed for the whole film. he is seemingly impressed with amelia because she stopped a train & thought a fresh footprint near a murdered person might be of relevance, i'm not being funny here but wouldn't any cop realise a footprint near a murder victim might be of some relevance? why is he so impressed with her? then there's capatin cheney who is not only unlikable & shouts at everyone for no apparent reason but is so incompetent that he failed to connect several murders committed in a short space of time where each victim had sections of flesh & skin surgically removed from their bodies, how exactly did this guy get to be a police captain? then there's the killer whose motives are less than plausible, are you trying to tell me they devised an intricate plan to murder at least seven people because they spent six years in jail for something they actually did? if they wanted revenge on rhyme why did they kill all those other people who had no connection to anything, i could maybe just about buy someone wanting revenge against the guy who put them away but not to kill several other people who have no connection to themselves, the intended target rhyme anything else. also after devising an intricate plan to kill these people & get away with it they suddenly turn into the most stupid person in history as despite holding a large knife & being able to walk & use their arms they are actually defeated & nearly killed by a quadriplegic who has no movement in his body below his neck! how did that happen? i should also mention amelia who is a terrible character, she actually buys her own camera to take crime scene photo's & shoots rats for no apparent reason.<br /><br />besides some of the worst written character's ever the story & plot isn't much better we never find out why the killer is using the bone collector book as inspiration we never find out why the killer was taking strips of flesh from his victims. it's never explained why a rookie cop like amelia is allowed to enter crime scenes even before the proper forensic teams. there is no reason given for why the killer chooses his victims. also the killers clues are a little obscure aren't they? i mean a bloody animal bone & shaved rat hair? logically how does someone go from a bone & rat hair to the exact pinpoint location of the next victim & has the whole of new york to choose from? there's some nonsense about a bird that sits on rhymes window ledge which is just totally random & at almost two hours the bone collector is really slow going. there is so much wrong with the bone collector & it all comes down to one of the worst scripts ever, it's atrocious on all levels & has zero credibility. apparently angelina jolie has stated that she shot nude scenes for this film but they were cut because they were felt to be too distracting.<br /><br />with a supposed budget of about $48,000,000 the bone collector is well made with good production values & that hollywood gloss about it. i also must add right now that i think angelina jolie gives one of the worst performances i have ever seen, i think she is absolutely terrible in this. denzel washington just sort of lies there really, queen latifah is awful & even michael rooker can't do much as he is stuck with a clich'ed & one dimensional character.<br /><br />the bone collector has to be one of the worst hollywood films i have seen in a while, i saw it for free on telly last night & i still feel cheated & ripped-off. there are just so many things to poke holes at it's silly, embarrassingly awful or should that be awfully embarrassing? works either way to be honest...
