every movie quentin tarantino has made has become progressively worse. i'd like to believe that most people would agree with that statement, but seeing as "inglourious(sic) basterds(sic)" has an 8.5/10 from over 100,000 ratings, it doesn't seem like the general movie-going public has any sense. even his best work, reservoir dogs, wasn't a 'masterpiece.' the trouble is that claiming that you like tarantino's work has become trendy. as soon as that happens, you get boatloads of people ready and willing to hop on another bandwagon. they will ignore laughably terrible acting, and utterly self-indulgent writing just so they can be part of the exclusive club called "everyone." this movie is so terrible, that i swear it must be some sort of twisted joke by tarantino to see how much torture his fans will tolerate and still praise him. like another reviewer has already said: "previous tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. this one is from a guy in love with his own writing." i couldn't agree more. this movie is nothing more than self-indulgent and in-joke riddled writing paired with acting ability taken right out of a high school play. but, thanks to the general movie going public, i'm sure it will still go down as one of the best movies ever made. bravo, tarantino. you've pulled-off one of the best practical jokes of all time.
