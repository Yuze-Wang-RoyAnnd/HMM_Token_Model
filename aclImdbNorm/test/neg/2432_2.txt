all this show is, is the same plot. kuszko (spelling?) is in danger of failing school, he needs to pass to become emperor. he needs to learn something, which he thinks is stupid, he then uses it/ learns more about it and realizes it's not so stupid. eezma, posing as the principal, tries to transform kuszko into some animal to stop him. every episode.<br /><br />jokes from the movie are copied (eezma's incredibly complicated plans, kuszko breaking the 4th wall constantly, squirrels.) they should try hiring some writers.<br /><br />2/10
