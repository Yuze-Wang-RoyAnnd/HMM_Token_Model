ok this movie was by far worse then the first one and the first one sucked! the zombie make up was extremely fake! the acting is very poor! and it doesn't really follow the first one! while watching this i kept thinking wow the first one is a masterpiece compared to this. i would say catch it on tv, don't spend your money on it! its not the worst movie i've ever seen but its on the list. i started watching it last night and fell asleep so i watched it today and almost fell asleep again! the plot was pointless, i mean i get the fact that a small military group are sent on a mission to get the blood of the lead zombie and bring it back so they can use it to save lives and stop zombies but they made it where you wanted everyone to die. they made plenty of bad guys who really were just annoying. if you ask me this was a rip off of resident evil and not a good rip off either. the plot could have made it if the acting was good and if they actually made you feel scared to see whats behind the corner. with these zombies my grandma could have went in that building and survived! out of a 1-10 i give it a 2.
