i'm a big fan of patricia hodge and mariam margolyes, so i watched this show when it came on a&e some years ago. the show was strange to say the least, but i gave it a chance because i liked these actresses. this has got to be one of the worst shows i've ever seen. i wouldn't watch it again and certainly wouldn't waste money on buying the video. the storyline of this tv version is ludicrous and just plain stupid! the "kicker" (pun intended) comes when ruth has surgery done on her leg bones. that kind of nonsense belongs in james bond and sci-fi movies. if this version is true to the book, then i won't be checking the book out from my local library! the american version came out some years after i'd seen this original. to my surprise the americans got it right this time, as their version with meryl streep and roseanne is played for laughs and is rather funny. when played for laughs the storyline works.
