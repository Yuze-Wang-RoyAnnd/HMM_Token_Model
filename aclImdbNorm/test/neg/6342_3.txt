but to be a little more precise i do not think that it is as bad as it actually could be. eventhough the actors (famous to semi-famous) didn't do a very great job. directors fault? could be the script as well hard for me to say? anyway, if you are after a lot of cool guns and action this is not the movie for you but they do run around with a lot of ww2 vintage guns. sort of fun :) well i guess i could say more but it just doesn't feel as if it's worth it. if you are desperate enough or a hackman freak see it otherwise don't!<br /><br />live well and prosper
