evil never looked so bad. they meant it.<br /><br />when a buddy of mine picked this dvd up at a half-priced book store, i didn't know what to expect. i mean, based on the title, i knew it would be worth a laugh, but i didn't realize how laughable it would really be.<br /><br />the first time through, i missed some of the dialogue (if you could call it that) because we were all too busy poking fun at the plot of the movie. it seemed like it was written in filmed in less than a week, and they hadn't the budget to go back and fix some of the minor flaws. wait, did i say "minor"? i meant the exact opposite. for instance, the main character is credited as 'ken', but several times throughout the film he is referred to as 'john'. <br /><br />if the plot holes aren't enough fun for you, take a look at the acting. nobody seems overly concerned about the zombie raids in their state, including the mother of the main character, who is missing for days while she sits in front of a fireplace reading a book.<br /><br />the constraints that the budget puts on the movie are equally as hilarious. maybe they didn't have a permit to film wherever they were, because during the big motorcycle chase scene, the characters are obeying all traffic regulations. the zombies, who had just killed twenty or so people, actually stop at a stop sign coming out of a parking lot. i don't even do that, but then again, i'm not a biker zombie. the ending of the movie looks like they just ran out of money. it ends so suddenly that it leaves you wanting more... on second thought, it ends just soon enough.<br /><br />so if you're looking for a good time with your friends, seek out this movie. it's a great unintentional comedy.
