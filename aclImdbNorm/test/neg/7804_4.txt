anupam kher is an excellent actor, he debuted at 28 playing a 50 yr old in saraansh<br /><br />now he turns director with ojj<br /><br />the film has a good plot but it's regressive<br /><br />the theme has been done to death and urmila's character looks too put on while anil-mahima and abhi- tara tracks are too sudden and then forgotten<br /><br />the film moves a snail pace and begins to drag but there are several good scenes like the entire conflict between anil-fardeen and abhishek where fardeen says to sell the house<br /><br />abhishek getting caught for a crime and anil shouting at him<br /><br />the climax is too much though<br /><br />directorally anupam shows potential, but has some way to go music is okay<br /><br />anil kapoor excels in his part like always fardeen tries hard and is okay but needs to improve abhishek is excellent, this was a turning pt, people realized he can act urmila is okay mahima and tara are wasted waheeda is good
