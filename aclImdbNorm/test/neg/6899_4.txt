this movie seemed like it was put together very quickly in both plot and graphics. my two daughters were ready to go 30 minutes before the end of the movie which rarely happens when we go to the theaters. this was a nickelodeon production and it would have been better if they had released it on the t.v. station. the animation itself in some parts was o.k. but the plot was horrible. a classic tale of a son trying to fulfill a fathers expectations is used in a lot of kids movies, but the animation or graphics need to be really good to keep a childs attention. this was not the case with this film. there were also awkward elements between the lead male character and the lead female character that the plot could have done without.
