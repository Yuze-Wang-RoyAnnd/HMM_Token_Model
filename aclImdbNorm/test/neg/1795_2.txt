heart of darkness, a short novel written by joseph conrad about greed, corruption, and traveling through africa was, to say the least, a tedious read. the narrator follows marlow, a seaman who travels into the deep of africa to rescue kurtz, somewhat of a prodigy ivory trader who supposedly went crazy, this conclusion arose when the ivory stopped coming into the main port. the basis of the story is conrad writing lavishly of the surroundings, he sets the scene wonderfully, but possibly a bit to extensively. the story seemed more like a water color painting, as apposed to the slow creeping mild action story that conrad might have intended to pan out.<br /><br />it sometimes happens that after you read a book, maybe watching the feature film might help correspond some thoughts with those in the book, or vise versa. not so with heart of darkness, even with the supporting role of masterpiece actor john malkovich the movie only confused me more, there seemed to be no real main characters in the film, no one stood out to the others, non of the extensive symbolism was explained. it was rather bland and drudging to say the least.<br /><br />in all do respect to the author, the heart of darkness is a true short novel masterpiece, it touches on some very severe subjects, the lies of marlow, and the greed of kurtz. it is not a book to be taken lightly, and will put you in a rather somber mood. a book like this i feel might be to heavy for a lot of people. i would however recommend this book to those who crave a sad pseudo action story without a textbook happy ending.
