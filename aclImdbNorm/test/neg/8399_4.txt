...now please move on because that's getting on my nerves.<br /><br />seriously, the man behind brilliant pieces like "my own private idaho" and "to die for" (and others not so brilliant movies, i.e. the unnecessary "psycho" remake) started an experimental phase with "gerry", which reached its peak with the thought-provoking "elephant". "last days" had some interesting aspects but was very uneven, while "paranoid park", his new film, also has good-looking 15 year-olds walking around... and not much else. some cool references to fellini (the soundtrack reuses some beautiful pieces by nino rota) and the elegant cinematography by the legendary christopher doyle ("in the mood for love") are the highlights, but the movie is just too artsy-fartsy and meaningless for its own doom. we've had much better coming of age stories, and "paranoid park" brings nothing new. i don't see anything artistic about seeing excessive shots of gabe nevins in his underwear or showering. or when nevins and 13 year-old taylor momsen (the little girl from "how the grinch stole christmas"), who plays his cheerleading girlfriend, have sex for the first time, just because she felt like they had to do it and after they're done, she calls her friend to say how amazing it was (and you can say from nevins' face how traumatic it was). everybody knows that they're starting earlier and earlier nowadays, movies like "thirteen" and even "elephant" itself (which shows how lost their minds are in general, not only when it comes to sexuality) have done a better portrayal of that. gus tries to be minimalist and artistic, but the final result is just boring and uninteresting. his next project, "milk", a biopic about harvey milk starring sean penn, will, hopefully, bring the good old gus back, because, frankly, this obsession over underage kids is almost... creepy. 4.5/10.
