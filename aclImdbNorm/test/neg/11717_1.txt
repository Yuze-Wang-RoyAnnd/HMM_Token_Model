upon completing this infernal piece of trash, a friend and i swore a solemn vow never to again speak of how we had just trashed away the last 90 minutes of our lives. this film is completely pointless, a two dimensional hero and heroin who we can't give a hoot whether or not they survive and some of the lamest villains to ever darken the screen of horror (or any other) genre. to further prove just how absolutely pointless this film was, i would have liked to add a plot synopsis, but i can't write fiction. all and all, the only reason i can think of that anyone would ever want to view this film is if they had just murdered their entire community and is looking for some self afflicted punishment that will haunt you for all following years to come!
