i rented this movie hoping that it would provide some good entertainment and some cool poker knowledge or stories. what i got was a documentary type look at an average guys life who happened to be really good at cards. do i want to see the romance with his wife? no do i want to see about everything that went on in this guy's life except poker? no. well thats what you get with this film. the acting is good for such a low budget piece of crap. the film never tries to break the mold or do anything original. it simply sleep walks its way through the script. the ending is disappointing and never really looks deep into ungar's mind. instead it focuses on what was already obvious. he was a drugged out card player with an average life not unlike any other average joe in vegas. the movie focuses on the aspects of his life that were un extraordinary rather than the extraordinary. the poker scenes in the entire film add up to about 4 minutes of footage. ungar's achievements of winning the wsop 3 times seem life after thoughts. a 10 year old could do a better job directing this movie.. or maybe it was the script being a piece of crap from the beginning that doomed this joke of a movie.<br /><br />if you want to see a film about gambling watch rounders. it at least has style.
