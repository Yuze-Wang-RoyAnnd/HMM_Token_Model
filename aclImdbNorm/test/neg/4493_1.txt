the action scenes was quite good. but the plot of the movie, i would have to give it a score of 1 out of 10. it seems that the producers and director of this movie didn't thought about it carefully?<br /><br />it doesn't give much value and values to it's viewers except for it's violence. the entire story was about revenge. a boy witnessing a rape and murder. i would even recommend it to be banned. those who watched it, you've just lose some money. if you're thinking of watching it, watch something else. i would ask for a refund if i was on a movie theater. so for you guys and girls out there reading this article. please don't waste time.
