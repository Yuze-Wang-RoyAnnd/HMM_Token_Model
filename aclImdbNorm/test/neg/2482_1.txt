wow...not in a good way.<br /><br />i can't believe people dig this trash. most of the shows on television are pretty bad, and this has been a running trend for a while now - they just keep getting worse, but las vegas definitely takes it home. what a terrible show...<br /><br />the actors are a bunch of has-been c+ losers that never went anywhere (except james caan...who knows what he was thinking when he signed on to this pos) so its not their fault that this show sucks. they just can't help it. blame the producers and the writers. i can't believe they shot this and were actually proud enough of their work to air it.
