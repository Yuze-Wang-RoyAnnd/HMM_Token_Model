not a terrible film -- my 10 year old boy loved it, and he would be the target demographic, so i guess they hit the spot. pretty dull for an adult though.<br /><br />hard to relate to animated lego characters, even mod high-tech ones.<br /><br />i thought the choice of the three great virtues of the bionicle world was a bit odd -- unity, duty, and destiny. am i the only one who thinks those sound just a bit fascistic? especially destiny. what about freedom, equality, justice, etc.?<br /><br />oh well, it will sell lego. kind of dull for a movie, but not bad for a 74-minute advertisement. could have been a lot worse.
