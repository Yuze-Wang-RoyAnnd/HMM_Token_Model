i saw this movie because it had a giant person and was labeled as a monster movie. i do not understand why it is called a monster movie. the movie is a drama. i was expecting a lot of destruction, but what did i get? most of the movie was relationship problems and people thinking that a woman was a loony because she saw a spaceship crash with a giant inside for an unexplained reason. the action started a few minutes toward the end. since the woman was killed, isn't that murder? couldn't they have done anything else besides murder her? if you watch this because you expect it to have action because it is labeled as a monster movie, don't watch it. it is not a monster movie. it is a drama.
