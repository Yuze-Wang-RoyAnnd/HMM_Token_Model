week after week these women just sweep all the men of their feet. get real. none of these women are "knockouts". carrie (sarah jessica parker) looks like the type of woman men would pick up at !:45am before the bar closed after their vision and standards were equally impaired by ten or eleven martinis. yet she's the queen bee, a super-sexy man-killer. the other three don't fare much better. and their constant foul mouthed comments.....not to mention that they jump in and out of bed with strange men and never catch a disease. this show is pathetic .and creepy.i don't think any man would be terribly attracted to any of these women, even if he popped viagra like tic tacs while on shore leave.
