i caught this during a brief run in a philadelphia theater. despite its local provenance (and its relation to a hometown tragedy, namely the beating death of eddie polec in 1994), i really have to come down hard on this movie. the director, for reasons best known to himself, decided to shoot the entire film guerilla-style, with nonstop handheld cameras and rapidfire cuts. such technique might work for the scenes of jarring violence, but is utterly inappropriate for the rest of the material, which makes up the majority of the film. a stroll down the sidewalk, a brother-to-brother discussion on a sofa, hell, even a kiss on a first-date are all shot cusinart-style, distracting this viewer from ever being able to enter into the drama. martin also undercuts his narrative by packing in far too many topics: besides the birth of mob violence, we get anorexia, alcoholism, divorce, racism, parental abuse...did i miss anything? no doubt a better cast (and a better-focused direction) would have knit these threads together, as martin surely intended, to demonstrate how one moral flaw leads into and sustains a host of others...but good intentions do not necessarily a great film make. just a sprawling mess. martin, i know you're from my town, and i'm down with you man, i really am...just do a better job next time, like you did in two plus one.
