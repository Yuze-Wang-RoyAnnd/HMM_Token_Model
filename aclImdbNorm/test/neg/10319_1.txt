i watched 5% of this movie tonight and you may tell me that i need to see the whole movie to understand it, but frankly i don't think so.<br /><br />what the hell is the story in this movie? i saw a lot of people running around in a factory, shooting at everything around them.<br /><br />where to start? okay..<br /><br />1) they were shooting around the place as if it was the terminator or something they were trying to kill. the entire place is made of metal, but not a single bullet sparked on the metallic surfaces.<br /><br />2) no ricochet. metal vs metal is bound to cause ricochets, but apparently no one got hit by a stray bullet.<br /><br />3) magic bullets? in one scene a bad-guy is standing right in front of a good-guy when another good-guy pops out behind the bad-guy and pumps him full of metal. you see the bullets exit his chest as it explodes in a bloody mist, but the good-guy right in front of him doesn't get hurt at all! 4) after having just splattered a human being all over the wall, the two good-guys tell each other some jokes and they laugh and look like teenagers playing with soft-guns.<br /><br />5) sound? at one point the good-guys cut a wire and an alarm goes off (who the hell cuts a wire just to set off an alarm?). the lady screams out "alarm in sector blah blah" and the bad-guy boss says "okay.. this.. is.. not.. a.. drill.. blah blah" in a very, very amateur kinda way. ooh, we're getting ambushed by terrorists, this isn't a drill, but i'm gonna sound like i don't give crap.<br /><br />6) focus!! first you see the bad-guys load up on weapons. for some reason the same guy gets the same uzi twice. deja vu or loop of scenes? you literally see every single bad-guy receive the same kind of weapon and they lock and load the same way. the weapons dealer pops in the clip and the bad-guy extra no. xx locks and loads. when they started opening fire you had to see the barrel flashes. boooring!! 7) actors or dummies? one of the presumed good-guys throw down a smoke grenade for some reason and of course the bad-guys are suddenly inside the smoke because they're smoke-blind or something so they don't see it coming. they cough and moan as if it was anthrax in the grenade. then a semi-boss bad-guy arrives and he doesn't even cough when he enters the smoke, he just pushes the other bad-guys away and they suddenly realize that the smoke isn't anthrax anyway.<br /><br />8) b flick? i think yeah! a guy sliding down a metal pipe wielding a uzi in his right hand shooting away at someone in his eye height apparently. i'd like to see a guy fire a uzi with one hand and i'd like to see him go get his hand afterwards. extra bloody gore mess in a b flick kinda way. small *pops* and a red hole with a torn shirt indicates that this guy is dead. though the first bullet hit his heart the good-guy who is a super trained green berets still feel the urge to empty his clip into the dead guy.<br /><br />9) one of these mentioned trained soldiers jump out from his hide with an empty clip! how stupid can you be!? always check your clip before facing an unknown amount of enemies! 10) boring scenes. like the barrel flash scenes and the lock and load scenes, the movie is filled with time wasting scenes of people running around in an apparently empty building. cut to the action if you're going for a b flick movie, please.<br /><br />my two cents on this movie.
