i gave soul plane the benefit of the doubt and thought there would actually be something of comedic value in it. im not black, but that does not mean i cant appreciate black comedy. i know that because i happen to enjoy watching the wayans bros, good times and other series. <br /><br />i've seen crap movies and im not easily repulsed. as for soul plane, i didn't even bother finishing it. don't know if they managed to land the plane and i couldn't care less. it would be unfair to say i didn't find some parts funny as i did laugh, but i also laugh at youtube videos of skateboarders falling on their nuts so that doesn't say much. the men in the movie were like a bunch of howling horny hyenas in mating season looking to "get some" whenever and where ever possible. and we wonder why all those stereotypes don't seem to disappear. to summarize: soul plane makes the harold and kumar series look like the godfather.
