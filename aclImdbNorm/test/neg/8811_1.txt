there were so many things wrong with this movie i have trouble keeping them all straight. but one thing that really bothers me is that if jigsaw was the one laying on the ground in the bathroom, what happens if zep never shows up? what if zep was killed by danny gloover before he made it to the bathroom? does jigsaw simply just get up and walk out? could the guy in the middle of the bathroom not be jigsaw, but another part of jigsaw's game? what if zep killed the wife and kid, how does jigsaw get him the antidote for the poison if he's lying in the middle of the bathroom? why does the doctor wait till the last minute to finally cut off his foot? it was too late, it was after six and as far as he knew his wife and child were already shot dead, it wasn't the best time for heroics. these are just a few questions i had about the film, but i may be missing something or everything as i have only seen the movie once. please help!
