this was one of the dullest movies i have seen in some time. i'm in my late 40s, and watched it with my son-in-law (early 20s) and son (17). the scenery was beautiful, but the story was a bust. we watched about an hour of it and turned it off. i spent more time on my iphone during the hour that we watched it than i spent actually watching the movie. i gave it a 3 because i enjoyed the scenery and cinematography; otherwise i would have given it a 1. i'm sure there are people who are really into the "art" of it all who will find my review appalling but we're all entitled to our own opinions, right? i couldn't figure out if this was supposed to be a "chick flick" where the focus was on the mother, or if it was supposed to be a movie for guys, with the focus on battle and adventure. in my opinion, it didn't succeed in either.
