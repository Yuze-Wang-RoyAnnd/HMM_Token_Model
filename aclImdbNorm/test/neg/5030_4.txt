as you might not know eca de queiroz is one of portugal's most rightfully celebrated writers. he was witty, he spared no one in his critics and must now be rolling in his tomb. and that's not due to this movie being bad, which it is, but as a result of the treatment dispensed to one of his masterworks "o crime do padre amaro". it's treated like cheap, throwaway trash.<br /><br />when it was publicized that this was to be a "modern and urban" take on the book i feared for the worst, normally modern in these contexts means taking the liberty to take the p**** when doing an adaptation, to half arse it in the shoddiest possible way. and so the moral and social dilemma of a priest having a secret,forbidden affair are substituted by extra-long passages of people dealing drugs and singing hip-hop for no particular or pertinent reason to the plot. it's just there like it might very well not have been.<br /><br />oh and there's lots of sex so you can at least be counting on that when you put this on. remember how every movie in the 80's, no matter the genre or the tone always found a way to sneak in some nudity? if it was a thriller and they had no need for it they simply found a way that when they were capturing a felon he "happened" to be in bed with a woman that would prance around screaming (naked of course) when the cops barged in. ahem, gratuitous is the word i think. not that there's anything wrong with nude scenes but here they make the creators of this movie look desperate simply because there's nothing else to the movie, it's totally devoid of what do you call it dramatic content.
