i rented this tv movie version of 'troilus and cressida' out of my library last thursday, and simply could not believe my eyes. where should i begin? no effort was made to make the play look remotely like it was about the trojan war, all the actors were wearing elizabethan dress. moreover, most of the actors were too old and horribly miscast - aeneas (with his white beard) looked older than nestor, troilus was at least 30, hector looked like a spanish pirate, ajax was badly played anyway and thersites was a transvestite.<br /><br />likewise the action is poor, the duel between ajax and hector is short and amateurish, the camera angle focuses more on nestor's face, so we can only see what is going on in the background which is frustrating in itself. nor is the 'battle' at the end given it's due respect. we do not see troilus and diomedes fight, nor anyone else for that matter, paris and menelaus just seem to mud wrestle in front of thersites. even patroclus death was omitted. all this was a major disappointment considering i waded through a very dull 2 and a half hours of bbc costume drama to get to that point.<br /><br />nonetheless, it wasn't all bad. i thought the incredible orlando as thersites and john shrapnel as hector were well played, even if they didn't look quite right. i'd say the same about kenneth haigh as achilles, since he didn't have the striking countenance and was a bit dry at times. spoiler: the climax at the end - the death of hector - was perhaps the best part of the film, achilles' dialogue here is excellent and sums up the attitude of a cold, seasoned murderer. however, the gruesomeness of the scene (when achilles stamps on what was hector's head)sets it apart anyway.<br /><br />charles gray as pandarus was delightful as a sleazy old pervert and i thought the actress playing cressida did an ok job. the war-mongering troilus, however, was annoying and i think that the play would have been better perhaps if he had been murdered by achilles instead of a peacenik like hector.<br /><br />conclusion? ok, but could have been better if it had had a younger cast and costumes that at least attempted to look ancient grecian, not to mention the lack of action. 5/10
