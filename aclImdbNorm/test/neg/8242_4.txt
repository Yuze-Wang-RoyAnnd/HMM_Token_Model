i have always liked the carry on films, with their double-meaning sexual innuendo dialogue and moments of slapstick comedy, but i can see why the critics give this one two stars. basically, many british people are gathering on a coach to go on a spanish holiday to an island called elsbels to the palace hotel. what they didn't know is that it is not completely built, plus they have to share bathrooms with their neighbours, they have crap draws, and many other complications and complaints that the owner pepe (peter butterworth, putting on quite an amusing accent, e.g. peace sounding like the bad p word). starring sid james as vic flange, kenneth williams as stuart farquhar, charles hawtrey as eustace tuttle, joan sims as cora flange, barbara windsor as sadie tomkins, kenneth connor as stanley blunt, an apparently crap (i personally can't remember who he is) jimmy logan as bert conway, june whitfield as evelyn blunt, hattie jacques as floella (a ridiculous hag character, not as memorable as her usual matron), bernard bresslaw as brother bernard, sally geeson as lily, carol hawkins as marge, jack douglas as harry and patsy rowlands as miss dobbs. i admit it is not great, but there are just enough dialogue gags, and of course babs in the shower, and going to to her bum with that iconic whistle, and later a rapid rip off of her bra. okay!
