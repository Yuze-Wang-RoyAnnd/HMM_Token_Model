36/100. this is not to be confused with the decent arachnophobia, this film is a very low budget and cheap rip-off of that movie. this one is so bad, it actually does have some entertainment value on that level. there are numerous unintended (i think) laugh out loud scenes. i wasn't expecting much from the film, and it was actually worse than i had imagined it would be.<br /><br />it's a clich'e ridden and predictable direct to video mess. fortunately, it doesn't take itself too seriously. the acting, as expected, is not quite oscar caliber. the special effects are poor, worse than i would have thought they would be. poorly edited and the score is intrusive.
