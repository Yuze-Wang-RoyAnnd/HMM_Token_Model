for me this movie was a disappointment. somehow i expected that it would explain the reason for general rommel's popularity and his success as a military strategist in ww ii. but there is none of that, it deals with the last year or two of his life and tries, in a way, to whitewash him. so i just have to suppose that rommel was primarily an amoral and apolitical technocrat in the conquering and killing business, without any particular charm or notoriety in behaviour. such real life people just do not make good movie material. i almost feel sorry for james mason, really one of my favorite actors, who had to impersonate a pretty wooden character. actually, a good director and a lot of great acting talent was wasted on this movie
