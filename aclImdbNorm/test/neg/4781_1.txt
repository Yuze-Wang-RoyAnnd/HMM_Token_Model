this movie was really awful. it was not in the least bit frightening, or even startling. i went to see it with a bunch of friends and by the end of the night we were saying "the ruins ruined my night." <br /><br />i would not recommend seeing this movie in theaters, renting it or even watching the movie on television by accident.it is an absolute waste of an hour and a half. <br /><br />the plot was nearly non-existent, the characters were horribly underdeveloped, and they gave no back story whatsoever for anything that was happening, and then left it completely open at the end as if preparing for a sequel.
