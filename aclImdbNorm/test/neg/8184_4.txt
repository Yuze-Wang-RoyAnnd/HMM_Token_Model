i have barely managed to view the entire film... only after about 85min out of the movie's 110min did the journey to mars begin, and then there were 5min left for the closure. these 85 long minutes were very boring and didn't contribute anything to the film. when finally reaching mars, it wasn't much better plot wise. it all could have been fitted into much shorter running time and nothing would have been missed.<br /><br />what i cannot understand is the piece of trivia saying the because of the film new-born babies were named "aelita"... why would someone want to name his/her baby after a villain, who despite having only one eyebrow, apparently has 3 breasts???<br /><br />the only interesting thing here is the sets and costumes for the mars scenes. they are an interesting experiment in constructivism, just as "the cabinet of dr. caligari" was for expressionism, five years earlier.<br /><br />i give it 4/10 for the great looking design...
