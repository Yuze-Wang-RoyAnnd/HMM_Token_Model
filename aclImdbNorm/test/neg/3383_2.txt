what an absolute joke of a movie. the case for this film would have you believe it is duel meets jeepers creepers meets texas chainsaw massacre. three good films in their own right and you would think, using their blueprint, mm couldn't go far wrong. well that's what i thought, and i was very, very mistaken! <br /><br />we follow two college students as they travel miles across the desert to reach a wedding. they pick up a girl (no she doesn't get her clothes off), then they get chased by a leatherface rip-off in a monster truck, whom they aptly name f**kface (aka monster man).<br /><br />the monster truck i will admit is a very cool vehicle, but the less than suspenseful chase scenes ruin it's potential.<br /><br />so mm decides he's got a bit of a grudge against these guys and chases them for a bit, they loose him for a while and stop at a bar full of amputees, then they go to a motel where lead character adam sleeps with hitch-hiker sarah (though they both wear underwear!). then they are caught by mm, taken to his home where they escape death and try to kill mm, but fail, hence the set-up for the sequel. apart from a minor 'twist', that's it.<br /><br />if you can get past the first 2 minutes
