i happened to catch this on tv, and wanted to watch because i remembered the spin magazine article upon which the movie is based. i was very disappointed. first, if james belushi is the lead actor in a movie, it should be a sign that it's not exactly an a-list production. gregory hines was a world class dancer, but sadly not a great actor.<br /><br />in fact, all of the acting in this film is either flat or hammy, which can only be blamed on the director, who is this film's weakest link. charles carner seemed to be trying to ape oliver stone's "jfk" in portraying the alleged conspiracy to cover up the "real" child murderer(s), but without the benefit of a good script, an a-list cast or, it must be said, the talent. it just doesn't work.<br /><br />it's a shame that such a worthy topic for a film did not get better treatment.
