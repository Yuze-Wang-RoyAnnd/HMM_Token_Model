this is by far one of the most pretentious films i have ever seen. it is a tight slap on the face of some indians who speak in english and were looking at the mirror. disgusting. the bubble gum version of the 1970s politics of the north indian plains. the message - the educated english-speaking indian tried to save the poor beggars of india in all earnestness. it ignores the fact that the poor beggars are also capable of and are saving themselves on their own.<br /><br />as a love story its okay. the problem is that the love story and character development is based upon a completely fraudulent version of politics.
