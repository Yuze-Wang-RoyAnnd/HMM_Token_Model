the is one of the worst spoofs i have ever seen. for one main reason: it isn't funny! i laughed a handful of times. the acting is bad, the script is worse. and why those guys had baby pacfiers in their hair i will never know. and you can tell this didn't have much of a budget to work with and it openly hurts the film. they had a good idea going in some parts but it never really came to past. and what was the point about the lead being older than his dad? 3 out of 10
