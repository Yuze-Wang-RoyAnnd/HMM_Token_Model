do all spoof films require pure stupidity and a lack of any sort of intelligence whatsoever to the humour? is there even just a single genuinely funny parody film anymore? all i see are zero-quality films that look like a couple stoned high school students got bored one day with a video camera. these movies are not funny, they're not clever, they're not entertaining, they're just useless in every conceivable way.<br /><br />the comebacks was a movie that tried to hide its hideous level of trash by not calling itself "sports movie". it's the same thing, though. there are a few different writers for these films, the wayans did some, freidberg and seltzer did some others, and i'm sure there's another pair. i can't even tell the difference in direction or humour to be honest, it all seems like the same people wrote and directed them. i can't tell if the comebacks was done by the people who did scary movie or the guys who did epic movie, or someone else, it's just the same jokes from all the others.<br /><br />if you have any shred of taste or value for humour, don't see this movie. if you have self-worth, don't bother seeing it. if you have any respect for film making, don't even consider watching it. don't see it in any broke down, derelict theatre that may still carry it, don't rent it, don't order it on netflix or pay-per-view, don't redbox it, and don't even watch it for free on od. avoid it like the plague.<br /><br />the only conceivable reasons i can see to watch this film are as follows.<br /><br />a. masochism. if you like torturing yourself, there's very few better ways. b. seeing a prime example of why to avoid anything that says "fox atomic". c. you're being paid considerably high amounts of cash.<br /><br />i really would not watch the entire thing if someone offered me $100 to do it. it's just mindless, mental collapsing torment.<br /><br />you might as well watch zohan.
