lord have mercy! why was this film made? why did seagal and rising star max ryan agree to be in it? the foreigner is so excruciatingly bad in every conceivable way that it boggles the mind.<br /><br />the film has an ultra-cheap look to it. like a budget of a couple of bucks was far out of their reach. what's worse is that the makers know this and try to make it look slick to compensate. the result is a film that just don't look right. the fight scenes are so dull and edited 'discretely' to hide the fact that steven seagal is not in good shape anymore. none of them are engaging or exciting. the plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it. the eastern-europe locations (a sly move by the producers to keep the budget down, or non-existent) look unpleasant and should not be serving as the backdrop for an 'action' film (what action?).<br /><br />and what is the deal with the title? as far as i could tell everyone in the movie was foreign. which one does the title refer to?<br /><br />the dvd is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen and in dolby 5.1 sound. neither are remarkable enough to warrant even a single rent. the foreigner is not worth one second of your time. gotta love that tagline tho! 'if they think they can stop him, they're dead wrong.' sheesh!
