i really thought this would be a good movie, boy...was i mistaken! for a quick summery: b grade acting c grade special effects d grade for the overall movie. don't get me wrong, the story was pretty good and not kiddish so an adult too ride along with it, the "hero" is good looking so most women will like it :-), not a total chick flick as it contains some fight scenes and some blood<br /><br />but the way it is shot... horrible <br /><br />the special effects->would be better suited for tv->on a kids show <br /><br />and lastly...send some of the actors back to acting school if they ever attended a class there.<br /><br />trust me there are much better ways to waste 2 hours.<br /><br />you have been warned.
