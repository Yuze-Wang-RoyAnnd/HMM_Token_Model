a comedy that spoofs the inspirational sports movies, the comebacks tells the story of an out-of-luck coach, lambeau fields, who takes a rag-tag bunch of college misfits and drives them towards the football championships. in the process, this life-long loser discovers that he is a winner after all by redeeming himself, saving his relationship with his family and friends, and finding that there is indeed, no "i" in "team"!<br /><br />i decided to watch the unrated version for this film. it was thirty minutes longer and i though it may be better than the theatrical release, hearing that people hated this movie. after all, thirty minutes of extra footage can add a whole lot to a movie. well, i certainly was wrong. it was as bad as the recent "meet the spartans" but it was thirty minutes more of torture!<br /><br />seriously, who makes a close to two hour spoof movie?! a spoof movie is short because if it goes any longer, it would be overkill! honestly, i love stupid comedies. heck, i liked "date movie," "white chicks," "epic movie," and "little man"! i guess when it comes to spoof movies, it is either a hit or miss and this one definitely missed.<br /><br />on the lighter side, from the many jokes in this film, i will say about six or seven made me laugh, even some that made me laugh out loud. but that's not saying much. following those jokes were more scenes of torture and unfunniness.<br /><br />i can't see how people would say this is not a terrible spoof film. in fact, there is as much product placement in here like meet the spartans, there are as many dance sequences, and unfunny jokes. i will say another thing i like about this movie is the songs. they are some very good songs in here. overall, watch it if you like spoof films. skip it if you like funny films.
