i am sorry to rain on everybody's parade. just a little background about me: i like and know a lot about asian cinema, especially japanese, chinese and indian. admittedly i am a novice when it comes to south-korean cinema but, if this is the best of the best, sorry. i just want you to know that i am not at all narrow-minded when it comes to appreciating foreign movies and i do not fit the stereotype of the "dumb american" . . . well, not perfectly.<br /><br />i cannot believe the high praise this piece of nothing is bestowed upon. this is a disgusting *and* ludicrous movie. hammy acting - everything is badly done and overdone, like begging for the uneducated viewer's attention. horrible camera-work, with an insistence on meaningless close-ups derived from the mtv aesthetics.<br /><br />the plot is more full of holes than a gigantic piece of swiss cheese. nobody expects a thriller to be 100% realistic, and for the sake of entertainment i'd be happy to close my eyes to small unfitting details. but, excuse me, what's happening here that *can* stand even summary scrutiny? this story of an unbelievably intricate and contrite act of revenge is worse than the worst tabloid story one can read in a line at the supermarket. (don't want to spoil your "enjoyment", if that's the word, so won't go into details of the plot.) the fighting scenes are violent, unbelievable, downright stupid (the main "hero" taking on dozens and dozens of opponents in the same time, after he only trained while imprisoned, punching a wall ! ) the truly "outstanding" features of this movie are two: the lurid and incestuous sex (brother on sister and father on daughter, well, we've evolved since oedipus, didn't we?) and the graphic violence. the cut off body parts - hands, teeth, tongues - together with industrial quantities of spilled blood (how many tens of thousands of tomatoes had to die for this movie to be made?) have no esthetical function/motivation whatsoever.<br /><br />a feast for the s & m inclined, admittedly, but, even for those, a feast of no merit nor subtlety. heavens, even mel gibson's recent and much-discussed work on an almost similar theme wasn't that bad.<br /><br />the invariably good press this pretentious, overblown, overlong piece of gratuitous gore coming from korean shores obtains makes me wonder what's happening. i don't think of myself as being the ultimate paragon of taste and often i am ready to accept that a movie i didn't enjoy may be better than i was able to perceive. however, i have no scruples whatsoever in calling this one as i see it: bad, bad, bad. no redeeming qualities. my 2c? find something better to do with your time.
