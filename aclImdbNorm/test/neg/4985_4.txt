jason lee does well to give this doggy movie fleeting promise, but it's not enough to distinguish it from any other bland family comedy<br /><br />this live-action, cg-enhanced adventure sees a shamed police dog (jason lee) transformed into a super-dog via an accident in the lab of scheming scientist dr. simon barsinister (peter dinklage). underdog sets about saving the city while attempting to keep his identity secret - a challenge given that he can both talk and fly.<br /><br />the odd gag raises a smile, but underdog's human sidekicks (james belushi and alex neuberger as father and son) are as dull as the predictable storyline. one for kids too young to have seen superman. or spider-man. or even shaggy dog
