may be i don't get it right. i mean the movie. it does not make me happy or whatever has to do . maybe because of my mood. anyhow this one is a simple family movie with kids for actors. just admit that - all movies of that kind cannot pass the barrier of 4 out of 10 never mind who is playing in the movie(example antonio banderas was playing in that kind of movies... two or three of them cant remember the exact count). i got bored. i almost fall asleep just because the topic is so clich'e and the actor play was so predictable. but i am sure that my kid will love this movie when he grows up... hey im not a monster i found some hilarious or good moments in the movie. the owls in the movie were sooooo cute. the trick with the painted police car windows and the hits that the kid received in the head by a golf ball...
