i simply cannot understand how any who fan, or just plain anyone could find this awful, lazy, poorly written abomination even remotely funny. it is so embarrassingly below par that it qualifies as a genuine tragedy. the potential for this was huge, it could have been great. what a shame that all that acting talent, the sets, the props, the goodwill of everyone involved was so pathetically wasted by a script that should have been burned.<br /><br />there is an obvious lack of any rigorous production and quality control here. like those hammy hollywood movies (mad mad mad world, casino royale) where the stars are just mugging for each other and 'having a great time' which basically means picking up a cheque for doing nothing.<br /><br />i could have written a better who send-up in my sleep. in fact i have, while awake though. i did it in year 10 in high school and performed it with a bunch of classmates. it was better, i look at it now and the gags are funnier. steven moffat you are a no talent bum! what a waste, what a wasted opportunity. makes me want to cry....
