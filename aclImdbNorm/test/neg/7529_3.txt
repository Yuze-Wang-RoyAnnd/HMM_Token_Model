...but i would be lying. a relative was a crew member, and we got to go watch the production of this movie for a couple of days (and i was an extra). i get to die and have a second of screen time, not that i plan on moving to hollywood anytime soon. i just thought it was awesome to see how movies are made and be a part of it. plus, i got a copy of the movie once it was finally released. they didn't have a studio backing when making this film so it truly was independent. why the writing and acting is so awful is beyond me, but the main character "cherry" is the director's sister so that could be part of it. but the cinematography was good. :)
