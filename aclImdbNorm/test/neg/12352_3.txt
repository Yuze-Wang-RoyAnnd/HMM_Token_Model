rabbit fever is one of those film oddities. it's an enjoyable 90 minutes, demands little of the viewer, and delivers as much, and on any terrestrial television channel even in a prime time slot i think that rabbit fever would be rather well received. which makes me wonder why it has been pushed into cinemas.<br /><br />the movie is filmed in the style of a television documentary, and introduces us to 6 women who have am addictive relationship with the rabbit vibrator. the film is primarily focused on investigating a supposed addictive quality to the famous sex aid product. the narrative is 100% tongue in cheek throughout.<br /><br />the storyline is strong, an introduction to some well rounded and likable characters, some enjoyable back-story, peripheral characters and situations develops into an engaging story, and pleasing conclusions. sadly there's nothing that feels clever or new. <br /><br />rabbit fever has some sharp moments, a few switches that hint at what the writers are capable of, and all credit to them it's not just 90 minutes of knob gags and innuendo, i could probably watch it with my mother. but there's a laziness about some of the scenes that holds it back, those moments went you are up for it, when you want it to be outrageous, and all you get is a dollop of sit-com.<br /><br />i chuckled, i left the theatre feeling empathy for the characters, but i also left with the bitter thought that someone had taken a 90 minute reel of made for tv, light entertainment and tried to put it into national cinema. <br /><br />i think rabbit fever achieves some of what it set out to do, it's a quirky subject, a rounded storyline, a well presented cast and a good diversion for 90 minutes. but there's nothing in this that can justify the extravagance of a movie theatre environment. quite the opposite - a few commercial breaks would have given the viewer chance to grab a breath of life that rabbit fever seems to lack.
