. . . and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice, bouncy jugs running around the so called african jungle. so no problems there for most males out there.<br /><br />i watched it as one of those bundled together package. forget about the plot which is essentially just a flimsy storyline to get our heroine flashing her jugs on screen at every opportunity possible. just to give you a sense, our heroine swings from vine to vine and climb on top animals at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her jugs at all angles. again, no complaints.<br /><br />the "fight scenes" are laughable and borderline on the pornographic. our heroine got caught by the baddies at least five times in the movie. on occasions when she has to fight, the "fighting" involves rolling around in the dirt, grunting unconvincingly and basically fighting like kittens. i am surprised no hair pulling is involved. it get so bad that the chief baddie had to remind the "combatants" that "i said, the one that draw first blood wins!" in order to avoid watching anymore stupid fighting.<br /><br />the witch doctor kuku was a bloody blast. from being a big, cuddly bear in the beginning, he became manic depressive when captured and then, outright psycho. he spent the whole movie muttering lines with no irrelevance.<br /><br />beside liana (our heroine)bouncing around topless, you also get to see plenty of other amazonians as well as one woman who decided to jump naked into the lake to take a swim for no good reasons. yeah, it is that kind of movie.<br /><br />watch the beautiful liane in her bouncy glory. despite the movie being more than 20 years old, the allure of watching blond women flashing their nice jugs on screen never gets old.
