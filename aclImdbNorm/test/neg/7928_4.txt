for a movie that was the most seen in its native south korea for most of 2004, it was a huge disappointment. shows that hollywood is not the only place where people can make over-emotional, melodramatic movies. the film was over 130 minutes long but not a lot actually happened and everything that happened was pretty much what one expected, the plot was that transparent. granted if one himself was korean, one would perhaps get into it more, but for me it didn't do much anything. suffice to say that as the case tends to be with korean cinema, the plot revolves around the relationship between the northern and southern parts of the peninsula. south korea decides to recruit and train an elite assassination squad from death-sentence prisoners to kill kim il-sung.<br /><br />a tedious plot doesn't bother me much if the characters are good but unfortunately that is not the case this time around either. they are stereotypes and most of the acting is mediocre and too often just over the top as it tends to be in korean cinema. too much time is spent on the numerous montages and the characters remain distant, one dimensional cardboard cuts. they should've spent more time establishing the characters and less showing us how tough and cruel the training and the soldiers are.<br /><br />one thing it does remind us of, is that a lesser of two wrongs is still wrong.
