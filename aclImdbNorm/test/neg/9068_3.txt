don't worry - no spoilers here, just saying there is a very predictable plot. a couple decide to live in his father's love nest so they can write a book/article/newsletter on his fling with a famous tragic hollywood starlet. this whole production ran kind of like a high school troupe doing an episode of "murder she wrote". the only acting i was sold on was the old fogy's they interviewed for sources in the story. apparently the directors thought the movie was getting too long, so towards the end they stopped pointing their camera to a kind of creepy image of the starlet and brought in plot enhancers to wrap this thing up. don't waste your time - even the tried and true horror/intrigue classics fail in this movie.
