this movie is widely admonished as being a copy of the will smith feature hitch. that movie was dull.<br /><br />this movie isn't so much dull as unbearable. govinda looks way past his prime. he is not at his best doing roles like this. it is similarly unconvincing as his performance in deewana mastana.<br /><br />salman khan is at his eye-aching "best". and that's in the few scenes where he remembers to put clothes on. it could only have been through nepotism that this eye-sore's scenes could be saved from the trash bin of any movie's cutting floor.<br /><br />another case of bollywood embarrassing itself with it's shameless cloning. another case of the bollywood audience majority embarrassing themselves by making this a hit.
