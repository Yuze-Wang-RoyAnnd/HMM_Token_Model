this one isn't even lively enough to be fun. something is out there, ripping people off (off-screen) after a spaceship crash (off-screen) while government executives investigates (off-screen) and bad actors says stupid lines (on-screen), including a guy who looks like jim carrey with a hangover. the "monster", when it finally is shown, looks like an extra from "robot monster", but there ain't enough monster fu anyway.<br /><br />fortunately, it's pretty short. skip it, unless you want to get bored out of your skull by this
