before i speak my piece, i would like to make a few things clear: 1)i am a chick who's not into chick flicks ("kate&leopold" and "someone like you" are extreme exceptions- hugh jackman's ass). 2)i only picked this one up because i am a fichtner fangirl who looked forward to see him in a bathtub. 3)i am not a demi fan, though i think her performances in "immortal" and "a few good men" were sublime and have earned places in my vid library- also i think she's a little crazy (no way is she not still sleeping w/brucie).<br /><br />if this is a character study of an unfulfilled woman living dual lives of independence and happiness, then i'd say we have one narcoleptic melodrama. marty: literary agent. makes 6-figure salary. lives in an upscale manhattan penthouse. easy for her to read several hundred manuscripts and fall asleep at her desk for some highly suggested nocturnal escapism. or perhaps stepping through an interdiemsional portal? she has the career, the looks, a cool car, a great pad, now where are the man and kids? in steps our boy aaron- some real escapism. what are architects? they're artists who can do math, dreamers that make real money. aaron gives marty the dream of security and fills a void where she, obviously has no self confidence.<br /><br />on the other side of the coin, there's marie, still living out her schoolgirl fantasies while she muddles through motherhood. her children are her career and life. but what about marie, does she only exist through her children? in waltzes william, a parisian stranger who helps her focus on the one thing she has lost touch with: herself.<br /><br />a supposed journey of self-discovery and late a coming of age thrown in some with angst and some resentment to marty/marie's own mother. this gets a 3/10. all i could say is thank god for the bpl multimedia division, i wouldn't waste my $2.99 at blockbuster on this, put it toward a harlequin blaze title.
