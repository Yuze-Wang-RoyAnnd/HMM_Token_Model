what i hate most in this garbage is the arrogant attitude of the film makers and network execs who foist this nonsense on the public because they really think the audience is so stupid, so undeserving, so tasteless as to deserve these kind of cons. there is an inherent entertainment is seeing disaster movies and with the magic of today's cgi effects artists are given powerful tools to explore what before was denied them. with that allure we sat down to watch some mayhem and destruction. well, guess what, the only mayhem we saw was in the ads touting next wednesday's episode. what a let down! but wait, there was even a bigger one. the script itself was the bigger disaster! and then there was the direction and the flaccid acting by everyone involved in this turkey. but we knew this before right?! we knew that effects alone do not an entertainment make, but yet the network bozos who okayed this tv movie didn't care about that because in their mantra is the everlasting line "never underestimate how stupid the audience are". these guys must actually live by this motto, and i am so fed up of it. no wonder the audience has abandoned us drama in droves and pitched their camp in reality shows. at least in those programs no one is trying to make it look like anything different from what it is: intellectual pornography. well, category 6 is worse than that because it assumes to be different and "original". yes this was a disaster movie alright but the disasters are not what they advertised!
