1st watched 1/1/2003 - 3 out of 10(dir-henri verneuil): sober drama about a well-to-do doctor who gets into trouble carrying on a relationship with a younger woman, whom his family brings in to live with them, as well as being married to another in the same household. his searching for happiness is not clear, but they do bring out the reason for his unhappiness rather well by displaying the overbearing trait of the females in his wife's line. well played, but predictable drama.
