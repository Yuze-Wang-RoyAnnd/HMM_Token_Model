clint howard, brother of more talented ron, stars in this abysmally awful horror comedy about a mental case who serves ice cream to children and kills people. striving to be a movie that's of the 'so bad that it's good' variety, this film misses that mark by a good mile and instead has to be seen as 'so bad that it's...well...bad'. wheter it's the constant 'shoe ad' cinema, the pillow stuffed 'fat kid', or the sleep inducing 'horror' that soured me on the film, i don't know, all i know is i loathed the film (and this from a guy who has a soft spot for b-horror films). paul norman choose to continue making films in the porn industry both before and after this, his only 'mainstream' film. a wise choice indeed as horrible acting, nonsense storyline, and ludicrous dialog are much much more palatable while seeing a porn starlet do her thing. funnily enough this turkey has absolutely no nudity (another reason to steer clear) <br /><br />my grade: d-
