making a film for under 1 million might be a triumph for a line producer or an accountant but doesn't do anything for the audience. the balance sheet might have been pretty but the viewing experience was poor.<br /><br />what will be a triumph for irish cinema is when people realise that production values and the script can't be sacrificed.<br /><br />i don't understand why people expend the energy it takes to put a film together when the production quality is worse than a low grade tv show.<br /><br />the deficiencies of the plot have been mentioned in another review on this site and i totally agree with what was written. what i would add is that the film skimmed the surface of several genres without ever settling in one of them. the film would have benefited from either going the direction of a straight out comedy or social/political commentary.<br /><br />my overall impression was that the film was rushed, thematically under developed and visually not up to standard. on a positive note the performances and music were very good.
