the ruins is to turistas as deep impact was to armageddon, a worse version of a mildly entertaining movie, except much much worse. one of the characters is supposed to be going to medical school, so why are they all retards? "you can't keep cutting." -best line form this movie. this is an awful movie. i like horror movies, but fully appreciate that most of them are terrible, but had a bit of high hopes for this movie after seeing the reviews on imdb. the situation they are in is stupid and how they handle it makes them stupid. it is awful, the one thing that makes it somewhat palatable is its cool australian backdrop, despite the fact that they spend the vast majority of the movie in one place.
