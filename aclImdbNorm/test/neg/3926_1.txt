the performances rate better than the rating i've given this work, simply because i will not support a movie which shows any child or mentally challenged person how to obtain, cook, and inject narcotics into their bodies.<br /><br />this is a disgusting film, which serves no purpose in the world, but to glamorize and attempt to legitimize the narcotic lifestyle. it bears convincing performances, which add to my disgust. what were these people thinking?! i could not enjoy a movie such as this. it's enough to make someone who has never done drugs, think about it, and those who have and have redeemed themselves, consider reversion. i'm surprised it doesn't make every clean junkie who sees it, fall off the wagon.<br /><br />there's nothing good about this "movie," which stands more as a how to get strung out docu-drama. this is the epitome of what's wrong with hollywood.<br /><br />utterly disgusting.<br /><br />it rates a 1.3/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
