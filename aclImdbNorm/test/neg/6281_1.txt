i felt like i was watching an example of how not to make a movie. i think the director filmed it in his back yard! there was no real plot. <br /><br />terrible script.<br /><br />terrible acting.<br /><br />the worst production i have ever witnessed. a couple of bad cg effects and then the rest of the movies was spent walking around in what looked like a junk yard.<br /><br />i don't normally write reviews to movies but was moved to warn everyone about this one.<br /><br />life is to short to waste your time with this movie!
