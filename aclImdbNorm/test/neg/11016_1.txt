i'm glad i didn't pay to see 'the wog boy'.<br /><br />i sat there hopefully waiting for something original and/or funny to happen.<br /><br />it reminded me very much of those predictable english comedies of the 1970s.<br /><br />i won't bother with a synopsis of the plot, i suggest you do something else for 90 minutes<br /><br />
