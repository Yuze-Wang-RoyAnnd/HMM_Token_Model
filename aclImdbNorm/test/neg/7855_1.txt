i came across this film by accident and wish i hadn't.<br /><br />why make a sexually rude sequel (and some gore when a man is beheaded) of a well know children's movie.<br /><br />do not take young kids to see this the title misdirects you, it has nothing to do with the original snow white except for stealing it's characters. better still don't bother going yourself, it's not worth it.<br /><br />i could not watch it all, the poor (in comparison to disney) cartoon graphics, and no plot except on how to totally mess up a classic movie made me want to give up and leave.
