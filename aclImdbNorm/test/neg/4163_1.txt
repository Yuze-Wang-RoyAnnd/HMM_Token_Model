i just finished watching this film and think it is one of the worst films i have ever seen. it was so boring that i found myself zooming through it at x2 speed and finished it in less than 30 minutes. i was not just disappointed, but angry that i had wasted my money to rent it. it ranks within the top five of the worst films i have ever seen, and i've seen thousands of movies! the plot was very confusing. had i not first read the dvd sleeve cover, prior to renting it, i would have been totally lost throughout this film. i would not have thought that tim robbins, after having made such good films as "shawshank redemption" would have agreed to appear in this film.
