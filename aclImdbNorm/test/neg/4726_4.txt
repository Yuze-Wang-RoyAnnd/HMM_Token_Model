this is another notorious mexican horror film: however, while the original spanish-language version is quite tame, all sorts of gore and nudity were inserted for the english-dubbed variant (prepared by jerald intrator - who did similar duties on the curious dr. humpp [1967/71] - and, like the u.s. version of that film, had previously been available on dvd through something weird/image)! <br /><br />i watched the original first and, while no great shakes, it was fairly engaging - especially with a plot as familiar as this one was: a doctor goes beyond the call of duty in attempting to save the life of his terminally ill son; he even has a hulking, game-legged assistant (played by carlos lopez moctezuma, who had essayed a strikingly similar role - though in a more sinister vein - in the curse of the crying woman [1961]). i know that several mexican films mingled horror with the "lucha libre" (wrestling) genre but i had never watched one myself; this element is present here - in fact, the heroine is a wrestler - but the two styles are, perhaps thankfully, kept apart (that said, the wrestling sequences are competently done, with some of the moves proving highly amusing).<br /><br />the doctor's son is transformed into a monster (looking like the incredible hulk with mud splashed over his face!) after having had an ape's heart transplanted into him - but, then, when this is replaced with that of a comatose female wrestler, he stays this way and grows a pair of fangs to boot (shouldn't he realistically have turned into a transsexual...though i guess that wouldn't have been very interesting)!! the climactic rooftop sequence in which the monster kidnaps a child and meets his demise at the hands of the police is reminiscent of the ghost of frankenstein (1942). my favorite unintentionally funny moments in the film, however, occur when the doctor, trying to comfort his son, tells him that he'll soon be cured - only to turn his back soon after on the verge of tears - and also the impatient look he gives his crippled assistant (as the latter staggers slowly into the car) when they're about to chase the monster who has escaped from the lab.<br /><br />the alternate nude scenes work for the film (these were actually done by cardona himself for a racier mexican version entitled horror y sexo) but its reputation is largely based on the added material showing over-the-top violence, such as an eyeball being gouged out of its socket, a scalping and even a person's head being torn off. there are also several graphic operation inserts which, however, give rise to a goof: while it's made clear that only two people are involved in the operation, we see a third pair of hands constantly holding an oxygen mask to the patient's face! <br /><br />the film is also said to be a loose remake of cardona's own black-and-white horror film doctor of doom (1962) but, since i haven't watched that one, i can't say how much of it was actually pilfered for night of the bloody apes...
