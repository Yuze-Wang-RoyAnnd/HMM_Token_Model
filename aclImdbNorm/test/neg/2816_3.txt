while i was watching this movie i never thought i'd be defending it. it's honest enough from the begininning about not having much of a plot. there's no real characters to latch onto except the killer. some of the acting can be better, but most of it is capable.<br /><br />i know, a three out of ten isn't stellar, but there are reviews saying it was shot poorly and completely useless, etc. i think it set out to do what it's supposed to fairly well. the lighting is minimal at times, more natural than most audiences are used to, but it's supposed top look like a camcorder snuff film. in fact, at times the quality is probably still too high to be true to that, but nobody would make it through tne minutes of camera work that's truly that bad.<br /><br />it's not particularly scary, but it is disturbing at times. there are one or two characters who don't come across as believable at all and the soundtrack does get tiring at times, but overall it was put together cleaner than a lot of camcorder movies.
