"tamara" just felt like another teen oriented knock-off of the "i know what you did last summer" trend and is painfully dull. a high school outcast, who is heavily into witchcraft and black magic, is accidentally killed during a cruel prank carried out by a group of bullies who secretly bury her in the woods, vowing to tell no one. the next day, the supposedly "dead" tamara, arrives at school with a completely new image and seduces her would-be killers and has a little revenge... this is basically a combination of "carrie", "the craft", and every other straight-to-video, teeny bopper turkey that hits the shelves these days. the actors are absolutely atrocious and look about ten years too old to pass off as high schoolers. there is some gore, which is actually nothing all that interesting since the movie is so boring and i couldn't wait for it to end. if you like modern garbage than i insist you seek this one out, otherwise don't bother...
