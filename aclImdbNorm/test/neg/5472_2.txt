peter cushing and donald pleasance are legendary actors, and director kostas karagiannis was the man behind the successful greek giallo-esquire thriller death kiss in 1974; and yet when you combine the three talents, all you get is this complete load of drivel! god only knows what drove the likes of peter cushing and donald pleasance to star in this cheapie devil worship flick, but i really do hope they were well paid as neither one deserves something as amateurish as this on their resumes. the story focuses on a group of devil worshippers that kidnap some kids, leading another group to go after them. the pace of the plot is very slow and this ensures that the film is very boring. the plot is also a long way from being original and anyone with even a passing interest in the horror genre will have seen something a bit like this, and no doubt done much better. the obvious lack of budget is felt throughout and the film doesn't manage to overcome this at any point. this really is a depressing and miserable watch and not even a slightly decent ending manages to up the ante enough to lift this film out of the very bottom of the barrel. extremely poor stuff and definitely not recommended!
