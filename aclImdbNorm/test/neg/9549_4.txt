the storyline has too many flaws and illogical sequences to be worthwhile. jolie's acting is pretty flat and poor, washington's is ok, the rest of the cast are cardboard cutouts. somehow almost everything about this film oozes mediocrity. the plot is lame. the only thing i liked more or less about this film are the fairly original methods the perpetrator uses to end his victims. technical details are worse than the most far-stretched csi 'knowledge' and gizmos and halfway the movie one wonders if the director even cared about detail credibility. (some spoilers hereafter!) i mean, an ekg machine with a pure sinus wave reflecting a man's heartbeat, a quadriplegic with full body muscle spasms and one working index finger, sure. a killer gutting a man's bowels whilst keeping him alive to allow the rats to feast on him followed by a rat aiming for the guy's face! what's with all that stupidity? then there are quite a few continuity goofs, but you can find those elsewhere here on imdb honestly i found it a bit of an insult even to my limited intelligence.<br /><br />waste of time. still 4 out of 10 to keep my girlfriend from kicking me.
