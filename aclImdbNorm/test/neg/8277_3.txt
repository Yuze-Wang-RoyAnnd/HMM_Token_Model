this movie was sheer, slow, plodding torture. not being a fan of slasher films, and preferring classic horror, i may not be the best judge. slasher fans may enjoy this as an early entry into the slasher genre. i really would like the 90 minutes i spent watching this back. the only reasons to watch this are 1) a young vanna white (pre wheel of fortune) who has about 3 minutes of total screen time. 2) an early role by scream queen linnea quigley (with nudity), and legendary beauty ej peaker as the school secretary, who added a bit of humor and sex appeal. otherwise, an 80's band called felony makes an appearance, which while interesting, drags on way too long. just like the movie.....i had to keep checking how much time was left and couldn't wait to "graduate" to a better film.
