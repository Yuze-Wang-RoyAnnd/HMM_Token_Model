... when we all know, no one does it like the bbc.<br /><br />being an avid fan of this sort of sunday night watching, i was quite looking forward to this. how disappointed was i! in the first thirty seconds i didn't think it was looking promising and after two minutes i was finding it hard to watch.<br /><br />however me and my friends persisted only to find bad acting and a complete misunderstanding of half of the characters. the plot was hurried to the extreme and the make up and costumes gaudy and very 21st century in a 'bbc robin hood' style. this modern style may have been able to be placed within sharp camera angles and visually sumptuous cinematography but unfortunately we got neither. the direction felt decidedly sloppy for both acting and shot choice.<br /><br />after 30 mins we couldn't bare to watch it and went out and rented 'the prestige'(which is very good btw) maybe it is unfair that i judge this as i have watched so little of this, but rarely have i felt so compelled to warn people not to watch something! however, me and my friends did think that the house and parasols were pretty- but thats as good as it gets.
