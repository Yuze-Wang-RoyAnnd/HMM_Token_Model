this movie is somehow showing 6.2 stars, it seems inconceivable that the director has that many relations. i am at a loss to explain this.<br /><br />avoid this movie at all costs. you have only a certain number of hours on the earth, don't waste 1&1/2 of them on this retarded steaming heap of guano!!!<br /><br />there is no story as apparently the director "wrote" (and i'm guessing with a blunt orange crayon) the next day's script at the completion of the day's shooting. the "story" has been called whimsical, no it is aimless, there is maybe enough "story" to fill a commercial. don't you hate ads?<br /><br />now while both leads can act they obviously decided not to here. and similarly the writer/director can actually both write and direct as evidenced by his next work "toy love" <br /><br />so to recap, even if you get this movie for free, even if you're paid to watch it avoid it.<br /><br />to paraphrase monty python's search for the holy grail, "run flee!"
