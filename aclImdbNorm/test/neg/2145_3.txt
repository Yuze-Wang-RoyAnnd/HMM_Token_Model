his significant charisma and commanding presence are about all that keep this afloat, but fred williamson has done far better urban action films including many of his later, vid-released fare. the big studios' williamson films of the early-to-mid 70's rarely had the punch of their mid-level counterparts, and this is a prime example. clumsy action, little violence, and the pg rating is nowhere near questionable. worth a look for hammer completists in any case.
