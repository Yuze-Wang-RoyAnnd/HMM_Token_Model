imagine the most cliche ridden b-movie horror plot you can. add more plot holes than plot. have it scripted by a 10 year old. have the acting done by a-level drama students faking really bad us accents (in the isle of man!) add monster special effects that the lovers of b&w dr who shows will appreciate. result: duff film. throw in samantha janus taking her clothes off (make a point of this on the cover) and you'll probably sell enough copies to make a profit anyway!
