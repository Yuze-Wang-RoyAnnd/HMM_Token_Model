i have seen most of john waters' films. with the exception of several of his very early ones which are not available, i have actually seen just about all of them, so it's obvious i am a big fan and it's certain that i have a high tolerance for the gross and irreverent in his films. while way over the top and disgusting, i adored female trouble and polyester--two monumental tributes to bad taste and excess that are seriously funny films. so i am certainly not squeamish and can take most of what waters has to offer. however, in pink flamingos he has created a film so repellent, so unfunny and so offensive that i couldn't even stand it. in his other films he made before he became more mainstream, they were funny. yet here, the humor just isn't there as it seems the intent is to shock the viewers and not entertain them in any way. i am glad that after making this film, waters' sense of humor improved, as divine consuming dog feces (as in this film) is shocking but not the least bit entertaining. my advice is to skip this film and just pretend it never happened and then watch his infinitely better films of the 70s and 80s.
