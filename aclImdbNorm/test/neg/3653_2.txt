i had looked forward to viewing this movie, it seemed anyone who had seen it loved it. i was completely disappointed. the acting was so overdone. the script seemed like the writer had gathered 25 different scripts from various movies and randomly chose dialogue and pieced them together to form one plagarized script.<br /><br />spoilers: was any cliche omitted in this movie? there was a mobstyle hit, homosexuality, prostitution, a serial killer, a fire, numerous godfather wannabees, the main character in love with the prostitute, cross dressing, torture by the police, hannibal lechter style mutilations, i could go on and on.<br /><br />line's like (the godfather wannabe to the prostitute)<br /><br />-"ben senin arik calismani istemiyorum" (i don't want u to work anymore)<br /><br />-"ben calismasam kirayi kim odeyecek?" (who would pay the rent if i didn't work)<br /><br />unrealistic scenes: we never saw a single policeman during the serial killer scenes, yet when the main character disappeared his father was taken in by the police and tortured for weeks.<br /><br />the only way i can make sense out of this whole movie, is if the version i had scene was severely edited from the original. i definitely do not recommend it, and would greatly enjoy discussing it further with anyone who would care to do so.<br /><br />
