very dull show. whats worse, its very racist. the white guys are dumb idiots and the only romance is between a black guy and a white woman. there is nothing interesting about this romance, it is not exciting, it is not fun, they don't even seem to care for each other at all, its more like the writers and directors wanted an interracial thing going on. why this is so popular in media today? it is social programming and will lead to no good, there is always tension when too many people want the same thing. this show is not worth the 20 bucks for the season, its a waste of time and harmful to society. at least when they use tv shows to sell products they are more discreet, selling whatever agenda here is quite obvious, and without clear thinking some may feel wrong to oppose it, but some of us know better.
