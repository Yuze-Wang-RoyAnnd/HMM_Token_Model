this movie is sad. according to my fellow imdb users, (*spoiler*) raptor uses stock footage from the carnotaur films. well, since i have not seen the carnotaur movies, i cannot say. but, i do notice some pretty bad editing and even worse acting. this movie is one big steaming pile of s***. it makes absolutely no sense. here is this thing that calls itself a plot: mad scientist re-creates raptors. raptors kill people. sheriff investigates. *spoiler* (although i don't know what it is that i'm spoiling) sheriff catches on to mad doctor's plans. army guys are sent in and raptors start killing army guys. raptors. yeah, right. i could make a clay figure that looks more real. the fx are the cheapest ever used in a movie. there is a lot of gore. cheap gore. it doesn't even look real. i will agree with another person who rated this movie that the only thing this movie has going for it is the fact that it ends. there are about two seconds of originality in this film. and that only comes from when the sheriff is talking to some tax agent on the phone about his electric bill or something. this idea has been used in about 100,000 other movies with 100,000 different names. overall, i'm gonna give raptor 1/5 just because it ended.
