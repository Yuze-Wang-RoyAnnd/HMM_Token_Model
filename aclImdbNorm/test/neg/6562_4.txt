that's the only word i can think of to describe this movie. not waste as in a waste of time (any time spent with these characters is never wasted), but waste as in a waste of opportunities.<br /><br />when i see this movie, i think of all the star trek novels that were written which would have made a much better film than the story shatner chose. the setup was like an average television episode, while the finish felt like the climax (if you can call it that) of the first movie.<br /><br />nimoy, in directing ii-iv, focused on the character of spock--how he faced the kobayashi maru outside of the classroom, and how he handled his emotional live now that he had a chance to start fresh. shatner could have done the same with kirk here, but he didn't. we don't know much about kirk that we didn't know before. again, one of the novels would have been better--try "my enemy, my ally" for a very interesting character study of our friend james t. the minor characters are used mostly for cute bits, and the scotty-uhura subplot seems way out of left field, particularly since the subtext in the original series was sulu-uhura.<br /><br />even hardcore fans can't find much to enjoy here. sorry, but it's true.
