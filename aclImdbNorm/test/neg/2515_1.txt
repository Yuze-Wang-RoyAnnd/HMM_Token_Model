how dare you? adam low, without apparent shame, puts his name to this fake tribute. it's not even a serious study or analysis or commentary of the great visconti's work. yes it's long and portentous, yes we do have some wonderful clips from the films that, most people interested on the subject, have already seen. but what resounds the longest leaving the most lasting impression is the gossip. the last and loudest voice comes from a third rate german actor, ranting and raving. the appropriately named mr.low directed this, hoping, i imagine, to get better ratings than his previous, more to the point, but deadly boring documentary on kurosawa. well i have news for you mr low and your cohorts. you missed a great opportunity and i for one, won't give you another.
