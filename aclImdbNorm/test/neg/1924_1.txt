*** this comment may contain spoilers *** warning: this does contain spoilers i have seen some pretty lame films in my day. and that only stands to reason seeing as i see about 80 films a year. i would have to say that out of those 80 films i see at the theater, maybe 5 are really really good, 15 or 20 are not that great, 40 or 50 are okay and then maybe 5 or 10 are absolutely terrible. here on earth falls into a category unto itself. this is one of the most predictable, vehement, despicable films i have ever seen. it is loaded with unlikable characters, maudlin situations about after-school-special kinds of topics and enough fluff in here to make the young and the restless look like american beauty. and i am not being unfair. this is an awful film.<br /><br />this is the story of a rich guy, a poor girl, a poor guy and a small town that makes fresh cookies every day for all of it's town folk. are you getting warm and fuzzy yet? let me continue. one day, the rich snot comes waltzing into town with his new graduation present that his dad has bought for him and he insults the pretty girl at the diner, almost gets in a fight with her long time boyfriend and then races him and destroys the little diner that she works at. so he is sentenced to a summer in the small town where he and the boyfriend have to fix the diner together. what this does is gives us plenty of opportunity to see chris klein with no shirt on so we can understand why the girl at the diner would fall for him. he has abs!!! oh and he is rich!!! and.... he is the biggest jerk with no respect for anyone. he is james dean, he is a rebel that doesn't give a damn!! he is rude to everyone in town, he doesn't want to associate with anyone that is trying to be nice to him and he acts like a spoiled rich brat. but leelee sobieski still falls for him. there is no reason given as to why she does, she just does. oh, pardon me, that's right i forgot to mention that he likes the same poet that she does. well if that doesn't get you wet then i don't know what will.<br /><br />here on earth also has some of the most predictable moments i've ever been privy to in film. there was one point when i left the theater to get some popcorn and read the graffiti on the wall of the bathroom and i told my fianc'ee exactly what was going to happen in the next ten minutes. upon my return she just laughed and said i was right, even when i said that there was going to be a dancing scene. and furthermore, the disease that she suddenly contracts is cancer. this is the most beautiful cancer patient i have ever seen. have you ever watched a cancer patient die slowly? they lose weight, they lose their hair, their gums begin to rot. it is not a pretty picture. sobieski glows after she contracts cancer, like she is pregnant. what an insult to people that have watched love ones die slowly from this disease. and how do you contract knee cancer from falling down in the field?<br /><br />now i realize i have seen way too many movies and this causes my cynicism to run rampant at times, but this is ridiculous. there wasn't one thing to like about this film or the chris klein character. he is a jerk, he is obnoxious and he never once tries to make peace with anyone around him. here on earth is not only a bad film, it is an irresponsible one. this received a 4.2 on the imdb voting chart, and that is way too high. this is an embarrassment to screen writing and whoever gave the green light to this being made should not only lose their job, but he or she should have to promise never to step foot near a script again.<br /><br />0 out of 10, and that is being generous. this film should be shown at film schools as how not to write and direct a film.<br /><br />if you are bored and really need something to do and your choices are cleaning a farm full of cow manure or watching this film, choose cleaning the cow manure. it'll smell better and you'll feel like you've done something good with your two hours.
