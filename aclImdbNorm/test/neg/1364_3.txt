being a big fan of horror films and always manage to find something good about a picture, but this film just did not hold my interest or attention. this story revolves around a father and his daughter and a girlfriend, since his wife died a few years back. these people encounter a horrible situation in a town they stop off and visit and all the senior citizens in this town gang up against these people and almost kill them. this film reminded me of a film called "children of the corn" because it really involves children who are being presented to satan and are his instruments of terror. there is plenty of chants, mambo jumble and a toy tank that completely destroys an entire family in their station wagon as well as dolls who kill a husband and wife.
