why is it that canada can turn out decent to good movies in every genre, other then action? i caught dragon hunt on tv the other day and it was like a train wreck. i just could not change the channel, it's sheer stupidity sapped my willpower. its pretty telling that the cast imdb "credits" with this monstrosity apparently never worked again.<br /><br />bad acting, bad writing, bad narration, bad music, bad hair, bad cinematography. it just goes on and on. the movie really has nothing to recommend it. if you're looking for bad action films to enjoy by laughing out, there are a tonne of other films that won't require you to scorch out your retinas afterwards.<br /><br />i hope this film didn't get money from the government for financing, otherwise i'm never paying taxes again.
