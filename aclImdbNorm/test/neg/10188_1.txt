this movie was a major bait and switch. i rented it because of rebecca st. james, a popular christian singer. i have met her and wondered what she would be doing in a ufo movie. well.......<br /><br />i think that she starred in this movie to help out a friend, or a friend of a friend. my first clue that this movie wasn't what it was supposed to be was when i witnessed the special effects of the ufo encounters. cheesy! as the movie progressed, i noticed how plastic the actors were. it was funny how almost everyone in the movie wore solid colors. (there are a few exceptions).<br /><br />rebecca was verrryyy disappointing. she is always found in the house and doesn't show the realistic facial expressions of one whose husband has return to the fold. doesn't she ever leave the house? <br /><br />i had to turn off the movie several times in order to finish it. i hope that rebecca doesn't believe the message of this movie - believe in what we believe or suffer and go to hell. jesus spread a message of love and hope. his message inspired others to change out of love, not fear.
