i watched this film with a bunch of friends at a halloween party last night. i got to say that the sarcastic comments were never ending and i have to say that they were well deserved. though i felt that the directing was done well, the craziness in their dialogue is just a little too much cheese. i think i got about an hour into this before i even started to realize what it was the point was that they were trying to drive home. you catch on pretty quick that this whole family is pretty quirky and something is off about them, it's just a little too slow. this movie could easily have been about 45 minutes and been a lot better. the only thing that made it bearable was the two bottles of wine that i downed during the course of the flick. bring on the slasher films folks, because at least i know what to expect out of them. this was not my thing, too much dark humour, and the subject material of cannibalism was a bit explicit and gross. i have to say that randy quaid played the part as well as it could have been, and i will give him props for that as i normally see him as a drunken goofball or a washed out fighter pilot who likes to kill aliens.<br /><br />in conclusion i give this horror/comedy film a very generous 3 out of 10.
