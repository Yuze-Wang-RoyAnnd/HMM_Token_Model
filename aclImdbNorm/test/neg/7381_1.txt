i rented this movie because the dvd cover made it look like it was going to be a ridiculous college comedy like van wilder or animal house. i took it to my friend house to watch for movie night. we ended up stopping it 15 minutes into the film, and watched copper mountain instead. i don't know if any of you have seen copper mountain, but it isn't great either. however, i would have to say that the alan thick jim carrey duo made it a more enjoyable watch.<br /><br />i later finished puddle cruiser. this movie was slow and the humor was forced. this movie reminded me of some stinkers that i saw in some of my earlier production classes in college. i was left wondering "was this the film that enabled broken lizard to make supertroopers?" also how could this movie suck so bad? supertroopers was good and club dread was decent. don't see this movie!
