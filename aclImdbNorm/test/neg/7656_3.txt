this film isn't a little bad. it's not even kind of bad. it's horrid. you know you're in trouble when charo shows up in a film. she must have had the week off from "love boat." george kennedy, at least he's a gamer - he's in there trying. actually, he's all right. and it's good to see martha raye. jimmie walker's okay. there's slightly better acting than in airport '75 but what film doesn't have better acting than airport '75? one thing i liked about this film is that it had more going on than a lot of other disaster films plot-wise. at least they made an attempt at subplots. what really hurts this film is the special effects - ugh! not too special if you ask me. this is the kind of film that at 2am is truly, truly funny if you've been up having fun with your buddies and you're looking for something to laugh at.
