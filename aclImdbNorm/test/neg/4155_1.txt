if i guess your "palabra", will you let me go through?- asks william geld, a tim robbins that keeps on acting like if they told him a fantastic joke and he is attempting not to laugh.<br /><br />he is trying to get to a forbidden area. the woman stopping him continues blabbering: -your "palabra" is carrefour.<br /><br />-how did you know?- the lady asks, surprised. he answers, in the name of wisdom: -i was hearing when you weren't talking. :/<br /><br />yes, this defines the movie. this precisely. it doesn't matter if carrefour is "road conjunction" in french, or if the future is coldly bureaucratic and mixes languages. or if samantha morton has nothing, nothing of spanish (maria gonzalez being her name in the film) with her irish, scotish whatever tone.<br /><br />it's boring and dull. if you fall in believing there are multiple symbolisms, you will buy the most bizarre, sickening love relationship ever, set in a future that may well be in seven seconds. i can guess this movie's palabra: it will be "painful".
