another sequel! why on earth do they keep making these? this has got to be the weakest 'franchise' ever, yet it is still being funded and spawning sequels. scarecrow gone wild - which i only watched so i could officially trash the whole series - brings back the evil straw-man who, again, butchers up some college kids... that's basically it. the acting sucks (as usual), the death scenes are beyond pathetic, and don't be fooled by the title, this thing doesn't have as much nudity as you may think. a couple nice topless girls, but nothing too pants tightening. let me just conclude my continuous insult (or review) on this movie by saying: if i come across a scarecrow in space or a freddy vs scarecrow on the video store shelves, i'm going to be in absolute awe...
