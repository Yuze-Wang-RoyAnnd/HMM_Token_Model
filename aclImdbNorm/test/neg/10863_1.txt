this movie makes "glitter" look like "schindler's list." tarantino and the weinsteins really need to consider more carefully before putting their names on a product. green-lighting a p.o.s. like this, regardless of the friendships involved, is just bad business. larry bishop needs to be kept away from a movie camera at all costs. writer/director/producer/actor bishop shows that his skills are inadequate for any of those jobs. a vanity project gone south, "hell ride" allows usually good actors to chew the scenery... at least when the camera isn't centered on bishop's feeble attempts to steal every scene he's in. (which is virtually every scene!) my final three words on "hell ride" are stink, stank, stunk.
