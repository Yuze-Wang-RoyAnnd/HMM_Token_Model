i can't even describe it. it's the worst movie i've ever seen (i'm being a nice guy when i call it movie).just another big-budget-made-to-someone-who-doesn't-like-to-think-much.it's not even scary. it's revolting when there are great movies that never reach the big screen and then comes this..."thing" to trick movie fans. i guess big producers make whatever they want.<br /><br />just get a big producer, hot chicks (allthough horrible actresses) and a ton of horror movie clich'es and cook it for a week or so, and you'll get "the nun".<br /><br />and i thought bad boys 2 was horrible!!!!
