i am very into waverly hills and first watched death tunnel the movie.couldn't have been much worse. then i heard that the documentary was coming out and got excited thinking that since it was a documentary it would be more serious and not have the horrible special effects.wrong the same guys did the documentary and ruined it with effects instead of producing it raw the way a documentary should be.waverly hills doesn't need help with goofy effects its fine just the way it is. tours are $20.00 per person and $100.00 for 8 hour overnight investigation per person minimal group of 10 for overnight investigation.tours must be set up ahead of time. awesome place for the ghost hunter!
