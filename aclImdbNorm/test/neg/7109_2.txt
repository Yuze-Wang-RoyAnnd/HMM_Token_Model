being a fan of marlene dietrich's films, i was very anxious to see this "documentary." i also got sucked in by reading rave review after rave review from the national critics. that should have tipped me off.<br /><br />the movie is just plain boring and obviously extremely overrated. you don't even see dietrich. she is heard in the background, discussing her movies and this video. she does almost nothing but complain about everything. what a drag! <br /><br />the filmmaker, maximilian schell, constantly complains himself and pleads with her to be on camera.....all to no avail. she just keeps refusing to cooperate. after awhile, this sort of thing gets really tiring. with her attitude, why would schell continue with this project? he should have just told the prima donna to "shove it."<br /><br />regardless of what you read, do not waste your time with this.
