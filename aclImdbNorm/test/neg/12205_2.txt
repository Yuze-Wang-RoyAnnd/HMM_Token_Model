this film brought a whole new meaning to that well-worn phrase 'like watching paint dry' because this was 'like watching paint dry in the middle of a monsoon'.<br /><br />i was attracted to the film by its location on the west coast of portugal which i have visited. it is a ruggedly beautiful place and the black-and-white introduced a whole new dimension to the beauty. that was the only good thing. the story was appallingly banal and frankly you have to have some story.<br /><br />a film crew runs out of film and the entire crew then have to wait. well, a wait is a wait. i can wait for a number 15 bus on princes street in edinburgh, i can spend hours on a remote railway station in the middle of nowhere on cold winter's sunday afternoon. however a wait is boring and yes, this wait was boring too.<br /><br />so the leader goes off to america to remonstrate with the film supplier who castigates him for not making the whole thing in colour. after a number of arguments two blessed bullets ring out from wherever and the eagerly-awaited end finally arrives, and not before time.<br /><br />yes, i would see this film again if someone arms me with a couple of cans of colour film so that i can hurl them at the screen.
