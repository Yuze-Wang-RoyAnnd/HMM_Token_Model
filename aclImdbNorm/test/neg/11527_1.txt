admittedly, you can put a model airplane against a black background and call it sci-fi, and thats enough to get me interested, so if you are like that, black horizon will at least get you interested before you watch it. the best part of the movie is when they rehash some actual footage of a shuttle launch.<br /><br />the movie plays like the naked gun series, spoofing cop dramas with bad clich'es and bad acting. unfortunately, i don't think they meant to be funny, the actors really are made of cardboard, the dialog really does suck, so well just have to laugh at them, and not with them.<br /><br />on a side note, it is rare to see a movie that takes place half in outer space, half on earth, and doesn't mix in the expected extraterrestrials and supernatural events. i really do ache for more realistic drama based on our space endeavors.
