i saw this movie previewed before something else i rented a while back...and it looked decent. i've seen some good stuff from full moon video, and thought it was worth a shot... unfortunately, this was not good stuff.<br /><br />the story is about a possessed bed. a couple moves into a new apartment, discovers the bed, and odd things start happening. odd things like the woman discovers kinky sex. and the man discovers kinky sex. and the woman draws pictures of kinky sex. and the man photographs kinky sex. and they both start having dreams about dead people having kinky sex. you'd think a movie with so much kinky sex would be good, right?<br /><br />well.... no. the problem is that this is supposed to be a scary movie, or at least a thriller, and it just doesn't deliver. there is little tension, no suspense, and no fear. aside from some troubling dreams and visions, there really isn't anything for this couple to be worried about. the whole movie is basically the two of them having these visions and playing around in bed. sure, you get a monster fight at the end...and some bloodshed...but nothing spectacular... there's only one murder, and one good scare, and that's it.<br /><br />and the kinky sex? don't get your hopes up (or anything else for that matter). their idea of kinky sex is woman on top, fully clothed, trying to strangle her mate with a necktie. not exactly my idea of a good time.
