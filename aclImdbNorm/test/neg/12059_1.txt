camp blood is an absolutely atrocious slasher film. we're mixing friday the 13th with the blair witch project and adding....a killer in a clown mask.<br /><br />the budget for this film must have been very low, some of the actors played multiple parts and the camera used produced a picture equal to the colourised version of the original night of the living dead, which if anybody has watched that version will back me up that it is poor.<br /><br />this film was just so bad. there is nothing in the film even worth watching. the very fact i watched this all the way through stunned me. just take my advice and don't buy or rent this film. it is appalling.
