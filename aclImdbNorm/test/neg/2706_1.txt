the first time i watched this movie i was ten years old. i thought it was bad then, and at that age i had no cinematic taste whatsoever. i watched this movie on cinemax about 3 days ago and was reminded why i hated the movie in the first place. madonna's character, nikki, is annoying and obnoxious. there's no way that the main character would ever fall in love with her. the jokes were corny and the dialogue was worse than a t.v. soap opera!! i'm glad that i didn't see this movie at the theatre, or rent it. i feel bad for my parents who had to endure watching it with me! madonna is not necessarily a bad actress, but in this role she is portrayed as a complete idiot.
