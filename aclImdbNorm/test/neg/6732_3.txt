can they possibly get any worse than this? probably. but after all steven seagal gets to do what he does. well kind of; this time instead of mortally wounding the bad guys he just wounds them. by reputation of being a bad ass agent seagal is hired to deliver a special package from france to america. but it is not an easy task with so many people trying to intercept and foul up the mission. the fights just don't have enough bite and the big bangs are just big and that's all. anna-louis plowman seems to be the only cast member not to appear wooden. also in the cast are: jeffery pierce, max ryan and harry van gorkum. don't put all the blame on seagal for this clunker.
