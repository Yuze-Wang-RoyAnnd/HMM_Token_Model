this movie was nothing like the book. <br /><br />everything was mixed up or changed. most of the movie was things that weren't even in the book.<br /><br />this movie never should have been viewed. it was a great disappointment to me when i enjoyed the book so much and then to watch how this movie trashed the entire thing.<br /><br />i would never recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of nora roberts or j.d. robb.<br /><br />honestly this movie is not worth watching with how off from the book is really is.
