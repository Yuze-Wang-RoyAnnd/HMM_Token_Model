from the english accents to the so unnecessary violence after violence. showing moses as a murderer. people who actually believe in the old testament will just sit there and shake their heads. i am not a religious person at all. but even i felt as though the writers of this movie were trying to turn us all against god and the jews.when moses picked up that rock and threw the first stone at the woman to kill her for committing adultery. i wanted to stone the writers. i can't believe in this day and age that hallmark and abc (disney) would attempt to show such garbage as this. don't we have enough problems in this world already?
