anyone who knows anything about evolution wouldn't even need to see the film to say "fake". "it's never been disproved" also is a weak argument. saying the universe was created by a giant hippo cannot be disproved. although, to be fair, it does seem like the only people who do believe are the same people who open email attachments from people they don't know or give their bank details to a dude in zambia. no bones of any primates are have been found in the united states or canada. there is also a good reason why legitimate scientists don't bother studying this. the same argument goes for the loch ness monster, ghosts and god.
