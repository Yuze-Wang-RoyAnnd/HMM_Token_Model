i gave "airport '79" only two stars because it's a truly lousy film. nobody who had anything to do with it deserves any praise (except for charo's chihuahua, who does a pretty good job in his role.) this is not to say that the film isn't worth watching. it helps if you have a buzz on, but this is not essential.<br /><br />a'79 really does seem like an early version of "airplane!" every scene has a set-up and a payoff, and the scenes blunder after one another as if they were totally disconnected. one of my favorite recurring points is that the passengers, crew, and airplane get to keep going, no matter what. you're a news reporter and a strange guy gets murdered at your house in your presence? the hit-man then chases you onto your greenhouse roof? no problem. you can still catch that early-morning flight to paris...no need to get the cops involved. your plane dodges one unmanned "drone" missile, four heat-seeking missiles, and cannon fire from an unidentified phantom fighter, doing barrel rolls, an unpowered dive, and a crash-net landing without thrust reversers in the process? no problem, we'll have the mechanics check the oil and get you on your way in just a few hours. it's truly funny.<br /><br />and i'll admit that there's a bit of the anarchist in me that comes out when the passengers pay no attention to the cabin attendants. the highlight is when the attendant tells jimmie walker he'll have to put away his saxophone (god spare me from a flight seated in front of a saxophonist playing jazz!) prior to take-off. jimmie basically says, "nope." later in the flight, the sax is damaged during a barrel-roll and jimmie actually shows up on the next leg of the flight with yet another sax that he won't put away. this aspect of the film is just fun. (one passenger actually obeys the attendant. when charo is told she can't take her dog on the flight, she leaves the plane. naturally, this is because you can't get a good view of her ass and boobs while she's seated.) <br /><br />in summary, a terrible movie, but terrible enough to be a bit amusing. unfortunately, the filmmakers and cast deserve no credit whatsoever for this, as it was probably entirely unintentional.
