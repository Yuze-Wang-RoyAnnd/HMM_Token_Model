did someone find the plot somewhere in the film?. perhaps it is the thing missing in this pretentious exercise of cinema about cinema. it is quite surprising that gordon says that "a movie without a plot is nothing"... it is possible that characters have more to say that the own wim wenders. was this phrase in the original plot or the actor decided to send a hint to the director?.
