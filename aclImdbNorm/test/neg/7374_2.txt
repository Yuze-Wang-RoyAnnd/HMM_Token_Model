that's the worst film i saw since a long time. historic accuracy is totally non-existent. for example, james wolfe, who his depicted as an anti-french canadian, is shown in london during the summer of 1759. natives are like indians of a bad hollywood movie of the 60's : they wear deerskin clothes and ride horses (the montagnais had never ride horses). the film is taking place in quebec city, but footage is set in louisbourg, showing the atlantic ocean.<br /><br />the original scenario was supposed to include the battle of the plains of abraham, but the producers drop this idea saying that costs for uniforms and participants would be more than 4 millions dollars ! i think they never heard about re-enactment.<br /><br />all the movie is planned to be a new titanic : an impossible love during an historic tragedy (the fall of new-france). there's even a song performed by celine dion at the end of the movie (yes, i stayed till the end of the movie, but i deeply regret). but the worst thing of all is that this movie cost 30 millions dollars. i just don't know how they spend all this money.<br /><br />sorry for my anger, but i'm just too irritated.
