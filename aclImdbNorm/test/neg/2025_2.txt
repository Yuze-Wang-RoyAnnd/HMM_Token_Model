screenwriter steve tesich's sophomore effort (following upon the wildly overpraised breaking away) is a compendium of clich'es, coincidence, and dour melodrama. perhaps he lived some of this; if so, i'm sorry to say he was inexplicably unable to dramatize any of it convincingly.<br /><br />in fairness, he's not helped much here by arthur penn, a talented director who's done remarkable work in the past (bonnie and clyde, little big man), but fails to inject any energy or verisimilitude into tesich's narrative. <br /><br />the cast struggles as best they can but are saddled with weak motivation and dialogue. sympathies should be reserved particularly for craig wasson, whose morose performance presages the impending quick fade of his leading man career, as well as the embarrassingly untethered jodi thelen, miscast as the film's extremely unlikely 'femme fatale.'<br /><br />it all seems longer than it is, and any points made are heavy-handed and obvious. see arthur penn's earlier take on the subject of the 60's, the droll and elegiac alice's restaurant; it's everything this one isn't.
