"black vengeance" is an alternate title for "ying hung ho hon" aka "tragic hero" (1987). i have just seen this on vhs, together with the first part of the story, "gong woo ching" ("rich and famous"), also 1987. (the poster and 2 stills featured on the page are for a 4-dvd set of movies starring rod perry (the black gestapo), fred williamson (black cobra 2), richard lawson (black fist). the fourth movie is called "the black six"). strangely, while the characters retain their original names in "rich and famous", in "black vengeance" chow yun-fat's character is named eddie shaw, alex man (man tze leung) is harry, and andy lau is called johnny. also confusing is the fact that 1994 is given as the copyright dates on both films. perhaps that was the year they were american-dubbed. according to the release dates given on imdb "tragic hero" was released before "rich and famous". was there any reason for releasing the sequel first? despite some users' comments, i enjoyed these films, although they aren't among cyf's best such as "the killer" and "hard-boiled" which are truly astonishing. however,if one day i come across a 2-dvd set of "rich and famous" and "tragic hero" i won't hesitate to buy it. hopefully, these comments about "black vengeance" clear up, which was also for me, a mystery as to where it belonged in chow yun-fat's filmography.
