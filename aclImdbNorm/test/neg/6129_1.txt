oh boy, oh boy. this movie is something for the lovers of "real" cineatique art. it really does not make any sense at all. it is totally boring, especially because of the "anti-climaxes". all people behave more than strange, and unrealistic. sometimes it feels like sitting in a theatre, because in dialogues the actors tend to face the camera (and therefore the audience) instead of each other. like i said before, if you are in to those more artful movies, shown in cannes - go for it. if you are not, better leave this movie alone, because you will be more than disappointed, and in the end know that you have wasted your time - like i did. two thumbs down... :-(((
