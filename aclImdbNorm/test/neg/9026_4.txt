what a silly movie. while it looks nice, it doesn't make a lot of sense. on the one hand, the film suggests that juana's "madness" was that she was just a woman ahead of her time. on the other hand, she has an obsession that is right out of the worst victorian novel of the wronged woman, and that does seem a sort of mental problem, like miss havesham in a castle. this movie is what elizabeth would have been if elizabeth had not been able to get past essex's sexual attraction.
