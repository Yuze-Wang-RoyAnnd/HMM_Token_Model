a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow) and some cheesy clich'es thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo. even the squibs look awful. at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america. three wonky old cars do not a country make.the mustang even has a wobbly right front wheel. the plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing. it couldn't come soon enough. even the jewellery from the robbery looks like the cheapest junk costume jewellery available. the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time. worth watching if you want to know how not to make a clich'e-ridden low budget movie.
