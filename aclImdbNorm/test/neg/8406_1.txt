i kept watching it because it seemed like the plot was going somewhere. when it ambiguously got there i was very disappointed. i'm going to tell you what really happened in the next sentence. but maybe i won't. maybe i'll just imply something will happen. the writers lacked any imagination. this is not even a "b" movie - it's a made for tv "b" movie.
