when las vegas came out one review described this show as, quote "a harmless bit of fluff". needless to say that after seeing a dozen or so episodes i think this description is right on the money. an assortment of pretty boys and strutting model types play out an assortment of paper thin stories while all the time trying to pretend they are serious business people. one dimensional characters, in a one dimensional setting, pursuing one dimensional stories. that pretty much sums up vegas. i still watch from time to time to see if the show is trying to evolve and take itself a little serious but alas to no avail. so far.
