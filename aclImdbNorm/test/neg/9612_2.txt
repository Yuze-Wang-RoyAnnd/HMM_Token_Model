i won't be too hard on this show because i enjoyed the first season, but then, things got worse. the concept is nothing special, just about a girl named casey who is trying to cope with a new step-brother, derek, and his loud, crude family, while she gradually forces her princess standards onto each of them.<br /><br />in season 1, the story was actually interesting. i liked casey back then because she was smart, strong, independent, and conservative. she was well-mannered and deep. i felt bad when she was being harassed at her new school by her new step-brother. she was a perfectionist, but not as annoying as the later episodes. oh, and she dated a nice guy, who is now currently portrayed as one of derek's idiot friends. the season grasped the true tension the title of the show was trying to capture.<br /><br />now, i can't say the show has really gone downhill because the story is sometimes interesting, but i root for derek now instead of casey. now, there is little, if any interaction, between the two siblings. if they interact, it's only briefly. oh, and i don't want any dasey fans in my face. people, that's called incest, even if they are step-siblings. my tolerance can only go so far, but that's not the point.<br /><br />it's strange. derek, as the antagonist, has gotten more sensitive over time, while casey, the supposed protagonist, is more neurotic and unlikeable than before. i like how the younger kids get more airtime, but the parents are even more clueless than before. but that's not the biggest problem...<br /><br />unfortunately, we are forced to see everything from casey's point of view, with lame, nauseating background music. she has gotten stupider and more shallow over time. in one episode, she got whiny and wanted her boyfriend to be more chivalrous, so she purposely dumped food on herself and blamed derek. now, what happened to being a strong, independent feminist? i haven't watched much of the fourth season, but i hear she is dating a guy named truman, who is a jackass and is arrogant. oh, i remember that fencing episode. she constantly reminds him she doesn't like him, freaks out over being "goosed" by a sword, and in the end, hooks up with him because she can "handle" him? what the hell? why go with a guy like that in the first place. the 1st season casey would have just punched him in his...never mind. or, maybe that would have been my reaction. oh, and she's a cheerleader. not that that's a bad thing, but i think she fell on her head at one of her practices. and in a prom episode, she cried because she couldn't find the "dress in her dreams," and wasn't completely satisfied until she became prom queen. one thing i've noticed is that no matter how bad casey tries to tell us her life is, thing's almost always go her way in the end (she gets the guy she wants, derek gets some kind of revenge, people all love her, etc.) derek is still quite immature, but i see that he really has matured. i don't see why many people hate sally. she seems nice, and it's good to see derek in a serious relationship with someone he cares about rather than "playing the field." he is also treating edwin slightly better, and is a good brother to marti.<br /><br />really, the show is so-so, and i rated it low because despite some character development, the character i once admired has now become like any "fashionable teen queen" you can see anywhere on tv. but it was good while it lasted.
