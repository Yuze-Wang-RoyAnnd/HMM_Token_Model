i didn't particularly like sliding doors or twice upon a yesterday, so i certainly didn't this poor second-rate excuse for those films. an idea that's been done to death (what would happen if...?) and the script is shoddy and unsuccessful, not to mention the obvious attempt at adding sex/nudity simply to gain an r rating and certain scenes that just weren't necessary but were there to push the boundaries (i really don't need to see a kid urinating or a struggle with a diaphragm. especially when they have absolutely no connection to or use in the film).<br /><br />the acting was also very poor, the only actor i found the least bit satisfying was her daughter; the rest were two-dimensional and quite unbelievable. the people i watched this with left the room about halfway through; i managed to finish it, but not without fast forwarding through part of it.<br /><br />overall: nothing new here, it's a generic and boring film. the few rather amusing moments are far outweighed by the silly or stupid ones. this would be dull even if it hadn't been done before. if it weren't such a rehash i'd rate it a five, but even for an indie film this was severely lacking, and as a rehash it loses on originality as well: 3/10.
