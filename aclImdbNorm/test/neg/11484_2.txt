when i first saw the trailer for this film, i really wanted to see it. i thought some of the director's other works were quite good, but i must say i was disappointed. the plot involves a young woman, who lives with a widowed father and two his two sons. they move into a well-guarded community, yet all is not as it seems; a sort of twin peaks. the woman begins to see, or not see, things an people. during the first reel, i had a hypothesis, and thought, "this can't be the whole reason?" well, the ending lived up, or better down, and gave us what i felt was a truly weak final act. the sound mixing and quality is excellent. saw it in a thx certified theatre, and was impressed.. by the audio, and only the audio. the picture is missing substance.
