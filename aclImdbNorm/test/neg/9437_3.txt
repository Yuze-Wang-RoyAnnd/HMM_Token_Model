this has to rate as one of the cheesiest of tv shows in a long time.<br /><br />jose ferrer played the title character, nemo. he did the part justice and certainly looked the part. but nowadays, it strikes me that the nemo he was made up to be bore more than a passing resemblance to captain bird's eye, from the tv commercials. or maybe it's the other way around.<br /><br />his nemesis, professor cunningham, was overacted brilliantly by burgess meredith. he never seemed to get over his "penguin" days from batman. although he doesn't do his penguin "quack" here, he is without parallel as the maniacal professor. only john colicos, of battlestar galactica fame, chewed up the scenery better as a maniacal despot.<br /><br />i never can recall what the grudge was between nemo and cunningham, but it must have been severe, since the prof. never missed a chance to try and scupper nemo, and vice-versa.<br /><br />the effects were nothing special, though prof. cunningham's submarine was way better looking than nemo's. it also had a crew of strange, fish-like amphibians that served cunningham and did his every bidding.<br /><br />however, the most memorable aspect of the whole show was prof. cunningham's secret weapon. the delta beam! he was forever saying "fire delta beam!", whereupon, a fishy crewman would horribly overract the motion of firing the weapon by use of a full shoulder shrug. truly priceless! they don't make them like this anymore, and perhaps just as well. but like other series of this era, for those who remember it, it will always have an affectionate, if cheddar-covered, place in our hearts.
