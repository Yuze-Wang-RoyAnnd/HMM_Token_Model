poor action films are the graveyards for aging martial art stars. in such films they struggle to maintain that dangerous demeanor that made their early work successful, but they all end in failure. seagal is too old for this type of role but he wont let go...no matter how silly he looks. some hope his current work will somehow bring back the magic, but there is no magic left. the late '80s and early '90s belonged to steven seagal and his work made me a fan. i could see him fit nicely in a slot on the sopranos where his overweight body, jowly features and sullen attitude could have found a home. i wonder what the return is on his run of direct to video films?! since he produces them i'm assuming the $$$ is more than satisfactory. if this is the deal we will be subjected to poorly done seagal action films well into his late 60s and 70s.....
