cyber zone, as this dvd was sold in oz, is about the worst b-grade junk i have seen. apart from a restrained deadpan act from singer, indicating he knew how bad the movie was going to be, the other actors sway about genuine attempts at line delivery (swanson and quarry) or absurd imitations of classic movies scenes. mathius hues makes the most ham-fisted portrayal of dying since jim carrey's mask. all of this with no real thread to suggest an attempt at a spoof by genre, period or any common vein is plain annoying. don't even try to join the dots with the plot. it is blade runner, thinly disguised with no content, actors or scenery due to a very limited budget. "you gets what you pay for" is never more apparent. there is repeatedly annoying re-use of limited sets, with no attention to set dressing and a spew of special effects that would have hit the cutting room floor for dr who in 1976. the helicopter explosion is worth a rewind to demonstrate my point. of course there are masochists that will lap up this tripe but if you are watching this movie for a bet, make sure you get more than your pay rate. at $2 this dvd will make a cheap and interesting beer coaster.
