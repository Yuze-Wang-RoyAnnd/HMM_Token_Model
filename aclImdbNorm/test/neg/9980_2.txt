probably not the same version as most of the other reviewers because there`s no real hard core sex . what do people mean by hard core sex ? the sort of explicit hard core sex seen in films starring traci lords and " big " john holmes ? well anyway this is really poor film , i doubt if i`ve ever seen so many big name actors wasted in a film . the script is really poor and plotless , the directing and cinematography is awful and the editing is non existant . it truly is an absolutely awful film. you could watch this ten times and still not understand what the hell it`s about . the only memorable scene is the one where people are buried up to their necks and a giant lawnmower comes along and decapitates them . yes you read that right , a film set in roman times has a scene with a head chopping giant lawnmower !<br /><br />trivia point. many years ago a pirate copy of the thing ( 1982 version ) was doing the rental rounds on my island and it been copied onto a rental tape of caligula meaning the pirate version of the thing starts with the first few seconds of caligula of the man and woman walking through the forest then the title sequence of the thing starts . this led people who`d seen the pirate tape to believe the forest scene was the opening of john carpenter`s 1982 film and were very confused as to what it meant. well that`s what you get for renting pirate videos . but having seen the whole of caligula i don`t know what it meant either
