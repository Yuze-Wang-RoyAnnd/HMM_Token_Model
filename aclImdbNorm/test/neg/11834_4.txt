screen treatment of the comedic broadway success "the gay divorce" (a title which was considered too scandalous for american moviegoers, though it was used in the u.k.) concerns a man and woman (fred astaire and ginger rogers) meeting under embarrassing circumstances while she's in the process of divorcing her spouse; they dance, argue, make up, dance, argue some more and dance some more. betty grable is very appealing in a brief bit (singing and dancing in the number "let's k-nock k-nees" with overtly sissified edward everett horton), but the star-couple looks distressed and unhappy throughout. the surroundings are screwball-sophisticated yet the characters are not more than one-dimensional. *1/2 from ****
