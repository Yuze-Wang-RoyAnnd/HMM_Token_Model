this movie just seemed to lack direction. the plot developed so many twists in such a short amount of time that it seemed to lose any semblance of what the true storyline was. there was a lot of wasted dialogue and just seemed like the writing was rushed and a little too wandering. the exorcism scenes and possession story began to take a back seat to the character's back stories (which were a little weak to begin with).<br /><br />all in all, i would say skip it unless you have rented out the rest of the horror section at your local video store and you have a jones for a movie you haven't seen before. you're much better off just watching the exorcist or the exorcism of emily rose.
