savage guns (video title) is a dirt cheap, bottom of the barrel spaghetti western in which the survivor of a massacre hunts the bandits who killed his brother and left him for dead, catching up with them in a town controlled by their crooked boss.<br /><br />despite plenty of violence, this manages to be both dull and colorless with bad characterizations and almost no imagination or humor.<br /><br />lead actor robert woods lives up to his name with a wooden and uncharismatic performance that fails to generate any warmth or sympathy whatsoever. in other words, the viewer never really roots for him despite the fact that he's the protagonist.<br /><br />the worst scene (in my opinion) is the annoying dance hall scene where a woman sings in a heavy and terribly unsexy german accent. it was the worst scene in blazing saddles and the worst one here!
