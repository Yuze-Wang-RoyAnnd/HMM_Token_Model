the only reason i'm even giving this movie a 4 is because it was made in to an episode of mystery science theater 3000. the horrible direction is only slightly overshadowed by the characters complete inability to act. the lead is an actor i have never seen in anything else and it shows. no chemistry with the love interest and so bland you almost don't care what happens to him. dick sargent was not convincing as a villain least of all this guy was suppose to be super evil...he was more annoying then anything. peter graves was the only person the movie that wasn't awful, his part was small and even he couldn't compensate for his co-stars lack of talent. in 2004 someone tried to make this mess all over again it was called the island...i personally didn't see that movie but from what i understand its the same movie. if you want to laugh at this movie get the mst3k episode its really funny...full of bewitched and biography references it makes this movie finally watchable
