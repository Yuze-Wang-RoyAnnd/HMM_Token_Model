lon chaney jr returns to lumber along as the mummy kharis seeking his mate, annanka whose soul now resides in the beautiful host of descendant amina(ramsay ames). andoheb, high priest of arkan(george zucco)leaves yousef bey(john carradine)in charge of kharis to continue their evil-doing ways. tom(robert lowery)must find a way to save his beloved amina from certain future mummy terror.<br /><br />routine, predictable entry in the kharis series proves that nearly every film follows a specific format/formula. the city is threatened by a skulking, one-armed corpse masked in wrapping who seems to have been gifted with superhuman power to choke the life out of able-bodied men who are restrained with relative ease by a mere chokehold from kharis. frank reicher, who saw kharis in action..and knows a great deal about egyptian history..in the previous film(the mummy's tomb), proves that anyone who happened to survive a previous encounter with the mummy is sure to die if he returns in the next flick. well produced, but lacks originality that would set it apart from the other films in the series. sadly, carradine sleepwalks through his role as the evil yousef bey. embarrassing script mistake has kharis, who is known for donning a crippled, lame right arm, carrying an unconscious amina with both arms for long distances with no ill effects. one aspect, the shocking climax where tom's attempt at heroism doesn't go according to plan as kharis holds his damsel-in-distress hostage, lifts the film from the doldrums slightly.
