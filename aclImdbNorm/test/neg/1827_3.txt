this is a pretty lousy picture.it offers nothing unique or original or even interesting.<br /><br />a medical student discovers that a secret society at her university is engaged in macabre medical experiments.and of course she becomes involved in solving the weird deaths at the school.this movie started out promising with a few cool special effects in which a guy is partially dissected while alive and tries to get away after he wakes up but then even that fizzles and the rest of the special effects are pretty routine plastic models of the human body and that unreal looking blood that these second rate horror movies always seem to have.<br /><br />and as if the routine plot and the lousy acting wasn't enough this movie had subtitles that many times didn't even match the dubbed english that you hear being spoken and then add that to the mouth movement not matching the dubbing ..well let's just say trying to coordinate all that in your head isn't worth it for this mediocre movie.<br /><br />i was at least counting on some skin in this movie and except for a bit during the opening credits this movie didn't deliver on that either.<br /><br />this is a boring routine run of the mill horror/gore movie---short on horror and gore.skip this movie unless "ernest goes to camp" is the only rental left.
