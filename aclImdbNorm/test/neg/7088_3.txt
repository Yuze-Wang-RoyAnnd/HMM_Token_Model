this is another of hollywood's anti-communist polemics of the golden 1950s. stalwart american gene barry, lovely englishwoman valerie french, and three others are kidnapped by an alien and given clamshells containing fantastic--and fantastically vague--power. what will the earthlings do with such power? toss it in the sea or use it to wipe out all of mankind? anybody who knows american cinema circa 1957 knows the answer to what the commies will do, but the story gets ripe when the americans actually test the things in the middle of the pacific. then one scientist, alone with the ultimate power in the universe, comes up with his own theory and uses it! his smarmy attitude afterward is nauseating, and the cheery disposition of everyone else is appalling.<br /><br />here's the spoiler for this dog: the capsules inside the clamshells have a mathematical code that tells the prof that they kill only "confirmed enemies of freedom"! that's right--don't worry about the ethical conundrum of killing everyone that an alien pill decides is an enemy of freedom; just do it! hurray! no commies! silly female--and you threw yours into the sea! ha ha! kiss me, baby!
