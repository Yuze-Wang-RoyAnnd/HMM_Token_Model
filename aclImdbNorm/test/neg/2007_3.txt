wow, there's a lot of venom directed at this movie, and a lot of it is deserved, but it's not the worst movie of all time. (that's probably "zoolander".)<br /><br />anyway, if you're high on something, really drunk, or just in the mood for a "b-minus- minus" movie that you can make fun of, this may be your cup of tea.<br /><br />yes, as others said, the first part of the movie makes you think you're watching an updating of the bram stoker novel. two of the main characters are named van helsing and mina, the ship is the demeter, and they're in the carpathian galaxy. you later find that van helsing is a descendant of the original, and he just happens to be on a ship in the 30th century with dracula. suuuuuuuuuuure.<br /><br />oh yeah, and to add to the originality, this "spooky ghost ship" movie has another character named ash. sound familiar?<br /><br />there's paper-thin character development and anachronisms like the aforementioned manual wheelchair, and coolio and tom lister talking 20th century black slang. but what really makes the movie ridiculous is the ending. if that's what happens to the characters, then the previous two hours have been a waste.<br /><br />like i said, it you want a dumb movie to play "mystery science theater" with, and your mind is in approximately the same mode required for viewing the "great vegetable rebellion" episode of lost in space, then you may find this diverting. otherwise, put a stake in it, it's done.
