after watching avalon (which was decent only because of the very nice digital fx), and several anime films written by oshii, including jin-roh (which is fantastic) i decided i should check out the oshii cinema trilogy box set. being that the red spectacles and stray dog are related, i will comment here on both. and let me tell you, it was one of the biggest wastes of money i have spent in a while. i first watched stray dogs and then the red spectacles. i am sad to say that these films are quite possibly the most boring two movies i have ever seen. for only about 10 minutes in each film do you get to see some action between the the characters, who are only dressed in the "panzer cop" outfits for a few fleeting scenes. the rest of the time you will see some very drawn out scenes filled with boring dialogue in some less than impressive locations. i really don't understand the motivation behind these two films at all. i love the wolf brigade outfits and the idea behind the plot, but the films themselves leave much to be desired. i would suggest not watching these films, and certainly do not buy the box set like i did, unless you enjoy wasting money. oh, and if you are wondering what i think about the 3rd movie in the set, talking head, i couldn't even bring myself to watch it before i purged the box set from my dvd collection via ebay at a $20 loss. if you want cool japanese live action, check out returner, or ichii the killer or the zeiram series.
