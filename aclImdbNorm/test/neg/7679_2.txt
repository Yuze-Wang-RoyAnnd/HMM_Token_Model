the original airport (1970) was a classic of its kind, and the first two b-movie follow-ups (airport 1975; airport '77) were watchable fun at best, amusing camp at worst; but this crass and inept final entry lacks any entertainment value and displays a shocking contempt for its audience. it's unendurable and not even good for laughs. <br /><br />all of the three "airport" sequels were theatrical releases made by universal's television wing but this one is beneath even the modest standards of a tv movie of its day, with cheapjack production, grotesque casting, visual ugliness and tasteless, unfunny "comedy". the project was clearly doomed by the "creative" efforts of universal executive jennings lang who personally produced and is given a "story" credit.<br /><br />everyone starts somewhere, and writer eric roth (forrest gump) might have provided an element of self-burlesque, as had the previous films (especially the notorious airport 1975), but there is nothing worth spoofing in roth's turgid, incoherent script and even the comedy airplane! left this crud untouched.<br /><br />what makes the concorde: airport '79 particularly offensive is its insulting misuse of professionals. the worst victim is the supremely gifted cicily tyson (sounder; the autobiography of miss jane pittman), pitilessly reduced to a vomitous subplot involving her escorting a frozen heart transplant on the unfortunate flight. <br /><br />a special kick to the groin is reserved for the wonderful george kennedy, who is the true lead despite being buried in the cast list. the official mascot of the "airport" series and the only actor to appear in all four movies, kennedy had more than earned the starring role and his turn in the captain's seat would have been the only possible reason for this entry other than the squeezing of one last buck. kennedy provides the only warmth and real humor in this mechanical muckup, briefly putting aside the bravura machismo and revealing a genuinely sweet and tender side to himself, and his lovable and heroic character of "joe patroni". unfortunately we are never allowed to forget how fat and old and over-the-hill kennedy is, and overage pretty-boy alain delon relentlessly calls him "porky pig" as part of a buddy-bonding that falls completely flat. even kennedy's parisian romance, the only humane part of this plane-wreck, turns out to be merely a set-up for a hateful joke at patroni's, kennedy's, and the viewer's expense.
