this is clearly a french film. it is about young group of idealist/revolutionary/anarchistic people. it moves very slowly. long takes. long closeups. a minute or more devoted to an attempt to light a pipe full of hash/opium. a long take on how a group overturns a car and burns it. it is a black and white film. the subtitles were white, so about a third of the time they were unreadable. (why do they do this?) i walked out after about an hour and three quarters when it became clear that this picture was going nowhere, slow. i was not the first to walk out. it was the first time i walked out of a picture in my long lifetime. (well, maybe the second.)
