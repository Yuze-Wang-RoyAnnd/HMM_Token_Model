anatomie isn't very unique in horror genre, in fact it isn't even scary at all. it reminds me of its american cousins, horror slashers. it's just a copy of any other horror slasher and as a german movie it's just too american with nothing to add to it.<br /><br />actually anatomie is too predictable and boring, its plot is not intact and consistent. it's got stupid scenes to it which don't even fit into a horror movie genre. amusing sex scenes with pop music and topless women in underwear. why do they need to have it all in just one movie? they should have made a cheap german adult movie instead.<br /><br />i can't recommend this movie to anyone because it's just too boring.
