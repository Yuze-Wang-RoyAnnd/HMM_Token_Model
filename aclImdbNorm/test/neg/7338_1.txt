what a dire film. i cannot believe that i actually sat down and watched it. a very, very, very, very, very, very pathetic effort, with no redeeming features whatsoever. hateeeeeeedddd ittttt! the so-called "racing" sequences are laughably awful, and the plot was so bad, i've forgotten it. part of the film was made at the spa-francorchamps course in belgium in, i think, 1988, during the actual grand prix there. i was there and am glad i didn't appear in any of the paddock scenes shown in the film. it could have been good...what a pity.
