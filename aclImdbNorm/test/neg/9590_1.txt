when king kong stripped her of her top in the 1976 remake, i was breathless. i don't know how many times i went back to see that movies hoping to see more. jessica lange was not a great actress then (she became one), but she was so hot! i went to see "sweet dreams" when it came out because, by that time, ms. lange had become a great actress. it looked like a wonderful story. and she's always exciting to see.<br /><br />i never walked out of a movie faster. my wife concurred.<br /><br />when we got into the car, i turned to her, and said, "if you had told me i would get bored watching jessica lange take her clothes off, i would have said your crazy. i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off!" how bad is that?
