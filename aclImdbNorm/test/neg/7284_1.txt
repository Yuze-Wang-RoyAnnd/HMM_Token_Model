the only reason this show did not get a 0 is because one is not available. this show has gone from informative news to sensationalized claptrap. i tried to support this show in its decline, because i like human interest stories and primetime used to have some very good ones. unfortunately, april 21st has forever changed my mind about this show and the unethical newscasters that participate in it. abc actually recorded a brutal case of child abuse and then refused to show it until the statute of limitations had run out and the parents could not be arrested on the charges they should have faced. what made it worse was how abc swept the whole incident under the rug; instead of taking charge and seeking true professional help for these disturbed individuals, they had some pop psychologists send stern warnings to the audience about how they shouldn't judge these poor angels too harshly. i was truly sickened. i hope this review stops one person from watching this investigative trash in the future. if it does, i will be happy. these days, all you can expect from diane sawyer and the good folks from primetime live are butt-kissing sessions with a-list celebrities and criminal acts covered up and praised to the stars. don't waste the hour of your life; you'd be better off watching an old sitcom on nick at nite.
