1) men over the age of 25 that refer to themselves, without irony, as having "game", or being either a "player" or a "baller". gentlemen, from here on in it's a swift descent into starring in your own real-life version of "a night at the roxbury". <br /><br />2) saying "the v.i.p." the term "v.i.p." in and of itself isn't bad, but when preceded by "the" it instantly becomes part of the douchebag dictionary. this goes double for white people. <br /><br />3) people that make tv shows based on stuff that they don't know isn't cool and then go on imdb posing as "fans", (...right...) moreover, one of whom is from the "united states" (hey, me too!) to bitterly insult members of their potential audience for inevitably thinking their show sucks. minus 1 additional demerit point if they employ any variation on the oh-snap-nice-one-bro justification that "if you don't like the show you obviously can't get laid." <br /><br />4) canadian hip-hop/r&b sensation massari...a random addition to the list at first glance, but at the end of the day massari gets the gas face for the simple reason that his particular brand of low-rent american-aping uncool and general aqua velva douchebaggery dovetails with the overall sensibility of "keys to the v.i.p." <br /><br />5) last but not least, "keys to the v.i.p."...for all the above reasons and more.
