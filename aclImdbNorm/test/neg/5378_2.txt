okay, sure, this film will never win an oscar. citizen cane this film is not... but why does every film have to be scrutinized? when was the last time you saw a film that was funny not becuase it was good, but because it was goofy? doesn't anyone remember roger corman, king of exploitation?<br /><br />well, i had fun. i liked the cheese. just go in not expecting to think, and prepare to throw popcorn at the screen.
