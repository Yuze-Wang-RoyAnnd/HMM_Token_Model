a perennial fixture in the imdb bottom 100, upon viewing this it's not hard to see exactly why for it proves to fail utterly miserably in just about every bloody department going!<br /><br />take the editing for a start; to call this choppy would be overly complimentary! indeed, had the makers of this got drunk one night and sliced and diced the film reels with some scissors and children's glue, then the resulting mess could hardly have been any worse than what we actually have here. added to this, the inane story drags on mercilessly for what seems like a torturous infinity before we finally reach the decidedly lacklustre climax. <br /><br />aside from the ever game michael sopkiw, poor performances from most of the rest of the cast don't exactly help matters any either and the actual beastie that is causing all the troubles is somewhat less than convincing to put it mildly. yay verily, all in all this is a complete pile of crap if ever i've seen one.<br /><br />deary, deary me....and to think that lamberto bava directed this to....tut, tut indeed. <br /><br />note: this was released in the uk under the alternative title of devouring waves, although bereft of most of its gore scenes, which ironically are just about the only reason that this may have been worth watching.
