this film's premise seems to be that the passing of the world war 2 generation in america, with its apple-pie phoniness and hypocritical morality, was a terrible tragedy. those awful hippies ruined everything apparently.<br /><br />what holds the film together are the excellent performances - particularly lemmon's which is truly remarkable. otherwise we have a boring slice-of-life drama (just over 24 hours of jack's life) with pretensions.<br /><br />i found it a chore to sit through.
