there are some great canadian films. there are some crappy ones. last night, i watched one of the crappy ones. it wasn't the typical canadian film where it tried to be so different by being arty. this film tried to be some type of hollywood gangster movie. it was terrible.<br /><br />from the beginning i had a sense that it would be a bad movie. it had some of the cheesiest dialouge a movie can have. there was this voice over for one scene and then it never returned. that always bugs me, when filmmakers just use voice over when they can't think of another creative way to tell a story.<br /><br />i know being in the canadian film industry, i should support my fellow brothers, but this movie is junk. the premise is something like a soprano's episode only not realistic. some banker's mafia boss dad is on his death bed and orders the son to make the business legit. not so original. and the workers complain about it, but they just take the fact that they will soon be out of jobs like nothing. to make it legit they use extortion. irony. but not the good kind. then some freak show girl who had an awful elvis wig and birthmark that covered half of her face robs the main character and kinda rapes him. anyways, this guy for whatever reason now likes to dress up as girls. then this banker hooks up with a hooker, when he has a beautiful future wife at home. but he falls for the hooker because the hooker dresses like a man and puts make-up on him. she blackmails him with some photos of him wearing bra and panties. yet, he still loves her. he also has no reason to leave his fianc'e, but he does in order to be with the hooker.<br /><br />for a movie about organize crime and sexual fetish, there was neither action nor sex. it was like a late night cinemax porn movie without the good stuff. the would-be sex scenes weren't hot or sexy. it was all too amateurish. the movie had nothing going for it, just the lame plot.<br /><br />i don't think it was the actor's fault. i think they had a terrible script to work with. what stuck out the most was the ridiculous characters. the bad guy's name was uncle bunny or something. but the name wasn't important. it was they all were clich'e. the dialouge was laughable throughout the movie, and fellow movie-goers laughed aloud at some of the movies "serious" moments. then, the worst of it all. it had to be the cheapest ending. if you can ever remember playing shoot out as a kid with either imaginary guns or toy guns. that was basically the ending of the movie. but i was more than happy it ended, and i had to warn my fellow canadians to not waste time or money watching this film.
