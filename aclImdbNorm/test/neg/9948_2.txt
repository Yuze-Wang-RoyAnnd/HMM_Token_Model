two little girls strike a friendship. one tries to convince the other she's a witch. the other is a pushover who bends to the would be witch's will. on and on the movie drags with the pointless interaction between the two little girls, with many a dramatic cut away as they pose "shocking" questions. you know, the kind sweet little children shouldn't ask, such as, "how do you make a deal with the devil"? oooh... creepy.<br /><br />in the end, the pushover is sick of being controlled by her witchy friend. her belief that her friend is a witch leads to a tragic end. but by the time it comes, you won't care in the least.<br /><br />i can imagine this film may have been frightening to a very religious 1960s mexican moviegoer, but it doesn't even hold up as a charming relic. it merely drags on. it is boring. it is pointless. it is not to be watched.<br /><br />there are many here who have a lot of good things to say about it, based on their knowledge of the director's other works and, of course, that common denominator everyone says about pointless films: "ah, the cinematography is wonderful!" those reviewers probably have a point. but for the ones who found this movie with no prior knowledge, who don't care about its "photography," its "atmosphere" or its...whatever else it has -- for these viewers, then, who just want a *good* movie that will entertain them for an hour and a half, do yourselves a favour, folks: <br /><br />skip it.
