probably one of the worst movies ever made, i'm still trying to figure if it was meant to be fun, but for sure i had no fun at all. maybe the movie lost something during the english-italian translation, dunno, for sure i miss the guts to watch it again in original version.<br /><br />my rate for it 2/10, and i feel like i'm being pretty generous (let's say 1 point is for liv cause she's a nice babe, and the other point is for those decent actors that got trapped into a worthless, useless and pathetic movie)<br /><br />take care<br /><br />alex
