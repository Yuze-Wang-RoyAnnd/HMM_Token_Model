i can name only a few movies that i have seen which were this bad. this movie has terrible everything: the dialog is corny and clich'e', the acting is poor for the most part with a few exceptions, the cinematography is nothing to cheer about, and the plot is silly (a fat woman stalks a suburban family because her daughter didn't make the soccer team). this is so bad, it's funny to watch. if you can catch this on lifetime, i'd recommend it highly as a comedy. as for being a serious movie, i'm afraid i'll have to rate this a 2.<br /><br />don't watch this film if you are a serious movie fan and looking for an interesting and challenging storyline, or good acting. there is none to be found.<br /><br />edit: hmmm... i think a group of people who work for lifetime must have written some phony reviews and voted all the negative ones down. don't believe them. this is a really crappy movie.
