my best guess is this piece of work will come out on dvd sometime before christmas.<br /><br />this movie was terrible. the time line jumps all over the place. this wouldn't be so bad if it left some suspense for the end. it was entirely predictable. bitch girls pick on outcast, outcast wants to know why they hate her so much, bitch girls die a terrible death, outcast girl goes home and looks crazy. outcast girl brought evil spirits with her, makes neighbors go crazy and kill each other. creepy kid understands what's going on. oh, and the younger sister not being good enough for mommie, sick mother sending younger daughter to bring the golden child home. <br /><br />to be fair, there were some great moments here and there. first of all, sarah michelle geller's character dies in the first few minutes. definite plus. didn't see that one coming. i didn't expect the wife to pour bacon grease on her husband's head, either. if the movie had kept up those kind of thrills, i would have loved it. the beginning showed so much promise. <br /><br />i was disappointed because i enjoyed the first one. it made me jump, i didn't expect most of what happened, and though i questioned some of the movie, it was still a fun watch. i didn't watch any previews for this the sequel, because i wanted to be surprised. i was, but in the wrong direction.
