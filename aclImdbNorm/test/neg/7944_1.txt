i don't think it's necessary to outline the plot for you, because the site and other users have done a superb job of that already. that said, here's my take. this is by far the worst movie of 2005, and there have been some really, really bad ones. i don't even need to go into detail because there is nothing redeeming about this movie. bad acting, bad plot, bad directing, bad special effects-you name it. if it doesn't stand alone as the worst film ever made, it's tied with some other piece of crap. i'd be embarrassed to have my friends know i was in this movie. but hey, most people that are gonna see it will do so no matter what reviews it gets, so more power to ya. when you feel the gaping void between your neurons two hours into your evening, don't blame me.
