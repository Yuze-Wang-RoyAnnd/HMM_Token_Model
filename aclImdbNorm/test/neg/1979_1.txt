final fantasy: advent children is and will remain a classic example of style over substance gone wrong. instead of drawing upon the memorable characters and captivating mythology of the original game, square enix has churned out a frivolous montage of incomprehensible battle scenes. yes, i said "incomprehensible." did you know that tifa knows blindingly fast kung fu techniques that magically cause the camera angle to shift every second? that cloud can effortlessly suspend himself in midair for a full minute while wildly swinging away with his 2-ton sword? the english dub is mediocre. while not egregiously bad, it is far from well-produced. the quality is comparable to that of an average anime dub.<br /><br />here is what i'd like to say to the die-hard ffvii fans who can't stop gushing over this movie: advent children is the best fan service you could have hoped for from square enix, but even a trashy cg flick like galerians: rion had a better story. you'll be embarrassed by this movie and its lack of thought in due time. the days of its novelty are numbered.<br /><br />movies like advent children make me question whether square enix recognizes the potential of its franchises. after all (and no offense), it's a japanese company. japanese developers can deliver fun games, but most of their offerings are disappointingly shallow. they are utter psychos, however, when it comes to production quality. advent children features some of the most breathtaking renders in cg history, but that doesn't save it from its convoluted plot and cardboard characters.<br /><br />any fan who followed this film knows sephiroth comes back. bending the story to accommodate his resurrection was a big mistake.<br /><br />note: the one point i give this "film" is in honor of the 10,000 enslaved japanese animators who gave their lives to render each bleached blond hair on cloud's effeminate caucasian head.
