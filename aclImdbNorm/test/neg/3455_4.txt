(caution: several spoilers)<br /><br />someday, somewhere, there's going to be a post-apocalyptic movie made that doesn't stink. unfortunately, the postman is not that movie, though i have to give it credit for trying.<br /><br />kevin costner plays somebody credited only as "the postman." he's not actually a postman, just a wanderer with a mule in the wasteland of a western america devastated by some unspecified catastrophe. he trades with isolated villages by performing shakespeare. suddenly a pack of bandits called the holnists, the self-declared warlords of the west, descend upon a village that costner's visiting, and their evil leader gen. bethlehem (will patton) drafts costner. after much misery and numerous efforts to break costner's spirit, he escapes, thus ending a lengthy section of the movie that could have been told better in a three-minute flashback.<br /><br />we now finally get to the major premise: the escaped costner finds an abandoned mail truck and delivers the letters to the nearest town, hoping to get some food under pretense of being a postman. a number of the village people led by young ford (larenz tate) want to get in on this postman act, which does not sit well with bethlehem and his bandits, and costner finds himself the unwitting and unwilling leader of a band of postmen at war with the holnists.<br /><br />the idea of the postmen versus the bad guys is not as ridiculous as it sounds. the holnists depend for their livelihood on the fact that the villages they prey on are isolated from one another; the holnists can destroy any one village, but could not stand against all their victims united. to unite, the villages must communicate with one another, and a working mail system would thus be a big step toward putting the holnists out of business. so it really makes a lot of sense that bethlehem would get medieval on our heroic mail carriers. unfortunately, bethlehem's eventual defeat is not the result of the villages uniting against him, but instead your old standby cliche, the one-on-one brawl between him and costner. nor is there even any real attempt by the communities to use the mail to work together to solve their problems; all the mail seems to be the standard "hi, aunt debbie" stuff played for maximum sentimental value.<br /><br />the postman is one of the most predictable movies, shot for shot, that i have ever seen. now, i don't purposely try to ruin movies for myself by straining to figure out what's going to happen next. but here we're talking about the kind of predictability that requires no effort; i just knew what was going to happen next whether or not i wanted to know. after a lion is prominently showcased eating people, a holnist bandit seeking the escaped costner ventures into the bushes after a noise, and we are then "shocked" when the lion eats him. a bunch of unoffending villagers are rounded up and shot by a firing squad, and one of the villagers sings out some famous last words right before being shot, to my immense lack of surprise. a covered statue is unveiled to show exactly what everyone knew was going to be there: costner bending to pick up a letter from a cutesy kid we saw earlier in the movie. a man tells bethlehem that no sir, you can't just take my wife; bethlehem runs the unsuspecting sod through, though he is the only person in the theater who is unsuspecting.<br /><br />but it is rank, cloying sentimentality that really undoes the postman. olivia williams, playing costner's lover abby, is worst served. she pours her heart into the material and gives her very best effort to make it sound natural and sincere. she tries so hard, it's heart-breaking. but nobody could ever have made the lines "i have a gift for you, postman . . . you give out hope like it's candy in your pocket" sound like anything but the syrupy pap that they are. another example is the scene where a mounted costner thunders past a little boy, ignoring his proffered letter, only to turn around, stare at him for what seems like five minutes, and then thunder back to pick up the letter. why didn't costner just pick it up the first time? no real reason; it's just an artifice that tries and fails to give us a feeling of elation by dashing the kid's hopes and then restoring them.<br /><br />schmaltz and predictability unite at the end as the statue of the postman is revealed. i sat thinking, "please don't tell me they're going to show the statue and then cut back to the scene with the cutesy kid. surely that is too saccharine, too obvious for even this movie." then, alas, the music swelled and we did indeed cut back to the dreaded little boy smiling as his letter to his maiden aunt is whisked away, and i held my head in my hands and thought, "somebody shoot me." it felt like having thirty pounds of apple pie rammed down my throat.<br /><br />gen. bethlehem is a more humanized villain than normal. your standard-issue post-apocalyptic villain is the meanest, toughest s.o.b. in the valley. bethlehem is shown to be a little nothing of a man inside, who tries to make himself feel important by beating up on others. although some menace is thereby sacrificed, bethlehem is credible in a way most villains aren't. unfortunately, will patton overacts. and although we are told early on that bethlehem utterly destroyed his last challenger in five seconds of hand-to-hand combat, bethlehem's actual fighting skills shown at the end of the movie are absolutely ludicrous.<br /><br />the acting is otherwise pretty good. costner has done better, but his razzie was an overreaction. as mentioned, olivia williams is very impressive. larenz tate as ford does a sincere and credible job. james newton howard's score is competent, though short of the epic standards the movie was going for. but it's not enough to save this film.<br /><br />rating: *1/2 out of ****.
