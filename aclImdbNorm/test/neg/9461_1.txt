one of the commenter's is wrong. this is not the only pat patterson film and he didn't die two years after this was made. he shot a film called the "electric chair" in pineville, nc. he shot this a few years after doctor gore. patterson died in the late 70's. i know this because he used my house and he left a cat there!! it sucked also. this was a big deal when the movie came out. no independent horror films were being made in nc. this movie didn't help matters. patterson used to do gore effects for h. g. lewis. he was also good at magic. his gore scenes in body shop were actually well done. the film was shot in a building that also housed a 7/11. you can actually see the tops of the walls in some scenes. the budget was less that $20,000 and the script looked like a child wrote it. only patterson could understand it. still...it's entertainment and it's a classic.
