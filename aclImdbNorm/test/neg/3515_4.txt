i recently watched this film on the sundance channel and it kept me interested from the start. however, it seems to take forever getting itself where it wants to go and in the end, i felt somewhat cheated. in a nutshell, noble willingham (of walker, texas ranger fame) plays a boat salesman who starts getting harassed by telephone from a man claiming to be his son. according to the mysterious caller, willingham has a dark, dirty little secret that affects the son and he (the son) is enjoying reminding him of it. i won't spoil anything for anyone but for me three things kept me from liking this movie a great deal. one, the movie has more foul language than goodfellas, scarface, casino, and glengarry glen ross combined. 99% of it is spewed from willingham himself. it didn't take long to wear me out with constant four-letter words. two, i simply could not believe that anyone would answer the telephone that many times, especially when one knows that a crank caller is on the other end of the line. no matter where willingham is in the movie whether it be at work, home, a diner, etc., the phone rings and he always answers it spewing venom at the "son", and then hanging up only to answer it again when the caller calls back in about ten seconds! how many of us would do that? now i realize that we probably do not have a movie if he doesn't keep answering, but i just could not suspend disbelief on that particular matter. three, and this is the most minor of the criticisms, why is the director so opposed to showing us the "corndog man" (a.k.a. the caller/son)? most of the time he's just a redneck sounding voice on the other end of the phone. i could have lived with that one if other things had fallen into place, but since they didn't it's just one more to tack on. i do give the movie credit for being a somewhat original idea and for holding my attention with suspense from the beginning but that's about it. do see it, if only one time. however, if you're like me, you'll be saying "triple k marine!" in your sleep for a night or two after you finish watching it.
