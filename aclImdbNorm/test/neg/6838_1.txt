spoilers!! bruce willis, the part-time comic and funny guy plays a hispanic assassin nicknamed after an african scavenger prairie dog? i guess all the good hispanic nicknames like sicatriz (scar), scorpion, viper, cobra, snake, tarantula, latigo (whip), navaja (blade), etc. were not available?? and why would some south american assassin be acquainted with a terrorist from the irish republican army?? last time i checked, the ira is not looking to open any branch headquarters in south america. and why would some prison-tough, battle-weary irish terrorist look like a middle-aged richard gere? i thought maybe this movie was going to be a spoof of "the crying game" when gere's character was introduced as the person who was going to hunt down "the jackal." what bad casting! and why would the fbi be hiring depraved terrorists in order to track down assassins?? it seems like a terrorist goes for mass destruction, and an assassin usually hits one target in a non-spectacular manner. but gere is the only person who has ever seen willis alive, according to the fbi. i thought this movie was supposed to be a remake of the very great film "day of the jackal" but this movie is just a dumber version of "assassins" with stallone and banderas. both of these movies are really dumb, and part of the dumb-ness is the fact that as the audience we are forced to watch bruce willis go through his routines and we should say "wow! isn't he smart!" the professional with jean reno was a much better movie about assassins. "the jackal" is just a movie about two fat middle-aged millionaire actors who could get paid for standing around looking pretty and pretending to be smart! "the jackal" is so poor, that i expected to see sly stallone, dennis rodman, mickey rourke, and jean clod van dumme making cameo appearances as "other" hitmen or fbi. needless to say, "the jackal" has eluded the fbi for twenty-five years, but as soon as richard gere gets on the job, it is only a few days before "the jackal" is kaput! i guess the positive message of this movie is, "thanks to terrorists, our streets are safe from assassins." overall, the "jackal" has no redeeming qualities.
