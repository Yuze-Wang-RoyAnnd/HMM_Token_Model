"congo" is based on the best-selling novel by michael crichton, which i thought lacked crichton's usual charm, smart characters and punch. well, sorry to say, but the same goes for the film.<br /><br />here's the plot:<br /><br />greed is bad, this simple morality tale cautions. a megalomaniacal c.e.o. (joe don baker) sends his son into the dangerous african congo on a quest for a source of diamonds large enough and pure enough to function as powerful laser communications transmitter (or is it laser weapons?). when contact is lost with his son and the team, his daughter-in-law (laura linney), a former cia operative and computer-freak, is sent after them. on her quest, she is accompanied by gee-whiz gadgetry and a few eccentric characters (including a mercenary (ernie hudson), a researcher with a talking gorilla (dylan walsh), and a a nutty indiana-jones-type looking for king solomon's mines (tim curry). after some narrow escapes from surface-to-air missiles and some african wildlife, they all discover that often what we most want turns out to be the source of our downfall.<br /><br /> the actors in this movie were not talented. dylan walsh acts like a pathetic crybaby, especially at the end; ernie hudson is unconvincing (is it no wonder he went on to star in tv films?) and laura linney is nothing special. i think i can safely say the only talented actors in this film had very small roles: joe don baker and tim curry, an always enjoyable actor (although sometimes scarred for life by constantly being reminded of his "rocky horror picture" days).<br /><br /> this movie also had some other problems, including awful direction style, cheesy dialogue and a just-plain-boring plot, which was completely hashed when compared to crichton's novel.<br /><br /> not even stan winston's creature effects could save this movie from being a disaster. i am deeply disappointed in this movie; there was not even a campy quality to redeem itself with. it was just plain awful, cheesy, boring and ridiculous, and proves to be one of the worst crichton book-to-film productions.<br /><br />2/5 stars -<br /><br />john ulmer
