apparently, in the eyes of some - there aren't enough horror films these days involving young people being chased across a desert by a mysterious, bloodthirsty madman in a truck. i mean, all we have so far is joy ride, wolf creek, jeepers creepers, monster man - among others. rest stop may very well be the worst out of those. it is about a girl and her boyfriend who leave their lives behind to start over together in california. along the way, they stop at a grimy lavatory so the young lady can relieve herself, but when she returns - she finds that her boyfriend and his car are gone. from there, she learns that the culprit is a guy driving a yellow pickup who proceeds to stalk and terrorize her as she hides in the restrooms. this movie is so unoriginal that it is flat out boring. the acting is annoying, the gore is mild, and the killer, whose identity is not revealed throughout the entire movie, is anything but memorable. terrible - terrible film...
