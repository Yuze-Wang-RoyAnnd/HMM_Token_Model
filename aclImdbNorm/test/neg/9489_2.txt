i saw this at my in-laws' house one night when it popped up on tv and my mother-in-law said it was one of her favorite movies. well, she can have it.<br /><br />look, i can enjoy a chick flick now and then, as long as it's good. but this one's extra-sappy, unrealistic, and just plain predictable, despite some decent performances from rock hudson and jane wyman. it's uncanny how quickly a woman can accept having her eyesight taken away from her. oh well, they say love is blind...<br /><br />the neat and tidy happy little ending nearly made me gag, too. and how often did we need otto kruger repeating the title? it happened not once, not twice, but three times!
