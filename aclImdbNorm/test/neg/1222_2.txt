it would be a shame if tommy lee jones and robert duval ever see this movie as they will probably be associated with it in years to come. "oh yeah", the public will say, "'comanche moon', that's the mini series about the texas rangers and the comanche indians that starred tommy lee jones and robert duval. it was a real stinker and probably the worst movie they were ever in. i think it was a comedy but a not very funny comedy. i really don't understand why they agreed to be in it". that would be such an injustice as the original "lonesome dove" was a true western classic and this turkey is a real bomb and jones and duval will be remembered for it.
