calling this film a decent or enjoyable horror tribute is far too optimistic. heck, you can't even refer to it as a nice spoof of the genre because it's way below average ( it's funny, but not "haha-funny, you know). but still i'd say to give it a look. if only for the huge amount of trivia elements in it. by the way, all those people who're complaining about this movie here in their comments have only themselves to blame. when you see the dvd-cover of this film, you should already know that it's not going to be on the same level as "the piano" for example, so don't come complaining afterwards...<br /><br />evil ed could've been something but the totally screwed it up. i suppose the main idea behind this film is criticism towards the growing 'cutting-committee' in horror nowadays. it shows an editor named edward who's slowly (well,not too slowly) going nuts by seeing all the violence and gore in the movies produced by his company produced. the big boss is named sam campbell...funny, isn't it ? personally i also expected a character named bruce raimi, but to my surprise there wasn't. anyway, this guy became rich by making movies called "loose limbs". they feature ( and i'm not kidding you! ) scenes in which a girl is getting raped by a beaver (?) and then gets shot in the head by a bazooka !!! now, who says horror isn't original anymore ?<br /><br />with all the gore and the 'loose limbs', it's hard to believe it but it really gets boring very quick. after a decent first 25 minutes, evil ed turns into complete boredom and never recovers from that. the only think left to do then ( besides pushing the eject-button, of course ) is look for the obvious amount of references to other, much better horror films. i saw scenes obviously stolen from the evil dead, silence of the lambs, braindead and several others.and there's a huge amount of classic horror posters on the walls to admire as well.<br /><br />evil ed finds it origin in sweden. i'm convinced there's a lot up talent there, far north ( take the danish "nattevagten" as an example )...but none of them talents joined the cast or crew of evil ed. only to see if you're in a dumb mood and you don't want to use your brain at all.
