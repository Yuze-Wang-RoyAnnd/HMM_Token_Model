oh, my. oh, this is a *really* bad movie. the acting is absolutely atrocious, the script is god-awful, and the photography is simply dreadful.<br /><br />what does make this movie stand out, however, is that you never once care about a single soul-- good guy or bad guy, living, dying or dead-- in the entire 87 minutes. "oh, s/he died? huh... figured they would" was the best reaction i could muster after each murder. characters are so black-or-white that with the volume turned off, you could still figure out who was who. while the cast's voices had an odd monotone quality throughout, their faces give the impression that you're looking at an old silent movie with a lot of eyebrow waggling, exaggerated frowns and "pensive looks". each character is a humorless, passionless, one-dimensional one-trick pony; once they fulfill whatever their particular role in this fiasco demanded their creation, they are summarily dismissed.<br /><br />it vaguely made me think of what would happen if thomas borch nielsen (director/writer of "skyggen", american title: "webmaster") decided to do a low-budget version of "american psycho" and got kind of distracted along the way.<br /><br />this isn't a particularly gruesome movie; the cold, passionless cast ensures that. it isn't an offensive movie; the director plays it so safe that no one could possibly find it so. it is, simply and after all, a bad movie.<br /><br />avoid it. we were not so fortunate and actually paid to watch this bomb on pay-per-view. as part of my penance, i'm writing this review.<br /><br />enough said.
