i think my summary says it all. this mtv-ish answer to the classic candid camera tv show features a gen x (or is that gen y) type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses, and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations. example: kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his "wedding." kennedy is the bride, done up in a full bridal gown and long wig. the "joke" is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his "bits and pieces." problem is, this schtick goes on way too long, obviously to fill out time. and kennedy is about as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun. candid camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took kennedy to get through this one, running around, constantly asking "do i look fat?" i recognize the show was not made for me. it was made for 12-year-old pinheads who think jackass is the height of comedy today. so let them laugh. thank god the show was short-lived.
