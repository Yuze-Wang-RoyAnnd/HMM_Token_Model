this is a standard action flick as we have seen them many times before. not much action in this one though. again it's about the guy protecting the president. he's macho - as usual, and at the same time soft and melancholic - as usual. does he have the guts to take a bullet for the president?! and then there's the girl and the usual conservative flirting around. stereotypical and predictable to the last toe-crumbling minute.
