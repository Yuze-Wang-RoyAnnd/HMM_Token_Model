okay it is terribly, and i mean terribly, easy to pick apart this film. c'mmon what do you expect with the title, synopsis, and actors in leads such as carol gilley, ralph baker jr., dorothy davis, bill thurman, and, my personal favourite, roger ready. yes, b star john agar is here as a sheriff out to rid the texan landscape of a robot-like ape from a nasa experiment gone awry. the movie has dreadful performances, dreadful scenery, dreadful special effects, and dreadful lighting. i really cannot find much good to say about it other than as bad films go you could do a lot worse as far as finding something dreadful to sit through. it is bearably short and has many moments of unintended humor. missed cues, lighting faux pas, off-screen terror, an unbelievably inane score, and of course john agar trying his level best to be the core of the film with an earnest performance amidst this muck. the beginning is the hardest part to sit through as it seems like it takes forever for these two teens to get their comeuppance for traveling in the woods down the texas back roads where great ape soon will reek his vengeance in his own terrible way...yeah right! night fright! bah!
