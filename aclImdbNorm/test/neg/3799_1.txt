awkward disaster mishmash has a team of scavengers coming across the overturned s.s. poseidon, hoping to loot it before it goes under for good. irwin allen's sequel to his 1972 blockbuster "the poseidon adventure" arrived in theaters seven years later! never mind that nobody cared anymore, why give us such a shoddy production, filled with dim characters and miscast actors, only to trash the memory of your biggest hit? one might end up feeling really sorry for michael caine, sally field, peter boyle, jack warden, karl malden and shirley jones were it not for their lost-at-sea expressions (good for a few stray laughs). there's a moment when saintly jones is tempted into taking some treasures just for herself and she timidly starts stuffing her pockets that is an unintended hoot. the film was a career bungler for all concerned, most especially allen, who never quite recovered from this. * from ****
