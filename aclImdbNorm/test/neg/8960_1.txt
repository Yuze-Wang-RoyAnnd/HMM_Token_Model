this movie is awful, i'm sorry. i bought this to get star worms, and actually expected this to be better after how disappointed i was in star worms. oh just kidding, turns out this is the worst movie i've ever seen. the acting is garbage, not that there really is any, and the main character is a big stupid box who gets attacked by like, stuff or something. i can't really tell. the special effects are so bad that you can't even see the warring dinosaurs, which by the way do not war, but just stand and kind of move their mouths, or whatever those things are. the movie is a headache. it's very obvious the director is trying to establish a universe. hahahahahahahaha... really, this movie is just abominable, even by troma's standards. the only good thing i can say about it is that it's got a lloyd kaufman intro, as he tricks us yet again into watching something that isn't fit for consumption.
