"the thomas crown affair" is a terrible remake of a not-very-good movie, redeemable only for the topless shots of former supermodel renee russo.<br /><br />that's it. the plot is negligible, pierce brosnan phoned in his part, and dennis leary (as usual) plays an annoying irish cop, but i couldn't take my eyes off the beautiful ms. russo. there's an okay love-making scene on a stairway, a terrifically sexy ballroom dance, a topless beach scene, and a roll in the sack. oh, and there's a painting stolen from a museum and a catamaran gets sunk.<br /><br />but let's hope other directors recognize ms. russo's perky attributes and cast her in more, highly-visible roles.
