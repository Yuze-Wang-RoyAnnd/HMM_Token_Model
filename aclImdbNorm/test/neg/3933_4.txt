the plot in petites coupures certainly left this viewer dumbfounded.<br /><br />***spoiler***<br /><br />in the space of 48hrs or so, auteuil's character has an affair with a teenager, loses his wife's affections, attempts to seduce scott thomas, is rejected by her goes on to grope yet another female character in the back of a car and then is finally shot for his trouble.<br /><br />***end of spoiler***<br /><br />wha ???<br /><br />the only saving grace in this flick is kristin scott thomas. similar to charlotte rampling, she seems a *natural* to star in french cinema. my hope is that one day francois ozon may cast her in a part where she can show her true talent.<br /><br />there are some fine french films such as the remarkable le colonel chabert begging for a dvd release, yet this is the tripe that gets chosen.<br /><br />avoid this one.<br /><br />zzzz..
