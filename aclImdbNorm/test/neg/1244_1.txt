what in the world! this piece of gambling cinema would have been suitable for the lifetime network. michael imperoli is a good actor but i think his portrayal as "stu" fell short. the montages were unbearable and too many. the supporting cast, where are you? whoever did the casting should be partially at fault. the cinematography was useless. a gambling story with an after school feel to it. stories of this sort should be left for the oliver stone's of the world. it would still suck ass but at least it would be fun to watch. it was an attempt that lost it's wheels before the race ever begun. mario andretti in the 1982 indy 500 came to mind.
