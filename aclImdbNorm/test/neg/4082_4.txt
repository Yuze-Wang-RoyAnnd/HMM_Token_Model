the creative team behind evan almighty really should have been able to make a better film. starring one of america's favourite funnymen and helmed by ace ventura pet detective director tom shadyac one expects a higher laugh count than the picture provides. hell even steve oedekerk who wrote and directed last years atrocious barnyard, and attains a writing credit here has done better work. the fact of the matter is that evan almighty isn't the worst picture of the summer season but it might well be the most disappointing. the title and creative team behind the picture suggest this is a sequel of sorts to 2003's bruce almighty. that picture had jim carrey in the lead, and whilst both steve carell and carrey are both funny guys it's the latter who's better suited to this sort of material. i've heard that carrey was offered this sequel before anyone else, but the actor declined staing he saw no other places for his character to venture. thus shadyac moved over to carell, who ever since an amusing bit part in the 2003 original has been gunning for stardom. after sleeper hits the 40 year old virgin and little miss sunshine the man has become big business, and so it's him rather than rubber faced jim who leads this production into theatres. the story see's evan baxter (steve carell) having been elected as a congressman and thus he and his troop move house and state so evan can find success with his job. his wife (lauren graham) and three kids have doubts but overall show a supportive side towards evan, who himself looks at the future with optimistic eyes. however things start to go belly up fairly fast, god (morgan freeman) appears to evan stating a flood is coming and that the politician must build an ark. initially ignoring the encounter, evan is quickly granted some robes a beard that refuses to stay shaved and animals are beginning to appear two by two. evan then begins to put the boat into construction but the neighbourhood aren't happy and neither is a fellow politician (john goodman). anyone expecting the wacky laughs of some of tom shadyac's other films will probably be left completely cold by this movie. ace ventura, liar liar and hell even bruce almighty where largely very funny pictures, but all of those ;projects have one thing in commen and thats jim carrey's presence. shadyac hasn't made a worthwhile film without carrey at the helm, he's worked with robin williams, eddie murphy and now steve carell, but still only carrey seems to meld successfully with shadyac. carell after the disappointing box-office and critical mauling won't be desperate to work with the director again, and with carrey now doing more serious projects shadyac had better find a new comic muse fast. carell himself is fairly dull here, whoever felt that his bit part in the first movie (despite being quite amusing) deserved a full length feature should be taken out back and shot. i expect after bruce almighty's box-office draw it was universal studios themselves, but you know when a quality comedian can't do anything with a character then the scren persona is a dud, and thats exactly the case with evan almighty. lauren graham isn't any great shakes as evan's wife nor do any of the children strike the right note. freeman lets it all hang loose as god in another amusing and chilled performance but he appears to sporadically to carry the piece. indeed the most consistent source of laughter is evan's secretary (wanda sykes) and creep co-worker (jonah hill), both made me laugh twice as much as any other character in the project. oedekerk's writing has been worse (barnyard) but also better (ace ventura when nature calls) than his work on this production. his script does have genuinely funny moments but it's also full of cloying family moments and the humour is never weird or indeed offensive enough. the film takes tame and easy swipes at religion when it ought to rip the concept to shreds, indeed the opening church sequence in the simpsons movie shakes religion harder than evan almighty's whole 95 minute run. with a bit more daring and heart this could have been a far better picture. i don't doubt that the core family audience will be mildly entertained by this film, but if they'll be satisfied is a completely different question. there's a line between being watchable and being worthwhile, a line that evan almighty is always on the wrong side off. maybe when you're feeling bored and the films on cable you can afford to watch, but i can think of plenty better ways to spend my time and indeed more importantly my money than tuning into this mediocre comedy.
