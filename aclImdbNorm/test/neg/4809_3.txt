adela is a rebellious teenager with the attitude that she is right and everyone else is wrong. she needs to be the center of attention and she'll act stupid to make it so. with her attitude she gets sent to charm school.<br /><br />there she meets the typical characters in today's cinema; the nerd, the clumsy one, the stepford housewife and the sexual minority. things happen and in the end adela "learns her lesson" so to speak. the plot tries to carry a deeper meaning to the state adela is in, but utterly fails to deliver (at least i didn't buy it). so what you are left with is superficial interaction within the same stereotypes you've seen in a million movies before. plus the director seems to have a breast fixation, adela flashes her boobies a few times too many, at least i can't see that they are relevant to the story.<br /><br />so the film is ok, but if you are like me and don't like to watch a teenager pissing people off and making a behavioral u-turn in an instant, which i found very unbelievable, think twice before watching.
