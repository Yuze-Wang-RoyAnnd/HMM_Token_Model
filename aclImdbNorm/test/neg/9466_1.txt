my friends and i have watched this so many time i have lost count. this is worth seeing for those in the right frame of mind, meaning that this is not so much a good horror film as a film to lampoon for its funny quotes and bad effects. this film is best watched with other like minded individuals so you have someone to laugh with.<br /><br />you'll laugh as greg leaps and shuffles around the lab, petting his pet rabbit, while his hunchback shifts from right to left on his back. "greg, stop clowning!", scolds dr. brandon. you'll laugh as j.g. patterson gives hand signals to direct greg to the other side of the operating table, while his hand is in the shot. and you'll probably chuckle when you realize that the final woman has none of the features he used to construct her with.
