if i could give this excuse for a film a 0 or negative rating i would. i was stupid enough to pick this dvd up in the shop, read the blurb and think, that sounds quite good, i'll spend lb10 and buy it. all i got at the end of it was a lb10 coaster. absolutely awful, i don't even know where to begin. i have no idea why anyone has given this more than 2 stars because i can't think of one good thing to say about it. <br /><br />the plot is basically, 7 people go into an unexplored cave, one of them is a reporter. no-one else knows they are there. when they get in the cave, they can't get out and they get killed off one by one by a monster. there turns out to be no reason for the reporter. one of the characters has some past demons where his ex girlfriend drowns in a cave 2 years ago... there seems to be no relevance or reason for that either, just a rubbish attempt at character building i assume? anyway, the monster turns out to be a guy that wandered into the cave as a normal little kid and has lived in there all his life. this for no reason makes him superhuman, able to glow, see in the dark, take bullets, breathe underwater, be in 2 places at once and have insane strength (able to move boulders, carry grown men as dead weight, etc). <br /><br />in the end scene there are 2 women left alive, they wake up naked, just covered in some bit of rug or something. they then find a picture of a kid. the monster then bursts in the door, wrapped in a carpet with some sort of animal skull over his head (says in the directors commentary it was a crow's skull, if so that would be the frekin biggest crow i have seen in my life) and quite literally goes "raaahhh" like a kiddie on halloween. i was watching it with my boyfriend and at that point he literally burst out laughing. the guy then sees a picture of himself as a kid and has a flashback to him sitting under a tree with his face all burnt and then getting up and wandering into the cave. that is the extent of the back story to why he mutilates people and it leaves you feeling a bit cheated for a story. the monster then kills one of the women and brutally rapes the other one, cut to end credits. i know the rape scene was designed to be shocking, but as a woman it just made me feel quite ill and was the thing that affected me the most in the whole film. he could have killed her and cut her into pieces and ate her and it would have been less horrific than the rape scene.<br /><br />there are so many things that are left unanswered at the end. aside from all this, the scenes where there was minutes at a time of just black and nothing else was annoying and the constant nauseating camera angles where it's all upside down and you can't see what's going on wound me up so much at one point i almost turned it off. an absolutely terrible film. you might as well get the money you were going to spend on it and set fire to it, it would be money better spent, as like some clever person posting above me said, once you've watched it, you can't un watch it.
