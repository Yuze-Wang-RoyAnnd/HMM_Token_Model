hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world. it only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap re-invented over and over again. take superheroes for example, for each x-man and spiderman, there are daredevil, elektra, ghost rider and hulk. japanese horror remakes are even worst. it only took the ring, which was pitch-perfect (mostly because of mr. gore verbinsky), to bring a ton of look-alike creepy-woman based horrors, e.g. the ring 2, the eye, dark water (which was fine, but pointless), and the grudges.<br /><br />the first grudge wasn't entirely bad. it was scary most of the way, which is what one could expect from it. plus, the plot had some brains mixing narratives. grudge 2 is exactly like the previous; this could be a good thing, but hey, what boy men in black ii? was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain? for the grudge 2, the critic goes the same way.<br /><br />tired scares, bad acting (except for amber tamblyn), and clich'es all over the place. three stories take place, on different places and time. there is aubrey (tamblyn) investigating what drove her sister karen (sarah michelle gellar) to death; allison (arielle kebbel) who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place; and finally, an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door. glad to say (and i mean it) that everything is tied up at the end, but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture, when everything else is simply tiresome and dull.<br /><br />the chills are all over there, a girl alone in the lockers, someone who shouldn't enter a house, others that dig too deep. meanwhile, ghosts keep killing and killing and killing, which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic. hey, doesn't that seem just like another bad japanese remake, something called pulse? yeah, day after day it's getting easier to hold a grudge... against hollywood bullshits.
