i'm really not going to waste my time with in depth analysis, i'm just going to say that i'm extremely disappointed that catherine zeta-jones made the mistake of being in the main role in this absurd, nonsense, in this full of clich'es boring to death thoughtless pathetic try in film-making! there is no point in trying to find the positive sides of this movie, because as a whole it is poor in every single way, and the saddest thing is that zeta-jones is dragged so uncompromisingly into the clich'es, that she has absolutely no chance of showing even 1% of her talent!<br /><br />avoid this movie even at the opportunity of spending the night at home starring at the wall!!!
