hands of the ripper <br /><br />aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />sound format: mono<br /><br />an edwardian doctor (eric porter) uses newfangled freudian analysis on a young girl (angharad rees) who turns out to be the daughter of jack the ripper, and just as deadly...<br /><br />unlikely hammer horror, in which a respectable society figure takes charge of a beautiful young waif without attracting so much as a whiff of scandal, even when she takes to murdering all and sundry with a variety of lethal implements (broken mirrors, hat-pins, etc.)! l.w. davidson's screenplay wanders aimlessly from one murder to another, sacrificing the material's inherent subtext (porter's obvious attraction to rees) in favor of commercial melodrama, and the tone remains subdued throughout. some of the gore scenes are surprisingly vivid, even for hammer, and these were clipped from the original us release (despite an r rating from the mpaa), though the complete version is now available on home video. porter and rees give excellent performances, and the climax in st. paul's cathedral is a definite highlight, but the rest of the film is strangely hollow and unaffecting. directed by peter sasdy.
