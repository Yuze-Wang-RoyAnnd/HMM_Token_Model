it's certainly a direct-to-video, but the story is not as bad as most of the other reviewers think. i quite like the fact the hero is doing the wrong thing most of the time.<br /><br />the hero's reactions and the reactions of the rebels are just human. the hopper character is actually playing god. that might be the right thing to do, but one may not like that anyway.<br /><br />in the end, the god player is doomed to death, and the hero, who would have spent his own life, can live. quite a morale. :-)<br /><br />the most unrealistic thing i saw, is that earth is doing so well with no moon stabilizing its rotation.
