the bridge at remagen contains some of the most preposterous war time screenplay i've ever seen. aside from the acting, which is wooden, no tank commander attacks with his tanks parked in nice neat rows, up the middle of roads, and with troops bunched all together with their arms not at the ready. the constant suicidal behavior set off my "tilt switch" so often i found it impossible to enjoy the movie. apparently the screen writers and director have never been through actual warfare and never bothered to bring in an expert who had. this movie is the very antithesis of the excellent detail in saving private ryan. unless you are under 7 years old, i recommend watching something else.<br /><br />gb
