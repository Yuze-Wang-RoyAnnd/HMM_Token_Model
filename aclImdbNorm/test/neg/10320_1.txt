i saw this one remastered on dvd. it had a big picture of sandra on it and said "starring sandra...." and made it seem like she had a big part in it. not so. she's barely in it. she does what she can with the script, but that's not much. <br /><br />the sound was awful. by that i mean things didn't go together. shots would be fired and the number of shots didn't correspond to the sound. people talking in a car while it's moving and the shot is from outside the windshield but there's no motor noise, road noise, or any other sound. kind of weird.<br /><br />score was awful. it sounded like the same few notes over and over. dialog really awful. <br /><br />acting was awful, i couldn't believe any of it. fight scenes were like a batman comic without the "biff", and "bam". they were really lame. the shooting scenes, i mean with firearms, were laughable, literally. i fast-forwarded through a lot of this movie. even then, it was too long.
