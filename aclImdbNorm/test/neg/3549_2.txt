request you to not watch this movie... it starts with a promise and as it goes on you crave for the movie to end... predictable,not entertaining at all,wasted movie... save your time and watch better thrillers.... the synopsis sounds good and that is why i watched the movie... but it was way too predictable with nothing to give you a start... no great suspense.. no great direction... nothing phenomenal with the acting... shy away from this... low rating... nothing to write about this movie so i am filling up the remaining lines of text so you can imagine how much a time waster this movie is...really irritated at how good a premise that was and how bad a screenplay was written out of it...
