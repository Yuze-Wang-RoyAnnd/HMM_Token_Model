this is horrific. no really, this is ,bar none, the absolute worst...worst...i hesitate to even call it a @&$%in' _movie_. it is a ninety minute visual root canal. the plot is practically non-existent: a mad scientist who looks like the frontman from 'the cars' impregnates a woman in his secret lab, a lawn chair in what i think may be a garage, via an injection of palmolive. within hours she births a full grown monster who then goes on a rampage. thats the whole movie. the death scenes: these are poorly set up, take _forever_, and the acting...how can you mess up _screaming_?? the victims stand there while the growling, wheezing, congested freak advances on them and proceeds to limply strangle them for about three days. the sets are cheesy, the lighting for most of the movie consists of a single maglite (yes, a big honkin' flashlight), the sound quality is poor, theres only about 40 words of dialogue for the entire movie and the acting is generously described as wooden. footage is shamelessly recycled to pad out the movie. and the special effects would make any bbc sci-fi production shake their head and proclaim "they didn't even try". the 'monster' is some nameless in a $3 halloween rubber mask with a few bandages slapped on. in its encounter with the lone cop of the movie the cop fires flashless, smokeless, invisible bullets that apparently travel so slow the monster can dodge them at five paces. don't see this movie. no really, thats not a dare. don't see this movie. the director should be shot. the writer should be chained to a giant rock where his liver will be devoured every morning by ed wood. enough rentals and there could be a sequel, don't let it happen!
