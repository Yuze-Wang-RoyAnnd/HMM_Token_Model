i too had waited a long time to see this film. as far as i know it has never been released in australia so in the end i found a copy on the net and ordered it through there. weeks after my order confirmation it finally arrived and i was extremely excited to finally be sitting in front of my tv ready to watch a film that sounded so interesting and controversial and filmed in an area of the world where so many good movies are. what a disappointment. within the first few minutes i realised i'd ordered a b grader but was still full of expectation. i convinced my son (18) to watch it with me as i love sharing when i find a movie of value with good underlying statements and/or story lines. about half way through he got up and said he couldn't stand watching it any longer, it was so predictable and amateurish. i agreed but watched to the end. the acting was atrocious even for b grade standards. the stereotyping also predictable and i feel for the good folks of lake arthur, louisianna who must've cringed after seeing the film depicting them in such a way. no doubt some racial prejudices still exist in many parts of the world not just the states but really, in this day and age i doubt they'd get away with all the ridiculous alibi's presented in this. i had to double check the date the film was made as their attempts at gimmicky filming of the more gruesome scenes was something i'd expect from a high school student's first attempt at making a film 'indy' like. i'd like to see this film put into the hands of experienced scriptwriters and film makers, its an old tale but one that could still pack a punch if dealt with professionally. so disappointed after such a long wait and with such high expectations. the soundtrack was probably the only thing i enjoyed.
