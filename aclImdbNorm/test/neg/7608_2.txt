i watched a movie called dark talon, dated 1974. the credits to this movie are exactly the same as dark star, so i'm going to presume it was an alternate title. dark talon was nowhere near as funny as everyone else here states. the acting was lame, the editing slipshod, and overall stupid. at the beginning there's an annoying 1970's trucking song called "benson, arizona" that has absolutely nothing to do with the movie. basically the plot revolves around a small crew of an interstellar bomber that goes around bombing places that are unstable. the bombs are sentient and respond to people. the obligatory disaster disrupts communication between the bombs and the crew. one of the crewmen goes out and has an absurdly idiotic existential conversation with the bomb that made no sense whatsoever. the movie i saw was done in under an hour and a half, with commercials thrown in, so i suspect that dark talon is an overedited version of dark star.<br /><br />the alien is an inflatable red beach ball spray painted with a pair of monster hands that it walks on. it was silly and unconvincing as an alien.<br /><br />it's hard to believe that john carpenter had a hand in this. his other movies were so much better.
