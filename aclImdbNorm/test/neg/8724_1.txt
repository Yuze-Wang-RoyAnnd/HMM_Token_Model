this is the "battlefield earth" of mini series. it has with a few exceptions, all the disastrous ingredients that doomed that movie and will follow it to the grave in the turkey cemetery. they are both adaptations of books with a endless amount of pages who has been turned to a complete mess by a script writer and a director (in this case they are the same person.) who clearly don't know what they are doing, they have both a messiah wannabe that don't really deliver, as a hero (played in this case by a guy that looks like mark hamill but sadly the force is not with him.) and a bunch of stupid bad guys who likes to betray and mess up the life for each other, they are both containing scenes stolen from better productions and they are both cheap productions who tries to look expensive with some (often badly made) computer animation. the exceptions that actually makes the whole thing worse is the terrible work made by the lighting guy who don't even have the skills to turn on the light in his own living room, the camera work that for no reasons at all sometimes are in tilted "battlefield earth" mode but for the most of the time are flat as a pancake, the extremely cheap and to small desert set that only contents a pile of sand in the front of a backdrop painted as a desert, that turns very old very fast because it appears in almost every scene, and the bad idea by the costume designer to try to mimic "the fifth element"'s fashion madness with the addition of the silliest hats ever made. silly moments to remember: 1. every scene with the guild guys, who looks like mst3k's observer guys but with silly hats. 2. irulan shows up at the party dressed in her butterfly dress (why butterflys? -was the one with stuffed parrots in the cleaner?) with matching silly hat, together with a couple of guys with silly balloon hats. 3. paul the stand-up comedian. 4. baron harkonnen in over acting overdrive, screaming "i,m alive". 5. every scene with the backdrop, because it newer fits the foreground 6. every scene with the fremen's fake religious cermonies, specially the "water of life" cermony. 7. the battle scenes where the same guys gets killed a couple times and the same things explodes over and over again. it is a lot more but it is a 1000 words limit on this so i better stop before i gets carried away.
