honestly awful film, bad editing, awful lighting, dire dialog and scrappy screenplay.<br /><br />the lighting at is so bad there's moments you can't even see what's going on, i even tried to playing with the contrast and brightness so i could see something but that didn't help.<br /><br />they must have found the script in a bin, the character development is just as awful and while you hardly expect much from a jean-claude van damme film this one manages to hit an all time low. you can't even laugh at the cheesy'ness.<br /><br />the directing and editing are also terrible, the whole film follows an extremely tired routine and fails at every turn as it bumbles through the plot that is so weak it's just unreal.<br /><br />there's not a lot else to say other than it's really bad and nothing like jean-claude van damme's earlier work which you could enjoy.<br /><br />avoid like the plaque, frankly words fail me in condemning this "film".
