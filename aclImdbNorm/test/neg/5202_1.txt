this is an awful movie from just about every point of view. since much has been already pointed out in previous reviews, let me just focus on "serbs" and "delta force" guys in this movie.<br /><br />1) the uniforms that "serbs" wear are not serbian. and helmets are wrong, too.<br /><br />2) the actors who play "serbs" are not speaking serbian, not even a language close to serbian, unlike in "behind enemy lines" where the czech actors did their best to speak the language and add at least a bit of credibility to the movie.<br /><br />3) the gray-bearded "serbian general" looks and acts like a moron, firing his gun whenever us soldiers call his name: <br /><br />- us soldier: "gravic! give up!"<br /><br />- gray-bearded moronic general: (fires his ak47)<br /><br />- us soldier: "gravic! come out!"<br /><br />- gbmg: (fires his ak47)<br /><br />- us soldier: "gravic! you're surrounded"<br /><br />- gbmg: (fires his ak47)<br /><br />- prop guy: "excuse me, mr. gray-bearded moronic general, see, we're out of blanks and i sent the boy to buy some more, but he's not back yet..."<br /><br />- gbmg: (click)<br /><br />4) since when does the army issue ak47s to the delta force? i guess they couldn't find enough working m4s in bulgaria, but there were plenty of old ak47s and practice blanks ;) maybe they should have went for some airsofts, they are cheaper and wouldn't have hurt the credibility of the movie anyway...<br /><br />5) in the scene where a df officer is hanging on a rope while talking to a rocket scientist, he is holding his finger on the trigger all the time. no sane person with any weapons training or just plain common sense would ever do that. i guess the actor figured that his coolness level increases the longer he holds the gun that way. <br /><br />this movie is such an insult to common sense..
