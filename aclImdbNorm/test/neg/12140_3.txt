<br /><br />well, great costumes and a wonderful `feel' for pre wwii italy. but what happened here? <br /><br />great actors...kristin scott thomas, sean penn, anne bancroft, james fox, derek jacobi ...if you can't get memorable performances out of this `a list' then the problem with this movie must be blamed on pitiful direction and an inadequate script. i rented this on dvd after having liked "angels & insects" (1995) also directed by philip haas. <br /><br />yipes! i can hardly believe how dull this thing was. it just dragged on and on and no one was able to save the poor thing. this is not even a good intriguing-foreign-dudes-and-young-things-in- pretty-clothes chick flick!<br /><br />"tea with mussolini" gone amuck!<br /><br />
