i have seen tons of trash, in every language, about every topic and of every trend of film-making. from every period, every director and any kind of budget available. that said i really have to declare:<br /><br />this is one of the three worst movies i have ever seen.<br /><br />it's painfully bad. it's pompous. it's grim. it's incomprehensible. it's annoying. it's a really bad mess. it is a piece of you-know-what.<br /><br />and, what's more important: it lacks a point. and even if it had one, the characters are so unreal and annoying that it's impossible to overlook the lack of cohesion of the whole thing.<br /><br />it's just weird for the sake of being weird.<br /><br />i actually felt sick watching this trash. the theater where i saw it (lincoln center in new york) was full when it started. by the end of it, half of the audience had walked out. there was a q&a programmed at the end but nobody stayed. with the exception of about two sickos everybody else ran for the door, myself included. <br /><br />save 2 hours of your life. it's probably one of the worst ever done.<br /><br />if there is a movie theater in hell, this movie will be playing 24/7, for eternity...
