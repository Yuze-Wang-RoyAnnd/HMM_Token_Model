this movie is not worth seeing, at least not at a cinema. the story is hard to follow and understand (it starts with 10 minutes of something happening 3 years earlier). it's hard to know if this movie is trying to be a comedy or just is so bad/weird that it sometimes seems like it. american sirens and lights on swedish police cars is just one example. the acting of persbrandt and bergqvist is good as usual, but i think jenny lampa acting as jasmin acts very poor. zara zetterqvist acts pretty well, she's not been seen as an actor in swedish movies for a long time. if you still want to see it, wait until it's released on dvd or is shown on tv.
