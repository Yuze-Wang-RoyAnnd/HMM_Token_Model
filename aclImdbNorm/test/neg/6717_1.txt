i think this movie was made backwards, first they shoot a whole lot of scenes and action, and explosions, and then the story-writers got to work trying to find a story to tie all scenes up together. this movie is without any doubt the worst movie i have ever seen, your average porn movie comes with a much better written and much more coherent script. the movie makes no sense. seriously, even if you are a segal fan there's no reason you should ever want to see this movie, except if you're one of those folks that like to stare at accidents, because this is a horrible accident, and should never have been released upon this world.<br /><br />boran.
