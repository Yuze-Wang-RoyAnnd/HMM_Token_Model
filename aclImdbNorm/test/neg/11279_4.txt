for a film made in senegal, based, i guess loosely on carmen, the book, by prosper merimee, this film doesn't achieve a mere resemblance of the story that has been made famous as an opera and as other films.<br /><br />ms. gai as the karmen of the title is very good to look at. her fiery dancing smolders the screen, as is the case with her torrid love scene at the beginning of the film.<br /><br />this is a karmen that aims to please to all genders, but a real carmen, she is not!<br /><br />we would like to see ms. gai in other films in which her talent is better used than here.
