the first two movies of this series excelled for their footage of the natural world and ordinary people stuck in the midst of society. this movie doesn't have any of that natural footage, which i understand is part of the point, but it really makes the entire video component of the film seem like random images stuck together-- ones and zeroes flying around, computer models of human skeletons, and so forth. occasionally the stock footage is put to good effect (the nationalism/finance segment around 35:00), but usually it makes the video appear to lack any meaningful content, and demands you accept the context of the stock photographers rather than the context of the director. it's no better than the video displayed on a karaoke machine. three stars added for the philip glass soundtrack.
