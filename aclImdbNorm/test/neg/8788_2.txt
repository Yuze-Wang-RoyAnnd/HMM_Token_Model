hubie -- like stanely the troll from bluth's a troll in central park -- lacks the spark of personality to be the main character that carries an entire movie. we're supposed to like him because he's nice, but that's about all he is.<br /><br />his character design is unappealing. the top of his head is a sort of dome that is narrower than the pudgy bottom half of his head.<br /><br />and penguins should not have teeth. i know that iago the parrot in aladdin had teeth, but maybe that worked because it made him look more like his voice actor, gilbert gottfried. hubie, with his weenie little voice (provided by martin short), looks funny with that big set of chompers in his beak.<br /><br />tim curry, who is usually delightful at being evil, does some sort of dippy surfer dude accent as the villain (might have been a good voice for a comic relief accomplice, not the supposedly menacing main villain).<br /><br />the entire plot revolves around the hero and villain's love for female penguin marina, who is just as dull as both of her suitors.<br /><br />worst of all is the pacing. we keep cutting back to the villain to watch him threaten marina some more - this time in dialogue, this time in song...<br /><br />barry manilow may be a great songwriter, but in animated films like this and thumbelina, his songs feel limp and listless - especially the ballads. the only song i liked was the 1930's-ish "good ship misery" song.<br /><br />i read that the distributor made some cuts in this film against the filmmaker's wishes, and that could have caused some of the problems - though i suspect the real problem is that they didn't cut the rest of it ;).
