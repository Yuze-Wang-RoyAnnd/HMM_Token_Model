simply miserable lana turner-ezio pinza vehicle. pinza had a beautiful voice but he rarely uses it in a film that reminded me of "the student prince" with adults. pinza is no leading man either. he looks like an elderly man ready to collect social security and go fishing.<br /><br />the plot is extremely thin and the supporting cast of barry sullivan, marjorie maine and debbie reynolds are given so little to do. sir cedric hardwicke comes in at the end to announce that our king ezio had better return to his people. as far as i'm concerned, the faster the better. is that lana turner really singing with pinza? not bad if it is her. the picture would also remind me in a way of the 1960 movie "the prince and the showgirl" with marilyn monroe and laurence olivier.
