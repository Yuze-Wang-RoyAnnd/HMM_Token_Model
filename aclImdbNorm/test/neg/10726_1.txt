oh my lord, what were they thinking about with this one. it not only is frantically unfunny, but worse, a very good original was trashed in the bargain. jane fonda, believe it or not, actually turned in the performance of her life in that one. even better than where she plays the whore in the other so called performance of her life. maybe she is just flat good as a crook. any other time, wow, what a waste of time. but she and segal team up beautifully, so if you even remotely got a glimpse of anything funny in this baby, catch the anvil upon which it got beaten into a pulp from.<br /><br />because very very very little of that one remains, to this ones horror. nothing in this baby is remotely funny except for maybe a couple of moments when dick and jane are bulging lipped up as lepers and cant kiss..... and uhh........oh my lord, that's it? well, looks like it. <br /><br />it truly is that bad a film.
