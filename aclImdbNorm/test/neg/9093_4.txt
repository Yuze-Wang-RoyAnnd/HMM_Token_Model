i really couldn't get into this movie. the plot is some old woman has been torturing someone so long that he is deformed. she dies and he is left in the basement to starve. months must pass and a family moves in. the daughter is blind because of an accident caused by the father. well anyway this guy in the basement, who for all rights should be long dead is still around. he eats a cat and now is superhuman. he now wants to eat people and have sex. and when a hooker dies father gets the blame. i always dislike movies where someone else is blamed for the killings because you always here the typical lines "i didn't do it", "i could never do such a thing", blah blah blah. and the family storyline could be a lifetime movie storyline.
