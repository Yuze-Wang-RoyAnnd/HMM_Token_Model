well, at least we have to acknowledge the big hollywood horror-producers are finally getting smarter and more perceptive. instead of patiently waiting to buy the rights of asian horror hits and subsequently remake them in america, they now discovered they could simply hire the asian directors and assign them to make their brand new ghost story directly in the states. that's like killing two birds with one stone; way to go guys! "the messengers" is pretty much identical to every other supernatural chiller that came out of the oriental countries ever since "ringu". roughly translated, this means it's a boring, overlong and entirely gore-free film, but it does feature copious amounts of false scares and embarrassingly weak "did we scare you yet?" moments. the pang brothers (danny & oxide) previously made the extremely overrated "the eye" and it sort of is a tradition for them to build up a story with clues and hints towards a point where it becomes nearly impossible to meet the expectations of their curious audiences, yet they don't seem eager to alter their formula any time soon. and they're also unscrupulous enough to recycle the same old & repetitive ghost topics over and over again. restless spirits of the previous inhabitants trapped in the walls of a remote countryside farm? the protagonist family torn apart by unprocessed traumas from the past, so they first have to restore faith and trust in each other? give me a break! throw in a videotape and a seven-days-curse, why don't you? even the attempts to make you jump in your seat are too d'ej`a-vu and won't scare anyone over the age of 7. slamming doors, filthy & gradually larger growing stains on the walls, ghostly appearances, noises coming from the cellar... the endless overuse of cheap tricks like this is almost becoming insulting to horror fans. "the messengers" revolves on a family on their way to a new life in the country as the growers of sunflowers. the family situation is kind of dysfunctional since a personal tragedy (which doesn't get revealed until late in the film) caused their youngest son to stop talking and the parents to distrust their revolting teenage daughter. soon after, the children experience strange presences in remote farmhouse, but they don't manage to convince their parents to leave. that's pretty much concludes the entire film. little ben sees things but he can't talk and jessica repeatedly gets attacked by supernatural forces but nobody listens to her. the basic premise of "the messagers" is very derivative of stanley kubrick's immortal classic "the shining", only it lacks the constantly ominous atmosphere and disturbing tone. the script takes itself far too seriously even though it's fairly easy to predict the final denouement and the total absence of violence and bloodshed is unforgivable. at least "the eye" delivered some genuine shocks in the end, whereas the happy happy joy joy ending of "the messengers" is just pathetic. the only positive elements i can think of are the beautiful rural filming locations, the adequate editing job and the promising young acting talents (and beauty) kristen stewart. and there's an uncanny, but sadly underdeveloped supportive role for william b. davis.
