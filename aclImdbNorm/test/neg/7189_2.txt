the creators of this movie must have sat down one day and said "let's make fun of the russians and at the same time show people how advanced we (americans) are". the movie portrays the russians as an inferior people who are unable to understand the brilliant ideas put forward by the americans. it is true that american campaigns are probably more professional and more based on expensive studies than campaigns in any other countries are. however, this movie goes to far and it exaggerates the differences between east and west. to me it looked like a propaganda movie made during the cold war.
