thomas edison may have done lots of great inventions but wtf is this!!!! i am sorry but this movie is simply awful. the plot is that this elephant walks to a certain point & gets electrocuted. okay the picture quality looked like someone used it for toilet paper. i thought that the early charlie chaplin films were awful. okay thomas edison may have been an inventor but why did he make this film he could have filmed a baby being fed & it would have been better. people might say i'm being harsh on the times but would you enjoy something like this from what i have said edison may have made the lightbulb but why did he make this particular movie. well i might sound like a complete a##hole but watch this on youtube then you will see this abomination. i still can't believe this film is completely awful. all in all the worst short film i have ever seen.<br /><br />rating: 1/10
