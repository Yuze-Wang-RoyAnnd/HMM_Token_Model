i'm sort of between the gushy review and the hate review. i've been a fan of lovecraft (and a lovecraft 'purist') for a long time, and while this little amateur film was of poor quality it had a number of redeeming qualities. i went into viewing expecting the worst thing i've ever seen, and wondering if lovecraft would turn in his grave over it, but i was shocked to find that i actually kind of liked it.<br /><br />i don't want to catalog the movie's faults, so i'll only mention a few that keep this movie from being a 'stellar amateur effort'.<br /><br />it's very low budget and shot on a video cam, so it has the look of some soap operas, but once you get used to the idea then it ceases to be a big deal. the direction is pretty amateur and the shot framing and use of distance in the shots is rather clumsy. still, this film was actually kind of creepy and it stayed more faithful to lovecraftian intent than nearly all the stuart gordan and brian yuzna travesties (my main exception to those films being re-animator and dagon) put together. the idea of being impregnated by some old one is reminiscent of dunwich horror and shadow over innsmouth (which isn't to say this movie is as good as those stories!!), so the overall plot is quite faithful to lovecraft's ideas. one thing that annoyed me was that words out of the bible seemed to make a zombie prisoner upset and afraid. i'm not sure if this was meant to indicate that 'god's' words upset the old ones or just this particular zombie. there was no real answer to that. the rest of the christian symbolism in it reminds me of august derleth's take on the mythos. so in a way this was a derleth style take on the mythos.<br /><br />i would recommend this film only as a curiosity. it shows how a fairly atmospheric movie can be made with nearly zero budget. i liked the setting of the wine cellars. the outdoor shots were sad, though. using the same stretch of beach and trees (and nearly the same damn shot) to convey 3 characters' long journey was really sad. the director needs whack upside the head for that. the acting was standard for an amateur film, with the blonde zombie girl getting a personal award for "best impersonation of gollum by an italian actress". actually i think this film was done prior to the lord of the rings movies. maybe andy sedaris watched her and thought "dang, she'd make a great gollum!" <br /><br />one little kudo to the director, though. the makeup on the zombies was like bad goth kids. i was upset seeing this and nearly stopped watching. i was like "oh so that's how we know she's evil and possessed", but later on in the movie you see a girl painting makeup like that on the face of an older woman (both living). so it wasn't an attempt to say 'goth makeup = zombie' but rather, 'goth makeup was left on after zombification'. however, possessed/zombie does equal 'blue contact lenses'...heh.<br /><br />on the whole, i still liked this movie better than the yuzna and gordan films (barring the aforementioned exceptions). yuzna and gordan had much better budgets, but this film did a better job at filming a lovecraft-like story than they did, and on a tiny budget.<br /><br />one quick word to the the make-up artist: i know you wanted 'claws' or something on zariah's fingers, but long, black press-on nails looked really silly.<br /><br />a quick word to the writer of the score: i know you couldn't resist, and apparently neither could the director who okayed it, but when the two characters square off with guns for a 'duel', playing that little whistle from "the good, the bad, and the ugly" killed any mood that scene had accumulated. it was cute, but cute wasn't appropriate.<br /><br />the filmmakers of this movie have read lovecraft and had a great deal of respect for him. i enjoyed the little nods here and there: the character carter with the bad dreams, and the character pickman who becomes a ghoulish zombie.
