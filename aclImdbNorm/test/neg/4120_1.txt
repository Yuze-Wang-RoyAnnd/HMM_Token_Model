tedium as only the french can do it. i checked my watch for the first time 7 minutes in, and with 143 minutes left, i also considered walking out. i won't even try to discuss the incoherence of the "plot" or the inability of the characters to be personable because at about 1 hour in, i realized none of this mattered. it was not merely self-indulgent or pretentious, it was a vacuum. a soul-sucking vacuum. this film has no saving grace, no enjoyable character, nothing funny, and nothing sad. it isn't smart enough to be drama and there's no moment that's in the slightest bit farcical. the most intriguing thing about this movie is how it has managed to get mostly glowing and positive reviews. i was tricked by those reviews, but you don't have to be, gentle reader. all i want for christmas is my three hours back.
