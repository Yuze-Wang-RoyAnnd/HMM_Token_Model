riotously cheesy lunacy about lava spewing from the la brea tar pits in los angeles. even if you attempt to suspend disbelief by ignoring this ludicrous premise, you'll still be howling with laughter at the inane dialog, nonsensical plot contrivances, and wildly reckless scientific plot holes that parade across the screen.<br /><br />i have a theory: every successful actor is doomed to appear in at least one bad movie at some point in his/her career. this was tommy lee jones's turn. although he makes a decent effort, the script is just so pathetic even he goes down in flames (oops, sorry about that). most of the supporting cast is also choked by the hackneyed writing; a few of the actors simply phone in their roles. anne heche deserves special hall of shame recognition for her awkward portrayal of a scientist. she is about as convincing in this role as pee wee herman, and even he would have at least done a better acting job.<br /><br />since the scientific plot holes are too numerous to list here, i would instead suggest that you screen the film with friends, and have a game of "find the scientific absurdities." the loser could be forced to listen to tapes of corny lines from the movie like "everybody looks the same" over and over. here's a sample of the kind of nonsense you can expect: a scheme to blow up a building is devised, engineered, and the dynamite set and detonated all within a space of about 20 minutes. <br /><br />let us not forget the obligatory disaster movie clich'es: divorced dads, scientists who get ignored by everybody, obnoxious cops, tough street kids, bratty teenagers, greedy investors etc.; all are present and in abundance. the film also bashes you over the head with a relentless barrage of political correctness.<br /><br />for fans of cheese and silliness only. all other viewers: beware.
