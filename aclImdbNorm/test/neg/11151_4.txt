i like arnold, and i love the subject matter, but this was a very disappointing movie. when i first saw the previews, they were dark and ominous, and arnold's name wasn't even mentioned. but i recognized him, which led me to believe that he was making a movie that had more of a serious, suspenseful mood. that it wasn't just another schwarzenegger action vehicle (though i admit, most of his are pretty good!). he had, thus far, avoided movies with any real religious theme. and i was excited. i was wrong. this is just another action, explosion, gun fire movie. and it's a pretty bad one.
