this story starts at the end ! so the film's opening credits advise us. unfortunately that's not true as we then are treated to around 70 minutes of a typical b science fiction movie of the 1950's. the story is dreary; the plot is very weak and has clearly been filmed on a low budget, as was often the case in those days.<br /><br />the story could have covered any situation where people are taking refuge in an isolated house and being threatened by someone outside. it just happened to be adapted to fit round a sci-fi story.<br /><br />the scenery consisted of a few rocks, bushes, and smoke. - oh yes there was a pool of water as well. someone wore a rubber mask with a beak like face and what looked like feathers.<br /><br />written by lou rusoff, who penned several sci-fi stories around that time including the she creature and it conquered the world the filming was completed in a matter of days, not allowing the actors time to develop their characters to better advantage. the low budget restraints also prevented this film reaching its potential. it could have been a much better film than it turned out to be.<br /><br />mike connors and richard denning brought some life to the film, but even they could not lift this film into the category where you could say- 'i enjoyed that film' richard denning's acting career began in 1937. he starred with gregory peck and deborah kerr in an affair to remember and later became more well known on television in the series hawaii five-o and the flying doctor series.<br /><br />directed by roger corman who has many films to his credit both as a director and producer. he has made some good films and is still making them. he became very well known for his direction of films from the stories of edgar allan poe, often starring vincent price. he also made other low budget films; some were good and entertaining for one reason or another, and most were much better than this.<br /><br />i would not recommend this film to anyone.<br /><br />darnmay <br /><br />10th september 2007
