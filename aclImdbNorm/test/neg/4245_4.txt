this movie was a dismal attempt at recreating a crucial time in english history. the film version of cromwell's growing involvement in the war is marginally accurate but the overall historical accuracy of this movie was way off. this film implies that the war was started over religious differences but the civil war was in no way catholic versus protestant: both sides were protestant. cromwell was never present at the battle of edgehill, nor did he ever "save the day". the royalists did not win, the battle ended in a draw.<br /><br />as another reviewer has noted, cromwell was certainly not one of the "five members" who were to be removed from the house and arrested. <br /><br />overall, this movie was decent. the producers tried way to hard and it didn't turn out so great. <br /><br />definitely could have been better.
