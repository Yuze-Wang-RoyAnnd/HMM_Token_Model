a stupid show in the vein of the rest of them with terrible music and a laugh track that must be from i love lucy. i got rid of tv because of shows like this, but picked up the 1st season at big lots for $3.00. should bought the van damme movie instead.<br /><br />if i was a conspiracy theorist, who believed that a small group of people are working against real families and keep coming up with this drivel/propaganda in order to undermine family values i would point to this show, married with children, family guy etc. but i'm not so i won't.<br /><br />btw i'm not christian, love the simpsons and peep show. i watched two episodes and thought that if shows like this are popular, who are they popular with? then i remembered all those fotos of the people of walmart that have been circulating around the web and thought ah ha!. it is no wonder our culture is a joke around the world when this is prime time.
