heart of darkness was terrible. the novel was difficult enough to understand, but when a production company decides to release a film loosely based on it, then that just messes everyone up. not only did those in charge decide to change certain characters and completely eliminate others, but the acting was horrid and the overall impression i got from the movie was that it was a complete dud. i watched the film in hopes of understanding the novel a bit better, but it just threw me and my fellow classmates off completely. i think the movie was a waste of time, and i was disappointed to see tim roth in such a disappointing film, especially when he has awesome flicks like pulp fiction and resivior dogs under his belt. same with the very cool john malkovich.
