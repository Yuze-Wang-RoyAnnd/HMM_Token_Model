this is a silly movie with much singing and dancing. acting is average, but writing leaves something to be desired. there are rememberable performances by buddy epsen, with a short but outstanding performance by gypsy rose as the bitter wife of a rich playboy. a totally unbelievable portrayal of college life which ends with a superb ice skating exibition of alice in wonderland. many parts are worth watching, but do not be afraid to fast forward through parts of the movie
