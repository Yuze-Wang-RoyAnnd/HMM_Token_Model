this is indeed the film that popularized kung fu in the 1970s. however, if it ever had any kind of excitement or even halfway interesting plot, it doesn't seem to have aged very well.<br /><br />long story short: extremely drawn out, slow-moving, confusing plot with run-of-the-mill choreography, typically annoying and exaggerated whiplash sounds with every punch and kick, and constant "plot twists" that never come to an end. by the time the film reaches its emotional climax, i had long had all the wind knocked out of me to actually care.<br /><br />watch it for its historical value as a milestone of chinese kung fu cinema -- just leave your expectations at the door, or you'll be bitterly disappointed.<br /><br />for hardcore fans only.
