how many times must i write the words boring and not funny on this page until i get to ten lines. george is about original an actor as alfalfa from the little rascals. although that is probably a slight to alfalfa. how many times do i have sneak into these overpaid actors crappy films before i will learn that there is but one law in the movie industry. take the money and make a movie - even if it is crap. they spend millions making this movie but can't take a few moments to watch the end result. and renee goawayzigger should stop taking the illegal drugs she is on and seek medical help for the facial problems she is sporting. at least i hope its drugs as she is quite unattractive whilst talking out the side of her mouth. this movie was neither funny nor dramatic and these hacks should just stop making crap like this. george and renee, you should be ashamed of yourselves and stop being stop stinking greedy.
