if they had a zero out of 10 i would of entered it. everyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves taking money from the public. i don't know how films like this get released video or pay channel. i am disappointed in vincent gallo. val kilmer was in it for about 8 minutes, so i can't get that mad at him. only the person who listed him to be the star in it. it is like marlon brando in superman.there is no plot except gallo searching and finding his friend in the catacombs. why they were searching for the gates of hell only the director knows. they should of kept this film in moscow and burned it for fire to keep all the homeless extras warm for the night. there is nothing more to say about this film that all the other reviewers have written. i wish i could forget this movie it hurts my brain.
