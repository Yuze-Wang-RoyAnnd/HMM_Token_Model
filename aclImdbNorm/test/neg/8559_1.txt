i have spent the last 5 years in the entertainment business and most recently find myself working for the company that made this movie, which is a real pity, because i like these folks, i just can't believe anyone could possibly make anything as bad as this?!!!! this was crap from every possible angle. from camera work to dialogue to acting to costumes and production design was one of the worst films i have ever seen! the actors in this film looked like they had been taken straight off of a porn that was being shot in the san fernando valley and put on a set with an even less talented crew.<br /><br />i just can't get over the fact that i am sitting on some of the best material i have ever read and contacts within the industry that could help me make my dream a reality and have hit every roadblock possible? yet the folks behind this spectacle of a film have no problems putting it together and in fact, sleep well after it is released.<br /><br />life, what a trip!
