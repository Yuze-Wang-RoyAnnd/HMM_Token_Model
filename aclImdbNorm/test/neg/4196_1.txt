a guy, with the unlikely name of shy walker, looks for his two daughters in a cornfield for an hour and a half. that's the entire plot...with across-the-board bad acting, of course. walker wanders around a corn maze (maize? i get it! hahaha...not funny) and yells "girls? where are you?!?" about 1000 times. for some reason whenever he runs by a pumpkin, a chipmunk-sounding voice laughs (as if the pumpkin is laughing at him, yeah ok...). his daughters scream for most of the movie...even when there is no reason to scream (maybe because they are still stuck in this awful movie?). twin girls straight out of 'the shining' show up every now and then. most of the corn maze looks the same so walker's search gets very old very quickly. the filmmakers realize there is nothing going for this movie (even the music is repetitive) so they try to make things interesting by spinning the camera around really fast, filming upside down, inserting smaller pictures of the same shot at different angles, using red lights to make the corn look scary, and rotating the camera 360 degrees (at least i'm assuming these were done intentionally but it's likely just examples of incompetent film-making). more often than not, when walker is wandering through the maze, you can't see his face. i guess the kid holding the camera can't look up that high... this movie gives you a new appreciation for the original 'dark harvest' (which doesn't have anything to do with this movie except for the fact it also features a cornfield). don't be fooled by the r rating. walker says the f word three times and now we have "an r-rated horror movie", ugh. the scarecrow on the cover doesn't even show up in this movie...and when you are wishing that those cheesy scarecrows from the first movie would come back, you know things are bad! instead we get a guy in yellow boots chasing our hero around (unfortunately he is dressed similar to mr. walker so i didn't even realize he was being followed for a while). i figured out the identity of the guy in the yellow boots long before walker did (the movie is almost over by the time he puts 2 and 2 together, natch). the end of the movie drags on and on...and just in case it isn't slow enough, there's some slow-motion! the last sound you hear (besides your own laughter) is very poor sound-dubbing. in case you can't tell, this is the worst movie i've ever seen. at least they didn't end with the promise of another sequel!
