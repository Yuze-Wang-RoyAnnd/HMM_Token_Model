how do i describe the horrors?!!! first, some points: first, this review should be taken with a grain of salt -- i saw this over 20 years ago, when i was a boy, at the museum of modern art in new york city.<br /><br />secondly, i am giving away some scenes and plot points. however, it does not have much of a plot.<br /><br />finally, i don't enjoy these type of art films anyway.<br /><br />this film was directed by proto-auteur luis bunuel. he was a surrealist and dadaist. these were modernist themes or movements popular critically in the 1920's and early 1930's. surealism was the school of art that made things hyper-real, yet often had freudian symbolism. dadaism is based on what is supposedly the first word made by an infant -- dada, or father.<br /><br />made in black and white, it was also made by a band of communists (or as they preferred the term, socialists). bunuel and his group of fellow film-makers and artistes had been working on a number of symbolic ideas and issues in spain and france between the world wars.<br /><br />dadaism and surrealism influenced a lot of artists -- the police (doo doo doo da), poet arthur rambaud, edvard munch (the scream), rene magritte (floating hats in space), salvador dali (melting clocks), and even hitchcock (psycho). no norman rockwell.<br /><br />here's what i recall most about this film: a girl meets up with a cow; her eye gets slashed by a razor; clownish men cavort in a meadow. there is not, as i said, much of a plot, but then again, that must be the point.<br /><br />this was attacked as porn back then, and would be again today. one of the trade-marks of surrealism is a significant anti-feminism.
