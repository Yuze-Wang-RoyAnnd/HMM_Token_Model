the supposed writer and director mr.dhawan has copied almost the whole plot of the blockbuster hollywood movie "hitch" starring will smith. many scenes are also exactly the same. the plot was just copy pasted and some low grade humor(probably mr.dhawan's own creation) and frequent dancing was added to increase the movie time to local standards.<br /><br />although salman khan and govinda's acting did give us some smiles, however it does not suit legendary artists like them to be a part of plagiarism, specially when they themselves keep telling people to stop buying pirated discs!
