i share the same opinion regarding underworld as the previous comment.<br /><br />i sat through the 1.5 hours of this movie wondering what this story was all about and more importantly why the author and/or director had made certain decisions for the plot. on the whole i found the movie to be unbalanced, consisting of strange sub-plots which (imho) actually had nothing to do with the movie. furthermore, when writing a thriller i'd say you want your viewers to wonder about the story and not about the way the story is filmed...
