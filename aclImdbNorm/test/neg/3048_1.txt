once in a great while i will watch a movie that completely surprises me. one that comes out of nowhere to be a bit of rousing entertainment. one that is pure fun from beginning to end. well folks, when a stranger calls is not that movie. it is an unbelievable stupid and far fetched remake of the much better 1979 horror camp classic. our lead heroine jill is forced to babysit after going over her cell phone minutes and is harassed by telephone calls from a mysterious caller. every clich'e in the world is used here from the stupid cat-jumping-out-of-a-hidden-spot to the car that won't start to the killer can be anywhere at anytime. this movie is bad...not even bad in a "so bad it's good way" more in a "so bad it's boring way." skip this godawful film and save your movie for something else. you'll thank me later, trust me on this. grade: d-
