i have no qualms with how the movie does not capture new jersey (like zach, i'm from there). fine. whatever. i lived there way long enough. i don't need to see a movie that captures the garden state.<br /><br />what i do have qualms with is how bad this movie is. let's make it easy on you. we'll use some bullet-points. there are probably some spoilers that follow. (not that you wouldn't be able to predict the movie anyway): <br /><br />-the music placement was maddeningly forced and patronizing. example: large: "what are you listening to?" sam: "the shins. ever heard of 'em?" "no." "listen to this song - it will change your life!" and then they proceed to play that shins song that was in a mcdonalds commercial. (don't you love when the characters in a movie blatantly tell you - the viewer - how to react to something? i love that! hey, they should have put subtitles during various scenes instructing us to "chuckle," "say 'aaaaaw'" "cry" "feel inspired" etc.) <br /><br />-the scenes were so bad. so clich'e. so melodramatic. example: the entire movie. but no, really, example: they're in the rainy quarry by the ark. large runs up - in the pouring rain (oh he's so tormented!) - on top of a piece of heavy machinery and screams! oh how moving! but wait! here comes sam and his buddy (the annoying drug addict), and they all scream!!!! but wait!!!! oh my god!!!! here it comes! they kiss!!! long, deep!!!! in the rain!!!!!!!! <br /><br />-the dialogue was so bad. so clich'e. so melodramatic. example. they're leaving the ark and sam says something like, "hey. good luck exploring the infinite abyss." and the guy says back, "you, too." oh...oh my! i never realized...could it be? oh my god it is! large's life is like...ohmigod...an infinite abyss!!!! another example: large and sam in the airport. sam says something like, "is this goodbye?" not enough for ya? ok, largeman says something like, "this isn't a period at the end of the sentence... it's an ellipses." and guess what happens when he tries to walk down the jetway and go back to his life in la. you know, what? don't guess. it's a waste of your time.<br /><br />-it's a grade z wes anderson rip-off movie. when not busy being melodramatic and clich'e, the movie spends lots of times with crazy-kooky-off-kilter characters. hey, sam's brother... thank you zach braff for including him, because it really made the movie so much more textured. also ripping off anderson: the dialogue. scene: sam and largeman are in a bar. in walks friends, "vagina!" says one of them. then they see him sitting with sam, so one of the friends says, "sorry i said vagina." and sam says, "it's ok." <br /><br />-inventive cinematography that's not inventive but pointless and annoying. give me a break with the speed-up/slow down of film. again, wes anderson does it effectively in his movies. and it was done well in "donnie darko." but, really, it was pointless. wow. a crazy party where people are taking x and snorting coke. better roll out all the tricks! <br /><br />-you can count the good moments on one hand (even if you're missing fingers). that's what makes it even worse. the retarded quarterback thing...well, that was good! the little thing he (largeman) says as they're about to enter the quarry (something about huffing turpentine)...that was good! oh, wait, that's about it.<br /><br />you know, zach braff is, i think, always a little too cute. but, he's likable. but, man, this is forced, pretentious, melodramatic (have you gotten that yet?), overly cute, overly everything. this movie is terrible. apparently, i'm outnumbered, as this waste of time is currently rated an 8.0.<br /><br />please, though, if you're looking for something truly poignant and subtle and unique do. not. rent. this. movie.
