largely forgettable monster film from the 50s features truly awful special effects -- the "claw" in question is a giant puppet that would make jim henson want to kill himself. i just saw the movie last thursday and i can't even tell you who was in it. that's a bad sign. i'm told that when the movie premiered audiences laughed it off the screen.... and that was in the 50s when standards in special effects were much lower. basically i should have walked out of the theater as soon as the words "produced by sam katzman" came on the screen if i knew what was good for me, but then i sat through "harum scarum" also so i guess i deserve it.
