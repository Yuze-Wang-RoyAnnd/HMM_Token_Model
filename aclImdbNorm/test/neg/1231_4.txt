okay, so i forgot to watch and only caught the last episode, thinking it was the first or second. honestly, i thought cm would have at least one more installment to resolve plot points. the rangers are left stranded on the plains ("we'll have to eat the horses"), for one thing. little newt is bereft, for another. what a downer ending! but my biggest complaint, esp. if this was the finale, is that the episode had no suspense, no big climax, no dramatic confrontations. even the last fight between blue duck and buffalo hump was badly staged. the whole episode had terrible pacing, which is what drives a western. steve zahn was watchable, karl urban (a ringer for johnny knoxville) played call like a man with a terminal case of lockjaw. all glowering looks and jingling spurs and jutting chin. and what's with the rangers? they talked big, about cleaning up texas, then milled around aimlessly in the middle of town, getting drunk. and how nice of hal holbrook to loan val kilmer his mark twain wig and stache! the set of austin was like the fake rock ridge from blazing saddles, all facade. i admit i was drawn into the plot, but that's mainly cause there were many things i didn't quite get, thanks to coming in late in story. if i'd watched from the beginning, i might not have gotten to episode three. now i have to go watch silverado to cleanse my palette.
