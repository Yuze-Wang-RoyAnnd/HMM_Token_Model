yes pigeon and coburn are great, and it's interesting to watch them, although coburn seems rather restrained and dull here. it's enjoyable to view seattle, victoria and salt lake city of 1970's, and the period cars and clothing. that's all the good in this boring film. the dialog is incredibly bad, as is most of the acting. ray and sandy's motivations seem forced and unlikely. i've seen this "training to be a pickpocket" routine several times before. there's a long build up, leading to nothing. better to catch an episode of "streets of san francisco", or one of the many great crime/caper movies. to name a few, there are bedtime story, remade as dirty rotten scoundrels, the lavender hill mob, the grifters, paper moon, the sting, and best of all, house of games.
