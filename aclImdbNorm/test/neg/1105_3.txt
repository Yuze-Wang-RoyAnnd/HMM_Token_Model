i really wanted to like this movie. a film with zombie children getting out of a mine to kill people at night really seemed like a great idea for a horror film. unfortunately, the film was in the bottom 3 of films played at horror fest.<br /><br />a mother and her two daughters attempt to move on after her husband/father had passed away from an illness that cost their family a lot of money. they have to adapt to their new environment. they end up struggling due to all the surroundings for different reasons.(crazy zombie kids go into this category) the film never gives any sentimental attachment for anyone that lives or dies, the film produces no scares or jump worthy moments, the film barely shows the children doing what they're supposed to do...kill! with a bigger budget and a better cast this film could have hope. until then, pass on it.<br /><br />3.5/10 actually.
