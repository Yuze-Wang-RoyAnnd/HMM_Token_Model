it just so happens that ivan the terrible, parts i and ii both had entries in the 50 worst movies book by harry medved. now, i do think that declaring they are among the worst movies ever is an overstatement, though they are still both pretty poor films--particularly the first one, as it featured more eye rolling and "googly eyed looks" than i have ever seen before!! director eisenstein and an awful lot of other people out there thought this made the film "artsy and profound"--and since i am legally sane, i must say that i hated this first film!! the second, while still very incomplete-looking, is a vast improvement, as eye rolling is minimal, though overacting and long boring scenes are present in this film just like in part 1! while part 2 looks pretty incomplete and needed at least another hour (especially since it never gets to ivan's insane behavior later in life--like killing his son and heir while in a fit of anger). since both parts 1 and 2 were commissioned by stalin to both excuse his own murderous reign and glorify him, it's no surprise that ivan's life story is left very incomplete. even without all the truly awful behaviors of ivan, apparently the supremely evil stalin still didn't like the film and wouldn't allow its release during his lifetime. maybe he didn't allow this because he was more worried people would see what a huge waste of money and resources the film was instead of seeing stalin as a crazy guy just like ivan! <br /><br />by the way, there was one segment of this tedious film that was just so cool that the film merits a 4 (without it, a 2)--and that's the scene with prince vladimir at the banquet! it is well-done and pretty funny in a dark way. and, the scene was done in a russian version of 2-color technicolor. this is very odd, by the way, because by the mid-1930s, a vastly improved true color process was developed by technicolor that no longer made everything look all orangy-red and greenish-blue. so, this film during the color sequences looks a lot like a silent or early sound color film. very odd indeed for the 1940s.
