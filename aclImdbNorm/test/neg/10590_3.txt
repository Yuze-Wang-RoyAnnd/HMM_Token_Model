this is one of the most boring films i've ever seen. the three main cast members just didn't seem to click well. giovanni ribisi's character was quite annoying. for some reason, he seems to like repeating what he says. if he was the "rain man", it would've been fine, but he's not.<br /><br />3 out of 10.
