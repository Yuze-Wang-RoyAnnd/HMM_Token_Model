dr. seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive. cat in the hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of goop. we have mike myers as the infamous cat in the hat, big mistake! myers proves he can't act in this film. he acts like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve. the kids in this movie are all right, somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying. the story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks and like most movies based on other stories, never tweak with the original story! bringing in the evil neighbor quin was a bad idea. he is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life.this movie is like a rejected comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it. the film sure does look tacky! sure there are a funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word, mildly funny. at least the grinch had spunk, and the film was actually good! this film is a cartoonish piece of snot with bright colors and bad mediocre acting. was mike myers even in this movie actually? and another thing, the fish. what is with that stupid fish! first time you see him, he's an actual fish. next time you see him, he's all animated and talking. but he looks like an animated piece of rubber play dough! this film is a total off target wreck. good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! i'm surprised it even had good jokes like the water park ride joke, that was good. so please if you have the choice, watch the grinch instead of this mess.
