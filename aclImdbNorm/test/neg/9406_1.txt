another entry in the pacino-as-mentor sub-genre. you know the drill: young hotshot with hubristic flaw (in this case, matthew mcconaughey, trying to jump-start a flagging career by latching onto pacino's coattails -- hey, it worked for keanu and colin, didn't it?) is discovered by glamorous and delightfully corrupt father figure (pacino, natch). young hotshot learns from father figure all the ins-and-outs of a lucrative yet degrading career (this time, it's football handicapping). father figure plies young hotshot with money and hookers and power, but we all know that this decadent state of affairs is on a collision course with dissolution and despair . . . that is, until the young hotshot finds his moral center by rejecting the father figure and all, or almost all, that he stands for. (clearly, stone's *wall street* pretty much set the ground rules for the pacino-as-mentor sub-genre.)<br /><br />we are also meant to take these latter-day pacino films as a parallel to reality. again, you know the drill: living-legend actor demonstrates his unquestioned superiority as compared to an inferior young actor. the latter may bear and grin through the process, but he must recognize that he isn't going to get any of the good lines, much less get a chance to chew major scenery before the denouement. now it must be said that there are actually two good movies in the pacino-as-mentor canon: *scent of a woman* and *donnie brasco*. in the former case, it was a one-man show, anyway; in the latter case, pacino had met his match as a scene-stealer in the person of johnny depp. however, those two movies were serious-minded, not merely an exercise in showboating for showboating's sake. pacino has made damn certain that his younger co-stars in the films since *brasco* are nowhere near as charismatic as depp. by the way, none of this speaks very well about the living-legend actor. like his contemporary de niro, pacino has spent the last 10 or 15 years resting on his laurels. *two for the money* is the worst example yet, worse even than *devil's advocate*, which at least had the virtues of featuring a naked connie nielsen and being chronologically prior to this movie. well, this is what happens when you're crowned king too damn early -- just ask marlon brando. frankly, i've seen one too many al pacino films with the same plot -- and the same overacting from the star -- to be charitable any longer. did i say "none of this speaks well"? actually, it's humiliating for everyone involved, including the paying audience. no one's going to accuse matthew mcconaughey of being a shakespearean actor, but even he doesn't deserve the role of second-fiddle to this intolerable old show-off, with the added implication that he, mcconaughey, will never measure up to the greatness that is al.<br /><br />i've not wasted space on the plot particulars. if you want a synopsis, imdb provides a no-nonsense summary, though i think i laid out a fairly comprehensive summary in my opening paragraph. basically, you've seen this movie before. many times. the particular milieu in *two for the money* is the seedy world (underworld, really) of sports handicapping. pacino runs an office of "bet advisers" -- that is, middlemen between you and your bookie -- and even has a cable tv handicapping show, co-hosted with several of his top guys. one thing the movie got right was the sleaziness of these type of shows . . . but one detail they got dead wrong was the constant use of the words "gamble" and "gambling". if you've ever seen proline or other shows of similar ilk, you'll never, never hear jim feist and his cohorts say the word "gamble". they ask you to call their 1-900 number to get their picks . . . but if you were from, say, mars, you'd have no idea what you were supposed to do with those picks. "gamble" is the f-word on sports-handicapping tv shows -- strictly verboten.<br /><br />gambling is against the law, you know.<br /><br />1 star out of 10.
