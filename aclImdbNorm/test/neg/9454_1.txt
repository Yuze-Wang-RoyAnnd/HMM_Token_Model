how poor is this movie? well, i got it less than two months ago and can hardly remember what it was about...<br /><br />i also paid a lb1 for this on dvd, the old story of 'put-a-new-cover-on-the-box-and-some-fool-will-buy-it' syndrome. all i really recall it that the cast ran around a lot, use of cars must have been too above the budget and that a vampire was involved. then again, guess you could know that from the film's title.<br /><br />straight to video rubbish or straight to cheap-jack dvd as it is now. this stuff will be in the bargain bins at rental shops, supermarkets and charity shops until the death of the sun. only cockroaches will rule the earth but this trash will still be around. god bless the dawn of the dvd age....
