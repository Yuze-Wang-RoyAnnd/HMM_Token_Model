rented this one by mistake thinking it was another film with the same title, and realizing that i had rented it some time before.<br /><br />quick plot line. a couple consisting of an artist and photographer rent a studio apartment in los angeles from joe estevez, still cursing the fact his brother martin sheen could actually act! they find a bed in a forgotten room, but the bed is haunted by a nasty looking serial killer from the 1930's and his last victim. their ghosts inhabit the couple, first enhancing their sex life, but eventually becoming more menacing.<br /><br />what ensues is cheap r-rated sex scenes, cheaper thrills and kind of a waste of time.
