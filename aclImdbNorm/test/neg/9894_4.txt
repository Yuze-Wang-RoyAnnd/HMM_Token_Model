the texas revolution of 1835 to 1836, including the periods preceding and immediately following, is depicted in this mediocre 3-hour made-for-television film, whose only redeeming value is bringing light and paying homage to stephen f. austin, the so-called "father of texas" whose life story had long been overshadowed by that of the legendary sam houston. the rest of the film is simply the usual "santa anna is a tyrant" storyline and with a weak attempt to show the mexican perspective with a fictional hispanic character displaying stereotypical latin machismo. combined with short low-budget battle scenes, such as the alamao and san jacinto, this film is recommended only for real history buffs who who do not come from mexico. to its credit, the mexican uniforms look accurate and the romantic subplot (another love triangle) doesn't take up too much screen time. overall, this movie depicts the violent secession movement by texas' anglo-saxon racial minority to be a positive and just revolution against mexican tyranny as personified by the general antonio lopez de santa anna, the so-called "napoleon of the west".
