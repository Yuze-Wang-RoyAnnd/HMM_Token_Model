i cannot believe that this is a film that i did not like. . . i usually find that i am open minded about all sorts of stuff. . . but this flick is just, well, bad.<br /><br />i could deal with the subject matter if the script and story were better. i could deal with the acting if the camera work was better or if the characters were better established. . . i think it mostly boils down to script and direction though.<br /><br />it was just bad.<br /><br />i want to give this the lowest rating, but . . . i don't believe in that, at least this guy got off his tail to make a movie. . . so he gets four stars (just above the average rating which this has so far)
