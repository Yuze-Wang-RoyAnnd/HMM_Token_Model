the acting made you feel like you were watching a kindergarten play. the story is full of holes and gaps and skips around so you have no idea as to what just happened. half the scenes are pointless. there is not an inkling of character development. the score/soundtrack consists of about three songs one in particular is played in about 70% of the scenes. i'm glad i only rented the movie yet i still feel cheated. avoid this movie at all costs unless you want to see some decent actors give horrible performances. it seems like the bulk of the budget was spent on putting a few name brand actors in this less than bad film. this movie is equivalent to visiting a strip club, it tries to get you excited and interested but just as you think something is going to happen your thrown into some unrelated scene and left trying to figure out how you arrived there.
