although i'm not too much of a religious person, i still had relatively high hopes for this movie, as it does have the amazing steve carrell, and its prequel, bruce almighty, was actually a creative and clever christian-themed comedy. however, evan almighty comes nowhere near this originality and freshness that the original has, and can't decide whether it's a comedy or a sentimental movie about faith and family values. if it had chosen one clear path of which of these themes to focus on, it could have lived up to its potential, but instead the result of mixing the two is a film that has a very flat and dry sense of humor, cheesy dialogue and motifs that attempt to give the movie profundity, but instead practically insults the intelligence of the audience, and also a very confused and clouded presentation of the movie's opaque message. it was very obvious that evan almighty was very poorly written, there are numerous plot holes and elements in the movie that make absolutely no sense. for example, although a large variety of exotic animals from all over the planet swarm to evan as he builds the ark for their salvation from the flood, is their inclusion really necessary when the only "flood" that happens in the movie is downtown washington d.c. and a suburban neighborhood, meaning they are at no risk of being wiped out? the filmmakers it seems lacked the originality to modernize the bible story whatsoever, and instead just had it take place in a present time without changing anything to the plot, leaving many elements that just don't add up such as this and make it obvious of the idiotic motifs and writing within the movie. overall, this work is tragic in that the acting talent of steve carrell and wanda sykes isn't exhibited because of the bland characters they portray, and that it was so poorly written that it skews and clouts many of the film's attempted themes, and makes a mockery of the first film. finally, evan almighty also is an insult to the brilliant actors in it and any halfway-intelligent moviegoer, in that it fails both of them miserably.
