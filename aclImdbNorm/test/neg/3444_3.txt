this show disturbs me. it takes up slots on nick at nite that could be reserved for the fresh prince or george lopez. even full house and roseanne. they're all better than home improvement. first off, the mother jill annoys me so much. she is an oversensitive whiny baby and i really despise her. brad is a fat toad, and he is annoying too. and the youngest brother, i don't even know his name! i don't notice him at all! that's probably not the actor's fault though, it's probably the writers'. tim is just a stupid ass. although jill is definitely my least favorite, i don't like any of them. the only reason i gave this stupid show three stars is one star goes to randy. as the middle child, he is still a pesky little brother, but an older brother, and i like his fun character. the other star goes to al. as the chubby friend, his character is likable. other than randy and al, this show sucks.
