tart is the worst movie i've seen this year, and that includes both the affleck/j.lo bomb gigli and the rob zombie borefest house of 1000 corpses. i don't know if that's a fair comparison seeing that tart was made two years earlier and probably has a budget half that of even the low-budget 1000 corpses. regardless, all three movies suffer from the same shortcomings: horrible script, horrible acting, horrible direction.<br /><br />*** spoilers *** (although i honestly don't think there's anything to spoil)<br /><br />tart is about a group of super-spoiled private school kids. most of them reside in super-sized apartments along new york's hyper-expensive park avenue, thanks to the finances of their neglectful parents. the film showcases the aimless life of one of the students (cat) as she discards her only true friend (as frivolous a person as she was) in the pursuit of the "good life" with the in-crowd. that, of course, leads to sex, drugs, and music that is substantially worse than rock & roll. everything is overly dramaticized in the way that truly bad movies usually are. cat's first sexual experience leads to her being branded a tramp and ostracized by her newly acquired circle of friends; her first encounter with drugs leads to her nearly being dumped down a garbage chute after her cohorts believe her to be dead from an overdose. no heavy-handed messages there, he said sarcastically.<br /><br />that's mainly what the "seen it before 100 times" plot entails. other minor, and even less interesting, plot details include one friend who steals jewelry and trinkets from all the others, a wild child who lives life on the edge (and finally falls off of it one night in the east hamptons), an anti-semitic british chick who ends her close friendship with cat the moment she finds out cat has a jewish father, and cat's strained relationship with her single mother who tries unsuccessfully to get cat to appreciate the privileged life she has. the thief turns out to be an irredeemable lowlife. the "wild child" is played as a toned down version of one of the hilton sisters. the british girl disappears from the film after the break-up. the mother/daughter relationship is seen as totally inconsequential until the film's final schmaltzy scene, where she and her beleaguered mother have a reconciliation of sorts. *yawn*<br /><br />*** end spoilers ***<br /><br />about the cast and crew.... dominique swain came on the scene strong with her role as the underaged seductress in 1997's highly watchable lolita and face/off. her performances were strong enough to land her on quite a few "ones-to-watch" lists at the time. she was 17 at the time and i hope that they will not be the best roles of her career. if she takes a few more roles like the one she takes in tart, it very well may be.<br /><br />i've only seen bijou phillips in one other film (bully) and i swear her performance in that one was nearly identical to the one she gave here. i'm not sure if she's incapable of giving varied performances or if it was just a coincidence her roles in the two were so very similar. my guess is that the former is true. i sense this woman possesses very little talent as far as acting is concerned. here, she is the actress tapped to portray the watered-down hilton sister. that she gives such a weak performance is amazing considering that she grew up with, and remains friends with, the real-life hilton sisters. she's essentially playing a version of herself in this film, and doing a damn poor job of it.<br /><br />as for writer/director christina wayne... i know nothing of her other than tart was her first, and only, film project to date. with a first effort like this it is no wonder her career in show business was short-lived.
