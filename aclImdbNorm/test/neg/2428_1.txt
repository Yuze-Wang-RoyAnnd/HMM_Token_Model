awful, awful, awful...<br /><br />i loved the original film. it was funny, charming, and had heart... this piece of junk has none of those things.<br /><br />reused jokes from the original film, stupid plots, bad animation, different voices (with the exception of kronk and yzma) that sound nothing like the ones in the original (especially pacha... *shudder*).<br /><br />the characters are off model, the animation is flat and boring, it's just a bad job all around.<br /><br />and why is kuzco a jerk again? i thought he had reformed... but since when are these tv spin offs loyal to the original *rolls eyes*.<br /><br />i'm sorry, but there is nothing redeemable about this... at all.<br /><br />avoid at all costs.
