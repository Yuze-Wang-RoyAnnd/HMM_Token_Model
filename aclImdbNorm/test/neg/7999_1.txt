any person, claiming this movie to be a ninja classic film, must have seen this movie before the middle of the nineties or he was less then 10 years before he's seen it. otherwise i can't explain this 'classic ninja movie' title.<br /><br />the fight scenes in this movie are just intolerable. instead of casting franco nero as the ninja, they could hire some experienced martial artist instead. in any way the acting skill is not important in that kind of a movie. nero's fighting ability is barely of some street fighter in a bar. his kicks and punches are lame.<br /><br />there's enough of old action movies with good action. this is just a waste of time.
