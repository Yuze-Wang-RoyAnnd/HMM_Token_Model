such pain! pain in the shape that it had promise in its central idea, but it never fully recognised it and goes on to blow a lot sand in your face. i wouldn't say this straight-to-video south african/canadian/uk horror flick is awful, but its just too bland, predictable and there's just very little memorable about it. it's a guarantee you'll forget it, not too long after watching it. i tried watching it last night, but had to finish it during the morning, as i couldn't keep my eyes open. even then i couldn't remember where i got up to, which left me watching it from the beginning again. the only thing that hit a chord was andreas poulsson's sharp cinematography of the vast, harsh and eerie desert locations. a nice glossy chic creates a striking visual sense, which can't save the film from that overall empty feeling. everything else is below-par and almost comes off grating. like the head-scratching revelation of the beast. huh. the computer-generated special effects of the ominous monster are tolerable, and there are some grisly flashes of stripped flesh and bones. but there's too little, as there's no hiding the fact that the clich'ed script wants to ponder on the generic character conflict to build tension and uncertainty. that would be fine if the wilted script was more than just basic, shallow fluff, because it never generated any strong, lasting suspense, but makes it uninterestingly labour on. the lead characters are superficial and the token support fall in the dispensable basket. it's your stereotypical bunch. scott bairstow and warrick grier's performances are colourless, and the beautiful rachel shelley tries but looks rather weary.
