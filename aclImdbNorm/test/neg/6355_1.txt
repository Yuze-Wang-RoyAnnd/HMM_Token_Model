in the wake of the matrix this travesty of a film with loose connections to vr has been reissued with the tag-line "the matrix just got deadler!", in a box with a very matrix inspired cover (still called "expect to die" though). due to the choice of font however the tag-line looks to all the world like it says "beablier". anyway.<br /><br />to complete the transformation to matrix wannabe they have mocked up a vr fight scene with a morpheus-a-like on the back of the box. it may be important to know that this character does not feature in the film.<br /><br />overall this film is a travesty on every level. jalal mehri is an awful actor and does not impress with his martial arts. however his partner stone is played by evan lurie, who in this film is simply the worst actor i have ever seen. clearly he was chosen to make jalal look good in comparison. worst film i have seen for a long long time.
