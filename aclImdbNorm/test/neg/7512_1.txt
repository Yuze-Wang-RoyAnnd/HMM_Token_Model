if you like me is going to see this in a film history class or something like that at your school, try to convince your teacher to see something else. believe me, anything is better than this movie. it is slow paced, confusing, boring, poorly constructed, gory, gringy, do i need to go on? it's message is good, but i have seen them been handled better in several other films. the acting isn't even any good. this movie is just even more awkward, as it start off as being funny (not intensional though)because of it's surreal story, than at the end, just becomes uncomfortable to watch.<br /><br />i honestly feel like 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life has been robbed. why would anyone want to watch a girls describe a threesome for 10 minutes, than watch them drive through a traffic jam for 20 minutes, listen to a hippie who can make sheep appear, witness a sort of rape, than see the female lead role eat her husband.<br /><br />honestly this movie deserves nothing but a 1/10. and if your not happy with my preview,seriously i'm an open minded guy and i like movies that protest through symbolism, but this movie was just awful. make any excuse you can, to avoid this film.
