if i were to rate this movie based solely on the acting/script/production, etc., i would give it one star. all these elements are awful. i can partially forgive this, in light of the film's $250 budget. the movie does contain many entertaining scenes, mostly those of the unintentionally funny variety. some of these include: a 14-year-old kid stealing and driving a bus, teenage hooligans (one of whom is sporting a joy division t-shirt) getting scared away from harassing the film's protagonists by a woman brandishing an obviously fake firearm, and an encounter with a plastic bull's skull in the arizona desert.<br /><br />i would have given it 5 stars just for the entertainment value were it not for the presence of that horribly annoying, morally pontificating old granny. i had to dock one star just because of her. who the *bleep* makes a wedding cake with black frosting, anyhow?
