the brave one seems to indicate that the main character, of course, is brave. i'd disagree. the more brave thing to do in a situation like the one that happens to her- getting brutally beaten along with her fianc'ee who doesn't live another day from it- is to go after the criminals without resorting to a total distorted view of society. jodie foster's character, erica, is a radio personality who's niche is walking the streets and recording what goes on. we're given no real depth aside from 'she had someone she loved, he died, the police don't pursue it, she gets a gun, yada-yada-yada, she gets somewhat but not really involved with the lead detective' into the character, and so were left with something leftover from past movies: the vigilante code of justice, where taking the power in one's own hands is all there is. but we're never too sure if erica is sane or not, if the filmmakers take a position one way or another (that is until the end, which is such a stupid message to take anyway, dog included as overbearing metaphor), while making the new york city of today, which has become significantly safer than, say, twenty years ago, look like you'll get knifed or beaten if you go down just the right alley or just sit alone on a subway car.<br /><br />there could even be a somewhat better movie in the midst of all of this- perhaps just in the undercooked subplot with terence howard's detective, who is involved in some custody battle of a child that isn't his and a woman who he's not linked to and a step-father who, i don't know what aside from owning parking lots and being a bad dude- but we're left to a script that's both ham-fisted and disjointed with logic. it becomes laughable, for example, to see that at first the logical side- of erica unable to really shoot properly, as seen in her first shooting in a convenience store at the convenient moment of a robbery of a wife by the husband- and then giving way to the illogical of her crack-shot at shooting at a pimp driving a car head on at her and killing him and ducking just in time to not get run over. it doesn't help that jordon's style with the camera becomes a little more than insufferable: it's called a stedi-cam for a *reason*, not because it can weave in and out.<br /><br />ironically, the script and direction become very good, or rather work the best they can under the desired circumstances: when looking at the actual beating scene under the bridge, caught between a video-taped point of view by one of the criminals by the regular film cam in a pace that is perfectly disorienting. and when erica first comes back on the air to her radio show, and she freezes up trying to do her old shtick, and speaks out a 'from-the-heart' about how afraid she is- this scene, from foster's performance, to the clear direction and script, is the best scene in the film. but aside from that, there's just a lot of posturing into a psychology that's flimsy: is she a de niro in taxi driver or a bronson in death wish? we have her narration over scenes, some of it doesn't have to do at all with her radio show, observing how disgusted she is with walking around at night, nothing to do but her self-imposed task of cleaning up the streets. but unlike death wish, a movie that held more ambiguity and never held an answer at the end in a revenge scenario, the path of endless violence just heeds to a message, one that won't be news to anyone who's seen a second of lifetime movie-of-the-week melodrama.<br /><br />the actors make do with what's given, and in the end it becomes much more frustrating trying to stay with the anticipated, the hackneyed plot turns, and the plain old inexplicable (plus the unintentionally hilarious, like a few expletives shouted by howard after getting shot in one scene), and the temptation to walk out grows stronger and stronger. it's a very problematic picture, with only a few moments of genuine interest and clear-headed convention-bending.
