if you're an average guy like me and enjoy good acting, good plot, good scripts, novel ideas, or being entertained, you might want to skip this one. i was honestly bored from the opening credits to the very end, but tried to give the film a chance, and watched it all the way through -- only to be disappointed at every turn.<br /><br />the acting was unbelievably sub par, but i'm not sure if the actors themselves are to blame or if it was the ridiculously wooden and horrible dialog coupled with an even worse script. the plot is very vague and underdeveloped and i think the audience is supposed to derive some kind of deeper meaning from it, or be able to look past it in some way, but honestly to do so would be a waste of time.<br /><br />the film has a kind of crude sexuality to it which doesn't serve any purpose other than to show off some tattoos and lingerie. no one seems to have any motivation except making money off of some kind of "investment" deal that is never really explained. the connections between the characters aren't terribly clear, and there is little to no character development.<br /><br />this is either some kind of sub-culture film meant for a very specific audience to enjoy or absolute crap, but you can decide for yourselves.<br /><br />i gave it a 2 because it is definitely one of the worst films i've ever seen, but probably not the worst.
