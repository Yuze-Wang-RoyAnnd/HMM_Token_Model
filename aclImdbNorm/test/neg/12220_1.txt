i'm sure there is a documentary amongst the ruins of this yawn-fest somewhere, given enough time maybe the producers could find it. i do not connect with any of the characters. this is a problem for a documentary. that disconnection soon festers into a complete animosity bordering on hostility. although because of the poor story flow, i'm not really sure what is happening to them and what are the consequences of whatever it is they are trying to do. the story and faces jump around so quickly it is very hard to completely understand what is going on. the 3rd founder that takes them for $700k is introduced so late into the film, khaleil and tom have to backpaddle (fruitlessly) to explain "oh yeah, this guy created the idea too". and just when i thought i had a slight grasp on who all the tertiary characters were, some crazy woman in ranting about getting a puppy? what's up with that? also, did tom really have to give all those awkward speeches to the staff? i can only imagine the boredom they felt when it was really happening. actually i think i feel for them.
