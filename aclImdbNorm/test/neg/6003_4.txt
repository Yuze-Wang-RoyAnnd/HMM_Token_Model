if i didn't know any better, i would have thought resurrection was made in the late 80's/early 90's, when crap sold as film in hollywood.<br /><br />i don't understand why people like christopher lambert. he speaks like he's reading off of cue cards and turns into a fountain whenever he has to emote. he was easily the movie's weakest aspect. the other actors were ok, nothing horrible.<br /><br />it's easy to see where the majority of the budget went: the special effects. the killings look pretty professional, but hardly make up for the film's dullness.<br /><br />i wouldn't go as far as to say resurrection is a carbon copy of se7en, but it certainly bears a certain resemblance to it. centering on a religious-minded murderer on a modern crusade, the detectives investigating his work have to rely on bible passages and christian history to piece together the killer's puzzle. resurrection, however, is bereft of se7en's clever storytelling, cinematography, acting...well, everything that makes it good. instead, resurrection lies to the audience and uses the scooby doo method of mystery to surprise it.<br /><br />in conclusion, resurrection was about as bad as i expected it to be. i almost feel bad for criticizing this movie since i knew it would be bad going in, but...sue me.
