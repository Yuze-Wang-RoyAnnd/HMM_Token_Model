i rented this film for $5 and felt sorry i did it...i wouldn't give a 5c for it if i knew.this is the worse movie ever...none of the filming locations was in former yugoslavia,map at the beginning what the...???english actors are trying to speak serbian eg. pretending they are serbs and they did it terrible bad.my first language is serbian and i could not understand what they were mumling about.they drove a big jeep in a country where 3 sides (croats,serbs and muslims) are in war and they wrote on it peace 4 sarajevo???ha,ha, how stupid was that...don't know why english are making stupid films about war like this one...or even if they do why they are blaming serbs for everything,when there was another two sides in a war too.and we all know they were killing too,not just sitting and pretending innocent,so they should at least show the whole truth.this film also harrison's flowers,behind enemys lines,the hunting party and few others were total bullshit and that's proved eg the hunting party was biggest loser in 2007/08 spent 20 mil 4 it and they earned 800.000 ha,ha, what a crap...the truth will come out sooner or later.proud to be serb!!!
