this is without a doubt the most poorly thought out movie in history. the invention gags by carrot top are some of the most awful attempts to be funny in recorded history. i am not familiar with his other work, but if it is half as bad as this then i am just going to cry. i give this movie 1 out of 30 billion stars, and may god have mercy on the souls of those responsible.
