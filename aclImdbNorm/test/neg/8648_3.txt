a special unit of four police detectives are dispensing justice in their own unique way in 1950s los angeles. nick nolte plays max hoover, the unit's lead officer and his partners are played by michael madsen, chazz palminteri and chris penn. also starring are melanie griffith, jennifer connelly and john malkovich among others. quite an impressive list of names. unfortunately that is the only thing even remotely impressive about this film.<br /><br />our story begins when young allison pond, played by connelly, turns up dead in a remote area of town currently under development. our band of four detectives is called in and it is immediately obvious that nolte's max hoover is going to be taking a very personal interest in this case. we will soon find out that allison, in addition to knowing hoover quite well, was also involved with some rather important military and government types who may have had reason to want her dead. but who exactly was involved and why exactly would they want this seemingly harmless woman dead? hoover and crew set out to find out. sounds like an interesting premise but unfortunately it goes nowhere.<br /><br />despite the impressive array of names, the acting here leaves much to be desired. nolte is overacting, madsen seems incredibly bored, palminteri and malkovich come off as caricatures, penn has hardly anything to do and griffith is dull as can be. by far the best performance is connelly's in all too fleeting flashback sequences. the dialogue throughout the film is forced and wooden. the sense of drama you would expect from a mystery of this type is missing altogether. nothing dramatic really happens. in fact nothing at all seems to happen for the bulk of the picture. instead we just slog along towards a rather ludicrous and incredibly disappointing climax. when the "mystery" is solved you may find yourself saying, "oh come on now, is that all there is?" but it gets worse as after the mystery is solved we get a completely ridiculous and utterly unbelievable action sequence. and even then we are made to suffer further as another awful, badly acted, completely unnecessary scene is tacked on at the end. and then mercifully it is over. and not a moment too soon.
