number 1 was really great summer popcorn fun. it was the modern jaws.<br /><br />number 2 is best summed up by jeff goldblum in the movie about being the stupidest idea in the history of stupid ideas (or something like that).<br /><br />number 3 is the obituary notice...jp has achieved all it ever will. <br /><br />once they realized they had no fresh ideas they should have just let sleeping dinos lie.<br /><br />that said. movie is ok if you don't mind knowing you already have seen it before.<br /><br />
