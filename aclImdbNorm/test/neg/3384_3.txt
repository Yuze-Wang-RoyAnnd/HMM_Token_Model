now don't get me wrong i love bad movies... no i adore bad movies, troll 2.... ouch painful, manos the hands of fate... just watch torgo go, guru the mad monk.. is that traffic noise in the medieval background? ok so that's clear, but this is one of those films that was quite obviously trying to be something better, but didn't make it. why not? well it would be easy to blame the plot, but heh we've seen worse, there weren't too many holes and heh i know there's not a lot of originality in it but then that needn't kill a film. the effects aren't bad (if you completely ignore the last scene), the monster is ok, the truck quite menacing so where did it go wrong? well i'd love to blame it on the 'chris moyles' look-a-like harley... so i will! comedy and horror are difficult to mix well, bad comedy and horror even worse and there's the problem. i loathed this guy from the moment he stuck his head up (literally), the continual bating of the overly meek adam becomes annoying, so annoying that you lose belief that the mildest of people wouldn't react by pushing him out of the moving car door... and i thought it was the monster bits that the director was meant to have trouble convincing us of. why are bad movies fun? well you have great fun poking holes in them, laughing at the script, all the howlers etc. this film doesn't make the coveted category of 'worst movies' because its just bad due to being annoying nuff said. don't bother, go watch anything else and you'll be a better person for it... i promise!
