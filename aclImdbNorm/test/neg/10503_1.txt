ok, normally i am fascinated by z movies. some of the actors, directors, writers, etc. in those movies have a shred of talent. they want to get that talent out so unfortunately for them, they have to associate with crappy people to make their films. but some z films do have at least one thing that may be noteworthy about them.<br /><br />not here.<br /><br />as soon as i saw it i thought...'wow, a blade knock-off.' believe me, if this movie could have lived up to that label that would have made it a better movie.<br /><br />instead i was subjected to some of the most horrible acting i have ever seen in my life. master kao was bad, so bad that i believe some of my neurons in my brain exploded trying to comprehend his acting. i am still trying to make sense of his enunciation and why he would raise his voice in speaking certain words...to add dramatic effect i'm sure...but it was for no apparent reason. simply mind boggling.<br /><br />oh and then there is the black guy in the purple cape near the end of the movie. purple cape guy fights the hero for about 30 seconds, but he is so bad that it actually looked like he was scared of fighting.<br /><br />the main hero and the main villain did decent jobs. the main hero (derek washington) seemed like he actually knew martial arts.
