this is absolutely the most stupidest movie ever produced in front of a camera. i cant believe i was gullable enough to rent this piece of junk. i have seen some bad movies in my time, but this takes the cake....ice cream ,,,, and chips too. omg, i still cant get over how bad this thing was. the acting was a joke.... the plot was non exsistant..and the camera work had to be done by a 3 year old child. i have never seen a movie take so long to go nowhere. i mean the whole movie could have been shot is less than 30 minutes. i guess this guy had some extra time on his hands.... ( like 3 hours. ) and an extra 60 bucks in his wallet, and decided one night...( hey ..lets go make the stupidest movie ever made. ) and they did just that. give me a break.i'm heading back to the video store right now to get demand my money back.anyone else who has watched this piece of trash, should do the same.
