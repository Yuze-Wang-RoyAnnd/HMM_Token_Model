this movie is such a waste of talented people and hollywood budget. it made me think everyone in the movie was paying off a favor by being in it because they were all out of place and wasted talent in this horrible trash pile of a film. it's a contrived plot that is just pathetic, unrealistic and not even close to fun or interesting. the only thing that kept my interest was the numerous big names in the movie that kept popping up for no apparent reason and who had no acting or good lines to contribute to the mess of a film. i kept expecting it to have some good stuff since all of these people had been cool in other films. but it never came through. this film should be shown in prison as punishment, but that would be cruel and unusual. you will be shocked to see so many recognizable faces parading around such a horrible pathetic script with flat lines and horrifically bad acting. this movie reminded me of another complete waste of time with lots of recognizable faces big trouble (2002), which also went off the readable scale on the suck-o-meter.
