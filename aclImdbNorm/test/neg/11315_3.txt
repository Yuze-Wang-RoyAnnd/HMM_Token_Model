give director stanley tong of jackie chan's super cop and rumble in the bronx, and what do you get? you receive a series of kung fu fights and a lack of magoo-like madness.<br /><br />the limited plot has magoo (leslie nielsen) put into an international plot, where he steals a world-renowned gem. of course he has no idea what he is doing. in fact, he has no idea that he had the gem.<br /><br />within thirty minutes you could get very bored watching this. there are some very funny moments though like when he is cooking the chicken. you will wish that you were as nearsighted as magoo. its a fun movie to watch but its quite a disaster! you have to love leslie nielson because he was made some very funny movies. this isn't his best, but he does a good job playing magoo. i thought it was a funny film, and it should be recommended to young children because they will probably think that its very funny.
