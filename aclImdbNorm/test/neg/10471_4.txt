....ok, small-town, clueless sheriff? check. sheriff's hot daughter? check? ne'er-do-well boyfriend of sheriff's hot daughter, whom sheriff hates? check. corporate land developer who greedily puts profit over people? check. developer's rank-and-file accidentally unleashing a primordial monster, then being pressured to cover it up? check. natives warning of mass death and destruction if things are not returned back to the way they were? check. amateurish cgi special effects that could have been produced by a commodore 64 computer? check. seriously, virtually all the clich'es of your typical sci-fi original movie have been lumped into a classic, so-bad-it's-good movie. the only one that's missing is the scientist/expert trying to impart his knowledge; there is a paleontologist with three students who get ambushed my the bone eater fairly early in the movie, but they are basically extras in the movie. and i can honestly say that i predicted virtually all of this; right down to who survives and who doesn't (though i have to say i got the actual death time of one of the characters wrong by about an hour). i swear i could have done this movie myself if they gave me all the characters. despite all this, the movie is fun to watch, if for no other reason than to play mst3k with your friends. if you're up for some mindless fun, it's a great movie to watch, which is why i give this movie a surprisingly respectable 4, even though for all intents and purposes it deserves a much, much lower rating. but then again you wouldn't tune in to a scifi original movie if you were looking for a movie with an actual plot, substantive characters or good special effects, would you?
