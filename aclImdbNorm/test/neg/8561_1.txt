i can only say this: ee03128 from portugal, i couldn't say it better. the worst movie i've ever seen... and i've seen lots of crap! when i read you comment i thought only about the thoughts i had while watching the movie. when i saw who was one of the script writers i understood it. balaguer'o uses the same tricks in all his movies. and his scripts are not much better either. and, of course, in barcelona we have tons of temples and churches around the city so we can keep cursed nuns to scare young americans coming on vacations. please, be serious! and i do not want to talk about the quality of the actors... there is something remarkable too. it is fair to recognize it. compared to the usual level, all the spanish actors use a fairly good english
