holy cow, what a piece of sh*t this movie is. i didn't how these filmmakers could take a 250 word book and turn it into a movie. i guess they didn't know either! i don't remember any farting or belching in the book, do you?<br /><br />they took this all times childrens classic, added some farting, belching and sexual inuindo, and prostituted it into a kaka joke. this should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like. i have to say, visually it was interesting, but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor (if you even think that kind of thing is funny) i don't want the kids that i know to think it is.<br /><br />don't take your kids to see, don't rent the dvd. i hope the ghost of doctor suess ghost comes and haunts the people that made this movie.
