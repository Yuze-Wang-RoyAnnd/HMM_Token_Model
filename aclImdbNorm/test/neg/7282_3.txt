so, it has come to this. in the top-rated comment on this flick, somebody says "nishi is an honorable man". really? this is a guy who mainly kills and maims people in the movie. he takes a short break to rob a bank. honorable? how would you like your kids to go to school with the kids of someone who calls that honorable? wait, there's more! the person also says "we can tell he's constantly thinking." how can we do that? well, do you know that joke "how can you tell when a ceo/politician/lawyer is lying?" ... "his/her lips move." well, nishi's lips never move, so i guess that means he is thinking.<br /><br />of course, this is existentialism to warm the hearts of the cult of victimization. existentalism supposedly stresses that an individual take responsibility for the consequences of one's acts. not nishi. borrow money from the yakuza. what, they want it back? kill them. the cops find out. kill yourself and your wife.<br /><br />really honorable.
