oh gawd. i want to time travel back to monogram studios and throttle someone in their 2 room front office for this sloppy musical. it is one watt above flat-lining for 60 of its 61 minutes and then actually shows (for the one thin minute, spread in milli-second blips across the hour) that there is real life talent being badly photographed.i just don't see the point of going to some trouble to actually make this film that could easily be energetic and actually funny and allow lethargy to be the main thing on view. the weird storyline shows cranky vaudeville trouper grace hayes bulldozing her blowsy way into a college where her rat-bag son is rich college clown. she's gonna fix his playboy ways, no matter what.her real life son (weird looking) peter hays plays her screen son. his real life wife plays her secretary. talk about nepotism. i suspect this talent package was almost the raison d'etre for monogram financing this back-lot musical produced by resident schlockmeister extraordinaire sam katzman. as with other monogram musicals it just looks more like a reason to film recent new furniture purchases and light fittings in order to show off to other studios that monogram pictures are 'lavish' in their b grade ways. have a ghastly look at swing parade of 1946 for genuine evidence of this: they just constructed this gigantic nightclub set then found an excuse to film actors and musicians running all over it. story? none. anyway zis boom bah is more bah than boom. where was gale storm and mantan mooreland when monogram really needed them? probably standing at the boom gate of prc pictures wondering if it looked safe to enter there. junior jive hepster roland dupree springs to life to rappety tap his teen legs around two wobbly dance numbers, especially in the 'big show' finale set in the new and expanded malt shoppe/club set. the usual crumpled curtains are loosely hanging on the back wall, and the stage set of mis matched drapery even has one dark main rag that is yanked back and forth as each amateur sequence elbows past the previous one. the chorus girls and their very plain looking partners in this finale just look like monogram office staff borrowed (from typing and carpentry) for the morning of filming. they have absolutely no dance talent and are so ordinary on screen... all the girls look like they are all called joyce. there is even a costume calamity where they wear frilly hot-pants...on one leg only. it is all so awful and crummy...and actually annoying when one more tweak up by all concerned would result in zis being actually fun. the one strangely interesting thing is the dialog delivery between grace and her son/daughter in law: it is so casually delivered that it actually works in spite of the script and logic. she has a very life like presence which is the only thing that allows the ridiculous story to be slightly compelling. the dupree kid is the real star. he can actually do something...in spite of looking like a tubby liberace tap dancing teen... you read that right.
