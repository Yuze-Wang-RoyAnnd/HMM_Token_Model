first let me say that those of you that voted it "10" are only kidding yourselves and trying to get the votes to a respectable level... something that this movie doesn't deserve. (the only movies deserving a 10 imo are the classics... godfather, shawshank, etc. look at the top rated films of all time for the complete list.) i also noticed that many people gave this a positive vote for being so realistic as far as what it's like inside a cave. though i would have to agree with them on the surroundings, they simply aren't rating the movie as a whole... they are infatuated by the surroundings but miss the overall review. that would be like me voting a 10 for the movie "from justin to kelly" because i think that the beach scenes remind me of what it's like in the florida keys... though that may be true, it does not merit the film getting a 10 because the movie as a whole was rancid.<br /><br />i wish i could tell you that something saved this movie, as usually if one thing stinks in a horror flick, something else picks up or makes up for the weakness. (ex. - bad actors are overshadowed by a great plot and/or great camera work and scenery.) we started the dvd and it all started out fairly normal. we jokingly started to pick out who would be the first to die... after a brief bit of driving and hiking, they set up camp for the night. at that moment, i keyed in on some things which really made me tune out the rest of the film. two main problems i had: bad effects and an even worse story line. the first thing that we all noticed was that the campfires weren't real... you can plainly see the "cgi" or fake flames that they were all sitting at. for a horror film to have such a blatant effect flaw should have told me what i was in for the next hour.<br /><br />only minutes later, i was shown how poorly written this film was. i don't remember exactly how they arrived at the point, but basically, we find out that the "token nerd" is writing a book about exploring caves, etc. another guy in the group wants to tell a story about an experience, but hesitates stating "i don't want this story in your book." the author convinces and coaxes the other that he will not put the story in his book and that he can trust him. (a direct quote: "if i tell you the story, you will definitely want it in your book.") at this point, i was fully expecting a nice 5+ minute story, complete with flashbacks and heartfelt acting. what i got was a short, poorly told (and acted) statement. i say statement because what he ended up telling was about 10 seconds and 5 sentences. i don't remember the exact quotes, but basically he says: "we were in a cave, the cave flooded, a girl died as our friend watched her drown." you may think i am over exaggerating and being really critical, but that isn't far off from a direct quote, line for line, from the movie scene.<br /><br />over the next 50 minutes or so, the film takes place in the cave and though the lighting is what i would imagine to be like in a cave, i could have really done without the really fuzzy/hazy look to the film, and the camera shaking is just one that i didn't go for. (i have really good vision, and after watching the main parts of the film, i felt like i was legally blind.) i was emotionally detached from this movie, therefore the parts that probably should have been scary weren't. maybe had i been able to overlook the very slow and poorly acted start to this film, i would have at least been scared, but i don't remember anyone in the dark room even twitching at any of the "action" scenes.<br /><br />the last scene was probably one i will never forget, and that isn't a good thing. basically, two women are trapped in a room naked. the "monster" comes in to attack/kill the women... he is stopped when he sees a picture of a little boy. a flashback occurs where we find out that the "monster" was injured as a little boy, and spent his entire life in the cave. cut back to present time, and he takes his "mask" (a large skeleton with what appears to be a deerskin shirt). he glances at the picture and the two women appear to have found the caveman's weakness/soft spot. at that point, he stabs and kills one girl, then proceeds to rape the other woman, rather graphically. after about 30 seconds of watching the camera jiggle and shake as he rapes her, roll the credits, movie's over.<br /><br />honestly, if i had to do it all over and i wasted money on renting this movie, i could have saved myself an hour and watch the first scene and last scene of this film and still left with the same thoughts about it that i have now.<br /><br />those of you comparing this to blair witch are way off... if any of you had read up on how the director and writer ran the filming of blair would realize how revolutionary it was... handing each cast member a script the day/night of filming without the other cast members knowing what the other actor was doing is genius.<br /><br />if imdb would let me, it would get a negative score... i don't understand how anyone in their right mind can recommend this movie.
