i'm so glad he wasn't alive to see this. this movie is a debauchery of his work. i agree with the other commenter-- this movie was a terrible disappointment. i'd give it a zero, but am forced to give it a 1.<br /><br />the story was weak, and it reminded me of the days when i was a young teenager trying to write a movie, then looking back on it and realizing how horrible it was. bad actors, family and friends, and someone stupid enough to fund it was how it was made. it's really amazing how strings can be pulled to get anything done. if this movie was able to make it out to the general public it puts high hopes on other indie film makers who have talent worth a damn who're struggling! this movie made me laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. by all accounts this was seriously not meant to be a comedy. scary movie is a better play on a horror genre-- this movie just sucks.
