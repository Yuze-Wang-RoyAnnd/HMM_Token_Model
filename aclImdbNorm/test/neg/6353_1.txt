wow, jeez, i don't even know where to begin commenting on this thing they called a movie. i seriously don't know what the hell david bradley began smoking after making hard justice, which in my opinion, was quite a good movie after the american ninja features. i hadn't seen any of this guy's latter movies after cyborg cop. lucky i saw them on amazon for like 5 pounds each and i can safely say the following: if i had thrown down the drain the 5 pounds i spent on total reality, crisis and expect to die, i would have ended up happier than having to sit through the 90 minutes that each of them lasted. my god, how the heck can anybody label these as "movies" ??? and why do action/martial arts actors fall knee-deep into the smelliest horse-dung when they've like reached their peak?? i mean, david bradley's no oscar deserver but his first movies were pretty entertaining. tough, cool guy with pretty good martial expertise who delivered corny lines but at least entertained action and martial arts fans to a certain extent. but i seriously would love to know what went through this guy's head after making hard justice. his final 3 movies have to frankly be the worst i have ever had to sit through. as i mentioned before, i'd love to get my money back on the 3 dvds i bought. crisis was the epitome of sleepiness, total reality was harsh but this expect to die is just utter nonsense. i bet the director was either mega-stoned when he made this or he was just taking the pee out of every david bradley fan who would sit through this heap of crap. the plot circles around a doctor (bradley) who develops some type of virtual reality game in which he's just killing different people off one by one. sorry but i just couldn't take this guy seriously playing a baddie with that posh hair-do, glasses and gray slacks and doing absolutely no physical fighting whatsoever (frankly, his best asset). the film is even worse than any of those saturday afternoon b-movies because the acting is laughable, the directing is horrendous and the few fights in the movie, well, what can i say... the actors look like they're training with their gym buddy. we get a dumb muscular cop who starts to show off his fighting stuff like one hour into the movie and fails heavily... a french hairy version of van damme who just can't fight, act or speak to save his freaking life and bradley, the supposed protagonist, playing the evil doctor who i was really happy for when he stopped making this type of expendable rubbish. i even reckon he didn't throw a kick in this movie probably due to his heart condition already playing up on him. for a b-actor, i must admit i really liked this guy, his style, physique, fighting skills... but i'm really, really glad he stopped acting after this monstrosity because i honestly wouldn't have been able to sit through another ninety minutes of pee-taking material like this one. avoid at all costs even if you're family of david bradley, you'll be glad you did, word.
