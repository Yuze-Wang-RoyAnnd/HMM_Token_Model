a thinly veiled attempt to push hulkamania to the film going non-wrestling fan. what could be worse than hogan in the movies? bad actors in the wrestling ring, and this film produced both, as tiny lester made his way to the wwe that summer in the mother of all promotional blunders. see the dictionary under oops. as a card carrying member of the stupid kids of the world paid to see this in theaters and when i came out i immediately checked into h.a. - hulkamaniacs annoynimous. i am proud to say i have been off the hulk for 17 years now and have never had a craving since. since this was made to bring in more fans to the juggernaut that was the wwe in hogans hey day one has to wonder if there weren't more fans like me who turned to other past times that did not poison ones mind like this offense to celluloid did, such as huffing gas or russian roulette.
