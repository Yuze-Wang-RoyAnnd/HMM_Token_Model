i don't know how this dvd made its way into my collection - my wife suggested it was one of these "3 for lb20" deals at a high street store. the thing isn't worth 66p, let alone lb6.66! having invested heavily in it, i felt duty-bound to watch it to the end, just to make sure it was equally bad all the way through - and it was.<br /><br />the dialog was awful, the story line was impenetrable (i still don't understand what the hell was going on, despite having read the synopsis), the camera work was disjointed and hopeless, the acting was wooden (not helped by the dialogue).<br /><br />in fact there were no redeeming features - no, not even the lovely sandra bullock, on whose glittering subsequent career this pile of dross has probably been sold. she should get her agent to buy up all the rights to it and then bury it asap.<br /><br />as a final amusing example of the director's ineptitude, there was a scene where the young lead is conversing with his father's ex-army sidekick while driving. this was the clearest bit of dialogue in the film - no engine noise whatsoever! i look forward to the engine-damping technology eventually making its way across the pond into british cars!
