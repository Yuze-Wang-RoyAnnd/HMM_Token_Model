"the beautiful country" is a big disappointment. it doesn't come up to my expectation. bihn, a tall muscular guy, is a son of an american gi and a vietnamese woman during vietnam war. we were told that that he was treated "less than dust" in vietnam in the early 90s, so he fleeted to america to seek his american father.<br /><br />sounds like a heart broken material? maybe, but showing in this film. i find myself having a hard time to connect to bihn emotionally, because the film is full of clich'e and i simply don't understand or believe him. the writing of this film is a total failure. the plot is full of holes. it grabs some events on a needed basis trying hard to stir the emotion of the audience. we are not that stupid and it doesn't work that way. let's see what the film is trying to do. so, you don't feel bihn's boat trip (yeah, he was on a boat!) is hard enough, let's have a storm over night and let the ship shake a little. still not touched? fine! get a little kid to suffer the heat, the hungry, the sickness, the violence with the adults on the boat, hopefully that will do the trick to touch the audience. still not touched? you heartless sob, let's... ok, i don't want to give any spoiler of the film, but you get the idea.<br /><br />the film is really long and slow. it never tell us why bihn didn't go to find his mom and dad, until the moment in the film when he left to look for his mom and dad. what has he been doing the 20 some years before he went to saigon to look for his mom? and guess what? he has the luck and everybody will tell him where to find the person he is looking for, and he will find anybody without a scratch. i really think the department of homeland security should hire those vietnamese who helped bihn. the beautiful country? which one? both vietnam and america seem hell to bihn.
