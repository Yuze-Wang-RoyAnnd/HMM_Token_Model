now, i'm a big fan of zombie movies. i admit zombie movies usually aren't all that good, but i like them anyways. despite the crappy acting and worthless dialogues that occur in almost all zombie movies, this one is by far the worst. see, there are a few ground rules with zombie-movies. 1. zombies are suicidal. tactics is seldom used, and never do they act like a boxer. they don't dodge a blow to the head, they take it with a ugly smile. they don't try and hit you in the face, they grab a hold of your arm and bite it! 2. zombies can't speak. only in evil dead. otherwise, they do not speak. 3. you don't fight zombies with melee-ranged weapons. you loose in a melee fight against zombies. firearms are used. in this movie however, melee is the way to go, which is wrong. very wrong.<br /><br />it had no redeeming qualities.<br /><br />if you wish to see a zombie movie, see one with an average score higher than 3 on imdb.com
