formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (vargas). it looks very much like a tv movie, not really exciting. the only reason i bothered to see it was because valentina vargas was in it. no real surprises here, though it is nice to see vargas. great looking chilenian landscapes on display but malcolm mcdowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie. michael ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts. the chase scenes are standard fare.
