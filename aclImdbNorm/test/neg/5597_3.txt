after seeing the movie in a class of mine and having a talk with the filmmaker, i found out exactly why the film bombed the way it did. the creators of the movie had no intention to call the film "8mm 2." originally, the film was called "the velvet side of hell" but was changed at the last minute by sony pictures to 8mm 2 without letting the filmmakers have any say in the matter. by doing that, it screwed them out of theatrical releases and doomed it to a straight to video release with minimal advertising.<br /><br />again, this is from the filmmaker's mouths, not mine, so i really can't say what is truth, and what is hype.<br /><br />if you look at the film as "velvet side of hell," it isn't that bad. it isn't great, but it is not god awful. it would basically just be a b-movie that likes to show boobs. but as a sequel to "8mm," the film fails terribly.
