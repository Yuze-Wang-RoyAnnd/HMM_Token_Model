my husband wanted to watch this film because the review in the paper said that it was better than fatal attraction. well, not liking either michael douglas or glenn close, i would have to agree. not for conventional reasons though.<br /><br />this is one of those films that needs to be watched late at night when you don't want to watch something that really requires thought but don't want to go to bed yet.<br /><br />yancy butler is a really enjoyable bad-guy. she is not the best of actresses, in fact she isn't even good but she is perfect for this role in this film. everyone else in it varies from pine to oak, including the slightly disturbing boy who comes across as a warped pinocchio.<br /><br />spoiler: the ending goes a step or two too far, complete with the clich'e not quite dead, up with a roar, still gonna get you moment and then there's a shot of pinocchio with his frozen wooden smirk which makes you wonder if they were going for chilling or just forgot there was botox in the make-up.<br /><br />regardless, it's a hilarious eighty odd minutes and despite being a bad film, you would have to be lacking the humour gene to not enjoy it somewhat. don't pay for it but if you're in that kind of apathetic telly mood then this is just right.
