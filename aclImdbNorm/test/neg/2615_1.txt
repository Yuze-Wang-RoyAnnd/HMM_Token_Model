aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! when does the hurting stop? that's what i said somewhere between the beginning and that other part of the movie that really sucked. this film nearly sapped all the life out of me and i have sat through some really bad movies. coming from a true puppet master fan, i would expect to hear myself say this, but it's true. the plot is inane, the special effects awful, the sound track the most benawl, infernal tootling i have ever heard. oh! i almost forgot about the acting, it was so bad that i forgot it was there at all, nuff said. the only redeeming factor in the film is the puppets themselves they truly are the stars and could out-act all but guy rolfe himself(he is the puppetmaster)and although you can see their wires and strings, they carry me throughout the painful start to finish of retro-puppet master. in closing, pm7 is recomended for true fanatics who happen to be masochists.<br /><br />roach<br /><br />
