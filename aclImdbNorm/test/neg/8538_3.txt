first off, the editing of this film consisted of one major flaw which i don't understand how was missed - you consistently see the overhead microphones bobbing in and out of the film. the first time i saw it i just said "well, mistakes happen" and brushed it off. after about the 10th time, it began to get incredibly irritating and distractingly funny. if you haven't seen the film yet, try counting how many times you see the microphone; might make for pretty interesting game.<br /><br />now, about the film. this movie started out with the makings of a pretty solid "ghost" story; however, the plot twist at the end just ruined it completely. you begin watching the movie under the assumption, alluded by the tv commercials, that the haunted house consists of ghosts which can only be seen by children; particularly young children, which makes it even more freaky as they will be unable to effectively warn the family of the impending danger. the opening scene did a good job of misleading the audience that this would remain the premise of the film. **(spoiler)** the movie starts with the family being stalked and ultimately killed by an "unseen" force in the home. the idea that only children can see these ghosts is set in motion when the daughter, at the beginning of the movie, asks her little brother to tell her where "it" is right before "it" grabs her and drags her screaming into the cellar. the young boy also witnesses this supposedly "unseen force" kill his mother after she tells him to hide under the bed. after his family is killed, the boy attempts to run and hide only to be snatched away as well.<br /><br />as i said, this movie started out with the makings of a pretty spooky movie in which the family would be stalked by an "unseen force" with their only hopes of survival resting on sightings by a two-year-old. this began to be ruined less than halfway into the film as the daughter began to see the ghosts as well; completely ruining the "only children can see" illusion set forth by the commercials and opening scene.<br /><br />regardless of this, the movie didn't actually get "ruined" until the plot twist at the end. in which the man who had been helping the family cultivate the farm turns out to have been the man responsible for killing the family at the beginning of the movie. all of a sudden, after being attacked by a swarm of crows, the man snaps and tries to kill the mother, daughter, and son while having a psychotic breakdown in which he believes them to be his family; which he killed at the beginning.<br /><br />the whole plot twist at the end just created a whole list of unsolved questions and left me going wtf. first, why was the family's souls trapped in a house? if the director was going for a ju-on (the grudge) approach in which the family, after dying in a fit of rage, would haunt the house and kill whoever enters, why did the haunting stop after the father was "captured" by the ghosts of his family? if the ghosts only wanted to kill the man that killed them, why were they attacking the new family? here's another one for you. it takes several months from the time you sow seeds until the plants fully blossom in time for harvest. this tells me that the man who killed his family at the beginning, the man that the ghosts apparently had a grudge with the whole movie, was living on the property for months. during all this time, why didn't the ghosts just go kill him? <br /><br />this movie included a lot of clich'ed "horror movie" scares as well as an obvious combination of ideas from other horror movies. however, i'm telling ya, this movie still could've pulled off okay if not for the plot twist at the end. it's like they just ran out of their budget and just threw together something for an ending. for this movie to have been a success, they should've stuck with the "only children can see them" premise and ended with either the family barely getting away or being killed off like the family at the beginning (would've opened the door for possible sequel,too).
