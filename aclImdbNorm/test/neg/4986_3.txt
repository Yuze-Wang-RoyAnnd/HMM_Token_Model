i didn't like underdog!i mean it was really unnecessary and needed a big face lift and then it would have been maybe passable but for the main part i didn't like it.this wasn't like any other kid movie its one of those movies that wanted parents(who grew up watching the cartoon)to come with there kids to come see this,i am neither of them so the film didn't appeal to me in the slightest.i had some problems with it like i don't think jason lee was the right voice for underdog it made it him sound sloppy and really unintelligent.then it was really predictable which makes you feel tired and mad.the humor was really what made me mad it was just to unfunny and somewhat pathetic.the one thing that bothered me the most thought was how almost everything out of underdog's mouth was sarcastic or rude.the acting was passable but needed a little improvement.if you have kids they might enjoy it, but if your not a kid by all means see it you might like it unlike me. 3.4 stars out of 10
