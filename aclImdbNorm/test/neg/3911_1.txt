there is only one word that describes this film: bad!! i have no idea why this movie was even made, or how they got dennis hopper to star in this film. stuart gordon is a better director than this and hopper is a much better actor. the film is plain stupid. i did like the "square pigs" idea and there was an interesting love scene involving a cyborg, other than that, avoid this film at all costs.
