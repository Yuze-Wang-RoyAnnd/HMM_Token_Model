demon wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs. it is definitely an awful example of a film. so awful in fact that i don't even consider it a movie. i describe it more as a thing ... a monstrous thing. a thing that must be stopped at all costs. my friends and i first discovered this ... thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friend's house. it was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies (we unfortunately picked this one.) well, during the 90 minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up. the thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word. it's just a cheap, poorly done rip-off of evil dead. the whole "story" seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces. i have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed. i've seen bad horror movies before (manos, troll 2, hobgoblins!!!) (shudder) i would have to say that demon wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity. watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid films.<br /><br />fun fact: this film is like a cockroach on steroids! much like the ouija board, every time we try to get rid of it, it always seems to mysteriously reappear. kind of scary huh?
