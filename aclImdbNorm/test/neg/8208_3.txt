this movie tries to be more than it is. first of all, the acting is horrible. you have to get past the incredibly bad delivering of lines and terrible emoting. the plot is quite interesting. a shipwreck occurs (apparently because it was made out of strings and balsa wood), and a couple of guys find themselves on shore. if this weren't bad enough, some guy named count de sade is living there as well. he lives in fear of pirates and has gone utterly insane. anyway, he has a large slave, a young woman, and some dogs. there's another woman who doesn't speak and his wife, who is a leper. anyway, things get bad as these men have to deal with this nut case. he is arrogant and likes to pose and deliver lines. the rest of the movie involves an attempt to escape. it has an ironic ending which i won't reveal and it kind of rescues the film. i wouldn't bother if i were you.
