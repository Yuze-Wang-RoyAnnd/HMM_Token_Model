flatland is one of my favorite books, thus i was looking forward to this film. unfortunately, the film is absolutely horrible. the dialog is so bad it sounds like improv half the time. the new storyline makes me think they took the book and a couple of newspapers, threw them in a blender and used what came out for the screenplay. it's a disgrace to the book and independent film making. the only reason i even managed to get all the way through the film was my hopes that it'd get better. unfortunately, it only got worse, climaxing in a really retarded ending.<br /><br />that's not to say everything about the movie is bad. the cg is acceptable, in a 1990's "reboot" sort of way which i assume is what they were going for. and i suppose you can't go wrong with "people" getting chopped in half and gushing blood all over the place.
