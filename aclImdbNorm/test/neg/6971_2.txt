i saw the biopic of ed wood many years ago. tim burton payed loving homage to this extremely untalented but yet enthusiastic filmmaker.<br /><br />then i saw plan 9 and it actually tickled me to no end. a silly story, kind of bad production values but still entertaining and even funny.<br /><br />then this. what can you make of it. well, since wood has been reported as being a cross-dresser it is startling to see a movie that deals with it like a cartoon. yes, there are some stabs at teaching the audience something about the subject but mostly this is some kind of really twisted self-parody.<br /><br />one of it's problems is that it has a hundred points of view. on one hand it is a plea for tolerance. another portrays transvestism as a disease. and finally, it tells the audience: "okay, if you are schocked now, then wait until you see this!" the problem must have been that wood had to compromise in order for the film to be made. you can almost sense it when you see the opening title from the producer: personally supervised by... so, where are we. this is neither a serious subject movie or an all-out schocker.<br /><br />the entertainment value is practically nil. the wooden voice-over is mildly amusing but only because it sounds so misguided. this was made in the 50s though, so one can argue that was brave making a film that even mentioned the word transvestites. it all comes down to what the film itself is trying to advocate against. schock. the rape scene, while mild is there simply to do that.<br /><br />so, sorry. this is a misfire but the discredit is not wood's alone.
