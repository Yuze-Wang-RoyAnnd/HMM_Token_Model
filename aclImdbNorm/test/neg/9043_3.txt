i recently viewed a copy of this (under the title 'eaten alive') talk about dreadful! any movie ed wood ever put out looks like oscar material compared to this laughable tosh. to be fair a couple of lines from the script will live long in the memory such as "these people (cannibals) don't buy frozen meat from a supermarket like us, they get it fresh everyday from folk like you or me" classic! the mad 'jonesville' type leader out in the jungle was the best character in the film, he really did look like a nutter. i think he was the only actor not to be dubbed in (badly), if these italians must have american characters in their films why dont they get americans to dub in the dialogue instead of english people trying their best to sound like annie oakley. i'll give this 3 out of 10, i'll give it three because it really is funnier than most comedies out these days.
