i'm relieved the later reviews have turned sour - reading all the positive feedback, i was starting to worry that my understanding of movies (and life) was completely different than everyone else's in the world. everything in this movie rang false to me...the characters, the dialogue, the manipulative soundtrack, the corny narration, all of it. as each scene unfolded i kept thinking, "people don't act like this." it's relentlessly heavy-handed and maudlin. in a way i think the movie bullies you into liking it, or pretending to like it, because it's serious and about real people and confronts issues. but man, it really did not work for me.
