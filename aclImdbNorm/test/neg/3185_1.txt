this is one of those star-filled over-the-top comedies that could a) be hysterical, or b) wish that you had gone to the dentist to have all your teeth pulled instead. unfortunately, one night at mccool's is a classic "b."<br /><br />goldie hawn recently commented about "town and country" that it's a big problem in hollywood that they start with hiring the actors and putting together a deal before a script is completed. you have to figure that not only did they go into this picture without a complete script, they also mangled it daily. maybe we need to send cards and letters to the heads of all the studio that say, "it's the script, stupid." <br /><br />this is also one of those movies where you find yourself feeling sorry for the actors most of the way through. they're working their asses off trying to make all this seem hysterical, but they know most of it is going to be accompanied not by belly laughs but by the sounds of the crickets you can hear inside the silent theatre.<br /><br />is it an unmitigated disaster? not entirely. there are some smiles along the way, mostly due to the efforts of the actors. i probably would have gone out of the theatre thinking, "eh. it was okay." so why the undeniably hostile tone in my review? the ending. if, as it's been noted, the rest of the movie is just all a setup for the ending, then it misses spectacularly. i really wish i could speak specifically about it, but i hate people who give too much away (even in warning). suffice it to say that as soon as you see john goodman behind a bent-over paul reiser (nothing given away here. it's in the trailer), get the hell out of the theatre and go out thinking, "eh. it was okay." the rest of the movie is tacked-on and creatively bankrupt. and you'll be appalled that there will actually be people laughing at this mess. <br /><br />if you loved "there's something about mary" or "meet the parents" (both great movies), then don't bother to see this movie. go have those teeth taken care of instead.
