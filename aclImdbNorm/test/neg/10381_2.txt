blackwater valley exorcism is a movie about a possessed young girl. do i need to describe any more of the plot to you? the exorcist and the exorcism of emily rose are two terrific terrifying movies. classics (imo). blackwater valley exorcism (bve) is not. not by a long shot. it's certainly not as terrible as a low budget copy of the exorcist could have been. from start to finish it has the feel of a "made for sci-fi channel" production. it's one of those movies that will probably be spoofed and ridiculed on mystery science theater 3000 (or a similar show).<br /><br />the make up and effects were absolutely laughable. the acting was horrendously bad. there was not a single performance that didn't lead to me rolling my eyes or giggling. oh, except maybe for jeffery (re-animator) combs as the sheriff. the script wasn't that terrible but it certainly wasn't anything special.<br /><br />it seems like through most of the movie everyone is more focused on who is sleeping with who than they are with the demon possessed girl in the other room. oh, there was something i learned from this movie. apparently if your teenage daughter is possessed by a demon then all you have to do is lock them in the room. c'mon. and if your daughter is possessed don't worry too much because all it does it make them talk in funny voices, eat rabbits, try to stare you down, and put fog machines in their bed. other than that there is nothing to worry about. apparently she was possessed with a low budget d-list demon.<br /><br />there was none of the ghastly deeds done by a-list demons like crucifix intercourse, painful body distortions, or even projectile vomiting.<br /><br />totally laughable movie. not worth even a discount rental.<br /><br />2 out of 10.
