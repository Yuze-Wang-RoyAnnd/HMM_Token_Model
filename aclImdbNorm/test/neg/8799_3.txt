too much stock footage (almost one third of this 53 minute film) really slows this one down. granted that the plot is that john weston (john wayne) is sent by marshall george higgins (george hayes) to participate in a fixed rodeo (say "ro-day-oh"), but character development and interaction are sacrificed. the relationship between the bad girl (usually a latina-- even in the great "duck soup" [1933]) and the 'heroine' polly ann young, a loretta young look-alike (hey! it's her sister!) could have benefited from more screen time. the happy ending is too abrupt-- although this time john wayne actually kisses the girl.<br /><br />the most interesting stock footage was the lengthy rodeo parade of real indians, squaws, and papooses. but when the best part of the movie is the stunt work by the mighty yak, yakima canutt, who gives us jumping from one horse to another and several different running leaps onto a horse, you know we're in trouble. as noted by others, the final fight with the villain is very poorly done.<br /><br />my copy, from 'platinum disc corporation' featured an added,sparse, ill-fitting (pseudo-classical) stereo music track that ruins the authenticity of the original film.(the dvd box had 'enhanced audio 5.1' on it.) if you're going to modernize and colorize it you should add a 'western' sounding score with acoustic guitars, 'klip-klopping' hoofbeats, harmonicas, and an accordion. <br /><br />finally, we have to say this is one of the weakest lone star efforts.
