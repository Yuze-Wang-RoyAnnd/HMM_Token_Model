a fine young cast is wasted in this empty, mawkish, manipulative film that tries to be a combination of both a cute comedy and an insightful drama. the plot moves so slowly that the 90 minutes seems endless as characters do nothing but mope and emote. the dialogue is filled with stilted cliches and fortune-cookie attempts at pseudo-philosophy.<br /><br />apparently aiming at being a moving and profound look at life and love, the film ends up being merely pretentious. the only real weight is the burden that the talented cast is forced to carry as best they can. but, never fear -- they are held up by the puppet strings of the contrived plot.
