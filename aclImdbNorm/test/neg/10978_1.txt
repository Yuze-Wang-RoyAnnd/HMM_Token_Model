i found it hard to care about these characters, who were either annoying or insipid, all living their fabulously hilariously urban lives.<br /><br />the dialogue was excruiciating at times, and at other times the narrative seemed hard to follow - was it me or were entire scenes deleted?<br /><br />it felt like a poor sitcom somehow turned into a film. the stereotypes and jokes about "men's groups" would perhaps have been funny in the early 90s. as it is, this is where much of the humour of the film comes from - and boy, does it get old fast.<br /><br />apart from the attractive irish man - this film was a dud. and not even in a "so bad it's good way". the last 20 minutes were particularly painful. perhaps if you've never met any gay people or never thought about homosexuality before, then this film might have something meaningful to say. otherwise - darlings, you'd still be better off renting the boys in the band or beautiful thing.
