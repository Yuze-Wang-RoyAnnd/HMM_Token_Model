i'm going to recommend putting this one in the "skip it" pile as well. i was mildly excited by the concept when my fianc'ee rented it, and a bit more excited when i saw that milos forman directed it. ah, well.....<br /><br />the costumes were nice, sure, but they were typical. there was nothing about them that said they were from anywhere but the period costume department of any major hollywood studio. there was no distinction between spanish, british and french - everyone dressed like they were at court in versailles. the sets somehow didn't evoke the qualities of the settings - the prison didn't feel like a prison, the mansions didn't feel like mansions, and the outside scenes looked like they were filmed on a back lot, for all that they were probably practical locations.<br /><br />the score was dramatically less than it could have been. i have been a fan of film scores since my youth, noticing, appreciating and collecting them, by which i mean more than john williams. my fianc'ee is a professional film composer, an award winner who has had her works performed at lincoln center, and a rising star in the industry. at the start of the film, we had high hopes for it, and it did indeed start off nicely. it rapidly deteriorated, and at several points - including the scene of the release of the prisoners - it actually reached a level of annoyance. i actually reached for the remote to turn down the volume. the score was never anything more than the most obvious choice for scoring a specific tone of scene, and didn't integrate itself into the "soul" of the film (think of the music in babel and you'll have an idea of what i mean). it never attained the grandeur it wanted to, but then neither did the film.<br /><br />javier bardem, as talented as he is, was awful. for the first part of the film, his mannerisms are so distracting that it takes over his performance. during the second half, everything that was his character in the first half is gone, replaced by an entirely different set of annoying mannerisms, and he looked like the love-child of keith richards and stuart townshend's lestat. i never got the idea that he cared about the role (which is to say, that the character cared about his life and actions), or that the character was ever drawn by the writers as anything more than an opportunist who, for whatever reason, changes his mind and decides to stick by his principles at the end.<br /><br />natalie portman was very good, although her performance lacked the shades of increasing insanity between her release from the prison and taking lorenzo's hand at the end that i would have needed to call it truly an effective performance. the character of alicia was never defined enough to truly discern, and if it weren't for the superb makeup on her eyes and cheeks, someone seeing the beginning of the film and the end wouldn't know they weren't the same character. the prosthetic teeth were horrible, artificial and distracting, but that's no knock on ms. portman.<br /><br />stellan skarsgard was fine as goya. not oscar-worthy, but serviceable and generally believable. i don't know much about the life of goya, or his deafness, but it seemed to be tacked on to the movie as a requirement of biographical information, rather than anything that was utilized in the film. i am sure it affected goya's life much more than just requiring the need of an interpreter, but you'd never know it from watching this. for the record, words and sounds can only be correctly interpreted roughly 30% of the time through lip-reading.<br /><br />don't get me started on randy quaid. at least he was a minor character.<br /><br />the script reads like one of the "choose your own adventure" books i used to read as a kid: at several moments through the film, several outcomes are possible, and none of the actions preceding them lead with any certainty to the way the film actually plays out. ironically, the film is also predictable, especially its meager attempts at leavening the mood through small bits of humor. the joke about the hands? maybe it's because i paint (not well) as a hobby and know what a pita hands are to draw/paint, but i saw the joke coming a mile away, as well as the reprise in the second half. was the baby ever there for any other reason other than to be taken by ines? there might as well have been a line of bread crumbs.<br /><br />disappointing.<br /><br />(note: this review is a copy of a reply i made to a thread in the forum)
