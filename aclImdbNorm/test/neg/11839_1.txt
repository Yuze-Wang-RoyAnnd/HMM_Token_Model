ok, lets get one thing straight, i love dinosaur movies, even the bad ones. so with this in mind lets proceed. "raptor" is a truly awful film, in fact its not even a film in its own right as it is cobbled together from bits of "carnosaur", "carnosaur 2" & "primal species - carnosaur 3". there is some new footage with eric roberts as a sheriff and his busty sidekick running around looking confused, frightened or whatever it is there trying to convey (badly) on the emotional scale but then how can they react to something that was filmed several years earlier. the producers (yes roger corman i'm talking about you!) even went to the lengths of hiring 2 people from "carnosaur" to play bit parts so there grisly death scenes can be reused! so this film is the cheapest of the cheap. watch the 3 original movies, there no oscar winners but they have some meritt and entertainment value but avoid "raptor". oh, it also has the most pointless sex scene that runs for nearly 10 minutes! do you think they were trying to pad out the running time?
