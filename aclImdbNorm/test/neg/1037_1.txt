unless you're interested in seeing 2 hours worth of scenic mountain footage featuring hysterical characters, lots of histrionics and cheap 70s gore (not much of it either), i would advise to avoid this movie. it is long winded, overlong and has a rather annoying amateurish feel to it. masterpiece? no, an average thriller, shot in an average fashion, in a gorgeous italian landscape. <br /><br />i'm a huge fan of slow paced 1970 movies, when there is a plot to delight and entertain you. in this case, it didn't work out for me. the plot is trite, interlaced with superficial and stereotypical characters, backed by hilarious angry mobs and your typical italian widow dressed all in black, sobbing.<br /><br />if you are not acquainted and familiar with the italy country side, the movie might be worth seeing as the scenery itself is spectacular and rather breathtaking. this movie isn't however, nothing out of the ordinary, there are much better italian horror flicks than this. not much else than a yawn fest. 5/10
