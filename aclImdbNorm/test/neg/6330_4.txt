i don't understand the people here. the film is neither as good as as bad as some people say here. except for de kok the acting is ok. the problem with the film is mainly the script. the characters are not believable. the sex is done okay, but the psychology behind the people makes very little sense. the film doesn't look good, but what do you expect? the film was shot for very little money on video. off course then it doesn't look as good as a normal film, duh! the one thing i do agree on is that the music is bad. sounds like a cheap soft erotic film from the '80's. the film is not good, okay, but you have to give some credit for pulling this of without any money.
