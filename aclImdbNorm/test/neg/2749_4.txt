as powerful as the true story of phoolan is, this book this film is based on came out before she herself was released from prison and had the chance to tell it. <br /><br />it is allegedly based on her diaries but she is illiterate. how does that work? <br /><br />that said, some areas of he film are accurate and the acting isn't bad, with some sensitivity being shown. <br /><br />really though this story needs to be old in a tv series. far to much happens to cram into a couple of hours. <br /><br />read her autobiography. highly recommended. it is a fantastic story.
