dean koontz's book "watchers" is one of the finest books i have read. sadly, the movie is a sad caricature of the book. the disillusioned middle-aged hero and the lonely spinster with whom he finds a meaning to his life are converted in the movie into a couple of silly teenagers, the stoic security agent and the conscientious sheriff are combined into a farcical villain - you get the picture? the moviemakers have taken a moving tale of love, horror and adventure and converted it into a z-grade horror flick aimed - very poorly - at the teen market.<br /><br />buy the book and enjoy many hours of reading - it will be far, far more rewarding than watching the movie.<br /><br />
