this is a horrific re-make of the french movie ma vie en rose (http://imdb.com/title/tt0119590/). the only scenario that i can imagine in which anyone (sinise?! bates?! butler?! what were they thinking!?!) agreed to be associated with it is maclaine seeing the original, being rightly impressed, and enlisting a friend (with no writing credits -- or talent! -- to his name) to translate the themes for american audiences -- whom they both agreed are stupid, stupid, stupid. then she enlisted other friends to sign up, and they did so as friends -- certainly not on the merits of this pathetically contrived, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink script.<br /><br />i'm not a knee-jerk fan of french film, but ma vie en rose is a subtle, thoughtful, and thought provoking treatment of sensitive cultural issues. i would love to see it get wider exposure among english-speaking audiences -- and if that means an american re-make, so be it. but puh-leeze! a little respect for the issues and the intelligence of the audience -- and better direction for the actors, who couldn't seem to decide if they were working for tennessee williams or jerry lewis!
