one reviewer says of those who might not like this film that "it will only be appreciated by film goers who weary of film as diversion". this, i feel, is rather unfair to those of us who find it boring.<br /><br />i have not become weary or disillusioned with film or with film makers, but found this tedious and self indulgent. but then, it's true, i'm not too big into deep meaningfulness. i feel that it may have great meaning for those in the know, you know.<br /><br />it is very slow and it spends a long time in trying to make its individual points, using imagery, indeed, to do so. but in such days as these, it seems possible that a film like this might be the kind of thing that you'd come across in one of those dark and daunting booths in modern art galleries, rather than on the screen of a popular cinema setting.
