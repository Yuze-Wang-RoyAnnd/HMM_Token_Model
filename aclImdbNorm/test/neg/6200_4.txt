i was really geared up to watch when two of best movie critics tagged this movie as a 'laugh riot'. but the movie turned out be disappointing.<br /><br />you will be advised to watch this movie keeping your brains at home but you simply can't ignore the flaws and the shortcomings.<br /><br />1. the missile scene was total stupidity.<br /><br />2. katrina kaif and govinda pair looked awful. (he's 49 and she's just 24... more than double of her age) 3. salman's comedy is less of acting and more of overacting.<br /><br />4. songs are good but interrupts the pace of the movie.<br /><br />5. some scenes were deliberately attempted by the movie makers to be funny, and 6. poor and flawed story.<br /><br />however, there are few pluses- 1. govinda. great individual performance.<br /><br />2. some scenes are actually quite funny.<br /><br />3. kattrina kaif. looks and acting keeps on improving with every film.<br /><br />4. rajpal yadav's don sequences. though under-utilized but hilarious.<br /><br />so 4 good points, 6 bad ones.. this one gets 4/10.
