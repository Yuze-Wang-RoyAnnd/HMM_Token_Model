can't liberals like alec baldwin get it through their heads that they lost the elections of 2000 and 2004? the ridiculous. lame swipes at walmart, non-union workers, george w bush and the stock market not to mention the intentional gwb accent that balwin's character uses in the film just makes him look silly and bitter on screen. as the credits roll the sour grapes continue as "special thanks" are given to ken lay, and other ceos from enron, tyco, worldcom, and imclone. let me clue you in to something - if you put all your money into one company's stock you're an idiot. we don't need this excuse for a movie to tell us that. what a waste of jim carrey's talent - from the trailer i expected a completely different movie - what i got was a 90 minute dnc commercial on how to scare people into not investing for their own future, keep them stupid, and keep them dependent on government. no wonder hollywood is in trouble and can't make a decent movie anymore - maybe you guys could get an original idea and put it on screen for once...although i shouldn't be surprised since jane fonda was cast in the original.
