in new york, in a morning close to christmas, an upper class father and mother go in their bmw to a private school to see the play of their daughter. then they go shopping and later they return to their fancy apartment in manhattan. in the night, they move to a simple apartment in a dangerous neighborhood, where they prepare drugs for distribution. on the christmas eve, while buying the christmas gift for their daughter, the father is kidnapped, and his wife desperately tries to raise a high amount of money to pay the requested ransom. "r xmas" is a deceptive movie of abel ferrara. the lead characters do not have names, are anonymous, and maybe his intention is to tell that in the breast of a neighbor family in your building may have drug dealers; or that drug dealers may also have families and may be loving persons; or that there are many dirty cops, probably worse than the criminals; or is it a simple apology to crime? whatever! however, this humanization of criminals is a horrible message, and i really did not like this movie. in brazil, for example, many drug dealers and criminals help their communities, due to the absence of the state in poor areas and slums, but this procedure does not make them model citizen. in this movie, we see a loving upper class family in the day, providing drugs as means of living, but the destruction of the members of other families is not shown in the story, and it is impossible to feel sympathy for any characters. in the end, i wished all of them dead. my vote is four.<br /><br />title (brazil): "gangues do gueto" ("gangs of the ghetto")
