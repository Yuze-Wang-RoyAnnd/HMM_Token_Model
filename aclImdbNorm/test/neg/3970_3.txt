parts: the clonus horror is not that bad of a movie. i have the mst3k version of it on tape and it is hilarious, but its still not the worst film the have ever done. i would go so far as to say that it was better than 80% of the movies they have made fun of. the concept could have worked if they had a better script, more money and decent actors. it could have become a classic if it was not so boring and had a bit more excitement. sadly it was botched in production and ended up on mst3k.
