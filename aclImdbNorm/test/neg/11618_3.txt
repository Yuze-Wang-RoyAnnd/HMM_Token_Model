uh, oh! i just said the this "classic" film has a plot that stinks! well, it's true,...so get over it! this film was a vanity project for joseph p. kennedy in which his mistress starred and money flowed to make her an even bigger star. today, only a fragmentary copy exists--one that was retored a few years back. however, even if the film had been in perfect shape, it still would have stunk for many reasons. and, without further ado, here are some of my reasons: <br /><br />first, gloria swanson, aged 31 plays a girl in a convent school--perhaps aged 16 or 18! come on--she looks old enough to be the mother of many of the kids.<br /><br />second, the movie all hinges on the stupid concept of "love at first sight". while some people believe it this, it is ridiculous to believe that a prince would throw away everything on a woman he didn't even know! what a lot of hooey! <br /><br />third, the movie is histrionic and the plot is nuts! after leaving the school, kelly goes off to east africa and then becomes "queen of the whores"--and later, after the evil queen back in europe dies (that's convenient), the prince is able to get out of prison, actually finds kelly and marries her and she then becomes queen of a real honest-to-goodness country! gimme a break--this is ridiculous, even in the days of silent film this plot was a groaner!<br /><br />so, in summary, this is a poor film with great production values (mistresses need to look good) that is parading around as a classic! there are so many better silent films out there--see them first and avoid this tripe.
