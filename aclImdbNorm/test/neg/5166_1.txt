a totally pathetic attempt at movie about sacrifices of australian soldiers during the new guinea campaign. total waste of money even if you only see it on dvd. thankfully the video store provided a free weekly hire with the dvd else it would have been a complete waste of money. probably made by arty types and full of the symbolism that today's chardonay socialists seem so into. frankly this movie is an insult to the memory of the brave chaps that never came back. somebody please provide the funding to make a decent movie at least the equal of saving private ryan. hopefully the rsl will put as much distance between itself and this movie as possible. the story needs to be told from all sides the australians, the locals & the japanese - although getting the latter to tell the truth about anything that happened during the second world war is highly unlikely. basically its rubbish, don't see it, don't buy it. walk away
