yes, this review may contain spoilers, but you'll thank me for it. this is the worst film i've seen in quite some time. i came to this board expecting to see the same response i had, but inexplicably, there are several people who love this film and spacey's performance in particular.<br /><br />some will chastise me for saying it, but i find kevin spacey's acting quite limited despite the world's admiration for him. i felt like i was watching a meaner version of kevin's "american beauty" role. his character in this film is ridiculously overacted, all the way down to his laughable insults he throws at his assistant.<br /><br />there are all-world trite and boring scenes like when spacey is tearing into whaley about bringing him equal instead of sweat and low. somehow, i suspected this particular scene was supposed to be funny, but by this time i was ready to hit the stop button (this is approximately 20 minutes into the film).<br /><br />what about the faux-homage to "resevoir dogs"? whaley proclaims, "i think i saw this in a movie once," as if he's going to cut off spacey's ear. but what does he use to cut him? an envelope! that's right, he's going to give him paper cuts! that has to be one of hollywood's all-time worst scenes, and the fact that the actors and director tried to carry it out with a straight face makes it even more appalling.<br /><br />i will admit that i didn't see the end of this film (my dvd mercifully locked up about a half hour before the end), but anyone who wishes to say so could spare me the line that i missed a great twist and everything would have made sense. well, i don't care what happened in the end, because it could never make up for all that bad acting and relentlessly over-the-top dialogue. i even got the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this film as bad as i did.
