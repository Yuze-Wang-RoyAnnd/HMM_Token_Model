i had never heard of "the clearing" until i was really bored one day with some friends in the local blockbuster and it grabbed our attention. the description on the dvd jacket grabbed our interest, but once we popped it into the dvd player, the boredom was only beginning.<br /><br />the story was dragged out for waaaay too long. it seemed to follow the same outline as other movies which include a kidnapping. the most suspenseful parts were in the beginning of the movie, however. after that, the outline was followed exactly and that made "the clearing" unoriginal. the flashbacks were too many in number and the grief of the victim's family provided nothing interesting nor enhanced the nature of the film. and i also found that i did not like the ending, so that probably led to me not liking the movie at all.<br /><br />the acting was not horrible...it wasn't the greatest, though. robert redford has given much better performances. willem dafoe's tragic character was the only one i really saw develop throughout the story line and the viewer only really sees that change in the last ten minutes or so in the movie. helen mirren's portrayal as robert redford's wife was flat and sort of followed the same generic mold as other movies which include a tragic and heart-splitting event.<br /><br />in my opinion, "the clearing" is nothing to rave about. use your movie rental money on something else...like "garden state," perhaps?
