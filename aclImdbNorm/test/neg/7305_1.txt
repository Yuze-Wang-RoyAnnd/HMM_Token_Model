okay, let's cut to the chase - there's no way i can give this anything other then 1 out of 10; and yet you have to see it! the acting is bad, but is nothing like as bad as the script, which itself pales before the production values. cardboard axes? yup, we've got then. car floor mats painted silver and used as armour? here it is!<br /><br />the film itself pretends to be artistic, but is just cheap; the same shots are used repeatedly - especially in the drawn out fight scenes; there is (thankfully!) very little dialogue, and there is much 'artistic' music to ram home the horror!<br /><br />and yet all this awfulness is compelling - you have to watch it through just so that you can say you've seen it. i've not even got onto the barren sets, the 'plot', or the risible special effects; this really is the 'how not to do it' school of filmmaking. this must be viewed - spread the word, and let the world all join together in puzzling over what on earth is happening at the end<br /><br />the best thing, though, is that they made a sequel.
