i won't go into detail about why this movie deserves an awful rating, plenty of other people have already done that. suffice it to say that out of the over 400 movies that i've owned on dvd, this is the only one that i got rid of- it was so worthless that i couldn't see ever wanting to watch any of it again.<br /><br />however, i do have a comment on the ridiculously high average rating of 2.9 (as of 3-15-06). while skimming through the 4 pages of reviews i saw no rating higher than 3 stars. looking at the voting history, 78% of users rated the movie as 4 stars or less. it looks to me like a few people are stuffing the ballot box to keep this movie off of the imdb "bottom 100" list. it would be interesting to see how many of the 30 users who rated this movie as 10 stars (none of who wrote a review of the movie) are actual active users.<br /><br />don't be fooled, this movie isn't worth your time.
