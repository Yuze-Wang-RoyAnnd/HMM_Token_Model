thankfully brief mystery about a telephone operator who is discovered to be the kidnapped daughter of a railroad tycoon. the discovery brings about an attempt on her life which is foiled by charlie ruggles as a "crime deflector". things take a turn for the dangerous when everyone ends up in the title location and another attempt is made on the girls life. your enjoyment of this film will depend upon your tolerance for rugggles and his nonsense.i normally like ruggles but there was something about this role that rubbed me the wrong way. actually i think it didn't help that the mystery wasn't very good so there was nothing beyond the characters to keep you watching. yes the finale on the train was exciting but it didn't make up for everything that went before. not worth searching out but if you stumble upon it give it a try.
