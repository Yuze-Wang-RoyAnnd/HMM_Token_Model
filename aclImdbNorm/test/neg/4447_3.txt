seriously, all these satan comes to earth movies always involve the catholics. why doesn't lucifer ever mess with the other denominations.<br /><br />the plot is that asmodeus (played by former jason vorhees kane hodder) has a plot to become human (but wasn't he always a demon) by getting this young girl who is his sister pregnant with his child. except maybe she isn't his sister. the plot isn't clear on this, and they inter-splice these scenes where he is seeing a shrink about his problem.<br /><br />the lead girl gets pregnant while still a virgin, with an incredibly creepy scene of her father giving her a gynecological exam to prove her hymen is still intact.... eeeewwwwww. her sister (played by a washed up and looking much worse for wear denise crosby) concludes that this is a sign from heaven. praise be! <br /><br />well, the demon baby takes mom's body for a joy ride and picks off, in order, a truck driver, her friend's boyfriend and her friend, all being watched by an ex-military priest whose mission is to kill the baby when it is born. we discover that asmodeus is actually a catholic cardinal who is running the whole thing.<br /><br />the ending is pretty much incomprehensible, and if you could make it that far straight through, you have a stronger stomach than i did. (i paused the film a couple of times, it was so awful.)
