if halloween 5 was a cruel joke to the fans of the series, than halloween 6 is a like a vicious insult. the storyline has gone to the dogs everyone. michael is used as a helpless pawn in this film and he isn't at all scary. he reminds me of an over-weight alcoholic man than the boogeyman that struck fear in our hearts back in the original. there are almost no redeemable qualities about this feature and i'm so glad h20 came out because it would be an insult to fans to have this be fresh on our minds.<br /><br />halloween 6 had about 2 aspects that i liked. having an adult tommy doyle in the film was a nice touch and it linked it to the original. donald pleasance is here(in his last performance...what a bad film to end an otherwise nice career on). when he's on screen he makes you remember the good old days when halloween was actually scary.<br /><br />that's about it my friends. the stalk sequences are unoriginal. one of them being a blatant rip-off of the laurie/michael chase in the original. the other characters are terribly under-written and just aren't likable. the music, on of halloween's highlights even when the film is bad, is tortured in this film. we get a silly rock version of the stalk/chase theme. what were they thinking when they made this film.<br /><br />*spoiler*<br /><br />their biggest mistake was killin off the character of jamie(now played by another actress who isn't worth mentioning)we watched this character escape death in two films. we rooted for her and when she is killed in this film you cant help but feel sorry for her and realize that the filmmakers don't care when good characters are established in a film.<br /><br />*end spoiler*<br /><br />the less said about thi embarrassment the better. i wish it didn't exist. i suggest skipping this film, and even 5, and just going straight to h20 because if you watch this you may not want to see another halloween film again.
