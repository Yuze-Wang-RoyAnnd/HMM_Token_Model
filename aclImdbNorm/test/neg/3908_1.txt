about five years ago, my friend and i went to the video rental store to get something to watch. my friend saw space truckers on the shelf, and so we got it. once we got home and started watching it, we realized what an absolute piece of crap it was! a beer can floating in space? a guy taking a dump in a toilet? a guy with a mechanical dick who tries to arouse a women by saying, "whizz, whizz!"? wtf!!! the dumbest, stupidest, most retarded, horribly throne together piece of trash my eyes have ever been exposed to. my friend and i still refer to it as the worst movie we have ever seen. only one other movie has come close to its crappiness (and that would be the stupid jackie chan flick, "the medalion"). if you eyes ever see this piece of junk on the shelf at your video store, proceed to do the following: 1. take it off the shelf and throw it to the ground. 2. stomp on it for at least 30 seconds. 3. proceed to set it on fire in a contained facility (bathroom stall). 4. lastly, take it to your local hazardous waste management facility immediately so that it may be properly dealt with.<br /><br />stay away from "space truckers"!!!!!!!!
