as a kid, this movie scared me green. as an adult, i couldn't stop laughing.<br /><br />i have not had the pleasure of watching this movie via mst3k. i caught it, instead, on a late saturday afternoon, when there was absolutely nothing in the theaters, and there was nothing left to do outside but rake some autumn leaves. i figured, this had to be better. i was wrong.<br /><br />the movie has some very good elements; a water-divining mystic, a beatnik painter, couple of idiot ranch hands, an elderly history buff, and an "evil wind." um...i mean...evil head. an evil head which will, as soon as the systematic hypnotism of each and every one present is complete, be looking for its evil body.<br /><br />the whole story takes place on an evil "ranch" which apparently neither grows crops, nor raises evil livestock.<br /><br />as everything is declared by their resident mystic to be "evil," you either roll your eyes horribly, or laugh til your sides split, depending on your mood. me? i laughed until i had tears streaming down my face.<br /><br />i remembered this movie fondly as one of those which really scared me as a kid. but some kids are afraid of santa claus, too..no? anyway... if you're into 50's horror camp, then this is definitely a movie you shouldn't miss. <br /><br />if you're looking for a good story line, this movie has that. it's the over the top dramatics and downright innocence of the time that makes it so horrid. the acting was just bad, but it still had some good elements. perhaps it rates a remake...? <br /><br />it rates a 4.3/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
