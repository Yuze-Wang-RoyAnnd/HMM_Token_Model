i really liked get shorty, but this movie was completely disappointing as a sequel. first of all, travolta does not in any way resemble the chili palmer from get shorty. he merely half-assed this performance as he has done in all of his more recent movies. he totally isn't smooth or have the mobster presence about him that makes you kinda root for him throughout the movie. it just seems like travolta rolled out of bed and decided he was good to go for acting in this movie. the plot just wasn't exciting or clever, there really aren't any highlights that happen, the only thing that resembled entertainment was watching christina millian perform and the rock was funny. but anyways, long story short, this movie was trash and i had to force myself just to get through it.
