apparently in early 2005, scifi channel threatened to release the incriminating photos they have of john rhys-davies and said, "we need you to star in another scifi original." the scary thing is, he's actually pretty damn good in this movie. that's really saying something since this is a silly scifi creature feature; you've gotta put some feeling into it in order to be well-acted. unfortunately, nobody else does. it's your stereotypical "moster-run-amok" movie on a cruise ship. the cryptozoologist wants to keep the creature alive, the navy seals think they have everything under control but they don't know what they're dealing with and they all end up dead, a girl jumps into the "movie sexpot" role as rhys-davies' daughter and the creature mauls about 100 or so shipmates. what this movie has going for it is, it's very fast-paced and lively; you're never bored or waiting for another kill. other than that, though, it does nothing to distinguish itself, and it's silly that this thing crawls all over the ceilings and can't be wounded by navy seal machine guns, but can be karate-kicked into submission by rhys-davies' daughter. kinda went back and forth on giving this bad boy a 5, but for the above silliness i'm giving it a 4.
