i bought this dvd for my young son who loves the toystory movies. i never expected it to be in the same league as the toystory movies but what i got was just another lazy disney cartoon, way below what i expected from disney/pixar. the story is unoriginal, the characters are dull and two dimensional, the animation is below par, even buzz isn't that great. the movie could have been so much better. i especially hated the paint by numbers storyline. i know it's meant for kids, but even kids know when something stinks to this level lameness.<br /><br />although i did enjoy some aspects of the movie, i really liked the opening section of the movie, with the slag mutant monster, it just went downhill from there.
