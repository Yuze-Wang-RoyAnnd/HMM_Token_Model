this movie is the proverbial 80s flick that shows the viewer that as long as he or she tries at something, they can be better than the pros. the main character, doug, showed off his skills in flying a cessna aircraft, which somehow equated to being fully capable of flying a jet aircraft and being able to kill people. we all would like to have a few million dollars to play with... maybe make a good investment, donate, buy a few things, but the directors of this movie decided to make iron eagle... not once... not twice... not even three times; yes, four times. the thing to look most forward to are the multitude 'hollywood endings' in this movie. just when you think the movie is going to end after a cheesy end sequence, there's another cheesy end sequence. then another. definitely a movie one must watch to believe... and maybe own just to remind oneself of how awesome the 80s must have been.
