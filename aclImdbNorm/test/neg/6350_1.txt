if you would like to watch an example of how not to make a film, then you need to watch this. i, myself, with no film making experience could do better. the script is laughable with a weak plot and there is no effort to be seen for any intelligent structure. in order to make up for this flaw, you would think the action would be decent, wouldn't you?<br /><br />as the acting, editing and overall piecing together of the film is appalling the only saving grace is the dreadful performance by the lead actor. the reason why he is the saving grace, is because he is so genuinely bad at acting, that he should win an oscar for it. at least some recognition for making me laugh at him so much.<br /><br />toss in a dead woman's body after an all male shoot out (where did she come from?), pull the semi automatic trigger tens of times while the soundman pulls off two gunshot effects, reflection of the camera crew in kool mo dee's shades, one and only one music track for the whole film, an unoriginal script that has no logic; is a perfect recipe for a really, really bad film. its actually more fun spotting the errors than actually trying to find something positive. avoid at all costs.
