it's amazing to think that this movie came out only one year before star wars but seems a million years behind it in sophistication and special effects. actually, the art direction and set design (nice victorian space ship) aren't bad; it's the monster costumes that are the most laughable, resembling the "guy in a rubber suit" monsters from the lost in space tv show. the evil cave-man makeup reminded me of some of the aliens from ancient twilight zone reruns.<br /><br />the script is stilted, and outside of peter cushing's comic relief the acting is pretty miserable too. this movie is only recommended if you really enjoy bad kitschy sf. and the music...yikes! a horrible 70s experiment with synthesizers that doesn't fit the time period of the film and which sounds like someone rambling with a minimoog and a 2-track tape machine.
