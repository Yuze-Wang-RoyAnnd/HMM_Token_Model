to date this is still the worst piece of rubbish i've ever viewed. so annoyed i even complained to blockbuster for stocking it. me and some friends rented it after looking at the back cover thinking we were in for a good horror film. the plot line seem to change during the film and there was lots of irrelevant padding. the film ended quite abruptly, i'm guessing they ran out of film. sound quality was dire and the first female character had a very thick spanish accent although she talked utter nonsense anyway. the guy provided a brief bit of eye candy until his bizarre attempts at murder. after wasting all the time to go into in-depth discussion on the workshop and its many power tools, he opts to put a plastic bag over her head. all in all on second thoughts i think you have to watch this film to actually believe it exists.
