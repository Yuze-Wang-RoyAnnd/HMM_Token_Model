franco nero stars as cole a ninja who comes to the rescue of his war buddy frank landers (alex courtney) and his fetching wife (susan george) to protect them from a mobster (christopher george) who wants the land. things get even more complicated when the mobster hires cole's old nemesis (sho kosugi) who is also a ninja. inept martial arts actioner, while having better production values then most ninja movies, fails to inject any life into the surroundings, or for that matter actionscenes. a poor effort all around.
