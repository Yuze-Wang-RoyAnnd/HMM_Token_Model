it's amazing that such a cliche-ridden yuppie angst film actually got made in the first place. the characters are so weak, and the acting so uninspired, that it's impossible to care about any of them-- especially brooke shields. the temptation to fast forward through the slow parts is almost irresistible. if you like this genre, you'd be better off renting "singles," or "bodies, rest & motion."
