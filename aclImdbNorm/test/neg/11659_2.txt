all i can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commenters. this is city of god meets happy days. the bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing. you can approach it in one of two ways: (1) a gritty, realistic movie turned sappy; or (2) a sappy, abc-afterschool-special with profanity, violence and animal cruelty. either way it just don't fly, do it? why then has it received so much praise? as others have implied, it gets the "conscience vote" from the west. show us pictures of poverty to contrast against our fluffy, double-wide theatre seats and 44-oz cokes, and we'll applaud in a heartbeat. but--oh--don't forget to candy coat it, because the bitter pill of reality (tantalizing as it is) is hard for us to swallow.<br /><br />i'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there. all i can say is: beware of any film that receives awards (hollywood oscars = sweeping, syrupy tripe. cannes film festival = beard-stroking, artless propaganda). to find the real gems, you'll have to work hard at it.
