a washed up reporter called bart crosbie (pat o' brien) blackmails gang boss heinz webber (george colouris) for the money to pay for his son to have a life saving operation. in return he agrees to turn himself in for the murder of his editor, whom the gang killed in order to prevent an incriminating story being printed about them.<br /><br />typical poverty-row b-pic of the time directed for far more than it's worth by terence fisher, who within months of making this would become one of the leading british horror film directors at the hammer studio. the script is far-fetched and teen idol tommy steele (guitar in hand) was drafted in to sing a poor rock and roll number called "the rebel" at a coffee bar that acts as a legitimate front for the gang's activities.
