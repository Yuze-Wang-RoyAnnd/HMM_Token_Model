if you first saw this movie with mary of the fourth form, then it's perhaps possible for the haze of nostalgia to encourage your charitable side. if not, it doesn't stand a chance. the young things' hipspeak is complete nonsense, people may have used the occasional word you'll hear here, but not huge batches of them in sentence after sentence. it doesn't so much date dracula ad 1972 as blow it to pieces, from the moment anyone under thirty opens their mouth it's impossible to take the film seriously and as for it being a laugh, it's not even a smile. the idea of throwing dracula into modern times is a good one and worthy of a far stronger script than don houghton can provide. the river thames and chelsea male are no match for puppet bats, model castles and terrified extras, but you can't help but feel that with better writing it would have been so different.
