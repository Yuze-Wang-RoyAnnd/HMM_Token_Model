ok, i just flipped channels and caught dw3. i watched it knowing it would be trash..but..as a person who has seen tons of films, this one stands up there as one of the most purely bad films i have ever seen...i'm not kidding. it is so bad you have to watch it, like a bad accident you can't turn away from. sometimes these kinds of films work, ie, troma movies...but watching martin balsam and charles bronson slum it up like this is painful....what's even funnier is i pulled up imdb to see what other people said and it actually scores a 4.1/10??? i can't believe it made it past 1.5! equally as funny is this is not even the pinnacle of this series...somehow this garbage warranted part 4 and 5? and to top it all off, some dude's comments on here referenced this as the best of the series and his favorite film of all time??? statements like that scare me about this world!
