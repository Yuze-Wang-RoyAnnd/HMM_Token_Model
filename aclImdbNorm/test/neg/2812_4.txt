reports of this film's brilliance appear to have been greatly exaggerated, and unless the other reviewers were watching a different movie, i fail to see how anyone can find this film anything other than dull, unscary, uncreepy, overlong, and at times, unbearably irritating. i'm not some schlocky horror fanatic. i love j-horrors and euro-horrors over american horrors any day, but i feel the need to warn any potential viewers about this film before they invest two hours of their life in it.<br /><br />it could have been so great. a reporter is investigating a series of bizarre deaths and occurrences, which seem ostensibly unlinked, but a series of unnerving tropes appears to connect them - dead pigeons, thudding noises, the presence of strangely tied knots... our reporter goes from person to person, interviewing them, filming them and then passing on. three important characters are among this jumble of people, a young, shy psychic girl, an immensely irritating, insane psychic man, and a crazy old woman and her boy, whose importance is not revealed until later on.<br /><br />the problem is that the film is not even remotely interesting, which makes its two hour running time unforgivable. it's also not even remotely scary or creepy. supposedly scary scenes, like shots of ghoulish faces are done incredibly poorly, shown twice, or worse, we are told when they are about to happen. other techniques, such as telling us that a family just interviewed "died five days later" simply don't make me care, let alone mildly creeped.<br /><br />the film does pick up a bit towards the end, as our reporter, cameraman, psychic and cursed woman go to a village in order to 'remove' the curse which is linking all these deaths. however, by that time, i was in a state of catatonic boredom, and couldn't care less, so all the fairly creepy camera-work and shocks were wasted on me. the "final tape" is quite good, but once again, i'd given up caring and just wanted this film to end.<br /><br />boring and dull, not scary and not creepy, i would advise you keep away from noroi. it has promising moments, but this is a film that was poorly made and not worth your time.
