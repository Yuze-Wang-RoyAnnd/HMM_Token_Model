i just finished up this unofficial adaptation of h.p. lovecraft's "the lurking fear" that was shot in louisiana. outside of a few changes (names, setting), this follows the short story point by point for the first 70 minutes but then tries to inject its own "twist" ending that you could see coming from a mile away. either way, it is a much better adaptation than full moon's the lurking fear. too bad it is a terrible film. director david mccormick shoots the thing with all the flair of an industrial short. i swear i counted maybe two camera movements. the creature design is cheap (we're talking store bought masks here) but shot in a dark manner (intentional or not) where they are somewhat creepy. the most impressive thing in the picture is the abandoned mansion but mccormick fails to exploit that as well. file this one under good adaptation, poor execution.
