*mild spoilers*<br /><br />in this would-be satire, chaplin set his sights on the evils of german fascism, playing the twin roles of tomanian dictator adenoid hynkel and one of his subjects, an inadvertent world war i hero and jewish barber. through events inspired by both adolf hitler and the marx brothers, hynkel negotiates contracts and declares war on neighbouring osterlich whilst finding time for numerous, oddly flat set-pieces. the dictator's much-celebrated waltz with an inflatable globe is actually entirely heavyhanded, underwhelming and unfunny.<br /><br />chaplin should certainly be commended for looking to lampoon hitler and for speaking out strongly on celluloid - his much-maligned final speech is actually the bold, memorable highlight of the piece - but the film simply isn't sharp or funny enough to merit the praise frequently heaped upon it, nor to demand repeated viewings. the best gags are away from hynkel's tiresome posturing and involve the barber attempting to avoid a large spinning bomb (a sequence which steals from the gun tussle in the gold rush) and later, with a pot on his head, accidentally walking the plank off the roof of his shop.<br /><br />compared to the director's silent classics, the great dictator is slow, wildly inconsistent and altogether somewhat unsatisfactory, whilst the barren spells between laughs are often long and difficult to endure. there is no doubt that chaplin was a genius, but even geniuses make disappointing pictures and the great dictator certainly ranks as such.
