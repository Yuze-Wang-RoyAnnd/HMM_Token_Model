i thought this is an unbelievable boring movie! i heard the director can't speak french and so he left his actors tell what they wanted... well, valeria bruni-tedeschi is great, as usual but i can't say the same of other actors. they have nothing to say, especially bruno todeschini.<br /><br />they all seem very tired, this being one of the movie plot : tired of being together, of living abroad, of their live in general; so they spend half the movie sleeping in a hotel room. after a while i felt sleepy myself...<br /><br />i gave 4, because of some very beautiful scenes, including the last one.
