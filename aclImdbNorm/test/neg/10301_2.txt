i work at memorial hermann hospital (tmc) and was also working at texas children's hospital, women's hospital, and west houston, during allison. first the shots of the hospital are sadly suburban. the texas medical center has a daytime population density similar to wall street!! there are huge skyscraper professional buildings and hospitals. tch was the largest children's hospital before it doubled in size, twice! methodist, with its 1500 beds is one of the largest hospital in world. the texas medical center skyline is bigger than that of memphis. yet, the best pics hollywood could muster are that of some dinky hospital in the middle of nowhere (besides the real pic of the hospital taken decades ago). also, they combined several real-life characters and portrayed them all in one (super-nurse). i actually know the medical technologist(s) working in the blood bank. two where actually working at the time but the movie shows only one pregnant mt. there was a pregnant mt, and another mt that took the precious patient antibody rolodex (research "alloantibodies" for more info). i will not mention their names (privacy). there was no nurse in the real life lab scene. hollywood combined these two techs (most likely to save time and money). in the movie, military helicopters (true) had to transfer the our babies (nicu and picu) to utmb all the way to galveston! why you may ask, when we have the largest children's hospital just down the street? because texas children's hospital refused to take them. you read right, they refused!!! being employed by them, i was ashamed. needless-to-say, i'm no longer affiliated with that facility. any other comments would be repetitive to the ones already posted by the people that who actually live here, or lived through the experience.
