"thunderbolt" is probably jackie chan's worst movie since "the protector" in 1985. yes, i know that nobody watches his movies for their stories, but the plotting of this one is unusually lame, even by his standards, and while the fight choreography is up to his standards, the fight scenes (the whole two of them) are ruined, as others have mentioned, by the frenetic, distracting camerawork. even the most serious jackie chan fans shouldn't really bother with this offensively haphazard, stunt-and-plug-filled garbage. anita yuen's cute and perky performance is one of the few redeeming virtues. for a good "serious jackie" movie, i recommend "crime story".
