my only reason registering to this site was for the opportunity to write a comment to this movie. i felt that i had to get rid of some of my anger by writing it off me. <br /><br />the movie "babas bilar" must be just about the worst film i ever seen. i really do believe that the script may have seen to been able to become a pretty good movie or at least ok, but somewhere on the line something happened. what makes it even more odd is the fact that the cast appears to be quite alright on paper. put to practice both script and the cast fails to deliver. there are to much action, it happens to much things and you can't help wonder why it happens. and then the cast, the actors make such a poor effort that you almost start to cry. <br /><br />if you have to much time at hand i would say you can see it. if not - don't.
