after watching caddyshack 1 i'd heard there was a sequel and decided to look it up. the movie seemed pretty bad and i told myself to stay away but stupid me gave in and actually bought the damn thing! all the reviews and everything bad you've heard about caddyshack ii are true. the movie is simply worn of ideas and the lamest plot and jokes i've ever heard, the gopher, the acting the whole movie really is bad (randy quaid was funny though).<br /><br />just stay away from this movie as much as you can is all i can really say. i deeply regret watching and buying the dvd but not sure which was the worser decision. just stay away as much as possible.
