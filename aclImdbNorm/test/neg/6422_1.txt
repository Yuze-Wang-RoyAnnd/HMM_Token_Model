if you see this film in the tv listings just ignore it. if you're looking for something scary you'll be better off watching reruns of the x-files.<br /><br />previous comments referencing the incredibly poor acting by the female lead are dead on. she is almost unwatchable. the sum total of her range includes 'whiny and scared' and 'whiny and not scared'.<br /><br />i am the kind of movie buff who enjoys a good 'bad' movie. but this is ridiculous. there is no direction. the plot is as simplistic as the set of numbers they keep throwing at you and much like that set of numbers, it ends up having no meaning in the end.<br /><br />your time will be better spent if you turn off the tv and give your dog a bath.
