a very un-tom and jerry short. jerry narrates this tale that revolves around tom the cat falling in love and losing her to his rival, butch. tom is best friends with jerry here which irked me a bit. the cartoon is also presented in cinemascope. overall i found this tom and jerry cartoon sad and depressing. the should have just put "puss gets the boot" on the dvd instead and i would've been happy. this experimental animated short can be found on disc 2 of warner brother's 2-dvd spotlight collection set. it's the last one on the set and i'm hoping that warner brothers chooses to release a second volume soon.<br /><br />my grade: c-
