i started to take a critical view on this adaptation within the first few minutes but as a dedicated jane austen fan i persevered through to the end... however, this is not a programme i would recommend to someone unfamiliar with her work as i don't think it does the book justice, nor makes particularly entertaining television in its own right. there was something about this adaptation that lacked believability - many of the costumes and even the actors did not have an authentic look and i found the acting to be, at times, poor. there is no doubt that the actors were all very good-looking, but this didn't provide enough variety to create really diverse, memorable characters. it was far too static being set entirely in the same location and missing out fanny's return home, which is one of the most interesting parts of the story. the best actor was blake ritson, who captured the wholesomeness of edmund very well, and the crawfords were effectively cast too. i do like billie piper as an actress, but this role did not suit her and was much better played by frances o'connor in the 1999 version who gave overall a far more subtle and convincing performance. jane austen adaptations will always provide a love story to leave you feeling good but unfortunately, this is one of the worst i have seen.
