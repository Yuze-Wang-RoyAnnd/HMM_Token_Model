this movie is a bad movie. but after watching an endless series of bad horror movies, i can say that it is a little different from many i have seen. not in the plot, which is a fairly regular slasher story, but more the way the scenes are cut. murder weapon gives us a lot of inane dialogue scenes, but they go on for a lot longer than in most movies of this type. because of this some of the victims seem slightly less like cardboard cut-outs. just slightly. i had a difficult time figuring out exactly what was happening at the beginning and kept wondering if certain events were dream sequences. my favorite scene is when two guys are on the run from the killer and take refuge in a car. in the glove compartment, they find a handgun. "thank you, god!" one of them happily exclaims. that guy's head suddenly looks like a mannequin's head, and it went on for just enough time for me to wonder, "what is that? where is that mannequin in relation to the two guys in the car?" then boom! the head explodes and i figured out that it was supposed to be one of the guys in the car getting his head shot off with a shotgun. i love that scene, but the movie is a very bad movie. 3/10.
