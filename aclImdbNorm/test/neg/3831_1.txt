i attended the premier last night. the movie started out with a bang (perhaps due to pre-premier excitement). the audience laughed for about 15 minutes, then most of us spent the rest of the time fighting off sleep. this movie can not be compared to _spinal tap_ or any of guest's work, unless you want to say _sons of provo_ is a wanna-be gone awfully wrong. it just fell flat, it died, it was painful. the story went nowhere, the jokes were bland, even if you were a mormon and could get all of the inside jokes, it felt like a waste of time. there were two redeeming qualities: kirby's acting was spot on! and the songs were very clever (for an lds audience only). so, my recommendations... avoid the movie. and if you are mormon, buy the music cd.
