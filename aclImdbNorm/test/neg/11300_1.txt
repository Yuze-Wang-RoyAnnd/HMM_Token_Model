i have witnessed some atrocities of cinema. in the past couple of years, it seems producers and directors are bent on making films that drive me closer and closer to insanity. hannibal was not an exception. i wasn't expecting much, when i went in to see the movie. the book was ridiculous, and the saying, "the book is always better than the movie" did not assure me at all that this movie would be anything but trash. but what i came to see was a movie that made all other bad movies seem better in comparison.<br /><br /> usually, when i see a terrible movie, i find myself more amused than anything else. sadly though, i could not even laugh at the sad excuse for a film that hannibal is. the movie was filmed with promise, i guess. it had anthony hopkins, julianne moore, and gary oldman. and for directing, there was ridley scott. there have been movies with significantly less talent that have been tremendously better. there was so much i would have cut from this film that i doubt anything would have remained. it was pathetic. the storyline was so ludicrous that it seemed like a complete idiot had written it. what's worse is that the book was even crazier, and there were some scenes that were too extreme to be included, which is sad in the case of a movie where<br /><br />***spoiler ahead*** <br /><br />ray liotta's brain was being cooked in pieces. that scene more than any other made me want to cry, because it tarnished its predecessor to such a monumental level. silence of the lambs was one of my favorite films of all time. but hannibal was a two hour plus joke. this movie should only be watched, if people want to learn how not to write a good movie.
