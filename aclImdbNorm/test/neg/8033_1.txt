even mel gibson couldnt save this slop of a movie. this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. why would mel gibson make a movie that im sure he couldnt sit and watch? what was this? a total goofball on some heavy drugs stalking a schizophrinic lady, who was also on some heavy ilicit street drugs. for all the moviegoers out there on heavy drugs; you will love this movie.
