if you are planning to watch 'partner' and are on imdb reading reviews about it, you have already wasted too much time over this stupid, idiotic, awful movie.<br /><br />it's a horrible, horrible, horrible copy of the movie 'hitch.' i choose to ignore all the other warnings and bad reviews i had heard about this movie, and wasted a precious 20 minutes on it - i thought that after all its david dhawan who is making it, and it has govinda - how bad can it be? but after 20 minutes of watching this nonsense, i couldn't take it any more, and turned off my computer.<br /><br />overacting by everyone in the movie, stupid dialogues, total time waste - i gave it a 1-star rating because that's the lowest you can do. if i could go lower, i would have given it a -100 rating.
