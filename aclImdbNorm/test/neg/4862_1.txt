funny thing. charlie sheen, donald sutherland, sam waterston, and stephen lang have all had incredible performances. who can forget sheen as the callow naif in wall street, or sutherland as the the cynical korean war surgeon in mash? waterston and lang have both also had successful tv and film careers (law and order, killing fields, de niro's tribeca, etc). so what in the world would any of these fine actors be doing in a stink bomb like this?<br /><br />shadow conspiracy's plot of a washington coup d'etat is not really that bad, unoriginal maybe but not that bad. sure it's been done (seven days in may - a fine film!), but with a little tweaking, it could still have been entertaining. <br /><br />shadow conspiracy's main problem is in the execution. early in the film sheen, political strategist extreme, ridiculously and implausibly resolves a potential public relations gaffe by blackmailing a congressman. later, gunplay with lang's mute hitman tearing up half of what is supposed to be georgetown is explained on the news as "gang wars". has anyone remotely associated with this film ever lived a day in washington? sheen is about 20 years too young, way way too young, to be so senior in a white house administration. sheen's response to avert a political crisis is so ladened with false machismo, he looks as though he attended the david hasselhoff school of acting. and when was the last time gang wars spread to georgetown? we're talking about a section of washington where citizens voted against having a metro stop so that they could maintain their exclusivity.<br /><br />i agree with another reviewer that this film would have been unbearable without the fast forward button. i taped it off hbo a year ago and then took 3 separate viewings to plod through it.<br /><br />in summary: don't buy this film. don't even rent this film. if you see it at blockbuster, run away as fast as you can.
