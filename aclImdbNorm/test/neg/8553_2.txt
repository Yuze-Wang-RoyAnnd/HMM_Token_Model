ugly women-of-the-cellblock flick rakes the bottom of the midnight-movie barrel, combining pulpy sleaze with the hoariest of girls-in-the-shower clich'es. linda blair plays an innocent sent to jail (we learn offhandedly she was involved in running over some guy with her car), facing hard time in the big house with some of the nastiest characters this side of a russ meyer pic. blair is continually pawed at, punched, raped, humiliated and harassed. the dialogue is four-letter-word disgusting throughout, and the flick offers no let-up from its barrage of violence and stupidity. still, some viewers see this as a camp classic, though perhaps its tongue isn't far enough in cheek. * from ****
