i actually liked certain things about this game. i loved the first person perspective and wish we had had that choice in the first three games. there's nothing like seeing the monsters up close, in your face. the graphics really weren't bad, but i would have liked more things to interact with even though it was just a shooter. the music was fine. the things i hated were: the movement kind of sucked and aiming was a total pain. the story was too lame for words and too much of the same old thing with no originality. the inability to save was awful!!! some of us do have a life and would like to save to finish the game later. i thought the weapons kind of sucked, too. this game is fun for awhile, but it's nothing like the first three and only good if you just want to shoot stuff. i'd recommend it for the novelty of playing in the first person, but that's about it. play it at your own risk.
