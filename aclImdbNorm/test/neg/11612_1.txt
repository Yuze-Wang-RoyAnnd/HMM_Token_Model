the storyline seemed fine, the actors seemed fine, the movie should<br /><br />have been fine. but it sure wasn't - it didn't lead us anywhere, the<br /><br />scenes are weird. maybe it was meant to create something new, to make<br /><br />us think. that atleast it did: where is the rest of this film? to me it<br /><br />was waste of money, time, and talent. someone might want to see this<br /><br />for curiosity, to see if they can figure it out. other i personally<br /><br />wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
