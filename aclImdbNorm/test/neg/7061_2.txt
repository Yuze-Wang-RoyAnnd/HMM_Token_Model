into a happy household comes the gypsy girl, played by myrna loy. with her amazingly wild hair and voice that sounds very high-pitched and weird, it's hard to believe this is loy!! she bears no similarity whatsoever to the refined and funny character nora charles who she played in the thin man movies. instead, she overacts so badly that you'd almost expect her to be in an ed wood movie. what a huge difference a few years made in the quality films she got as well as her acting ability!! on top of the horrendously silly character, the film also fails because it just isn't interesting or exciting--just very, very stagy and stupid. the only thing good about it is the vitaphone sound system--making the sound quality of this turkey about the best i have heard from 1929. heck, it was even better than most 1930 films, so the sound technician at least has something to be proud of--all others, forget it.<br /><br />this is a movie that even the host of turner classic movies referred to as a "guilty pleasure" because the movie is so bad! and, after having seen it i disagree...slightly. the movie is simply bad.
