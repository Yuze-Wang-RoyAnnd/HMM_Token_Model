(this review will have some very obvious spoilers, so beware.)<br /><br />a friend brought this over, and we made it through 45 minutes of the movie before we decided that fast forward 8x speed was the only way that this film should be watched. there were points when we were watching the movie at normal speed where i would leave, prepare part of lunch, and return, to find that literally nothing had happened. 2 lines of meaningless dialogue were exchanged. nothing happened the background, no important facial gestures were made, nothing but mind-numbing awkward silence.<br /><br />this is not how to make a thoughtful film, especially when the movie's plot follows all the same basic hollywood movie tropes. if i told you that disney was making a film about 4 girls starting a band, and the singer was a french exchange student, what you would expect to be the "conflicts" that arise?<br /><br />the lead singer has to overcome stage fright? someone has an unspoken crush? the band is late for their performance, and a side-character has to buy them time?<br /><br />*spoiler alert*<br /><br />all of those things happen in this movie.<br /><br />at no point in this film do you have even the slightest fraction of concern that these girls won't be able to accomplish their goal.<br /><br />*this ends the section of spoilers*<br /><br />i like japanese films. i've spent a lot of time in japan. i work for a japanese company. heck, i even know all the bands referenced in the record collections and mds that they're going through, and i've sung along to the title track with friends at karaoke.<br /><br />this is probably the worst film from japan i've ever seen. do not be confused. though the characters will have points in the movie where they do typical japanese high school things, this is not a "typical day in the life of" movie. this is "a day in the life of 4 extremely random, heavily-conflicted, awkward japanese students."<br /><br />there are noticeable problems with the dvd, as well. viz decided that a great extra would be a producer reading aloud the wikipedia entry about the blue hearts. what a value! in addition, they care so little about the subtitling that the band's name in the subtitles, "paran maum" is different than it is in the chapter selection menu, "paran marum". in the final auditorium scene, there is a very visible reflection/ghosting effect on everything, but this seems to be the fault of the original film.<br /><br />2/10, do not view if you do not absolutely love awkward silences.
