the acting was flat (at least none of the actors sounded like they'd just got the script that morning) and the film and sound quality made me think of the 70s movie of the week bombs. the only thing that told me that it was indeed not a 70s movie of the week was the reference to dna testing. but for me, being eastern orthodox, the most egregious thing about this....film.....was the total romishness of the religion. romania is 88% orthodox but you'd never know that from this movie: father soren is irish. and i'd have known this even if i hadn't seen the actor play the irish pub keep, michael sullivan in star trek: voyager's "fairhaven" episodes. the bishop was wearing roman vestments (and for the record not even orthodox bishops wear their vestments unless they're saying the liturgy, especially if they live in a monastery). about the only non-romish paraphernalia i saw was the 3-bar cross on the door of the church, and even then i had to squint to see it. the first reviewer said the producers had done their research. well, if that's true they messed up on the religious aspect of the film.
