this movie was terrible. you couldn't fast forward fast enough to get to the end of this movie. it came down to the last 20 minutes of the film and i literally hit the eject button right in the middle of the scene. it was one of the worst movies i have ever experienced. worse than all dean cain films combined. to start, the acting was terrible. i realize that the main actors were from the cast of survivor, but one would think that any tv experience would have given them a little more talent. the movies other main problem was the campy visual effects and the poor film quality. in the movies defense, the theme of the show was well intentioned and the story was all right.
