the movie contains a very short scene of deneuve in a bathtub. she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age 56, but this is the only saving grace of the movie. otherwise, it has a mindless, unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of deneuve's appeal. the director apparently watched too many peter greenaway films and pola x comes across as a student's imitation of the greenaway style, without any of his inspiration.
