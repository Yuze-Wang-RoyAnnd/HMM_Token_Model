i went to see "passion of mind" because i usually get a kick out of the genre of alternate reality romances, i.e. "sliding doors," "me, myself, i," etc. <br /><br />but this was the worst one i've ever seen! i had to force myself to sit through it. i didn't even stay through the credits which is unheard of for me.<br /><br />the magical realism was completely missing because demi moore was grim and the lovers she was two-timing were guys who usually play villains, though each was kind of sexy and appealing.<br /><br />there was actually a psychological explanation provided for the dual lives, with a distasteful frisson of the elektra complex; maybe the magic shouldn't be explained for this genre to work.<br /><br />(originally written 5/28/2000)
