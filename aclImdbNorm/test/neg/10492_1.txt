imagine what it must have been like for john agar. one of hollywood's handsome leading men. married to shirley temple for five years. he finds himself doing movies like this. i remember him in "tarantula" where he wasn't half bad. unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend this film. the monster is dumb uninteresting and incompetent. the police are boring. the teenagers are boring. the plot is stupid. people run around. there are events that do nothing to advance the plot. there's dancing that goes on and on, and then there is no attack. there is some idiotic love triangle that no one could care the least about. it isn't even campy or outrageous. it's just no worth anything. agar might as well have been a post. he's given nothing to do.
