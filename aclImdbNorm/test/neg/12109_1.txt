to even say that this film is sebastien's work at his best just tell you everything you have to know on the man. sebastien is a pathetic, foolish, not amusing at best, yet highly popular host on french television. if watching any of his shows is just plain torture for any normally constituted human being, his first (ans lets hope only) film proved to be even worst. sebastien's apology of rape (the victim fall in love with her aggressor) is not only misplaced but plainly unacceptable. i highly suggest you not to bother taking a look at this picture (or any of sebastien's future features), you would just loose your time...there is something about french television that don't smell right...and this is patrick sebastien!!!
