this movie is like so many biopic tv movies i have seen: formulaic, exaggerating, poorly acted, and most importantly, happening too soon.<br /><br />what i mean by that is the movie was filmed and, for that matter, aired before michael jackson's acquittal from his child molestation charges, which i think was one of the most significant periods of jackson's life and career so far. it probably would have made a great ending to this docu-drama. however, this movie already bites off more than it can chew, cramming too many details in this overly ambitious project.<br /><br />it's no doubt that michael jackson has led perhaps the most interesting life so far of any musician, let alone modern day pop star, to date, and his story would probably take six behind the music specials to tell accurately. this movie tried to tell too much in three hours, and needless to say, it failed.<br /><br />flex alexander did what he could in playing jackson, but he came off more like an snl caricature by the likes of tim meadows and amy poehler. it would admittedly be pretty hard to find someone who accurately portrays jackson without meeting with the king of pop himself and studying his methods of madness. on a shoestring budget, though, one can only depend on what they see in the tabloids, and those do not necessarily give an accurate representation.<br /><br />furthermore, the director's efforts to make alexander look like jackson are completely foolish. the caucasian makeup on alexander's face makes him look more like a reverse minstrel show, and everyone who has been in a grocery store knows that jackson's nose is not as big as alexander's. it's also amazing to me that the film documents jackson going under the knife to get cosmetic surgery, yet in the next scene, alexander still has the same size nose. this kind of suspension of disbelief that the director expects can't hold up to tv viewers in the 21st century.<br /><br />it was even more distracting when footage of the real michael jackson (i.e. the time he hung his infant child over a balcony in germany) was interspersed into the movie in real time. it was a nice try, but it just didn't work.<br /><br />if this movie as it is was released into theaters, it would gain a profit only because of its tackiness. it even pales in comparison to "mommie dearest", and that's saying a lot. above all, this was a movie that was probably rushed into making, like many tv movies that aren't on hbo. it could have been done a lot better if it had just told of one aspect of jackson's life. even if it just covered the child molestation allegations, it probably would have been done a lot better and would have even been more intriguing.
