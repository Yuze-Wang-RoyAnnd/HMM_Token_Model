the only good thing that this movie created was that it made me hungry for ice cream, minus the dead body parts in it. the movie is one of the most cheesy i've seen in a long time. when the "ice cream king" dies in the beginning, i was laughing so hard because the kid took the ice cream from him and started eating it. his mom asked him to say something and should should have said "leave me alone and let me eat the free ice cream so i can watch my acting career go down the drain at a young age." that seems about right for a line. then i wondered why the ice cream prince was behind the bars of his ice cream truck. was someone going to rob him of his twenty cents? i've never seen bars on a ice cream truck window. it seemed pretty stupid. you might as well forget about the acting because it is just awful. forget about this movie and go down to dairy queen and get an ice cream.
