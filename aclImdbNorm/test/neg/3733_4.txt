it hasn't even been two years since i first saw this film, and yet, i can barely remember a thing about this movie. needless to say, i found it to be very forgettable. of what i do remember, nothing stands out as particularly good. a talented cast is wasted in what i suppose was meant to be a dark comedy, but if that is the case, it fails miserably. at best, this film is mildly interesting. at worst, the seemingly omnipresent overcast skies are more interesting than the storyline. if you like watching films where it always seems damp and cool, then i guess you may find something to like in this picture. just try to ignore what else is going on, because it is barely watchable.
