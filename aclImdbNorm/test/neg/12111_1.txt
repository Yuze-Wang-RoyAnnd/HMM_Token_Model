this thing, directed by french sensation patrick sebastien,is worst than all the turkeys that you may have seen. forget independence day, kazaam, the patriot, etc... you get the picture, this one's the pits. sebastien is a tv celebrity in france, (if you need an equivalent, let's say he's jerry springer with an i.q of 13), this is his first movie let's hope it's the last. i hope troma or someone would distribute this film in the states, so that you guys out there can excperience the french stench at it's worst. let's cut this short, this is the masterpiece of s**t.
