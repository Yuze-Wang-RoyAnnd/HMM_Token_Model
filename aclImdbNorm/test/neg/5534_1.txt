i was quite excited when i saw this film in competition at the montreal film festival. along with elephant and a few others, i thought the issue of american gun violence/culture would be treated intelligently and in a fashion compelling for film-goers. the press-release promised (in not so many words) a `red violin' for the gun-violence crowd, something to make us ponder our nra-shoot-em-up mindset in this country.<br /><br />after waiting until after 9:15 to be seated for a 9am screening (what technical difficulties they would have encountered is beyond me), we were finally let into the venue to see the film on dv (where did the advertised 35mm print go?). i think i just answered my first question.<br /><br />the result is an abhorrent mess. we get the "gun", in a vignette with the most unrealistic "biker' i have ever seen (and i do know more than a few). the film then lapses into irrelevant "character development" only because the characters are either a. stereotyped, b. losers, c. stereotyped losers, and/or d. racial caricatures. it takes another 30 minutes to get to the plot movement, and once we are there, we wish for the inane conversations between the couples and/or the bikers and pawn brokers.<br /><br />the film finds it's conclusion, but not without leaving any clich'e untried. i didn't care for the white-trash characters who came in contact with the gun, and the depiction of the minority characters should have the naacp crying foul immediately. all these people would chase after a gun, because they are at the bottom of the societal trash-heap, and would look for an opportunity wherever it was found. placing the action a level up would have at least provided some soul-searching on the part of the characters.<br /><br />the biggest problem is the promise unfulfilled. the plot outline was great. in the hands of a p.t. anderson or gus van zandt, it could have been a powerful piece. but due either to bad screenplay, direction or both, the thing is an unmitigated mess that needs to be ignored at all costs.<br /><br />my bigger question is who at the mff thought this was competition material. better bury this on showtime at 3am.<br /><br />art blose
