first of all, let me just say that after watching this movie i felt like i'd been sold a bill of goods. mind you it's not the movie's fault that imdb has it listen as a comedy first and a horror second (although i don't know how that's entered...maybe some moron from the film's crew put it in). being a fan of the horror/comedy genre, i checked it out based on that and i'm so, so sorry i did. where to start? first of all, to touch back on my beginning, there's no comedy in this movie. it tries once or twice, but never gets more than a chuckle at best. my reaction was primarily rolling my eyes and wondering why someone thought such tired material would be funny. also, there's no horror here. not a second of tension can be found. you think i'm exaggerating...i am not. no tension, very little blood, and not much violence on screen (sorry, but in a horror flick cutting away just as the good stuff starts is a major foul). hell...there's even zero nudity. call me a purist or juvenile...i prefer some in a horror flick if it can't come up with an original plot/premise. and that tired as all hell "reality tv show gone wrong thing"? it's been done before and a lot better. like wrong turn 2 or...ummm....whatever that movie was called with edward furlong. that's how bad this movie is. i don't even remember the name of that movie, but it was better than this. i also enjoyed the one comment claiming the timing for this was good because "reality tv is taking over". did someone from the past post that with a time machine? are you freaking kidding me? this thing is trash...and not in a fun way.
