i sort of liked this movie, not a good one, but not the worst ever made. though, everyone else says it is one o the worst movies ever created, i thought it was okay. there are a lot of immature jokes. it wants to be funny sometimes, but fails.<br /><br />the story is okay. it may be a little hard to follow for the younger audiences, though.<br /><br />the acting is pretty bad. jamie kennedy is a horrible actor at most times. at some times, it is even laughable. alan cumming is probably the best actor in here. he is funny when he is supposed to be, but some of his lines are god awful.<br /><br />oh, and the main bad thing about this movie that i hated was tim avery's voice when he is possessed by the mask. the voice is horrible. also, the scenes that he is in are so unfunny, that they are almost unbearable. i am sure they could have cut him out, and it wouldn't affect the movie at all.<br /><br />overall, you can live without seeing this. it is a nice movie to watch if you have nothing else to watch, though. they definitely could have gone without making the sequel, but it is a decent effort. 4/10
