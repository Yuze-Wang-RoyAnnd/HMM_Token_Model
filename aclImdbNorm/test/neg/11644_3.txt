jim brown stars and produces a tale set in the philippines just after the japanese invasion. the story has the japanese taking several navy men prisoner including some divers, who they use to retrieve the gold that macarthur had dumped into the manila bay.<br /><br />it's a messy movie aiming to make a statement about war and racism (the film uses edwin mccain's war in a not so subtle montage). the performances are just adequate at best. jim brown is okay, but he doesn't really show any sort of range in a performance that just has him standing there looking annoyed. the sets are serviceable but seem rather cheap. the film suffers from the outset due to a great deal of stock footage including many of the best known shots from the japanese attack in tora! tora! tora!. the use of such big budget sequence effectively makes the rest of the film look positively anemic; it also reminds one that there are better films out there one could be watching. for me the film seems to have half a real plot, the retrieval of the silver, and half a plot that is there just to fill time. none of it is particularly exciting even with the explosive finale.<br /><br />given the choice i'd take a pass.
