wow, what a cheesy movie this is! it starts off looking like it's gonna be a backwoods slasher, with the camera following dogs running through the woods. it then gets a bit boring and follows the story of some girls moving into some house haunted by indian spirits. we then get plenty of shots of one partially clad girl and another naked girl in the bath. it suddenly gets really cheesy when the "zombie indians" arise from the earth and start terrorising the girls. we even get a samurai indian. <br /><br />this movie starts off pretty boring although i did find the story of the four indians who buried themselves alive quite interesting. once the indian zombies (or whatever you want to call them for they aren't technically zombies) start terrorising the girls is when all the fun begins. this is not a special flick and can't be taken seriously, it's just something fun to watch when you're bored or when you're drinking with friends. i can't help thinking though that it would have worked better as a short story because the first half is tediously boring.
