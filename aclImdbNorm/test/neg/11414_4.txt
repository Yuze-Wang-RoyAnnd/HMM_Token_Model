i'm really surprised seeing all these positive reviews for this movie. don't get me wrong, it's not that i don't like 'these kind of movies'.<br /><br />while i very well can enjoy a good mindless hollywood action blockbuster like die hard 4.0, i like the 'dogma' kind of movies, or 'real-life-as-it-is'-movies just as much, if they are well made.<br /><br />a good example is festen (1998): no music, no dramatic camera angles, no special fx, no fancy locations. just a good story combined with excellent acting and the result is an excellent movie.<br /><br />is nine lives devoid of dramatic camera angles, special fx and fancy locations? yes. is it a good movie? i'm glad you asked. <br /><br />the answer is: absolutely not.<br /><br />first of all, everyone is raving about the acting performances. i'm terribly sorry, but you can act all you want, but if the story and the dialogue is not believable, the acting falls on its behind immediately. and that is exactly the case with nine lives.<br /><br />not once did i have the feeling while watching 'nine lives' that i was watching real people having a real conversation. i had the feeling i was watching actors trying to come across as 'real characters' while they were were saying things a 'real person' would never say under the circumstances.<br /><br />you can hardly call it a spoiler, but there are some dialogue excerpts below. if you think that reading ten lines of (ridiculous) dialogue will ruin your movie experience stop reading here. if you want a good laugh, continue reading.<br /><br />the dialogue was often so ridiculous that it was tragical. you want examples? plenty of those in 'nine lives'.<br /><br />example1:<br /><br />picture this. couple visits their filthy rich friends in their new mansion. woman sees this castle of a house and says to her husband:<br /><br />woman: i could get used to this (meaning the expensive house). man: don't. woman: why not? it could be. man: no. they are who they are and we are who we are. woman: i like the sound of that -- we are who we are.<br /><br />she likes the sound of that? her man is acting like a jerk, but she likes the sound of that. then an elderly couple walks past them holding hands. this is what the woman comes up with:<br /><br />woman: look! they are like children after school. they lived through so much. shared everything. i love you.<br /><br />they are like children after school? and then the most overused clich'e lines you ever heard? finishing with 'i love you'? she says this while her man is being a jerk to her? yes, very logical, very realistic, not. if anything, this kind of dialogue made me wanna strangle some of the characters in the movie for saying these horrible, horrible things.<br /><br />example 2:<br /><br />elderly mom, dad and younger daughter at a funeral. dad: i didn't realize andrew was religious. mom: it's for comfort. daughter: it's for strength. mom: life is fleeting. dad and daughter burst out laughing. <br /><br />yeah, this one-liner cracks me up any time, especially at a funeral! sorry, i must have missed the joke here.<br /><br />and it goes on and on and on....<br /><br />how about the camera work? don't even go there. 'boring' would be a compliment. it supposed to come across as 'realistic'; instead, you miss half of the actors facial expressions (the only thing left to watch in this movie), while half the time the camera is aimed at someone's back or side instead of the face.<br /><br />conclusion? well, don't say i didn't warn you! it's a good movie to rent if you want to make out with your date or something during the movie, because you won't even care whether the movie is playing or not after the first five minutes.<br /><br />overrated and more boring than watching grass grow kinda sums it up.
