i like 50s sci-fi movies a lot. i like the really good ones (such as the day the earth stood still, when worlds collide, invasion of the body snatchers, and many others) and sometimes the really bad ones because they can be really funny and great to watch with friends (such as plan 9 from outer space). however, when a sci-fi movie is bad but not bad enough to be fun, it really should be avoided. this movie is just such a film. the posters make it appear as some sort of sexy she-beast is attacking mankind, whereas the real plot is a lot less interesting. a woman is married to a womanizer. she is contaminated and begins to grow to a huge size and decides to track down this worm and kick his tail and that's about it. also, many of the special effects really stink--especially the gigantic papier mache hand that comes into the room to grab the wicked hubby.
