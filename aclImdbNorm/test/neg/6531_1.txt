i walked out of this movie and i did this only one time before with the australian movie sweetie close to 20 years ago. after about three minutes i felt like killing the camera man and just couldn't believe that this film actually showed anywhere and- guess what - was nominated for two independent spirit awards. what???? regardsless how realistic the dialog might be (i will never use the word "dude" again!) -who wants to listen to these conversations? i don't go to the movies to be annoyed but that's all i got. the only good thing i came away with was the realization that if this movie can make it to sundance and other festivals, anybody can. well, wait, that might not be a good thing after all...
