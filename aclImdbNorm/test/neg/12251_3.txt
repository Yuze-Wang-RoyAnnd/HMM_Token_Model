your idol will deceive you in this movie. stephen nichols is mis-cast as a young german student still bending under his father's orders although the actor obviously looks near 40 years-old. this makes his relationship (a collection of copulation scenes, basically) to a very young looking girl all the more disturbing. the character's have no dimension and the war depiction serves only as a backdrop for this soft porn wannabe. nichols, who is one of daytime tv's best performers shows no passion in what is to be the main interest of this movie: watching him have sex over and over with this girl. it's like watching two animals going at it. if you're a fan of this actor's talent in other projects, don't rent this for you will never view him in the same way. if, on the other hand, you want to see stephen nichols have an orgasm in front of the camera, you might like it: stephen will show you his naked butt, lots of tongue work, his groaning range, but not his talent as this character who's obviously just as sex-driven and misjudging as he was for wanting to do such personal things in front of the camera. he may have found it kinky but i didn't - a big deception!
