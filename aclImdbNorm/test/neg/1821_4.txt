alan rickman & emma thompson give good performances with southern/new orleans accents in this detective flick. it's worth seeing for their scenes- and rickman's scene with hal holbrook. these three actors mannage to entertain us no matter what the movie, it seems. the plot for the movie shows potential, but one gets the impression in watching the film that it was not pulled off as well as it could have been. the fact that it is cluttered by a rather uninteresting subplot and mostly uninteresting kidnappers really muddles things. the movie is worth a view- if for nothing more than entertaining performances by rickman, thompson, and holbrook.
