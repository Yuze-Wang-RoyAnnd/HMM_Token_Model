one of my co-workers recommended this one, implying that it was one of the most frightening movies she ever watched. i checked it out together with my girlfriend and we gave up after 50 minutes or so.<br /><br />yesterday, i had a long talk with my co-worker (we're still friends!).<br /><br />this movie is as original as the latest film starring steven seagal. it brings absolutely nothing original to the table. the spooky parts have been done thousand of times before.<br /><br />the biggest fault however is the painfully slow pace of this movie. the periods between the scares are completely wasted with meaningless dialog and a lot of.. nothing..<br /><br />1 of 10 molotov cocktails
