and so it started with "shreik" a send up of horror films, then we had scary movie, a genuinely good attempt at a new kind of genre, the illustrious send up. however....now we have: scary movie* scary movie 2 scary movie 3 scary movie 4* date movie meet the spartans not another team movie* plus many more (genuinely funny movies marked with *)<br /><br />and.....super hero movie.... it seems the people that make these movies cannot yet grasp what makes the send-ups funny. using the rip-offs from other movies in a funny way is all well and good if done properly, but not many producers seem to know how to do that. scary movie(1) did it well, the following sequels were then horrendous as the tried to over play the franchise, but it was redeemed by scary movie 4. not another teen movie was good because it used the spoofs well...and to its credit i am sick of teen movies. however, this movie plays like a bad version of all of these. it relies on slap stick the would make even the 3 stooges cringe, violating the image of stephen hawking, and then when people begin to get bored (and the producers knew when this would be) we are treated to pamela anderson in a skin tight suit. to conclude, spoofs should be about making a homage-like mock-up of an original movie with an original storyline, not plastering random take offs of legitimate film onto the storyline of a real film. <br /><br />...i shudder at the thought of "sci-fi movie" and get my seppuku knife ready
