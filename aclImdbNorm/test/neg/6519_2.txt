this film attempts to cash in on the success of richard curtis movies, particularly "love actually" (which i loved) - a series of disparate scenes following the love lives of various couples. <br /><br />it's a great idea poorly executed. the script tries to be a little too clever and simply doesn't resonate. most of the acting is stilted which is more a reflection on the director than the actors.<br /><br />the version i saw (on a plane) was called "scenes from a park", which is a more appropriate title as not all the scenes were of a 'sexual nature'.<br /><br />i was so looking forward to this movie, but ultimately it is disappointing. don't bother.
