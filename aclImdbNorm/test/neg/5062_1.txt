this is a really obnoxious show. it is in fact an example of how low television has fallen since 'reality' got in style. tanya is pretty but she is also extremely rude and has awful taste. is a house show the place for sex appeal? apparently some males like the show because they find tanya attractive. the other boss is not pretty but he's fully as rude and also has awful taste. it is unfortunate that so many houses have to be shown while someone is still living in them. most of the people who are allegedly viewing these houses before changes are made should be moving into brand new houses or completely empty ones so they will not be insulting anyone. most of them ..like the 'crew'..need to be taught manners. i can imagine how awful the british show is since the british reality shows tend to be even worse when it comes to manners and taste.<br /><br />what happened to the arts and entertainment channel? when it started out (and for some years afterward) it was filled with treats. now it's one big trash machine.
