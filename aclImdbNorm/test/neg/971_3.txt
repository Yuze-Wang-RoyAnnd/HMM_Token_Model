minor plot spoilers ahead!!!<br /><br />how did such talented actors get involved in such mindless retreaded<br /><br />drivel? robert deniro plays a dumb hollywood version of the standard<br /><br />violence prone tough cop (i.e., he beats up the bad guys and rolls his<br /><br />eyes at cops who prefer to stick by the book), and eddie murphy plays a<br /><br />not so tough cop who would rather be an actor (i.e., he screams out,<br /><br />"freeze, police!" and has his "tough look" down pat). naturally, they<br /><br />are partnered when bobby's loose cannon tactics get him in hot water<br /><br />with the media and he is essentially blackmailed into starring in a<br /><br />"cops"-like reality show. take a breath, cuz that's as funny as it<br /><br />gets.<br /><br />no energy was put into the script - it feels like a pale retread of<br /><br />every copy buddy movie tossed into a blender with "15 minutes" starring,<br /><br />yes, deniro himself as, pretty much the character he is playing here. <br /><br />the jokes fall flat, the action feels listless, and no one seems to be<br /><br />having a good time. it's dead on the screen.<br /><br />please don't waste your time. even if you have an overwheming affinity<br /><br />for one of the actors - avoid it and do them a favor. becauze if this<br /><br />makes money, these kinda of scripts will be deeemed perfectly acceptable<br /><br />for actors of their quality.<br /><br />and to mr. deniro. you used to make serious films. i remember them -<br /><br />they were good. you were nominated for awards for them - remember how<br /><br />much fun that was? now after "analyze this" (which was good), "meet the<br /><br />parents" (which was also good), and "the adventures of rocky and<br /><br />bullwinkle" (which was not good), i think we need to see you parodying<br /><br />yourself less, and being yourself more. "casino" feels like a long time<br /><br />ago. and no, i don't count "15 minutes" as serious bobby. anyone who<br /><br />took that media satire seriously must get their weekly world news
