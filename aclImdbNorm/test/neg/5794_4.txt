even disney are guilty of the cash cow disease, after the roaring success of the love bug in 1968, the house of mouse cashed in with herbie rides again, herbie goes to monte carlo, and herbie goes bananas. neither sequel capturing the charm and inoffensive appeal of the love bug back in 68, in this one we find race driver jim douglas and his sidekick wheely applegate, entering herbie in the monte carlo rally. naturally things outside of the race start to take over priorities, they get mixed up in a diamond robbery and herbie falls in love with another car!. the car stunts are of course pleasant and easy on the eye, and it would be churlish of me to really vent venom on such a friendly piece of fluff, it's just that the film goes nowhere fast and personally now i can see it for the coin motivated piece of work it is. still you get to see herbie take a bath, foil the baddies and of course dance for the lady in his life, so something there for everyone i think....................4/10.
