this 'schlock-buster' should carry a government health warning. if you play it in your dvd machine, you are in serious risk of opening a rift in the space-time continuum and disappearing without trace into it - so bad is this 'movie'.<br /><br />the fact that this movie was so successful is evidence of the true desperate state of modern hollywood cinema, and the continual commissioning of films that appeal to the 'lowest common denominator' - although i truly dread to think of the 'lowest common denominators' that this film actually appeals to!!<br /><br />i think hollywood were just conducting some kind of proving trials when they made and screened this film! i can imagine the executive boardroom meetings at the studio ... "just how bad a film can we actually get away with making - and still make loads of money!??! holy cow, i didn't realise we could go that bad!! woooo hooooo!!"<br /><br />the only films worse than this that i can think of (and trust me it is close) are die another day (rip the bond franchise as i knew it) and independence day!<br /><br />avoid - avoid - avoid!!!!
