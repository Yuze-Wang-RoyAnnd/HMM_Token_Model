pretty lousy made-for-tv sequel to the roman polanski classic. rosemary's son adrian has grown up and is embodied by creepy stephen mchattie. after eliminating rosemary (here played by patty duke) a coven of witches, again led by minnie & roman castevets, preps satan's son for world domination. it's not really scary and light years less macabre than its predecessor. instead, writer anthony wilson and director sam o'steen opt for a satan-worshiping thriller full of a lot of chanting, plenty of candles, and ruth gordon trying to act daffy and nasty at the same time. gordon's the sole holdover from the original. george maharis replaces john cassavetes as guy and a very hammy ray milland plays roman castevets, subbing for the late sidney blackmer. newcomer mchattie is the film's only real saving grace. he's very off-kilter and looks really sinister without even doing anything. the music by charles bernstein is suitably creepy, but so over-used, it's ends up being intrusive rather than effective. o'steen, who edited the earlier polanski masterpiece, shows no flair or subtlety whatsoever.
