my caddy limo was destroyed!!! well, i had one just like it - drove the hoi polloi and many of the chosen ones around manhattan for a few years. <br /><br />that was a whole lot more entertaining than this movie i can tell you. lordy, what a bomb - as in rpg go boom. i also drove a lot more stars in my white caddy than appeared in this dud of a flick. <br /><br />robert patrick is a very serious actor and did a credible job with the nonsense he had to work with. unfortunately, rutger hauer played his part like a red-nosed circus clown. if he couldn't take it serious why should his audience? the director should have kicked his butt off the set in the first hour of filming.<br /><br />the dialog was written by 10 yr old's for 8 yrs old's. surprised there wasn't a whole lot more cracking up on the sets. oh well, i am a movie fanatic - ergo - you must take the bad to get to the good.
