in a future where an industrious travel agency uses time travel technology to send wealthy clients back in time for explorations to the age of dinosaurs, the future is inexplicably changed when one of their clients breaks the cardinal rule not to stray off the path. in an attempt to fix the damage done, a seasoned time scout (edward burns) teams with the inventor of the technology (catherine mccormack).<br /><br />the premise is pretty good and engaging. it may have a few flaws in it but it could still make for an interesting movie. unfortunately, a sound of thunder fails to really hook the audience in. it suffers from a number of problems and it takes itself way too seriously so it's hard to actually have any fun while watching the movie. personally, i thought the script was the film's biggest problem. the were more plot holes than expected and the movie was kind of lazy in explaining things. i was hoping for a more in depth look into "the butterfly effect" but the film was more escapist fun than anything else. that's okay with me since 90 minutes of mindless fun is still a nice way to spend an evening. however, all the fun this film offered was unintentional and lame. there were a few scenes that kept me entertained but i was pretty bored.<br /><br />the acting isn't much better since most of them seem more interested in a paycheck than anything else. the only person that gave a good performance was ben kingsley. he kept the first half of the film enjoyable and he seemed to be having the most fun as well. edwards burns was pretty pale and bland. i don't think he has what it takes to be a leading man. however, he could make for a decent supporting actor. catherine mccormack was just really annoying and not very believable. i haven't really seen her in anything else but she could have potential. the rest of the actors also give bad performances though most of them are relatively unknown so it shouldn't effect their careers too much.<br /><br />looking at the message boards, most people are complaining about the special effects. there's no way to sugarcoat them and they are terrible. all the dinosaurs look really bad. the gibbon-lizards (part monkey, part dino), while a creative idea, become stale after awhile and they are most likely to encourage laughter rather than fear. the green screen work just looks awful and unprofessional. i was really wondering what director peter hyams was trying to accomplish here. he fails to deliver the suspense, action and thrills and makes this movie a long sit. for the most part though, the film is pretty harmless and it's far from the worst movie of 2005. hopefully they will remake this film in the future. there is potential in this project but for now this is the best we got. in the end, unless curiosity gets the better of you, there is no reason to see a sound of thunder. rating 4/10
