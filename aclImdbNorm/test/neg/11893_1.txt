can you people please stop believing everything this man says. get<br /><br />your facts straight before you start praising this liar. he's not even<br /><br />from flint. he just says that to keep his "blue collar" look. he's <br /><br />from a rich suburb next to flint. i mean he went to a private school.<br /><br />his parents paid for him to go to school. wow, that sure does seem<br /><br />like they suffered a lot from flint going to the dumps. he was also born in canada. oh wait, that makes him a canadian citizen. i wish he would just move there. instead he lives here in his 1 million dollar new york apartment. thats working class right there. i sure can't wait for his dvd set to come out. i want to here him talking about how big corporations are bad. where will i get those dvds? oh yeah, at target and wal-mart. the two biggest corporations in america, which were also the only two stores allowed to sell them.
