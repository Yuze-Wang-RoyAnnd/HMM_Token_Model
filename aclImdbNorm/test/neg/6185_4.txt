does anyone remember braveheart ? it starred mel gibson who also directed and was scripted by randall wallace . the film contains over 200 errors . does anyone remember the green berets ? that`s the john wayne western where the duke saves a homestead called vietnam from a bunch of injuns from the commie tribe . if you watch we were soldiers you can`t help but be reminded of these two films .<br /><br />first of all what`s with that scottish lament that`s played three times in the movie , four if you count the end credits ? i mean what`s the connection between scotland and `nam ? maybe wallace is using it in the vain hope that because braveheart was bombarded - undeservedly i might add - with several oscars then so might this film ? whatever reason it`s included it really jars . gibson plays hal moore as a cross between william wallace and john wayne and i was expecting him to say something like " they`ll never take our freedom - the hell they will " and it`s impossible not to notice other similarities with the green berets like the subplot of a journalist picking up a gun and turning into a warrior and moore telling the journalist about guilt in a scene almost identical to the one seen in the wayne movie<br /><br />when not reminding the audience of other movies wws also fails to stand on its own legs , it`s based on real events in 1965 but seems to lack an integrity needed to do the story justice , it never feels like 1965 and lacks a sense of time and place probably because it was filmed in america not asia . hal moore might have brushed up on the french experience in indo-china but if that`s the case then he was unique because the american military went out of their way not to read up on the french indo-china war , indeed when asked about the previous conflict westmoreland replied he had nothing to learn from the french " who haven`t won a war since the days of napoleon " so i was confused as to the portrayal of the nva in this movie , when in 1965 the american high command , brimming with hubris held the north vietnamese and vc in contempt . it`s like history has been rewritten in order to show the rice farmers of vietnam are superlative warriors . they are , but very few americans believed this in the mid 1960s<br /><br />there`s a couple of other things that confused me like how the wives back home get telegrams telling them their husbands are dead ? no bodies are shown being flown back to base and no one on screen is seen referring to who`s been killed in the la drang valley . likewise we`re not seen reinforcements arrive on screen so how do we suddenly see the americans out number the nva ? i put these down as directorial/ editing blunders on the part of wallace who doesn`t strike me as much of a director , and his biggest problem seems to be communicating the horror of the battle . take the scene where the american burned to a crisp is flown away screaming " tell my wife i love her " . this should have an emotional impact similar to that death scene in platoon but here there`s no impact . in fact i found the scene cliched and patronising , and he`s not the only character to mouth the words " tell my wife ... " while mutilated or dying , i counted at least two other characters use the phrase . did characters actually say this at the battle ? i`ve no idea but since randall wallace wrote the script i do have reservations<br /><br />i sat in shocked awe watching apocalypse now , platoon and the killing fields made my eyes water , i laughed at full metal jacket , i kept looking at my watch with the deer hunter , and after seeing we were soldiers i felt totally patronised
