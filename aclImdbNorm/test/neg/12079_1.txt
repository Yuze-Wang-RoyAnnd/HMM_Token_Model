it's just when a band tours, and only has one original member. it's not the same as the classic line up. all new actors playing the main roles of rag, scotty, etc, with ashby as virtually the only returning face from the first movie. and he was of only minor note of the first flick, serving as the only redeemable group of the three guys that scotty was trying to assist in meeting females. the film is poorly written, featuring the dumbest dialog this side of armageddon. even for a t&a movie, this one is a turkey. not even die hard low budget 80's films fans would want to sit through this movie, which has no plot, and plenty of bad acting. this film would have been better off never being released. just plain bad.
