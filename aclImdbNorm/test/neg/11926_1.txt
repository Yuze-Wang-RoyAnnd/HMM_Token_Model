right up (or down) there with toys and jurassic park 2 and the phantom menace.<br /><br />the premise sounded cool, some of the commercials looked semi-promising, but alas, the entire movie had about 30 seconds of neat shot-ness, and that was shown on the small screen's 30 second slot.<br /><br />if you want amateur writing, second-rate effects, ridiculous costumes, and an all-around snoozefest by all means watch it. the plot is recycled sci-fi fodder. too bad too, because coming in i thought it would be bad but held out hope. it may be the worst movie i have ever seen, and i have seen a lot. <br /><br />bottom line - don't watch it.<br /><br />unless of course you -liked- any of the above 3 movies.
