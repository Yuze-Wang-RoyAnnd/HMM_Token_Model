the seven collaborations between director joseph "von" sternberg and star marlene dietrich were so distinct in look and tone, and so different from anything else going on at the time, they almost seem to constitute a sub-genre of their own. like any genre, they have their outright masterpieces, as well as their absolute turkeys. time to send blonde venus back to the farm.<br /><br />after the seedily seductive hits the blue angel, morocco and shanghai express, in which miss dietrich established her screen image as cabaret-singer-cum-prostitute, someone at paramount decided it was time for marlene to play a mother. there is nothing wrong with that in itself; as an actress she was up to the part. it's just that nothing else about the format has changed. it's like the blue angel plus a kid. fair enough, the story of a woman who drags her child along on her sleazy escapades is a sound premise for a tragic drama, but that's not the way this is played. dietrich's journey is played as some kind of adventure, using her wits and accomplices to stay ahead of the law. this is not some cheeky example of pre-code libertarianism
