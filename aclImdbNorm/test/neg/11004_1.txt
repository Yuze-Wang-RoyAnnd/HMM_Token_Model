yes, it's a sbif (so bad it's funny) classic. with a budget running into the tens of dollars, some of the most abysmal acting you have ever seen, and absolutely no even remotely frightening moments - not even a nanosecond! camera work was at the elementary school level - one still shot outside a house was obviously hand-held and jiggled crazily. blood looked like watered-down cherry koolaid, someone made a trip to the local butcher shop for the "human" bones, and miss witch had the cheapest mask wal-mart could provide.<br /><br />did anyone involved look at the final cut and realize what a mess this was? most of the names in the credits have to be pseudonyms, it would be career suicide to have this on your resume. do yourself a favor and watch ebert's video of his colonoscopy instead!
