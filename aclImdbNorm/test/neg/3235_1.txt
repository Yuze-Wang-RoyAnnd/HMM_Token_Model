i still find it hard to believe that a fine - if overlong - novel by dean koontz was transformed into this utter excrement.<br /><br />this movie is so bad it's disgusting. boos to all who participated. shame on you!<br /><br />p.s. the fact that sequels have appeared just goes to show how little taste and discretion remains in silver screen land.
