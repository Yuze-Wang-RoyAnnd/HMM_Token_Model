normally i wouldn't go to the trouble of commenting on a horror movie sequel, because it's usually assumed that they're bad, and if you watch them with a healthy disrespect, they can be very fun and enjoyable to taunt/laugh at. however, this chapter of the ongoing halloween saga came close to gumbing up everything the original stood for. in the very first movie, dr. loomis said (very pointedly i might add), that michael myers was evil, and this tries to explain why (doing a bad job of it i might add). in my opinion, he was much scarier when he was just a blood hungry freak. the whole goth/cult thing was unnecessary and a desperate attempt to throw a new curve into the halloween equation. the result was a boring, predictable movie that was not scary and not bad enough to be funny.
