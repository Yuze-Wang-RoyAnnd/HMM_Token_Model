there is nothing original,humane or insightful in this film. the acting is average, images are amateurish, the writing lacks subtlety and the scenes are very basic...something close to a soap.<br /><br />in 2:37,a suicide is used to turn the film into a suspense drama. we watch, partly, because we want to know who dies. the various characters each have a problem, and the film shows how bad each problem is for them, but only as a way to get them each to a place where you think they might kill themselves. despite the different points of view offered by the camera on the key events, there is never another way of seeing the events themselves. so in 2:37, the arseholes are arseholes, the angels are angels. this is simple stuff.<br /><br />without this complexity, the film emerges as a voyeuristic tale of youth sex and violence. you hardly get to know the kids as much as the breasts, bodies and limps that the filmmaker passes off as characterisation.<br /><br />in the end, if you know anything about film in the last 5 years, 2:37 is just an immature rip off of elephant - not a meditation, not a progression. yet while the filmmaker and distributor use the alleged suicide of a friend at every chance to give the film some legitimacy, they never talk about gus van sant or elephant. the positive posts on imdb curiously avoid any mention of this, or simply don't value originality. if you do want something with heart and voice - avoid this piece of youth exploitation. i was surprised by the filmmakers age when i found out after seeing this film - i had assumed a 13 year old had made it. the twenty somethings i've always known are too busy trying to express something real in them to lift the work of an old man.
