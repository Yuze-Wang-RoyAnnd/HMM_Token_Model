i haven't laughed so much in a theater in years. the only problem is that it was not the intent of the movie to make my throat raw from laughter.<br /><br />this movie is absolutely overflowing with bad cgi, absolutely terrible duologue, absolutely terrible *acting*, and enough geek references to make the whole thing come off as nothing but complete cheese.<br /><br />as a gamer and a geek-type girl myself, i did recognize all of the obvious game references in this movie as well as the geek stuff that was just thrown into the background as eye candy (the steamboy poster, the t-shirts from thinkgeek.com and j-list.com), and that didn't redeem the movie at all.<br /><br />the only thing that might have been good at all were the ghost children type characters that were purposefully badly done in cgi to make it look like they were from a game, and who were obviously stolen from japanese horror movies.<br /><br />to be honest, it was hilariously bad, and something i'd expect from a midnight showing of a made-for-tv b grade sci-fi channel movie. don't expect more than that and you'll have a great time. just don't get a soda or you'll spit it everywhere when you get great lines like: "why did you bring that game into our lives?! why?!"
