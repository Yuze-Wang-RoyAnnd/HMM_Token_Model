what an atomic bomb of a movie. the story goes nowhere and comes fron nowhere. it leaves the theatre goer with ones arm up saying "is this it". what happened to redford. he was once a fair actor. now he thinks that he can show up on the set and make a few scenes and it's a take. wrong. what an unemotional film. i don't mean to be so so cruel, but what crap of a movie. unbelievable amateur crap. if i was in this movie i would be so embarased that i would not show my face. i tell you what, if i was associated with this movie, i am in big trouble. this movie will go down in the annals of movie making as the king of bombs with which all others will be compared to.
