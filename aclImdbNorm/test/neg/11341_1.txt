racing enthusiast fabian (as tommy callahan) smokes, drinks, and suffers blackouts while juggling feelings for alluring brunette annette funicello (as francie madsen) and blonde mainstay diane mcbain (as annie blaine). complicating matters are ms. funicello's boozy race car boyfriend warren berlinger (as eddie sands), and her father jan murray (as pete madsen), who encourages the reckless drivers. funicello's cow-eyed performance is sometimes enjoyable; however, her drunken driving scene is unnerving. "thunder alley" provides marginally more nascar excitement than its predecessor, "fireball 500" (1966) *; be warned, it isn't much. a wild party scene, featuring some mild strip tease, is the film's low highlight.
