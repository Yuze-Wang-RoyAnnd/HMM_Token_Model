any horror film that casts robert englund (freddie kruger!) then kills him in the opening 5 minutes before the opening credits have even run should be instantly viewed with nothing but suspicion.<br /><br />tony todd (candyman!) as a swamp tour guide (his james earl jones voice impression is hysterical by the way, i don't know or care if he was trying to be funny but i was laughing at it). sadly his role was all of 5 minutes long as well. more reasons for suspicion and quite rightly so.<br /><br />mercedes mcnab (aka harmony from buffy & angel, i had to look her up to see what i remembered her from but she gets semi-naked!), marcus the token black guy (not another teen movie) is filling a comedy role that really isn't required in a horror movie unless it's intended as a spoof.<br /><br />joel murray (bill murray's brother & pete from dharma & greg) plays shapiro, the guy shooting the gonzo video with the 2 cute girls. as they take a "spooky swap ghost tour" the 2 lead male characters meet up with some other folks and get run aground on rocks and have to leave the boat. so their now all isolated in the swamp at night in the rain.<br /><br />once the real story of victor crowley has been told (his make-up looked like sloth from the goonies) we have established he is dead (well you aren't coming back from being hit in the skull by an axe!) once the old guy is attacked, despite pulling her gun and having a very clear shot it takes marybeth more than 30 seconds to actually start firing at a guy who is hacking an old man apart with a hatchet. is she stupid? thats 29 second too long! in terms of plot there really isn't one (i don't class undead psycho as a plot, sorry) and the pacing is really bad as well. you have a killing, some running away, some light relief then some slow dialogue before beginning the cycle again.<br /><br />after an extremely long scene investigating a wobbly bush with a raccoon in it victor appears again (with some sort of power tool) and kills the dark haired porno girl, he also manages to slice the tour guide in half with a shovel? once misty is left on her own to keep lookout for ben i felt it was pretty obvious she was going to be the next to die (i was right but you don't get to see it).<br /><br />film makers? rain will not extinguish burning gasoline, ok? idiots! obviously after the 2 near misses in the cemetery marcus was next to die and ben was hurt in the foot with the spike but they managed to find a boat after impaling victor on the spike.<br /><br />she's pulled into the water by something unseen, he's trying to save her then she's suddenly pulled into the boat by victor and is screaming and the movie abruptly ends.<br /><br />yeah, just like that. no clue if ben was dead (he seemed to be missing an arm) and no clue if marybeth was going to survive and what happened with victor.<br /><br />it's an awful ending and no doubt my verbal attack at the film makers got the last review deleted. so much for free speech, eh?
