this is one of the worst movie i have ever seen. it's a thriller with a rather ridiculous ending. i watched this movie hoping for the best and instead found something truly bad. the movie starred two actors that i like very much, rebecca demornay and antonio banderas. sure they had decent chemistry together but for what? the movie's premise was bad to begin with and the execution just made it even worst.<br /><br />miss demornay plays sarah taylor, a psychologist trying to analyze a convicted serial killer whose defense hinge on multiple personality disorder. that pretty much will give you a hint to where the movie is going and the identity of the killer. early in the movie she gets an unexpected visit from her father. this being made in the 1990's when the bad daddy was the in thing in hollywood is another clue to the ultimate conclusion.<br /><br />mr. banderas plays a mystery man named tony ramirez, who comes into sarah's life. the whole first meeting and first encounter between tony and sarah is so badly done and so unconvincing it makes you wonder how it even got shot. and there's a sequence where the two of them are supposed to be knowing each other that is so sappy it doesn't seem to belong here. one thing that i would admit was that there was a sex scene that's very hot. anyway creepy things start to happen after he arrives, weird packages arriving, things falling off the wall that could kill sarah, incident that say things aren't normal anymore. <br /><br />overall the movie was badly conceived, the editing at times seem jumpy, and the conclusion was laughable. another thing that bugged me about this movie was the whole orchestral music playing in the background. a more subtle musical score would have been better. i have to say this, no matter how bad the ending was, miss demornay was very good in that sequence. it's sad that she never got first rate materials in her career. she's that rare combination of talent and beauty.
