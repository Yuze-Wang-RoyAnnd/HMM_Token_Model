back in 1994 the power rangers had become a huge franchise and t.v. executives at the usa network were hoping to get in on the action and came up with the tattooed teenage alien fighters from beverly hills, in which the evil emporer gorganus, who looks like he's wearing a home made darth vader costume, and his talking bird, that looks like a rubber dog chew toy, come to earth to invade it using giant monsters that look like rejects from a 1970's godzilla film. fortunately nimbar an alien that looks like a giant piece of clear jello recruits four teenagers to defend the earth, nimbar gives them each a tattoo of a different star constellation that allows them to transform into buffed up superheros who look like dancers from an eighties tech no music video, they could also combined into a giant knight. forty episodes were made. the usa network clearly did not have the money to try to adapt a show from japan like power rangers did, and made up this show on their own using the budget of a 1950's scifi film. the fights scenes are generic, the special effects are poor, and some of the sets look like they could fall down. the actors pretty much realized how ridiculous the show was and pretty much ham it up and overact. i can only imagine their shock when the show was cancel led.
