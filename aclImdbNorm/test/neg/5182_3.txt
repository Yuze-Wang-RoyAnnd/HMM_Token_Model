after a while i realized it was just my iq slowly dropping. frostbite is one of those pathetic movies where no one, and i mean no one, is even trying. i rooted for the dorky hero to die inside that trashcan (how did he even manage to fit in there, anyway?), traci lords, the queen of b movies, was horribly unfunny and ripped me and my friends off by not showing her boobs a single time.<br /><br />the "characters", though i use that term loosely, are people so exaggerated and one-dimensional they might as well have used cardboard cutouts. the "jokes" (i use this term loosely as well) are simply hilarious. a guy's fart causes an earthquake. roflcopter! our "hero" gets a butt acupuncture by traci lords. oh god, i can't breathe! the blind guy uses the f word repeatedly! this is too much!!! <br /><br />say what you want about the acting but i thought adam grimes did a pretty good job at playing a mentally challenged snowboarder. apart from that the sole source of entertainment value here is boobs. i think i counted three, maybe four pairs throughout the entire film, scattered over maybe five minutes of screen time. that's five minutes worth watching out of 83 minutes of unfunny trash. don't watch this. watch barb wire with pamela anderson - at least there was plenty of nudity and action in that trashy flick!(r#26)
