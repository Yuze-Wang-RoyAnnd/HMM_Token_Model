i am a big md fan. but, i call it like i see it. this film limped along. the plot was preposterous. gaining access to heads of state in this movie is easier than gaining access to the the local grocery store. come on! tone loc has the emotion of a wooden plank. loosen up! the editing is choppy. the actors, and i use the term loosely, sound as if they are reading their lines on valium.<br /><br />this movie could have been better. dudikoff has potential, but he chooses scripts that just scream,"stinker".<br /><br />if you want to watch a good dudikoff movie, may i suggest crash dive or avenging force. if you have never seen one of his films, this is not the one to introduce you to his work. you will walk away with a bad taste in your mouth and think all of his projects are this bad.
