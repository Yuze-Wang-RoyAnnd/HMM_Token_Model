ok, where to start. i can't believe how many good reviews i read on here. i watched this (year 2004) and i had to fight to not push the stop button, i decided to continue just because of all the good reviews i read. after watching it i felt it was my duty to let the world know about this. first of all the movie seems like it is never going to begin, the plotline doesn't actually occur until about 30 minutes before the movie ends, leaving the viewer wondering, `when is this going to start' so don't ever call this a `revenge movie' because the revenge doesn't even start until over half the movie is already gone by. furthermore, the movie tries to make you believe this is a post-apocalyptic australia. i am sorry if showing dusty rural roads half the movie and a crooked letter on a sign didn't quite convince me of that, even for 1979 this was not science fiction. so anyways, add this on top of randomly placed homoerotic subtext and you have got yourself one crappy movie (i have nothing against gays, there was just no need for it). the only good part was the first chase scene, good directing considering it was 1979, and another good part is how he kills the last guy. so basically i recommend you watch the first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes and you will enjoy yourself much more than if you sat through all that stuff in the middle, which may lead you to gouge your own eyes out. don't say i didn't warn you.
