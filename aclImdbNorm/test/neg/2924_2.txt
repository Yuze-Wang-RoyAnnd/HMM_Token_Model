the most remarkable thing about "talk radio" is how bad it is. the callers' voices all have a phony, reading-from-a-script ring to them. an evening with an annoying loudmouth at a dallas radio station is told with the portentousness of a sartrean glimpse into hell. stone tries for an existential revelation and gets unintended comedy instead. whenever a caller makes a "profound" (empty) point about something, stone shoves the camera at one of his character's face as they are stricken with some traumatic realization that is never revealed to the audience. bogosian overacts throughout in one of the most irritating performances ever smeared onto celluloid. underrated classic? give me a break.
