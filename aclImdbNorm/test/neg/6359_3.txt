sadly, this movie is not very good. but does it really matter ? we all know the basics for the story, and this has nothing new. but i love low budget horror & sci fic camp classics ... so i forgive this one. about thew only thing that anyone remember from this movie, is that little leonardo dicaprio made his debut in it.<br /><br />he did ok. the part didn't ask for great acting skills, and the direction probably never gave him any chance of providing one anyway ... little leonardo dicaprio was very cute ... and so was the girl. the movie is fun, if you like horror & sci fic camp classics and are experienced in watching them.
