another try, another miss. france may be doomed for not being able to produce a good horror movie. i mean... the least they could do was to shoot the movie in the forest of broc'eliande, but even the forest is fake ! it was shot near paris ! the subject is useless, the actors are really insignificant and the text makes you wish you were deaf. nothing could save it.<br /><br />bad... to the bone. i wasn't warned. i want my money back.
