this movie was so bad and so cheap and so corny, i found this movie to be one of the most boring slow paced early 80's movies that i have ever seen. i like most 80's cheap horror movies but i would never rent this one again. it just did not make any sense. a family that lives in the woods invites their son, his wife and their daughter to spend time with them for the holidays and during the movie for some reason the mother and daughter- in- law do not get along well. we never figure out why until almost till the end of the movie but until then, all we see is the fact that the mother has some form of esp and the daughter- in- law is having nightmares and flashbacks of a catastrophe of what will happen to unfortunate victims to this "thing" that we have no clue as to what "it" looks like, all we see is a bright light signaling his approach and all we hear is a cheap interpretation of darth vadar voices and a soundtrack stolen from various horror movies. then when we finally find out what and who it is all i did was laugh. this "killer" turns out to be some kind of alien japanese warrior from ww2 who has apparently come back to life to claim the mother and her family. and all the mother does is stand there in front of the living room shaking with her hands on fire or something like she's going into some kind of convulsion. this movie is pathetic! avoid it, it's not even worth renting.
