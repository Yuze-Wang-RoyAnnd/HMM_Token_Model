even if i had not read anne rice's "queen of the damned" from the "vampire chronicles," i probably would still have thought this movie was just awful.<br /><br />it was tasteless, plot-less, it made absolutely no sense at all. i sat for a while pondering the plot disassociated from the book, and the longer i thought of it, the worse it was. to associate it in any way with the prior chronicles film is ridiculous as it is ridiculously inconsistent with that movie, let alone the book. the bare few ideas taken from rice's genius in "the vampire chronicles" were butchered and ridiculed.<br /><br />it is an absolute insult to anne rice fans everywhere and such a pathetic excuse for a legacy in being aaliyah's last film. truly, it's an insult to aaliyah fans as well.<br /><br />possibly the only compliment can be paid to the sound effects as well as some of the graphics. good as they may be, it is still not at all enough to make me regret the time spent watching this movie. as a matter of fact, i signed up for this membership for the sole reason of communicating to people bothering to look at this film (7 years after the release, as it may be) to not waste their time or expect much beyond disappointment.
