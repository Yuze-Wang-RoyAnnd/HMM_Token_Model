why are there no good reviews? because this film is hysterically bad.<br /><br />set in a japanese prison camp in world war ii, we have jim brown as the hero who puts up with a hysterically unbelievable racist officer, and just as hysterical is the way the japanese officers brown nose jim brown's character.<br /><br />this is probably the worst film any of these actors ever did. stereotypes not only abound, but they dominate this film. the sixties-seventies music may be the best thing about the film, maybe because it has nothing to do with the film.<br /><br />this is even difficult to sit back and enjoy as mindless fun. this film is even more racist than the message of racism it tries to deliver. and believe me, i was alive in the seventies, and we thought crap like this was just as stupid then. it was never popular.
