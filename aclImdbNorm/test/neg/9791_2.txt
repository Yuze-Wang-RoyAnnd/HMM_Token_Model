apparently shrunken heads was the last movie that julius harris had a role in. i have not seen all of his movies, but julius harris was in many good movies, and i remember him best from "live and let die" where he played tee-hee and which was full of voodoo references, something that is common here in south florida! i always thought live and let die was a great movie because it had some atmosphere and mystique, unlike most of the 007 movies. in shrunken heads, julius harris is back in his voodoo persona! he has a great style for mystery and the occult, and his part in this movie is excellent. sadly, the rest of the movie is something of a comedy. spoilers: three kids who look like they were fired from the cast of the little rascals get killed by a neighborhood hoodlum who looks like he got fired from the cast of fame! or as a dancer on dick clark's american bandstand. in other words, these kids give low budget another dimension. julius harris goes to the mortuary-funeral home, cuts off the three kids' heads (and nobody notices) and then takes them to his condominium unit where he has a giant cauldron of boiling liquids. the three heads get tossed in, along with some herbs, spices, and voodoo items. at some point mr. harris has the ugly little heads on a table and he spills his blood on them, and they come to life as talking heads! they can fly, make jokes, roll their eyes, and exact vengeance from the evil-doers. they usually look pretty funny flying around, but the effects are not bad. for some reason, one of the kids always has a switch-blade in his mouth, and he uses it to slice people's necks and to cut holes into tires. this movie is weird and funny, but only the first time you see it. meg foster is in this movie and she looks fatter than rosie o'donnell and meg plays a masculine leader of the local gangsters. strange movie.
