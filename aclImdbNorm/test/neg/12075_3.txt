wow, did this episode start on a stooooopid premise! the enterprise is chugging along when all of the sudden, abraham lincoln is floating around in space and welcomes the enterprise!!!!!!! is it just me, or is this a really lame-brained idea?! lincoln comes aboard and they welcome them. abe suggests they beam down to some barren planet, where they meet other famous dead folks--both good and evil. it seems that a really cheesy-looking rock monster has assembled a team of good and evil people to battle it out for supremacy. the whole thing seems really daffy and inherently unfair, as the good side is saddled with surak--a vulcan who makes gandhi seem like rambo!! despite a totally awful premise, the action is pretty good and it's great to see overhead shots of obvious doubles fighting it out in this grudge match. but, don't mistake this for high art or deep sci-fi. the bottom line is that the series was on its last legs as a first-run series and this really looked like they dusted off this turkey and filmed it regardless of the absurdity of the premise.
