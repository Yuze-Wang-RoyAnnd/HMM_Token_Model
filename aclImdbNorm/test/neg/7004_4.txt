i ran across yvette mcclendon in a film at the los angeles film festival and thought she was a doll. after writing my review of her film there, i wanted to see more of her! found this movie, it was pretty bad. not her fault, she is only in the first few minutes where she is obviously being the person to pull you in to watch this bad movie. bad directing. scenes are looped over and over, with all the actresses. amber smith has a very bad breast job yet the other actresses looked pretty good. i really like yvette but, this was obviously a bad choice of hers. i can't believe i rented this trash to look for her. i hope to find her other movies.
