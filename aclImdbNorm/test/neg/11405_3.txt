you can generally ask two questions concerning 80's low-budget horror films. and this `demon wind' in particular. 1. is it a good film? no.. 2. is it a fun film?? you bet! demon wind is a gruesomely filthy and nauseating tale, filled with cheesy make-up effects and nasty violence. the story is pretty much non-existent and involves a group of young people revealing the horrible secrets of one of the groups' ancestors. apparently, his grandparents used to live in a devil-worshiping neighborhood, and evil (in the form of demons and fog) still dwells around there. but, i got to hand it to this film.from start to finish, it breathes morbidity! the diabolical undertones, the playful gore and the (relatively) decent acting all together make this film raise high above the mainstream, uninspired 80's slashers for sure. it shows some creativity and guts (literally) where other productions from this decade fall into routine and oblivion more easily. this creators clearly got inspired by the success of `the evil dead', and perhaps even lamberto bava's `demons, but what the heck! it's fun and made with lots of enthusiasm. although.this film does have a pretty high `what the f***'- standard at times. especially near the end, when flashbacks and laser shows are happily being mixed. and what the hell is the story on those two wannabe magicians? nonetheless, `demon wind' gets my recommendation if your likes aren't too high concerning crap horror!
