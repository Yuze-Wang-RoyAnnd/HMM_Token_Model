this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life. they said this was the man's answer to waiting to exhale...all i'm going to say is that we really didn't respond at all. i couldn't believe that it was actually made. the director should choose another profession, because he can't make a movie. the script wasn't good. it made no sense and was very messy. bet movies are much better than this was, and i was horribly disappointed to see the talented actor terrence in this bad excuse of a movie. if i could turn back the hands of time i wouldn't go back to media play to never buy the movie, i would just keep it wrapped sitting on the shelf, instead of wasting my time watching it.
