after the success of star wars, there was a boost in interest in sci-fi movies. this was one of those cheap attempts to cash in quickly.<br /><br />a group of survivors from a spaceship land on a planet inhabited by stop-motion dinosaurs, where half of them are systematically killed off (the people not the dinosaurs). porn-movie level acting. cheap special effects, even for the time, although it looks like a lot of effort was put into them.<br /><br />costumes were pure 1970's, as were the hairstyles. ahh, the 70's. i expected a disco to break out at any minute.<br /><br />nothing to really recommend in this film.
