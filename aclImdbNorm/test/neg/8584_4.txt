predictable, cliche, unbelievable, boring...what else can i say? it's only the caliber of the cast that saves any redeeming qualities of this bloated mess. oh yeah, and the entertaining end zone antics.<br /><br />but wait for the eleven o'clock highlights, 'cause the outcome is as predictable as who's going to win the globetrotters/washington generals matchup.<br /><br />i was well into the second act before i figured out these were supposed to be pro teams we were watching (all clad in vintage padres brown). and cameron diaz character's imitation of a youthful georgia frontiere was ill-conceived on the page. (not your fault, cameron. would you like to go to dinner?)<br /><br />enough of this - i'm only on a rant because i was looking forward to this film. rent the longest yard instead.<br /><br />
