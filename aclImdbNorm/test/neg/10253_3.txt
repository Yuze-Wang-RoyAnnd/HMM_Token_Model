i readily admit that i watch a lot of really bad movies. but there are very few that i can think of that are quite as bad as when women had tails. it's a stinker of epic proportions. what should have been a sexy comedy about a group of cavemen discovering a woman for the first time is instead a dull, lifeless affair without a single laugh to be had. the comedy is extremely weak. i suppose if you think bashing someone in the head is funny, you might find a laugh or two. the guys in this movie make the three stooges look like high art. and there's just not enough of a plot to hold the thing together. it seems to drag on and on and on.<br /><br />well, you may be asking yourself, "if it's as bad as you say, why haven't you rated it lower than a 3/10?" good question! and i've got two answers. first, the movie is not without its curiosity value. i do find a bit of interest in an italian spoof of movies like one million years b.c. with raquel welch. i'll give when women had tails a point for its historic "value". the other two points are for the mere presence of senta berger. i know it's not much of an explanation or reasoning for a rating, but what are you going to do? it's the best i can come up with.
