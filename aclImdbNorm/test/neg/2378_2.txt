i think it's the first time that i go inside a theater and go out so disappointed. there were two reasons why i went to see "ast'erix et les vikings": first as a film buff, and second as a big ast'erix fan.<br /><br />in the end, the film doesn't satisfy any request. it's simply a big animated mess and it proves that the ast'erix franchise is going from bad to worse.<br /><br />in fact, it has been this way since the death of first scenarist ren'e goscinny in 1977. his faithful collaborator, illustrator albert uderzo took his place, but the following books were clearly lacking of the quality that was present during the goscinny years.<br /><br />"ast'erix et les vikings" is based on the book "ast'erix et les normands", which was published during the goscinny reign. the basic story is the same: goudurix, abraracourcix' nephew' arrives to the village and ast'erix et ob'elix must turn him into a real man, while the vikings come to gaul in order to discover what fear is, because it seems that fear gives wings.<br /><br />the similarities end here. what follows in the book is a non-stop series of laughs, gags and hilarious dialog with the result that the vikings do discover fear and they flee gaul. the movie is silly, unfunny, fast-paced, corny... well, just name a default and it has good chances of being applied...<br /><br />the difference between the book and the movie could be more acceptable if the movie was good. but the new ideas simply crashes it in a bottomless pit. even older ast'erix movies such as "ast'erix le gaulois", which almost transferred the lines one by one without changing them are easily better.<br /><br />animation has the quality of other 21st century movies, but it has its faults and any film beginner could find the mistakes. the greatest example is the continuity mistake, where the day follows the night after a fraction of second, in the same sequence.<br /><br />imagine. they took animation studios from numerous countries and they still can't get adequate film-making.<br /><br />the changes of the original story are simply unbearable. and they still could be even if there was no original story. goudurix, in the movie, has a pet pigeon named sms and who act as his cell phone (!). grossebaf, the viking chief, has a rebellious teen daughter named abba (!) and she constantly defies her father's authority. there's also a stupid viking wizard, his cartoonish dumb and muscular son, the faithful bride of grossebaf who is obsessed with decoration (her name is vikea!) and... well i can't stand that much longer.<br /><br />we're far from the original gags from the original book. the biggest problem is the difficulty of transferring the images to the big screen, mainly because the greatest laughs in the books come from the verbal jokes and visual gags which do not have the same appeal on a theatre screen. i remember that the greatest moments in the book were ob'elix laughing at the invaders' names (which all finish in 'af') and goudurix tries to scare them in ridiculous ways.<br /><br />and if everything wasn't enough, somebody in the publicity staff decided to write on the movie poster that there's an already existing c'eline dion song which would be featured in the final credits. if it was a new song, i could have understood. but using an old song is only another proof that the movie is so badly made that they're ready to do anything in order to attract film-goers.<br /><br />the only good point for this movie is that it is so stupid and the end is so bad that we just can't walk out of the theater without being left cold. in a summer release, it just can't hurt...<br /><br />the only other acceptable point of the movie is how goudurix becomes courageous. his psychological transformation in the book is too spontaneous and not credible, while it's better pictured in the movie and the motivation point is more believable.<br /><br />so if you haven't seen the movie yet, don't waste your money on it. grab the book instead.<br /><br />oh ren'e, why did you leave us?
