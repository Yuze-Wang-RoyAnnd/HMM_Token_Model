kairo, or pulse as it's known amongst english speaking audiences, is set in tokyo & starts as sunny plant sales employee michi kudo (kumiko aso) decides to visit her friend taguchi (kenji mizuhashi) to enquire about a computer disk he's been working on, when she gets to his place he gives her the disk but then rather inconsiderately commits suicide in front of her. meanwhile a student named ryosuke kawashima (haruhiko kato) has recently hooked up to the internet & keeps getting spooky messages & images on his monitor so he ask's computer whizz harue karasawa (koyuki) whats happening, she doesn't really know but it seems that the place where people's spirits go when they die is full & they need somewhere else to go & earth is as good a place as any, right? these spirits don't like sharing either so they sort of make people commit suicide or turn them into ashes or something like that, i don't really know because the films a bit of a mess...<br /><br />this japanese production was written & directed by kiyoshi kurosawa & right off the bat i have to say i hated kairo, i hated everything about it & it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that asian cinema can produce something as crap as any american filmmaker. the script is an overlong mess, the thing simply doesn't make any sense with scenes which seem like they are from a different film, sequences which make no logical sense or are not explained in any way & kairo is also the most downright boring film i've sat through this year. at two hours long this is a real chore to sit through, i really wanted to fast-forward it but i'm fair if nothing else so i stuck it out to the bitter end & frankly wished i hadn't. there are so many things wrong with kairo, i suppose the filmmakers were going for a surreal ambiguous & deliberately incoherent feel but those are traits which i despise in a film unless they are done properly. then there's the whole internet thing which i just couldn't relate to at all, i use the internet all day & it's not in the least bit scary to me in any way. then there's the fact that kairo as a film provided zero entertainment value for me, maybe i'm a neanderthal but i kind of like the films i watch to entertain me, make some sort of sense & not bore me to death.<br /><br />director kurosawa has made the ultimate insomnia cure as far as i'm concerned, if you have trouble getting to sleep stick this in the dvd & you be fast asleep within 10 minutes i guarantee you. i didn't think kairo was scary in the slightest, the whole internet thing was laughable & as for scary you should see some of the penis enlargement pop-up ads i get, now that's scary! i hate this film, i hate this film, i'm sorry i just need to make that basic point again, twice. forget about any action, tension or gore as there isn't any. if you have a very nervous disposition then there are maybe a couple of scenes which might creep you out otherwise this is kiddie friendly pg rated stuff all the way. urgh.<br /><br />the film looks so dull & boring it's untrue, the camera just sits there for very long shots & when it does move it moves very slowly, this has all the style of a mexican soap opera. since kairo is sub titled it's difficult to judge the original performances so i won't bother, it's hard to care for someone when they don't even speak the same language & you don't know what they are saying.<br /><br />kairo is crap, i hated it & it's as simple & straight forward as that. just because it's an asian flick doesn't automatically make it any good & the mess of a story, the plot holes, the fact it makes no sense & it's an absolute bore means kairo would rightly be torn to shreds by people if it were an american production. the worst film i've seen this year by some distance. kairo got a hollywood remake as pulse (2006).
