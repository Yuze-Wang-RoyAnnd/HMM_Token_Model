this has to be one of the most awfully scripted films i've ever seen. it's basically a remake of the beast from 20,000 fathoms (1953), but done with your standard snake-like puppet-monster instead of a sleek ray harryhausen creation. combine the plot of that classic monster movie with the production qualities and acting level of the creeping terror and you have an idea of what this movie is like.<br /><br />the movie is dubbed, although by the original actors (i think that the movie was originally dubbed in italian for that countries audiences, then redubbed for us release), which just makes the movie seem weird...the sounds, like in a japanese monster movie, just don't quite match properly to the action on the screen, even if the actors' lips are moving properly.<br /><br />poor ray milland...he's certainly come a long way down from the lost weekend or dial m for murder or any of the number of excellent movies he was in. add this to his other sci-fi travesties (panic in the year zero, x the man with x-ray eyes) and you can see a once good actor fallen into a boris karloff syndrome...stuck doing really bad horror films in foreign countries just for the work.
