this film simply has no redeeming features. the story is incomprehensible, and the script is gross, sadistic, and stupid. the sex scenes are a joke, as is the inevitable car chase. the music is awful. the acting is limited largely to growling and smirking. a half star dud. shame on directv for putting it on pay-per-view. in a theater, people might well have thrown soda at the screen.
