<br /><br />this movie sucked! the first one was way better. no one from the first has returned in this dumb sequel and in some way that is a good thing because of the bad acting but the characters in this film are not even better. killjoy in the woods? come on! give me a break! i'm suprised killjoy's friend the blair witch didn't show up to make a cameo. bad acting, bad story and just plain out silly and boring. don't waste your time!
