i watched this movie with big expectations. the blurb on the back indicated that this was going to be a nasty one. but it was pretty tame and a little unsatisfying. the violence was nothing i haven't seen a thousand times before, the gore level was only average (mind you there was probably more than what has been seen in hollywood in the last 5 years - perhaps more), and at no stage was i even feeling uneasy let along frightened. again a cat 3 movie with big wraps, has not lived up to its hype.<br /><br />sure hire this movie, but don't go in with any expectations. i am so keen to get into the whole asian horror scene, but am continuously disappointed. i did love ichi, and audition, but then again, miike stands alone at the moment.<br /><br />please inspire me..... there is a large cluster of jaded genre fans who are starved of quality horror!
