yep. those of my generation who grew up watching those old sunbow cartoons were spoiled. the 80's joe tune was one of the best cartoons in the history of television. well written stories, well developed characters. granted it was nothing more that a glorified toy commercial but it definitely helped carry that toy line. fast forward almost twenty years later and enter valor vs. venom. the animation was average at most. the movement of the characters seemed to jerky and puppet like. the movie felt more like a small soldiers sequel than a story about a special military force. then we have character development or lack there of. dusty likes to be all dusty? slice and dice like to do things together? what? did the writers take a writing course on how to develops characters with the depth equivalent of jar jar binks? as for the story. i like a bit of sci-fi. but that whole concept of turning soldiers into a mutant army has been done to death in the joe universe. mega monsters or toxo-zombies anyone? but i give the creators credit for trying to make the fan boys happy by having martial arts action every 10 minutes. i'm not a huge fan of se and ss but i did like the fight scenes between the two. if you can appreciate vvv for what it is you will enjoy it. i admit to not being able to appreciate vvv as i should. again everything joe gets compared to what ways done in the 80's, and honestly nothing will ever compare to the glory days of gi joe. if you can appreciate vvv for what it is you will enjoy it.
