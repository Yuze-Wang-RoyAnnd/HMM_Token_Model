i very much enjoyed bruce almighty but the minute i found out that there was going to be a sequel without jim carey, i knew it was bad. although steve carell was hysterical in the first film ( the babbling scene is one of my favorites) , and, in my opinion , deserves an emmy for his role in the office , he is pretty weak in this dull comedy. i'm curious how much work the script writers put, because we could just as well do without the story . but even if we discard the huge plot holes (why did elephants and lions come to aid evan when the flood only concerned that particular area of washington) the film is simply ...not funny. i did not laugh once and as far as i remember, a comedy is supposed to make you laugh . or giggle at least. not this one.<br /><br />there is small hope however. evan almighty has "family" written all over it and maybe a family viewing might be enjoyable,(kids might be entertained by the variety of animals and the silly jokes) , but ,for me, evan almighty simply doesn't cut it.<br /><br />i give it a 4/10 and hope that carell will be more careful when choosing his roles in the feature.
