i would like to know who conned the producers of this movie to pay for its production - that persion is a genius of sorts. this movie somehow held my attention for about two thirds of it until i realized that it was going nowhere fast. i think the music managed to make it seem like something was going on, but nothing really was. it was not scary. the dialog was poorly written. the first 90 minutes should have been covered in about 15 minutes. this would have been a moderately acceptable twilight zone or outer limits episode.<br /><br />at this point i'm just mad that i wasted all that time. that's a couple hours that i will never get back.<br /><br />i hope these comments save someone from wasting their evening. take a nap or hit the gym instead. or if you want to be scared, turn on a cable news channel.
