in short, this movie is a declaration of artistic bankruptcy.<br /><br />almodovar is easily the most important european film maker of the 80s and 90s. no other living director has shaped the style and contents of present-day european cinema more than him. it is therefore not easy to say that his latest effort is not just another disappointment after two lackluster films, but rather a complete and total disaster confirming that he has run out of ideas, out of humour and, worst of all, empathy for the characters he creates.<br /><br />that is not due to the complexity of the story. all almodovar films are almost impossible to summarize. this time, in fact, it's rather easy if you are familiar with his earlier work. "broken embraces" is a remake of "law of desire", only this time the director is straight and the jealous jilted lover is a millionaire.<br /><br />for those of you not familiar with that film, i'm doing a summary. if you don't want to know too much, please skip this paragraph. a blind man, who used to be a famous movie director, seduces a sexy buxom woman reading a paper to him after a chance street encounter (yes, really, that's how it starts). just then he gets a visit by his agent and best friend. he mentions to her that he has learned from the paper that a certain millionaire has died, which takes the story 14 years back. he can still see and is about to direct his next film. he stars the inexperienced mistress of the said millionaire as the lead, as he is instantly smitten with her. the millionaire discovers their affair via silent videos made by his gay son, which he has lip-synched by an interpreter (a few great scenes: cecilia roth). after violent quarrels, the mistress escapes with the director to a seaside resort where he learns that the millionaire, who produced the film, had it released in the worst possible edit, destroying the director's reputation. the couple decides to return, but has an accident in which the director turns blind and the would-be actress dies. back in the present, he learns that his agent has preserved the film's negatives and starts to reconstruct it.<br /><br />as in "bad education", there are various sub plots to beef up this rather thin story, and as in "bad education", the result is more confusing than satisfactory. for instance, the agent's son, who works as a dj, has an accidental drug overdose - which is completely unnecessary for the plot, and also interpreted rather badly.<br /><br />mostly, however, the actors are not to blame, but the way their characters are written. blanca portilla as the agent has so many skeletons in her closet that not even a brilliant performance can save the character from ridicule. lluis homar is an old man's dream of a protagonist, living in an artificial world where an english alias and a few sweet words can seduce any super model. and penelope cruz is the embodiment of this old man's sexual fantasy. her character is completely lifeless. it remains thoroughly incomprehensible why she would go from one old man, who at least helped her family, to a slightly less old man, who isn't charming enough to convince as either a romantic hero or a passion fuse.<br /><br />but all these shortcomings wouldn't make this film so awful. however, almodovar does the worst possible thing of a director (or any type of storyteller) running out of ideas: he quotes himself, something he has increasingly done, and to very little benefit. the film-within-the-film, which "broken embraces" uses as a plot-driving device, is actually "women at the verge of a nervous breakdown" (1988), only this time it is called "chicks and suitcases". this rather unimaginative title may give you a hint how this beloved classic is treated here: while the dialog making up the final ten minutes of "broken embraces" is a frantic, over-the-top exchange of screwball one-liners in the original film, here it is a stern, colorless, pesky business encounter.<br /><br />in conclusion, this is the d.o.a. brainchild of an exhausted creator of past marvels, pretty much as awful and disappointing as the last indiana jones feature. maybe not so many people would agree with that, because almodovar used to be such a genius. i'd rather offer my respect to his accomplishments by humbly asking the reader to watch "all about my mother", or "tie me up", or "high heels", or "matador", all of which bear witness to almodovar's unique and unmatched talent. a few more film like this, and his legacy may very well be destroyed for good.
