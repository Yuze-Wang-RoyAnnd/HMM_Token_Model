russians never dropped children's toys filled with explosives over afghanistan, that never happened!!! who did invention of that?? hollywood portrays russian army as horrible, dreadful troops of evil! that is disgusting!! united states president jimmy carter had accepted the view that "soviet aggression" could not be viewed as an isolated event of limited geographical importance but had to be contested as a potential threat to the persian gulf region. the uncertain scope of the final objective of moscow in its sudden southward plunge made the american stake in an independent pakistan all the more important. a great deal of damage was done to the civilian children population by land mines.
