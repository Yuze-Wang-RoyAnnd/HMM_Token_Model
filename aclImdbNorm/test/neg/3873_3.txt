the original title always struck me as a rather overblown definition for a bunch of gun-toting saddle-tramps. still; their screen presence was at least underscored by a top-quality group of actors to support yul brynner. most were movie stars in their own right.<br /><br />however; this first sequel was a pale imitation, with a group now composed of largely b and c list players, who were more mediocre than magnificent. it was a similar set-up. brynner's 'chris' had to recruit yet another team of gun-toting saddle-tramps to sort out the mexican peasants' problems again. another tyrant was giving them grief.<br /><br />with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer. the budget was evidently very limited. this was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic. it was also more than half an hour shorter than john sturges' original. yet we still had a reprise of the agonising and moralising that made even the first a little turgid at times. however, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up. filmiing was less expansive. it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.<br /><br />generally; it just lacked imagination. the first movie had been a smash-hit, and this pedestrian sequel was evidently put together as quickly and cheaply as possible in order to cynically cash-in on former success. and it shows. there's very much a 'made for tv' feel about it.<br /><br />not recommended.
