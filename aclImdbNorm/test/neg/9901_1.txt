what a mess--and i'm not referring to the "destruction" in the title. i could go on about the hackneyed plot, the lousy effects, the (actually notable) cast grimacing as they deliver the worst lines of their careers, etc. i'll just say there weren't any palm trees in chicago the last time i checked, and leave it at that.<br /><br />hmmm...need ten lines to get this posted on imdb.. ok, well, i think a dvd release with outtakes could be interesting. maybe dennehy will reveal what favor got called in for him to appear in this thing. maybe dianne weist will show us the bag of money it must have taken to get her involved. maybe cbs execs will apologize...
