when jim wynorski first announced he would be doing a new sequel for my favorite series of all time, the "slumber party massacre" series, i was ecstatic. i had been waiting for a new installment for literally years. so, production began and very small bits and pieces on the shoot and the actors involved were released until the shoot wrapped. then, the announcement of a title change. no longer would this new sequel be titled "slumber party massacre iv," but "cheerleader massacre" instead. i was a bit disappointed, but having a different title would be a very small price to pay for a film i had waited so long to happen. i was still extremely intrigued and on the edge of my seat to see it.<br /><br />maybe a month ago, some very advanced copies of the film were released to some extremely lucky viewers, who got to see the film months before its release date. a few reviews leaked on the net and judging by them, i began to become apprehensive on jim wynorski's "cheerleader massacre."<br /><br />tonight, i got to see the film for the first time in full length and i am still scratching my head. as i read in another review, "cheerleader massacre" is definitely not a new installment in the "slumber party massacre" series, but a slasher flick all on its own. and a bad one at that.<br /><br />before i get into the specifics of the film, let me first state what an enormous fan of jim wynorski's films i am. i always thought him to be a true camp genius, with a winner almost every time. yes, his movies are made on shoestring budgets and don't contain the most top-notch acting around, but they're fun nonetheless. they are what they are: campy movies you watch when you want to have a good time. from "sorority house massacre ii," to "hard to die," to "chopping mall," jim has produced the goods on more than one occasion. one of the reasons why i was excited that this film would be his latest project.<br /><br />"cheerleader massacre" does not (in my opinion) reflect any of the films i had seen this director/writer create in the past. firstly, the production was extremely inexpensive and the film was actually shot on videotape, something i had never seen jim do before. the actors were mediocre, to say the least, and the story is almost laughable. the killer is also extremely stupid and reminds you more of your cuddly old grandpa, rather than an escaped lunatic.<br /><br />of course, the film is littered with female nudity. this is a jim wynorski movie we're talking about, folks. but some of the boob-shots seen here almost seem like they were done for time. there is an extremely long shower scene, containing the cheerleading coach, that seems to go on forever and it greatly reflects a shower scene in jim's "sorority house massacre ii." the girl even bathes herself almost in the exact same way.<br /><br />"cheerleader massacre" is also extremely cliched, to say the least. the opening scene is literally something we've all seen in hundreds of past slasher flicks. a guy and a girl making out, on the verge of consummating their relationship when...you guessed it. they're hacked to pieces.<br /><br />brinke stevens, who i've never really considered to be a tremendous actress in the first place, also gives one of her stiffest and forced performances in her small cameo. we're talkin' possible cue cards here. she recalls some incidents her character endured by the killer seen here twenty years ago to the police, while footage of the original "slumber party massacre" plays. why was footage from the original film used if it was definitely not a new "spm"? i have no idea. there is also two explosions seen in this movie that i am almost certain were recycled from other films.<br /><br />not only does this film recycle footage from past films, but it also recycles the scores from other films as well. some of the music used in "humanoids from the deep" (which was also recycled prior for "the coroner") can be heard throughout the entire film. there are at least two more as well that i cannot identify, but am certain have been used before.<br /><br />after sitting through this film's horrendous acting, ridiculous story, non-existent gore/special effects, and camcorder-like quality, i am having some serious concerns toward mister wynorski's career. has the man who delighted audiences with films in the past finally lost his niche? only time will tell. oh, and let's not forget his newest film. a new installment in the "sorority house massacre" films, now titled "final exam." i think i'm seeing a pattern here...
