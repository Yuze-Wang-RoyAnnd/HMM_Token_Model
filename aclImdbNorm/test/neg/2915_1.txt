remember those old kung fu movies we used to watch on friday and saturday late nights when our babysitters thought we were in charge? well, this movie plays exactly like one of those movies. patsy kensit's biggest claim to fame was the love interest to mel gibson's character in "lethal weapon 2," and this performance was one of the reasons why she's never made it big: she's a terrible actress.<br /><br />in "lethal weapon 2," i thought she was cute. cute enough to check out some of the other movies she'd been in, including "loves music, loves to dance" another big let down, which i, obviously, was not impressed with, either. but, as attractive as she is to my eyes, my soul screamed at me to turn it off because she played another cheap, predictable role, and done it very badly.<br /><br />in this movie, kensit stars as a comedienne (and not a good one, either) who's working the clubs of france (couldn't cut it in her own homeland, so she's making their ears bleed), who's down on her luck, but, even worse, the french government wants to throw her out because of an expired visa (or maybe they just caught her act). but she gets married to this casanova (freiss), who is just as down on his luck, and the predictability begins...terribly! is there any way to give this movie a negative rating? 1 out of 10 stars is over rating it!
