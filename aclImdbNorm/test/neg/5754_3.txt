hercules wound up falling into the same category as many promising television productions that could have been a really great classic, only to become a sad joke.<br /><br />i really like kevin sorbo and his supporting cast, but i didn't care for the direction the show took since their movie equivalents either. i believe the show would have had a much more successful run if they had kept the same format they did for the movies.<br /><br />i watched in the beginning and lost interest along the way. i did encounter the odd episode afterwards, but my attention span towards it was lucky to make it to commercial break.
