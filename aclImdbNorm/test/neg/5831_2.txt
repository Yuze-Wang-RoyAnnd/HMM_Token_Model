everyonce in a while,4kids brings new shows to it's company. for the past few years, they brought pure gold like kirby: right back at ya! or mew mew power. but recenetly, 4kids has been off. catdog is one of the examples.<br /><br />it's hard to write a negative comment without bashing the show, but in truth, weekenders is pure garbage. it revolves around a group who with an over active brain. the catch though is anything he thinks up comes bad. it may sound good on paper, but after watching it, you'll realize how far from good this show is.<br /><br />the pizza guy is an extremely dumb character. he's very 1-dimensional, there's really not much to him. he's hyper-active, end of story. though many feel all the character are a rip off of the south park, i think just the contrary. mechazawa from cromartie high-school is an interesting character, and he's able to make me laugh. tino fail to do either of the two.<br /><br />the cast for the show isn't any better. like tino's mom they suffer from lack of character. they only stick to one characteristic and thats it. the only redeeming quality is the fact that the show can cause you to smirk. whether it's that the scene may actually be funny, or you may just smirk because how stupid it is.<br /><br />thje weekenders is a very crappy show from disney/4kids. though it does seem to love some fans, it should really be left to the kids.
