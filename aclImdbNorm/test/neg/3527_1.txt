"nuts in may" may be one of the worst films i have ever seen. if ed wood was still alive this would be the type of movie he would be doing.to say this movie is bad would be the understatement of the century. but how bad is it really? well, here are two levels of bad i go by; "it's so bad it's good" or "it's so bad it's god awful". this film falls into the latter section. what little unintentional humor it has does not make up for the slow, hard to understand, boring majority of the film.<br /><br />summary: spoilers**<br /><br />two middle-aged anglos take a trip to the countryside for some r&r and camping, there they met ray soon-to-be jim (i'll explain later), who's tent is next to our main couple. throughout most of the movie the two leads go sight seeing on the beach, at a rock quarry and other exciting locations. in between these adventures they talk endlessly about the environment, vegetarianism,fossil collecting, the duty of a proper citizen and proper diet, all thing i want to see in a comedy. they bore anyone who will listen to them. the dialogue is not only bad, but the pacing in some scenes is so slow i sometimes felt like dosing off. scenes would go on forever and just when it begins to build up and something is about to happen the scene ends. half way through the movie i thought to myself, "nothing is going to happen in this thing, it is truly a movie about nothing".<br /><br />the characters are annoying and constantly repeat things. at one part i felt the director was playing a cruel joke on his audience. the scene i am referring to is the "sing along" scene. in it our two boresome brits play some of there music for us, actually it was the same 4 four lines over and over and over and over. the idea was to get ray to sing along with them, but ray knew, as well as us, that they are the worst songwriters known to man. this scene was beyond tedious, by the fifth time the song was played i started to question the existance of a merciful god.<br /><br />words can not describe the awfulness of this film. the first thing that strikes you is the indecipherable british accents that most of the cast has. remember the thick scottish accents in trainspotting? times that by 10.<br /><br />towards the end our tree hugging, incoherent, couple get into a fight with some of ray's friends that have complete disrespect for the rules of camping. our hero becomes so incensed that a climatic battle ensues between our hero and the head hellraiser. to settle their dispute the two men engage in a stick fight. that's right a stick fight! now this is where the unintensional humor starts. i laughed so hard at the ineptitude of it all that i thought, "this may make up for the other 80 minutes." after this histerical battle our hero runs behind some bushes to cry his eyes out and the other man calls ray over by calling him jim for some unknown reason.<br /><br />a stick fight, a crying nature loving 40 year old and a character name change 3/4 into the movie, ed wood would be proud.<br /><br />though, i was again forced to endure the last 10 minutes which to sum up ends with a long take of a pig. why? who the hell knows. at one moment we see a pig grazing and the next the credits start to role over the screen. one of the worst endings to a one of the worst films of all time.
