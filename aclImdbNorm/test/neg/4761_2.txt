this movie is simply rubbish. i have to say i am an expert of rubbish movies. i reserve the "1" rating for movies that are rubbish but funny, but this film is just tedious and certainly not crappy in a funny way but crappy in a crappy way. it gets a "2" so those of you out there can distinguish between the ones that will make you laugh and the ones that will make you fall asleep. there are scenes in this movie where the actors are looking at something, their expressions are of amazement and there wide eyes and slack jaws tell the audience that what they are looking at is going to be profoundly amazing, this simply isn't it's just a cupboard or even more desert. it has to be pretty god damn awful for me to walk out, let me tell you, i walked out and so did quite a few people.
