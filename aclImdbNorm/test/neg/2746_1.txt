i love basketball and this seemed like an intriguing movie. however, in the first ten minutes of the movie i knew that it was going to be lousy. it was poorly acted and much too slow. on top of that it was very, very racist, sexist, antisemitic and homophobic. sometimes putting in racial, ethnic and other types of slurs has a point, illustrating the bigotry that exists. in this movie there was no point to the horrible bigotry and no one learned from what was being said. part of the problem is that it was an adaption of a play and a remake of a 1982 movie that dealt with a basketball team from the 1950's. having this movie take place earlier in time would have made a little bit more sense. it didn't translate well to modern times and the writing was horrible. i don't know how the play was originally written but i can't believe that any movie as bad and as hateful as this one has made it to television and video in 1999. it was disgusting. don't waste your precious time on this one.
