army private gene kelly, who's also a talented trapeze aerialist, comes under fire for doing daring stunts without a net and alienating his high-wire cohorts; meanwhile, there's an elaborate 'camp show' to put on for army soldiers and personnel, and the whole studio of m-g-m has shown up to join in the fun. mickey rooney plays m.c. (unctuously), introducing acts like kay kyser and his orchestra, bob crosby, benny carter, and the m-g-m dancing girls (who appear to be dressed as vegetables). red skelton does a cute bit with donna reed and margaret o'brien, but the other comedic bits suffer from an apparent vacuum between the performers and the allegedly-live audience (they're awfully silent until the editor cuts to them for exaggerated reaction shots). judy garland sings an inappropriate song about a jumpin' night at carnegie hall (improbably accompanied by classical pianist jos'e iturbi, whom judy calls 'hep'). the production is glossy, but the manic energy feels false, fabricated. ** from ****
