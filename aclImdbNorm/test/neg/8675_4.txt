oh dear! the bbc is not about to be knocked off its pedestal for absorbing period dramas by this one. i agree this novel of jane austens is the difficult to portray particularly to a modern audience, the heroine is hardly a elizabeth bennet, even edmund is not calculated to cause female hearts to skip a beat. however i must say i was hoping for an improvement on the last and was sadly disappointed. the basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was so altered that all that was jane austen's tone, manner, feeling, wit, depth, was diluted if not lost. if some past adaptions may be seen as dated the weakness of this one must be that it is too modern ('his life is one long party'?????) the cast was generally adequate, but i think billie piper was the wrong choice, it needed someone more restrained, i gained no impression of hidden depths beneath a submissive exterior, she was more like a frolicking child. i see i must wait for the bbc to weave its magic once again.
