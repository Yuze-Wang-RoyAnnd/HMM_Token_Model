the only reason i rented this movie was that val kilmer rarely stars in a bad movie. there is of course a first time for everything. in many ways, this movie proves that oaters aren't as easy to make as we think, especially by foreign directors. the only one who got by with it was probably sergio leone, but even his movies lacked that something indefinably innate to our american psyche and panache. american actors in clint eastwood and henry fonda did help . i can see now why they changed the original title from "summer love" to " dead man's bounty". that itself tells me the producers and director didn't have any core understanding about a western other than those standard shoot'em up scenes and violent themes. i suppose we can say the same about american directors attempting to make a polish movie while failing miserably in the process.
