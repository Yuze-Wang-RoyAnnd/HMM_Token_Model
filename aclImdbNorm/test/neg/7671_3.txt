my take: the silliest of the airport movies, and probably one of the worst of the 70's disaster movies.<br /><br />as if to milk the franchise with all its got, the producers of this third sequel to airport throws in more action, silly subplots, gratuitous star appearances and goofier elements. in its attempt to be the biggest airport yet, concorde: airport '79 is the worst one yet, and probably one of the worst of the disaster movies of the 1970's. with its bad box-office results, it is no wonder that the genre has overstayed its welcome.<br /><br />the film opens with a rather catchy score by lalo schifrin backed-up by some impressive shots of the titular aircraft in its former glory (the same plane used in this film would be involved in a crash in july 2000). but then the credits appear, and we get a glimpse of the "all-star" cast, which is composed nothing more of faded hollywood stars, tv actors and none-too-popular b actors. the plot is sillier than ever: george kennedy is back in the role of joe patroni, now the pilot of the concorde (co piloted by co-pilot alain delon) en route to france after the summer olympics. on board is reporter maggie whelan (susan blakely), who has just discovered that his boyfriend, renowned weapons manufacturer kevin harrison (robert wagner), is selling their weapons to terrorist. to prevent her from revealing the news to the world, harrison sends his most advance missiles and best saboteurs to prevent the concorde from landing.<br /><br />the cast/subplots are dumber than ever, even sillier than an alcoholic myrna loy or a singing nun. we have cicely tyson transporting a live human heart in a cooler (!), martha raye as a woman with a bladder condition (and the character doesn't go deeper than that), j.j. walker a a pot-smoking saxophonist (arguably the most annoying character in the film), eddie albert married to "old" wife sybil danning, avery schreiber as russian coach with a deaf daughter and finally, a love story between reporter jon davidson and gymnast andrea marcovici (much to the sour watching-eye of coach mercedes mccambidge). plus the movie gets much closer to love boat episode than ever with the silliest cameos of charo (and her pet chihuahua) and bibi anderson. camp buffs will no doubt get a real kick-in-the-balls in this silly entry in a long strain of 70's disaster movies. this one is, in more than the sense of the word, a true disaster.<br /><br />rating: *1/2 out of 5.
