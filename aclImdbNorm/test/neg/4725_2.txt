the following "review" is one from the wrong side of the tracks, meaning two things: you will hear nothing but praises coming from me and don't be fooled by my rating. i also could tell you that this review contains no spoilers, but technically... that's a lie.<br /><br />well,... screw the review. i'm just going to ramble a bit. it has been a while since i had so much fun with such a bad film. and if you cannot enjoy this piece of utter drivel, then you simply have no sense of humor. first off, this movie was meant to be taken seriously, and that's the main aspect were the fun is coming from. the story? a doctor's son is terminally ill. daddy-doctor decides that a hart-transplant must be the only way of saving his son. so, in true mad-doctor-style, he decides that the heart of a gorilla will do the trick. of course, the gorilla-heart is "much too potent for a human", so sonny-boy transforms into this hideous ape-man that immediately breaks free and goes on a killing and raping spree (because that's simply what any horny beast would do, isn't it?). the make-up of our ape-man is hilarious. there's simply no other way of putting it: the guys' face looks like a turd! i'm talking human excrement here, the solid brown kind! beautiful! the gore in this flick is wonderful too: aside from real footage of an open-heart surgery, we also have incredibly fake (but quite nasty) looking blood & gore effects: a decapitation, an eye-gouging, a throat-ripping, the scalping of someone's skull,... it's hilarious, and indeed it's quite incomprehensible why night of the bloody apes ever made it to the notorious uk video-nasties list, because all of the nasty things portrayed in this film are simply too ridiculous to be taken seriously. oh, and there's only one bloody ape running around in it too, by the way. so, needless to say that la horripilante bestia humana is a much more accurate title for this terrifying and convincing tale of science gone horribly wrong.<br /><br />when not trying to shock with poorly staged acts of bloody violence or random portrayals of female nudity, this movie manages to be highly entertaining with ingredients like nonsensical dialogues, cheap cardboard sets, plot stupidity and incredibly bad acting. just a few random examples, maybe? about the sets: one can clearly see that the set-designers just used the same walls, doors, windows (etc.) over and over again to be build various different interior sets (e.g.: one side of the hospital room - the window side - where the unconscious wrestling girl lies, looks suspiciously similar like the window side of the basement-laboratory from where ape-man escapes; the set-designers also took one of the side-windows from the laboratory, made it a bit larger and just placed it in the conference-room of the hospital; all the walls in any building are the same grey-ones;...). then there's the setting of the park. clearly shot in a studio, you can see (on several occasions) that the grass is loose. whenever there's some struggling/fighting/raping going on, the grass just shifts and shuffles and you can see the grey concrete from the studio-floor beneath it.<br /><br />just a few random lines that come out the actors' mouths: <br /><br />-- in the conference-room where all the doctors are debating the disappearance of unconscious wrestling girl (a disappearance that would of course mean bad publicity for the hospital), daddy-doctor intelligently utters "we find ourselves in a situation that is difficult".<br /><br />-- during that same debate a colleague-doctor cleverly remarks "a sleepwalker! any sleepwalker gets up.", hereby providing a solid excuse for the disappearance of unconscious wrestling girl.<br /><br />-- after our investigating detective, through the amazing process of his own logical deduction, concludes and tells his superior that the murderer must be a half man/half beast, his superior answers that it's absurd, adding the line "it's more probable that of late, more and more, you're watching on your television many of those pictures of terror"... truly one of the best lines of the movie.<br /><br />other sources of laughter: <br /><br />-- the two scenes were daddy-doctor and his igor-like assistant kidnap the gorilla from the zoo and unconscious wrestling girl from the hospital - these well thought-out acts of abduction are like taking candy from a baby.<br /><br />-- daddy-doctor speaks to god a lot, doesn't he?<br /><br />-- sonny-boy calling daddy-doctor "papa" on more than one occasion.<br /><br />-- an old lady screaming "aaargh!!! a dead man! a dead man! a dead man!! a dead man!!!".<br /><br />-- the plot periodically stops to wallow in scenes of women wrestling, only to go on again and do nothing with that concept. sure, daddy-doctor replaces sonny-boy's gorilla-heart a second time with that of unconscious wrestling girl, but do you think something spectacular happens after that? like ape-turd-man growing breasts or something, trying to rape men this time? our leading living wrestling beauty (norma lazareno) doesn't even go into a climactic wrestling contest with ape-turd-man near the movie's finale... but ape-turd-man does start to show some motherly love near the end... almost (and i say "almost") in true king kong-style (i.e. the top of a building and people on the ground pointing and screaming).<br /><br />okay, i think that's enough now. i chipped in more than my two cents here. vomitron's rational rating for this sleazy piece of hilarious dreck: 2/10. vomitron's rating from the wrong side of the tracks: 8/10. go see this film, people. it is well worth it!
