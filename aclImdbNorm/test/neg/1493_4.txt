i was very disappointed with this series. it had lots of cool graphics and that's about it. the level of detail it went into was minimal, and i always got the feeling the audience was being patronized -- there was a lot of what seemed to me as "this is extremely cool but we're not going to explain it in further detail because you won't get it anyway. let's just show you some pretty pictures to entertain you." the host would drop interesting-sounding words such as "sparticles" and "super-symmetry" without any attempt at explaining what it was. we had to look it up on wikipedia.<br /><br />furthermore, i know quite a bit about superstrings (for a layman) and i found their explanations were convoluted and could have been so much better. they could have chosen much better examples to explain concepts, but instead, the examples they used were confusing and further obscured the subject.<br /><br />additionally, i got so sick of the repetitiveness. they could easily have condensed the series into one episode if they had cut out all the repetition. they must have shown the clips of the quantum caf'e about 8 times. the host kept saying the same things over and over and over again. i can't remember how many times he said "the universe is made out of tiny little vibrating strings." it's like they were trying to brainwash us into just accepting "superstrings are the best thing since sliced bread."<br /><br />finally, the show ended off with an unpleasant sense of a "competition" between fermilab and cern, clearly biased towards fermilab. this is supposed to be an educational program about quantum physics, not about whether the us is better than europe or vice versa! i also felt that was part of the patronizing -- "audiences need to see some conflict to remain interested." please. give me a little more credit than that.<br /><br />overall, 2 thumbs down :-(
