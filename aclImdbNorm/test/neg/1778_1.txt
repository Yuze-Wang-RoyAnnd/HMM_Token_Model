at the very beginning, the look at a control panel that reads "8 miles of the cost of california", and no, i didn't misspell that, they really did not realize the put of the cost instead of off the coast. these people must have been morons.<br /><br />it's good if you're into terrible movies, but the sheer fact they couldn't catch a simple spelling issue make me believe they really didn't put any effort into creating the movie whatsoever. the navy uniforms are not correct at all in any manner whatsoever.<br /><br />wow, completely ridiculous, but good if you are looking for something insanely stupid to watch. how these folks made any money off this is beyond me.
