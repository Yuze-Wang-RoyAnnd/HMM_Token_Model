ed (kel mitchell) is a teenager who lives for his job at good burger, a small but friendly neighborhood hamburger stand, while his buddy dexter (kennan thompson) also works there, but lack ed's single-minded devotion to his job he's there because he accidentally destroyed the car of his teacher mr. wheat (sinbad) and has to raise money to pay the damages. when mondo burger, a mammoth fast-foot chain, opens across the street, it looks like good burger is history, until ed formulates a secret sauce that brings hundreds of new customers to their door. however, the monomaniacal manager of mondo burger, kurt (jan schweiterman), is determined to get his hands on the sauce and put good burger out of business. meanwhile, ed and dexter must rescue otis (abe vigoda), the world's oldest fast food employee, from the demented hills asylum, and ed might just find love with monique (shar jackson) if he could take his mind off the burgers long enough to pay attention to her. good burger is a comedy directed for kids, decent story, acting, and overall a pretty harmless kids movie.
