dr. markoff is a mad scientist who is experimenting , trying to find a cure for a viral cause of acromegaly. when he attends a piano concert, he is stricken by the beautiful daughter of the pianist and sets out to woo her. but when she wants nothing to do with him, he infects her father with the acromegaly virus in an attempt to extort money and his daughter in exchange for a cure.<br /><br />that is the basic premise for this b-grade low budget thriller. i have to say i was underwhelmed by this movie. not that it was terrible-it wasn't, but there was nothing particularly noteworthy about it either. it was entertaining enough for a viewing but is not one that will stay in my memory.<br /><br />the dialog is a bit corny at times and the acting is just mediocre. the story is fairly predictable and doesn't really give us anything new. of course, i can't complain too much about a movie that has a guy in a gorilla suit who serves almost no real purpose and a doctor with a svengali-like stare that fails to mesmerize his victims.<br /><br />it may be worth a watch if you like this sort of movie, but don't go into it with too many expectations.
