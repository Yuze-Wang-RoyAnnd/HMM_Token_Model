-spoilers------------ i am a fan of 60's-70's french cinema but not necessarily of the more modern,so to be honest i watched this because of bellucci.she is very young here,extremely beautiful and on top of this supposedly this movie is where they met with cassel,so it gives it some extra importance.<br /><br />the movie begins with a very nice style reminiscent of depalma.then suddenly we are thrown to flashback,and the back and forth goes on which gets tiring.i don't mind one flash back,but do it and get it over with man!!!anyway,the movie is still interesting to me until a point when the first and definite hole in the plot,that allows for the rest of the story,never lets me enjoy the rest.i can allow for little holes here and there,but not to base an entire plot on hot air.this is the story of a man who is literally searching for an old flame.this is the main plot.i will go along,when the story at some point will convince me that there are really mysterious things going on,but in this story there's nothing really mysterious.bellucci-cassel are a couple ,then bellucci urgently has to leave for some job in italy(not the farthest place on earth from paris)and she leaves him a message,which for reasons later explained he doesn't get.ok,so what?don't these people have phones?supposedly she was away for 2months(not a century exactly) and wouldn't she call her boyfriend in paris to see how he's doing? of course not.instead,even after she gets back she forgets all about him.and thats fine,but later in the movie she tells her friend that it was her greatest love and was ready to commit for the first time in her life.yet she failed to give him a call for 2months and then never tried to get back with him.and what about cassel's character?he was supposedly unable to locate her in italy,really hard to find someone in italy,its probably like siberia,especially an actress who is probably listed even in the arts papers.and after 2months when she would be back,really hard to find her and ask for an explanation. one thinks she wanted to avoid him,but no,we find out they simply couldn't meet.so hard to meet in paris. ok,i don't need to go further,because this is the incident where the entire movie is based. what is even worse,bellucci is not really the star of this movie but this other girl bohringer is.
