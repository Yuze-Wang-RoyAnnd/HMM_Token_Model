first, i want to clear a common misconception: it is not unrealistic that the school zoey goes to gives students laptops. at my school, those in grade 7 and higher must have apple macbooks (this is payed for in the entrance fee). moving on. this show is very annoying. it has boring, predictable plots and bad acting. often in the show it brings "girl power" to a new high, with girls beating guys in everything they try. but that is not the worst. the worst is that girls are nevertheless all portrayed as being focused on their personal appearances, and screaming whenever they are happy. except for the one smart girl, who is portrayed as a freak who is obsessed with ugly boys and science. however, this show is very addictive. i do not know why, but it is. although, the most recent season has been so terrible, bringing the stereotypes, boring plots, and bad acting to extremes i never thought were reachable, so i am no longer addicted, thankfully.
