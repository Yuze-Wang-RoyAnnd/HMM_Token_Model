its a space flick, or at least i think it is. you got half-naked female prisoners in a space prison and a monster on a space station using a virus to infect humanity through sexy encounters. its friggin hilarious. the acting is so bad that space nuts looks like an emmy award winning film. the story is simple. space prisoner gets chance to reduce sentence by investigating a space station that lost contact with humanity. she finds a doctor "experimenting" with women and a angry of alien. she fights them, so on and so forth. its a movie worth seeing it just to wet your pants with laughter. if you like real sci-fi flicks its a no-no but its a great mood setter for the amateur film maker because i can guarantee their film is better than this.
