i admit it now. this is one of the lamest films ever made. but, in mr sjogrens defense, the "not really"-scene wasn't all bad! <br /><br />and you gotta love the effort of going all the way to sweden just to find a sweet swedish 15 year old blonde, have her speak swedish posing as the jewish mother of henry (dennis hopper). <br /><br />what makes this scene so perfect is that henrys father answers the blonde swedish-speaking(jewish?) girl in german... <br /><br />the best actor/actress of all in the film must be the nun who takes care of henrys mother, this is a woman who has had no experience whatsoever of acting, but still puts in the most convincing performance of all!<br /><br />all and all, this flick is nostalgia for me personally, it is after all what gave me a posting on imdb:s database. :d<br /><br />//feelin like a movie-star*
