the film-makers went well out of their way to find only the following demographics: palestinians that have the appearance of peace-loving, solution-seeking good will, palestinians (particularly older women and families with children) who are especially inconvenienced by the security fence, and israelis that don't believe in the security fence, sympathize heavily with its alleged effect on palestinians, and consider it unnecessarily divisive and/or a waste of money. oh yes, they do put in one member of the israeli government that does support the fence, but they do what they can to portray him as inhumane and uncaring, and ask him very leading questions that are really statements (e.g. "the wall is bad for the environment...it is destroying everything").<br /><br />i have no problem with any (well, most) of this being presented in the movie. however much i may disagree with the people they interview, their opinions are valid enough for a documentary. however: there are at least two sides to the issue of israel's security fence, and despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of israelis (and many others) support the construction of the fence and believe it is having an overall positive influence, this "documentary" does not present the opinion of even one such person. they even go so far as to interview an israeli jew who claims that "all israelis support the fence" and are thus insane, and then stubbornly refuse to interview even one such "crazy" israeli. oh, and to top all this off, they set the tone for the film by interviewing a couple of young israeli children (truly exceptions to the rule -- i've been there) that are laughing at/about their arab neighbors from across the fence.<br /><br />a "documentary" is a film that explores an issue and presents a full array of facts, opinions, and perspectives. unfortunately, this is not a documentary. this is an unabashed propaganda film that very clearly, very pointedly offers a battery of support for only one side of a heavily disputed, emotionally and politically charged issue. it is no more of a documentary than, say, fahrenheit 9/11.
