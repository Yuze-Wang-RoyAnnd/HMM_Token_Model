carlos is perhaps not the most original comic, but the first series was amusing, his forthright comments and observations were fresh. i missed a couple of seasons, but after all of the allegations of stealing material i caught a couple of episodes of the mind of mencia at the end of july 07. a bit of a change i see! carlos is much more into toilet humor and sex jokes than the race observations. in one episode he sort of implied he was in the same league as chris rock and dave chappelle. i think not. perhaps comedy central will give him one more season, but episodes i saw sounded tired and samey with more words beeped out than the osbournes. carlos, go back to stand-up for a couple of years, get some fresh material and try again.
