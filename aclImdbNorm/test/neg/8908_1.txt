what a crap that movie is. the script is simply non existent. the movie at times seems like a music video. but it cannot even be that since the soundtrack does not really match. pathetic way of combining action and rap. one might think it being a recipe for a successful flick... here it fails miserably. dialogues in this flick just killed me. the scene when harlan is interrogated by some policeman is merely pitiful. generally speaking, recent seagals films are hardly watchable. what the hell happened to the guy? i know he's old but can't he get "hollywood" to drop him a decent script or something? is he running out of dough for his escapades to india that he takes on anything they serve him?
