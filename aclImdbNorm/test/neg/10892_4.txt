as horror films go, "rest stop", could have been better in many levels. director/writer john shiban shows he probably had the best intentions when he started it. unfortunately, either he was not sure as to what to do with the material, or maybe, he was under pressure to deliver a different movie from what he intended, either by the studio, or the backers. several endings have been included in the dvd, but unfortunately, the one chosen for the finished product is probably not the best.<br /><br />the idea of a psycho roaming the back roads of a remote part of california presents many possibilities at first. after the disappearance of jess in the spooky rest stop, things get out of hand. poor nicole is left alone to fend for herself all the weirdos she finds along the way.<br /><br />it was clear when one started to hear "amazing grace" in the background that there were forces trying to avenge the ways in which nicole an jess desecrate their neck of the woods by engaging in careless sex that is not well appreciated by the natives.<br /><br />watch it at your own risk. there's a lot of gore for the aficionados of the genre.
