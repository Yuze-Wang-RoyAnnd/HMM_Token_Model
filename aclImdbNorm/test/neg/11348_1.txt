i just finished watching one episode(s1-#5 a boy in a bush), so maybe my review is not very fair.<br /><br />but based on that episode, this is a very poor version of csi, the acting is crap. the main character, dr whatever her name is, is so fake it actually hurts. i wouldn't cast her to do an add for dog food!<br /><br />the other hurtful thing is david boreanaz of the "angel" fame, a good actor, does a great job, but wasted coz of the idiotic acting of that woman.<br /><br />supporting cast is ok, but all is ruined due to this stupid acting of emily deschanel .<br /><br />very disappointing version of csi, very sorry to see it appear on the filmography of some of the potential talents involved in it.<br /><br />that woman is really sh#t, at least in that episode. but based on this one view, i will not even invest watching it even if it was shown on an elevator screen.
