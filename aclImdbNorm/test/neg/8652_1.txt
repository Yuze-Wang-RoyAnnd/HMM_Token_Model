oh my god, why, did i waste my precious time on this film? it is pathetic, waaaay ott and unrealistic, and one of the worst films i have ever seen in my life. yes, my life. i am embarrassed for yash raj films, the poor guys have to live with the horrible news that yes, they produced this terrible film.<br /><br />this is by far, the most, trashy, sexual, eyebrow-raising movie i have ever seen by yash raj films. i cringe for them, i really do. along with the terrible acting (or no acting, for that matter) by uday chopra, combined with the lack of talent of the "look at my boobs" tanisha, neal 'n' nikki has not one good thing about it at all. even the music is not upto the standard left by yrf. the director, arjun sablok, did an embarrassingly bad job here.<br /><br />honestly, i expected more. much, much more.
