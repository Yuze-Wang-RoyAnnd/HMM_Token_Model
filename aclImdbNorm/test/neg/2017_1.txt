this might quite possibly be the worst movie i have ever seen. i knew it was a b-movie before watching it (it was actually the reason for watching it), but i'd never thought it could be this bad. the title promises dracula in space and does deliver, however, the story makes no real use of the fact that casper van dien's character is a descendant of van helsing. and watch out for the ending of the movie, it comes at you fast. i've never seen an ending scream out "and now we're over budget!" in a clearer fashion. their resolution of the movie was rather comic though, the story had so obviously painted itself into a corner. if you feel you have to see it, watch it with a friend who shares your love of b-movies. if i hadn't, i wouldn't have made it to the end.
