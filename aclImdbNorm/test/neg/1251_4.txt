stu ungar is considered by many to be the greatest poker / gin player of all time - an extraordinary self-destructive force of nature - tiny in stature, but a huge heart for the game.<br /><br />what we have here is a kind of hallmark film about the dangers of gambling. sure, he wins, he loses, he blows it all on sex, drugs, and more gambling we get it, but where is the real play - where is what made him the greatest card player of all time.<br /><br />much too flat, and frankly boring in places, this gets a four because we get to learn something about stu the man, but stu the card player, nada.<br /><br />nicely shot and presented up to a point this is the perfect example of how not to make a film about cards: honestly, espn's coverage of the world series is more watchable than this.<br /><br />a waste of a great chance.
