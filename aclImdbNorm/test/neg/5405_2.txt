the scientist charles and his wife (or assistant) marissa receive some objects and a skull from an ancient indian cemetery, and while cleaning a vase, they are attacked and murdered by a mysterious being, the skeleton man. then, a military squad commanded by captain leary (michael rooker) seeks out two groups of four soldiers each that vanished in the jungle. they face the skeleton man, shooting him while he kills each soldier. then the skeleton man goes to a power plant, and captain leary explodes the facility destroying the supernatural being.<br /><br />i bought "skeleton man" on dvd expecting to see a funny trash, but i found an awfully boring, annoying and senseless crap, with shoots and explosions. the imbecile story is totally disconnected and does not make any sense, and the military team is composed of imbeciles, insisting in shooting the supernatural skeleton man until they are totally slaughtered. their leader is also the most stupid, with the blow-up of an entire facility in the end to destroy the supernatural rip-off of the extraterrestrial warrior predator. on dvd, it is possible to use the fast forward button along the movie and reduce the suffering of the viewer. my vote is two.<br /><br />title (brazil): "skeleton man"
