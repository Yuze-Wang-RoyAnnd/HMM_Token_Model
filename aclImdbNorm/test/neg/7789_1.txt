this was only the second version of the classic story by charles dickens i had seen, and sadly it turned out to be one of the worst. the film opens with a quick live action piece where simon callow as charles dickens begins the story of a christmas carol, and then obviously it goes to animated story itself. you probably already know it, ebenezer scrooge is the grouchy cold-blooded businessman who refuses charity and hates christmas. he is visited by jacob marley (nicolas cage) who warns him of the visits of the other three ghosts of christmas past (jane horrocks), present (sir michael gambon) and the silent future/yet to come. after all this he obviously realises the true magic of christmas, and promises to be nicer in future. the only changes i noticed to the story were scrooge having mice as friends (a stupid idea), scrooge's ex-love belle (kate winslet) needing to see him to help at the orphanage, the ghost of christmas present showing the two kids, "want" and "ignorance", scrooge still gets haunted after being turned nice, and he's worried he can't keep his promise to stay nice. also starring rhys ifans as bob cratchit, juliet stevenson as mrs. cratchit, iain jones as scrooge's nephew fred and colin mcfarlane as fezziwig. the animation is not great quality, the actors have wasted their voices for a worthless piece of garbage. the only good thing that comes from this film is the good voice of kate winslet, singing the closing song "what if", as for the rest, it is just excruciatingly awful. very poor!
