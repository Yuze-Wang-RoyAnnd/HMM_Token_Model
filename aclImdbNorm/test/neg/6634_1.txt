first and foremost this movie has the stupidest plot of any movie i have ever seen, and unfortunately i had to see this one. i was flipping through channels one day and stumbled upon this lousy excuse for a movie, and it confirmed what i have been saying for a long time. carrot top is not an actor, and is not funny in the slightest sense. he acts like he's a great comedian and thinks he commands the audiences attention. frankly he has the acting ability of a 10 year old class clown, scratch that less than a 10 year old's ability to compare them to carrot top would be a grave insult upon their good name. this movie tries to be funny using dull one liners which all seem to have been lifted from 50's cartoons. by the end i would have done anything to erase my memory of this movie, but sadly the memories stay with me. the only thing i can do is to warn others to never to watch this movie. however it proves the rumors true carrot top can't act worth a damn.
