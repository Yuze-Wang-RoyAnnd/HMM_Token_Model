there are many distinct problems with the movie "killshot". for one, there are way too many coincidences. the husband is a hunter and just happens to be hunting on the day that the main killer shows up, with someone the killer knows. okay i will take that one. the kid calls the real estate agency that the wife works for and asks for money to be ready when he comes to get it. okay, i will take that one as well. before he goes to get the cash he decided to rob our killer, who doesn't kill him but decided to go with him on the job. it's starting to get real weak. then they show up, on the same day that the husband has an interview with his wives boss. no one is there but the wife and the husband who has decided to make his way into the empty office. they make their way into the office and the professional killer just assumes that they are talking to the right guy. that is just in the first 15 minuets.<br /><br />there are a lot more holes in this movie then i care to talk about. why the killer didn't just kill everyone at the real estate agency i don't know. why he didn't shoot the woman on her porch, i don't know. why he kept letting that dumb kid make all those stupid moves and mess a whole lot of crap up, i don't know. why the girlfriend was even in the movie, i don't know. why he decided not to pocket the gun and just leave it out on the counter, i don't know. why they even went into the witness protection program, i don't know. what i do know is that the casting director did a great job, the director of photography did very good work, the location scout picked great locations, and the production designer was worth every penny. so my advice for anyone that is going to pick a script that is going to be so well worked by the crew, make sure that every attempt to kill someone by the hit man is not foiled by a peak through an open window.
