rented this from my local blockbuster under the title speck - that may be the way to look for it if you still feel the need to see it after this review.<br /><br />it's a movie about the serial killer richard speck, who killed several nurses in chicago in the sixties. watching the movie, one gets the feeling that it follows the crimes to the letter. unfortunately, that doesn't make for a good movie.<br /><br />another problem i had was the near-constant music letting us know that this was a scary movie, and some god-awful narration letting us know what's motivating speck. the acting was average for this type of film; to give credit where credit is due, the movie is very beautifully photographed for my taste. your mileage may vary.<br /><br />over all, if you're interested in the subject matter, it may be worth your time.
