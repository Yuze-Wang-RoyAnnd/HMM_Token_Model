this movie was disappointing for at least one of two reasons. the suspense created disappeared because of horrible acting or lack of direction from the director.. i don't know.. it was like a tasty bubble gum that seemed to run out of flavor yet you continue to chew on it because it once tasted great. like most thrillers the hitchhiker had promise yet failed to deliver when it had me bright eyed and ready to turn the volume down(i was watching the movie alone.. in the dark) this so called thriller simply came apart like it was made of lego transforming into something else. it simply ran out of gas and left me staring at a made-for-tv-like style movie with one exception.. it was probably rated-r.
