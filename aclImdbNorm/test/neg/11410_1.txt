i've seen this movie about 6 or 7 times, and it truly gets funnier every time. perhaps what i enjoy most is the tired character paradigms that the movie offers us: the somber all-american male protagonist, his blonde girlfriend, the theater nerd with glasses, a brunette girl, the antagonistic jock, and brunette girl #2. however, we're then presented with two magician martial arts experts with mullets driving a convertible. if anyone can explain that, please contact me. among other highlights are bobby johnston's portrayal of the jock character, dell, and his trademark line, "that's why i keep her around." in watching johnston's performance, it comes as no surprise that his career quickly descended into the realm of soft-core porn. (spoiler) also, after multiple viewings, i still have absolutely no idea what that big demon at the end says at any point; it's just electronically muffled noises. oh well, that's probably for the better. and lastly, why are all the demons so slippery? is wet skin scarier? it certainly didn't help in this film.
