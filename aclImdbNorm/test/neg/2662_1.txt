did you ever see the film "marathon man"? the part with the dentist? i would rather have that happen to me than to sit through "random hearts" again. it wasn't simply uninteresting, or uneventful-- it was horribly, painfully, and agonizingly boring. at one point, i momentarily lost conciousness. to the average layman, i may have appeared to be sleeping, but the other movie patrons knowingly realized i actually blacked out from the bordom. i thought i was going to die. when the film finally ended (i think it was twelve hours long, but i'm not sure), i let out an exhasperated "thank you jesus, it's over!!", to which all other movie goers cheered. if i had to listen to harrison ford drone on one more second in that monotoned whine, i would have been forced to search for something sharp to jam in my eye to divert my attention. this is 136 minutes of my life i will never get back.
