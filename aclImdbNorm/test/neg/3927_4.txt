i preface by stating i am a big fan of jjl and not one of patrick. therefore i watched this to see her performance and of course, it was excellent. i do not feel the director was adequate for the film as several very bad choices were made re: shot angles, blocking, etc. if the director was trying to give it a "realistic" feel, they failed and lost some good performances because of it. nearly always felt that the camera was way too static, too far from intense facial reactions -- and so many times when the action depended on the intimacy of lead characters, the dialog was slow and plodding. this easily could have been resolved by cutaways or changes of camera angle. but the impression i got was that the budget was too small and only one camera was used! i also got the impression that perhaps scenes were shot multiple times and the energy coming from the actors was... used up.
