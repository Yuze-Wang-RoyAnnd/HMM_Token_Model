one of the dumbest movies in the history of cinema. wait, i take that back-- this movie can't be included in any category related to "cinema"; it belongs in categories like "waste", turds, or similar categories. ironically, it's even _about_ two garbagemen. the movie is "men at work", a lightweight crime comedy starring the estevez (sheen) brothers from 1990. setting aside the asinine and implausible plot line, bad acting, bad dialogue, poorly executed stunts and slapstick, continuity errors, and high rate of no-name actors never to be seen again, all in all it was a pretty bad movie anyway (at its core, i mean). it was the kind of movie that might be good for one thing: you can watch it about 200 times, learn every line, and in a campy kind of way repeat them back and forth in public with your *wasted* friends, thus securing your status as the biggest dorks in your tenth grade class.<br /><br />to make matters worse, i actually submitted an imdb trivia entry (along with this bad review) to the movie's imdb web page, if only because i spotted a silly little punk music joke that apparently nobody else spotted yet(about the butthole surfer statue). i'm so conflicted about why i should even *waste* my time submitting what looks like a supportive trivia note, when what i really want to do is blow up emilio's acting career (no, wait, he's already done that himself. thanks, dude!) i'm so glad i *wasted* only time on this, not real money. for that matter, can i maybe have at least one tenth of their budget? anyone other than this director (emilio) could have made two or three much better movies with just what they spent blowing up cars, carefully placing bikini-clad bimbos in the background, and beating up useless extras (henchmen) in haz-mat suits. i'd mention emilio's writing credit, but it would be a stretch to call this screenplay "writing" -- it's more like crayon-scrawled cartoon ideas. and charlie sheen, if you're reading this, i assume m.a.w. must have been made during the part of your career in which you were a coked-up, hooker-loving hollywood brat who had not grown up yet. (oops! sorry, i guess that part of your life isn't over yet. get well soon, you "half a man". such a promising talent, so *wasted*
