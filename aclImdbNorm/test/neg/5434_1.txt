i love bad movies: showgirls, plan 9 from outerspace, so on. and this movie fits right in. don't believe anyone who tells you this is good film. it's downright awful. tim curry's accent moves from german to portuguese to hungarian. there's a person in a gorilla suit who is supposed to be able to communicate using a glove that interprets the ape's sign language. there is a scene with a killer hippo that moves around a river like a great white shark. there are people hopping up and down mt. kilimanjaro as if there were escalators installed on it. this thing is laughably ridiculous. so ridiculous i was rolling on the floor. it is totally implausible. i loved every minute of it.
