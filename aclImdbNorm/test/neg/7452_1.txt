i have seen this movie several times, it sure is one of the cheapest action flicks of the eighties. so, i think many viewers would definitely change the channel when they come across this one. but, if you are into great trash, "dragon hunt" is made for you. the main characters (the mcnamara twins) are sporting great moustaches and look so ridiculous in their camouflage dresses. one of the best scenes is when one of then gets shot in the leg and is still kicking his enemies into nirvana. this movie is really awful, but then again, it is a great party tape!
