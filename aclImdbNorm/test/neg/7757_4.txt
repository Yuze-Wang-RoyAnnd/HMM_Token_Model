from what i understand, mr. bava abandoned this project before completion...and rightfully so!!! if i were him i definitely would have made sure that every copy was burned and if anybody in the future ever asked me about this film...it never happened & it never existed...end of story.<br /><br />despite some great sets and good photography this is one horrible film...is it supposed to be scary? (not in the least) is it supposed to be funny?? (puh-leese) a total waste of time...and i really don't like to have to say that!!
