this movie is truly unbelievable, in every sense of the word. i couldn't believe what i was seeing, and hearing, and i didn't believe it anyhow. hepburn is probably my favorite actress, but this was ridiculous. being a hillbilly myself, i know what it should sound like, and it's not kate's back bay accent. the only thing i found funnier was the fact that the guy who played charlie chan so many times, sydney toler, was cast as another one of the hillbillies, with accent to match. maybe this was a practical joke, come to think of it. i can think of no other reason for such peculiar casting. well, maybe this. i noticed that natalie schaefer, lovey howell on gilligan's island, appeared in this play on broadway. can you imagine what part she might have played?
