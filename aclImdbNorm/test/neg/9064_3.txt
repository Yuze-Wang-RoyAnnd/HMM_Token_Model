honestly - this short film sucks. the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience. the unearthed dvd is crisp and clear and i haven't made up my mind if this helps or hinders it. if the film was a little grainy it might have added some "creepiness factor" to what was going on. i have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter - but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like nekromantik and visitor q among others, are more shocking than in aftermath. all this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull****. this is an expensive, beautifully filmed turd. it's not that shocking, it's not that disgusting. if you insist on viewing it - rent it. i give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia (there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos ;) - the filming is good and it does have some "gore" (if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore...) but other than that - absolutely nothing going for this over-hyped mess. on the other hand - genesis - cerda's "sequel" to aftermath (now available as a "double feature" released by unearthed films) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film, really showing what a good director cerda really is when given the right material. although i don't care for aftermath at all, genesis is so well made that i will forgive cerda and definitely keep an eye out for him in the future...
