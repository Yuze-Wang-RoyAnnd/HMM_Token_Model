this movie is the last straw in a list of films i have seen this week that have pushed me over the edge and forced me to join imdb and spread some warning to the public. it was absolutely horrible. the film was drawn out and painfully boring. the sound, effects, and even picture quality seemed like they came from willow (1988) or maybe even conan the barbarian (1982). the battle of bannockburn was absolutely absurd. this "largest filmed reconstruction of medieval battle ever staged in the british isles" made me snicker. there wasn't even a coherent formation at all, just a few guys with spears and horses running right through them. the scenes of douglas, especially in the last battle, were simply horrible, as was most of the acting in the film.
