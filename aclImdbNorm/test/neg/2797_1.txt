pardon my spelling. this is probably the funniest horror movie that ever existed. think evil dead * 1000. the acting is horrible, you can see the makeup line on a certain lady's face. there is a lesbian scene, which makes no sense at-all. and the ending, haha ohhhh the ending... be prepared to have your stomach hurting from laughter. now if you watch this film for more then 5 minutes and are still expecting something, take a look at your self, and ask what the hell is wrong with you. this is a very bad movie, meant to laugh at and enjoy for its pure silliness.<br /><br />don't forget to watch all the outtakes after the movie, you can see just how low budget the whole thing really was. all in all this movie is a rare gem in demonstrating the pure and udder lack of talent/care/ability/money/ and anything else you would ever need to make a successful film. but its definitely worth watching.
