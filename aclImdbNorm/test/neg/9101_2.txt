this film tries very hard to be an "action" film, but it fails miserably.<br /><br />steve guttenberg plays the head of an elite counter-terrorist team that fails (?) in attempt to keep a mysterious group from stealing a deadly nerve agent.<br /><br />the story...the acting...the special effects...all fall flat!!!<br /><br />definitely a must avoid!!!!
