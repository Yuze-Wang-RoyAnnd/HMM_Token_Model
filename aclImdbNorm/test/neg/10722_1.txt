part of the movie's low rating is the emphasis on unemployment and the suffering we have to endure. while this is good for drama, in comedy, we know the pains it need not be emphasized. as a result fun with dick and jane is not an appropriate title and i was just plain disappointed failing to see any fun with dick and jane. it is true that this is a copy from the movie of the same name, but it fails on the execution and the title was not appropriate for the story line.<br /><br />however, if the movie was retitled to be "the art of the steal" and the emphasis on bungling slapstick comedy more takes on the robbery and the plans to steal (stupidly of course) would have given the movie a major boost. while, at the same time the movie should show the ceo at least in the beginning to be a crook, so it will be easier to project the pains to someone responsible early on and just leave it at that. the movie suffers a viewpoint issue and with that in mind, a comedy cannot work if the viewpoint is not done properly. a scheming husband character who is that of a wile e. coyote on the road runner would be more funny, including the slapstick comedy. but in this case, a steal instead of the capture of the bird with complicate contraptions would be extremely funny here. i mean you can make many of these and put them in the movie. but since the viewpoint was done wrongly, the robbery part had to be limited.<br /><br />you will enjoy the movie the first 15 minutes (during jim carrey's great rise), but to make the problems they had to faced to be more comical since it is a comedy, that is the part that needs a major overhaul. it can be funnier, if problems were faced more like john travolta's civil action during the downfall. that movie was a serious one but the problems they faced were somewhat comical.
