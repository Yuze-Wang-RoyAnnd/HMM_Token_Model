this horror tale takes place in the namib desert of africa. a canadian systems analyst, zach straker(scott bairstow)is sent on an assignment for a diamond mining company. although he hates field work, he finds himself in a truck with a rescue unit in the open desert fighting sand flies and whipping, blowing sand. four diamond prospectors are found...well whats left of their scattered bones are discovered. during a long cold desert night a shape-shifting monster makes its appearance. zach and his colleagues are terrified when their truck is stranded and members of the unit are dying horribly one by one. there is no character development; let alone dialogue to speak of. the desert set in its own way is beautiful and without giving anything away... the creature is as old as the desert sands. also in the cast are: rachel shelley, warrick grier and patrick shai.
