hmmm! is it worst film ever? well sort of, for some of the cast its a shame to see them in such a film but hey if it pays the bills why not, as for the film well. ok cg effects not to bad for such a cheap film ,music is just about ok again for a cheap film, end credits are ok lol<br /><br />bad to many to list but, cast, acting, sets, script, ending..what the hell ,drac..........worst drac ever!, many more but can not be bothered to put them all down.<br /><br />idea was ok but needed ten times the budget and more thought and much better lighting and style and change all bad points, i do say however to see this film so you to can say"what the fu%$ was that all about"as the credits run.also its kind of a must see just to see how bad it is.
