this film could have been a decent re-make, and gosh knows it tried (or ms. english tried). assembling talented actors together with a successful & experienced writer/director should be a formula for a decent film. but ms. english's experience - according to her imdb bio - is exclusively limited to television work, and it is glaringly obvious throughout this film.<br /><br />i am surprised that none of the reviews i have read mention what i found most unlikeable about this film, and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential: it looked and felt like it was made for television. to give some credit to ms. english, many of the jokes that simply did not work on a movie screen would have been terrific on tv (and maybe a laugh track would have helped). so much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on tv but looked awkward or odd on a big screen. if the whole film had been chopped up into a mini-series or a sit-com, i think it could have worked. but this is cinema and sadly ms. english's talents didn't translate. i cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors & the writers that i felt like i came out of the theater half shriveled! meg ryan is her usual perky, cute self (except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face), but where did she have a chance to use her talent?! she has made films where she doesn't recreate her stereo-typed role and done them well... but not here. annette bening seemed to simply go through the motions - such a great talent and yet such a poor performance! i enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance, and it was sad to see. what worked in this film in the 1930s doesn't translate to the 2000s, and no one helped ms. english get the changes & updates or subtleties right. if only she (as writer, director and producer) had reached out for some assistance, i think it could have been good. but it was not.<br /><br />it's so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and come away feeling it was a waste of everyone's time & money! this new yorker cartoon i saw yesterday is appropriate: a few movie execs are having a meeting & the caption reads: "let's remake a classic with worse everything!"
