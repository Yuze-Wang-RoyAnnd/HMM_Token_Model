jackie chan movies are typical examples of how offer is bigger than demand.well,to be honest,which demand?in this one jackie chan is whatever his name is in this one,i doubt if he even knows,and he is some kind of race car driver.well,he drives 10 miles an hour and then the footage is sped up,that way i can do all the stunts myself as well.during the great finale,in which jackie chan wants to arrest the bad guy by beating him in a race,we finally get to see how shoddy this production really is.chan's fighting,especially in the casino scene is decent,but when we're talking about special effects,dear lord.and must everyone crash in this race?that's just stupid.and here it's really not safe for the drivers,there's not even a concrete wall in the neighborhood.and don't get me started on what kind of awful story this has,i mean,it's hongkong,it was probably written at gun point by eight-year-olds,but still,what a mess.i like chan as much as the next guy,perhaps more since i saw "rush hour",but his agent's retarded cousin really needs to pick his projects better.
