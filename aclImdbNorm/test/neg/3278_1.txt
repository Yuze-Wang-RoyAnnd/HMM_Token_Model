1 bolo yeung is in the movie ten minutes altogether including when he's serving iced drinks to his boss. 2 a lot of street thugs looking like junkyard keepers get instantly overpowered by the asian superhero who talks like an illegal alien just out of the back of a manure truck. 3 (thug) let this to me -shirt off, gay model like muscles- heee-haaw! hee-heeew! hap hap! - he's dead on the floor with his neck, elbow, chin or balls broken - 4 cheap semi-sex scenes where the white broad come out of nowhere digs the asian superhero. 5 norton (former c action movies star ) does nothing but pose as an eccentric trendy weapon smuggler who traffics white slutty girls hand picked at a night club where they willingly follow some idiot posing as a millionaire snapping at them ( you reap what you sow ) 6 yes, the local police captain is involved and yes, the first butchered cop is the former patrol teammate of the super-hero ( yaawn! ). 7 action scenes are fake, like a) hee-haw! chinese tries some spinning kick b) skinny leg of chinese to the throat of negro thug c) finishing death move to his head too much like walker texas ranger fake action 8 end titles finally<br /><br />utter rubbish. those people are good enough only to be stand ins or body doubles in other c movies and be credited at most collectively as "stunt crew provided by the county prison ".
