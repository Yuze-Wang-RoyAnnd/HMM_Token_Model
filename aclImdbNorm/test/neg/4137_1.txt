a holiday on a boat, a married couple, an angry waiter and a shipwreck is the reason to this films beginning.<br /><br />i like boobs. no question about that. but when the main character allies with whoever happens to have the most fish at the moment, mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim, my anger just rises to a whole new level. take two guys (a husband and another man), put a pure bombshell woman in the middle of them, ad a deserted island, subtract all her moral issues, ad a whole bunch of moral issues to the men and mix it in a big bowl of arguments, fish and a zippo lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this. <br /><br />the acting is, i would say, good. there are some bloopers but not many as far as i could see. the main female character makes me sick. this is due to her lack of moral values. the man with the most fish get's her attention. even though one of them is her husband, she sees no problem with being unfaithful with (manuel) the other man because "i must do it to survive". how can you justify having sex with another man for fish when your husband is 30feet away? and he won't even benefit from it? the female character has absolutely no problems to justify anything that she does. if she doesen't get approval for her actions, she's a victim.<br /><br />i recommend everyone to see this movie. this is the kind of movie that will make just about everything else you see this year a pleasant movie experience.
