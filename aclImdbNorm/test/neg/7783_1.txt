i couldn't wait for the end. this is absolutely the worst film i have ever seen. if you thought that just about anyone could make a watchable movie, these folks prove that there is a minimum skill set required. this is a film with no redeeming features whatsoever. it scores a zero in every department. this is more than just 'amateur' as the audience is given no consideration or regard at all. there is no serious attempt to act or entertain. the storyline is aimless, pointless and senseless. the cast look very uncomfortable and completely lack direction. the technical aspects of the film are poor.<br /><br />as a dvd it makes a good drinks coaster.
