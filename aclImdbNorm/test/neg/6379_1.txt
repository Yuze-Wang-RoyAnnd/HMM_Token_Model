i have tried watching this show on several different occasions and each time found it to be utterly pale of humor.<br /><br />the reason, to mention one thing, is that it is solely based on ridiculing anything the republicans have done. in short it is basically democratic party political opinions touted as humor.<br /><br />all mr. stewart does is wisecrack about anything the republicans have done and the audience wets themselves in gales of forced laughter.<br /><br />my guess is that the left is so devoid of any real substance that they have to define themselves in terms of how much they all hate republicans.<br /><br />-ld<br /><br />_____________________________<br /><br />my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
