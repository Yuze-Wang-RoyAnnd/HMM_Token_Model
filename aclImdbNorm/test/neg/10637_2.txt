when i first saw this movie in the theater i was so angry. it completely blew in my opinion. i didn't see it for a decade then decided what the hell, let's see. i'm watching all hellraiser movies now to see where it went wrong. my guess is it was with sequel 5 that was the first to implement the whole "i am in a dream omg i see weird stuff, oh noes what is happening, oh its a dream, oh its not a dream, oh wait i see something spooky, oh never mind"-sucky storyline. those sequels don't even require the box to be opened, or stick to the rules from the first 4 movies that if you saw pinhead you are pretty much screwed and dead. the first 3 hellraisers sticked to this storyline which made it so scary in the first place. nothing fantasy, nothing weird, the box got opened boom they came. kirstey was the only one that could bargain her way out of it, first because of uncle frank. then because she had information about the cenobites. this movie at least attempts to stick to all that, even though it was a bad story it was still somewhat hellraiser. no i'm pretty sure part 5 was the first part to completely and utterly destroy the hellraiser series. now they are remaking 1, and i don't even think i will watch it. oh who am i kidding i probably will and probably will be disappointed.... again.
