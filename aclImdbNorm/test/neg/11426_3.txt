because i would have never ever seen this movie through to the end. although there are some, but not many, funny moments in this movie i couldn't understand more than about 15%(the fancy english couple in the 3rd story included) of what people were saying. three short stories, none with a real point, with just some of the most miserable and lifeless people i could have imagined and a load of foul language. didn't find it funny, didn't find it amusing, didn't find any sense in it. 4/10
