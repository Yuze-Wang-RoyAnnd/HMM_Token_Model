perhaps if only to laugh at the way my favorite of jane austen's works has been portrayed. perhaps i am too severe on this adaptation, but i'm afraid i am biased to the a&e version. i have a hard time imagining mr. darcy portrayed by anyone other than colin firth.<br /><br />the characters seemed shallow, and often dialogue forced. lizzy seemed to lack the real feeling that is so evident in the book. her fancy for wickham was overplayed, and then her sudden like for darcy was not believable.<br /><br />darcy was portrayed tolerably well, i will grant him. he managed to maintain the aloofness that is required, but i felt he did not project the feeling and inner struggle that makes his character so delightful, especially in the proposal scene.<br /><br />mr. and mrs. bennet were also played well, but seemed lacking in many ways. the mean temper of mrs. bennet was not completely captured in her performance.<br /><br />mr. collins' was a good portrayal. very much in line with the book.<br /><br />i will refrain from commenting on lady catherine except to say that she is possibly the worst portrayal in the entire film.<br /><br />other problems i saw were the few liberties they took with the order of events such as darcy being present at the first meeting with lady c., and also that miss lucas and sir william did not join lizzy on her visit to the collins'.<br /><br />the choreography was dreadful during the dancing scenes. the scene where lizzy and darcy dance loses much of its intensity because one cannot get past the feeling that they look akward on the ballroom floor. at least this bbc version left out the dialogue between lizzy, darcy and sir william when he commends the two on their dancing, as they performed very ill indeed.<br /><br />there were occasional moments that it kept me interested, but overall i find this version to be a disappointment. i would not advise this film unless you're like me, and you are excessively diverted by such follies.<br /><br />
