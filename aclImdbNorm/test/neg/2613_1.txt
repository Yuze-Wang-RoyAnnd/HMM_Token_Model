you know, i'm sure the boys were sitting around the office one day and said, "how can we make more money?" they had made every possible variant of toy they could make with their current characters. so they decide, let's steal the star wars idea, a prequel, and we can make up all new characters, and sell them as toys. incidently something they did in puppet master 3, but who cares? anyway they pick a point in time before the first movie when toulon is still alive, he and the puppets are sitting around, and a wooden head roll on the floor and the puppets want to know if that is a dead family member or something, it doesn't matter. so the tale of the puppet master ancestry begins. it's long, it's boring, no body cares.<br /><br />the funniest part is, they tell the origin of these new characters in the movie, but give no clues of their fate. so guess what, once the revenue from the new toys pays off, they can fundsa new (and 4th straight rotten) sequel, called "puppet master 8 the sequel to the prequel of the fate of the dead retro puppets!" hold your breath!
