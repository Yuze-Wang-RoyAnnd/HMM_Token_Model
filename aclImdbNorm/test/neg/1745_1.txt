if this is what's best in the finnish cinema at the moment, i'd say those big tax euros spent at supporting "culture" have gone to waste here in a horrible way. paha maa is the worst kind of example of trying to make a finnish "european film" for big audiences. i'm sure they wanted it to be all state-of-the-art, smart and touching at the same time. the result is crap.<br /><br />to make it short: - the story is pretentious, na"ive and not credible. the same goes for the characters. i can imagine them brainstorming about making a film where "everything would, like, turn to ***t and people would be hurt and feel, you know, really bad inside, because finnish people are so notoriously depressed, too, and their self-esteem is so bad", which brings us to the fact that...<br /><br />- the film is loaded with clich'es, mostly about "the finnish mentality". the way the it deals with people's problems and their causes could be straight out of a regular women's magazine or a cheap bull-psychology-self-help book. ("we feel so bad inside!") i'm sure they watched some kaurism"aki, too, to find out what it is about his films that people like, misunderstood him completely, and came up with a boring, depressing story about people going through all kinds of s**t for no other artistic purpose than perhaps social pornography. it's a crying shame they threw in tolstoy here. it's just a sign of trying to be smart. and of not being.<br /><br />- i think the worst fault, however, is the complete lack of vision and depth. the film is highly unoriginal. it is also frustrating to watch endless sulking and suffering without any real revelation brought to it. i can go through this kind of mind**ck if the film is funny or ends up being an elaborate joke, or better yet, something sublime like in e.g. von trier's breaking the waves. there was none these in paha maa. actually though, i did start laughing at some point because the turn of events was again just too predictable, over-the-top and incredible.<br /><br />who does this crap? and who likes it? i hope they're pretending.
