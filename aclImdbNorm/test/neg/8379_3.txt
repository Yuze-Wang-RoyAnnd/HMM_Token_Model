the two most noteworthy things about "i won't play" are: it won an academy award as the best two-reel short film of 1944; and it was directed by silent-era leading man crane wilbur. the plot of this run-of-the-mill short is inconsequential, the dialogue lacks spark, while the acting is no better and no worse than that found in most war-themed hollywood movies of the 1940s (in other words, it's awful). admittedly, there are moments when "i won't play" is funny -- janis paige's totally artificial look and line delivery are precious -- but one laughs at the picture, not with it.
