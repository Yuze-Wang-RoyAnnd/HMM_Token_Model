i'm guessing that the folks talking up this drivel are cronies of the director or something. this is bad, and not in the michael jackson song kind of way. to compare the pacing of this movie to the progress of a snail would be to insult the snail. this movie limps along for what seems like an eternity, all to introduce us to some un-scary zombie kids with silly makeup and some sort of vendetta, or thirst for blood, or whatever. believe me, you won't care. the thought alone that mom would move her two daughters into this dilapidated and filthy home is absurd. and worse, i found myself simply not caring. backstory about the zombie kids? snore. endangerment of mom and/or daughters? don't care.<br /><br />in short, wow was this dull. don't bother.
