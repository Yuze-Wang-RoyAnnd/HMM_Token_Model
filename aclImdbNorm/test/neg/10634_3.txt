great subject matter, director, and cast somehow adds up to a truly abysmal film, told in that flat, semi-documentary style that was so popular around the time this film was made. (and hello, this is not a film-noir!) the lackluster, overly complicated, over-populated story has no arc, no focus point, little excitement, and staggers from one scene to the next with no discernible purpose, other than as a valentine to the supposed and highly doubtful cooperation between the american and mexican governments on the issue of illegal immigration. <br /><br />the scene that made me hate this film is when montalban and mitchell make a daring escape from their captors, race to presumably save montalban's injured partner from being murdered by a goon with a gun driving a piece of farm machinery, montalban says something like, "quick - we must try to save him," but instead of doing so they lie on their stomachs and watch in agony for about 5 (!) minutes of screen time as the machine bears down on murphy and finally runs him over (or so we assume - the machine simply stops, another goon detects the presence of the two "rescuers" and shoots at them as they run off again.) scene over. the whole thing is so horribly filmed and utterly anticlimatic. there's nothing worse than a protagonist (ostensibly, montalban, though he's off screen for over half the film) who doesn't even try. jeez, ricardo, do something!<br /><br />i know it's anthony mann, but hell, not all of his films are classics, people. how bad does an old movie have to be around here to get anything lower than a 6 rating?
