a true gothic horror trash classic!<br /><br />uhm, actually, it's a horrible movie. best thing about it: rosalba neri's erected naked nipples. intensely suckable material.<br /><br />oh sure, rosalba neri is one fine lady. never even heard of her before this flick, but she is a damn fine looking lady. but honestly, it were her nipples that did it for me, in that very last scene, before the movie abruptly ends, all naked and erected... total dream-nipples, man. okay, sorry, getting a little carried away here...<br /><br />basically, i got what i expected from lady frankenstein: it's a sleazy and horrible flick with a big stupid, ugly-looking frankenstein monster and a couple of naked tits. and it's got a castle in it. so i wasn't really disappointed or anything. it just dragged too much in certain places (the first resurrection of the creature kept on going for ages, with daddy frankenstein just experimenting, talking, trying some more). there was one fun, imbecilic homage to the original frankenstein, though: instead of throwing a little girl into a lake, here mongoloid franky picked up a naked chick and threw her in a river. had me laughing.<br /><br />some friends of mine raved just a tad bit too much about this flick, though. had me maybe expecting a bit too much. but rosalba's erected nipples sure were worth it... (aw crap, i really need to stop mentioning her nipples). i think i'll just end this user-comment now.
