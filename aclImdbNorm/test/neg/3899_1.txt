i know jesse franco is responsible for a wide variety of films, and i mainly go for his horror films, as lousy as they are at times. i guess it was morbid curiousity that drew me to this, and i wasn't even curious enough to finish it. maybe it got better towards the end but unless you're into lesbian sex scenes (of which there's plenty) then you may want to take a pass. so what exactly can you say about a movie that features a woman that pees in a bowl on the kitchen counter (while standing up)? just never you mind what that's used for later, you probably don't want to know. if this sounds intriguing to you, then that's your problem but then again you might just like this movie. i myself, am no prude, i've seen plenty of disgusting movies in my day but at least they were done well, and this isn't. sometimes too much is just too much. bleah.
