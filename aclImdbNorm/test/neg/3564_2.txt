a depressed creepy teenager does many bad things to a socially active older lady who does not like to use shades or drapes in her windows. he steels assorted things from her, peeps at her, does prank calls, and plays assorted unpleasant tricks on her. oddly, he keeps none of this a secret from her. at first, she does not seem to care one way or the other that he is bothering her. then later she seems to begin to respect him for his cruel fevered activities.<br /><br />there are some illogical items to note. one is that the guy peeps into the night through a pane of glass from the more brightly lit side. in real life such a thing would not happen. the more brightly lit side of a pane of glass acts as a mirror. he would be able to see exactly nothing. also, everyone out in the night would be able to look inside at him sitting in his well lit room.<br /><br />one other illogical item is that the creepy teen takes a job as a milkman, and his one and only customer each morning seems to be the lady he is picking on. easy work, if you can get it.<br /><br />i saw a short film about love at a public showing. by the end, there was not a single open eye in the house. a short film about love is the foreign language movie for those who do not like reading subtitles. not only are there very few words spoken in the film, but much of the movie is silent. a certain rest in peace.
