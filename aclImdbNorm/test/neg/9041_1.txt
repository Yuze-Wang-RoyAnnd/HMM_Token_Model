***spoilers*** this movie - called eaten alive here in the uk is quite possibly the worst film ever made and is brilliant just for that. a sexy rich girl teams up with a rugged action man to search for her sister in the new guinea jungle. what follows is an unspeakably crap mixture of cannibalism, insane cults and religious maniacs that has to be seen to be believed. the cannibalism scenes are quite horrific but are so badly staged and acted that they prove quite amusing. the cast are awful except for janet agren as the female lead who is excellent. look out for the scene where she is stripped naked and covered with gold paint! my rating - 1 out of 10.
