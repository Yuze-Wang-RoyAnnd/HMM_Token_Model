countenance! antoine monot, in a copycat impersonation of kevin smith's silent bob, keeps asking for it, but writer/director christian z"ubert never listens. z"ubert just can't say no to a joke, no matter how cheap. the best thing about this movie is its soundtrack. of course, joey burns of calexico and the divine jonathan richman, understated old-school bard of "there's something about mary" fame, would grace any small-town dropout story. in visual allure, stefan (lukas gregorowicz) looks cool enough riding his tan six-series bmw two-door, wearing aviator shades, going nowhere. true, he *accidentally* sleeps with his wild-eyed bohemian kid sister (marie zielcke), but then, who wouldn't? thumbs up also to how he goes black-and-white on a liberal dose of that mysterious substance they call zero-zero, but if you're looking for a slightly more serious rendering of what intoxication can do to you, i suggest you check out "fear and loathing in las vegas".
