so this guy goes into a psychiatrist's office for his first appointment. after the paperwork is done, the psychiatrist says "i'm going to show you ink blots. tell me what you see in them." "well, says the patient," looking at the first one, "i see a man and a woman having sex." on seeing the second one, he says "i see two women having sex." on seeing the third, he says "i see two men having sex." on seeing the next one, he says "i see two men and two women having sex." the psychiatrist puts down the the inkblots. "so," he says, "we'll start by discussing your monomania." "my monomania?" says the guy. "and you with all these dirty pictures!" that's how this movie strikes me.
