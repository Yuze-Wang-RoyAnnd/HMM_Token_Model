if i could rate it a zero i would , coming from someone who likes shock/exploitation films of the time and waters overall i must say this is useless.<br /><br />it does nothing , serves nothing , an idiot with a camera and a urge to prove his cleverness by rebeling against social standards is all this comes off as.<br /><br />its entirely amateur , both in principle and execution , it doesn't have a point , its digusting for the sake of disgusting ,obscene with the wit of a neanderthal , its useless.<br /><br />someone said waters was probably "chuckling" over all the bad press and disgust others gave with this film , but why? if i made a short film depicting a man in a bathroom taking a sh*t for ten minutes straight surely it would receive the same accomidations but why would i be proud or "chuckle" at that? <br /><br />would it be because i am so unintelligent that i have to resort to this so i can say "ha! take that censors and mainstream! im so rebellious ill do whatever i want and film it!" no.<br /><br />waters shouldn't be proud of this mess , fans of waters shouldn't watch it , its useless , that is , without any use.<br /><br />its doesn't even fit under the criteria of art for arts sake.<br /><br />to like or defend this movie is to defend something that was designed purposely as being anti-culture to be pushed for the mainstream audience , in modern terms this film is the hot topic of films.<br /><br />useless and obsolete. a poser film that demands it be acknowledged as rebellion .
