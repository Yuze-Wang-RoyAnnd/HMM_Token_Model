the camals are coming is a rather disappointing british comedy from 1934. i purchased this because i like desert adventures and states on the box that it is a drama. it certainly isn't.<br /><br />it is about a couple who head for egypt to capture some desert drug smugglers.<br /><br />this would have been much better if it had been done as a drama instead of a comedy, which lets it down a lot. it is quite silly in parts. depsite this, there are some good action and location scenes.<br /><br />the cast is lead by jack hulbert with anna lee as the love interest.<br /><br />one viewing is enough for this movie. overall, a disappointment.<br /><br />rating: 2 stars out of 5.
