the movie starts in mexico where a girl has been cursed, she spits on snakes thru green jello and her friend tries all these crazy spells to lift the curse. he does nothing but chant horrible language that does nothing, so they decide to cross the border get on the train to make their way to l.a. to see his uncle to lift the curse. comic hilarity ensues. this movie has the same snakes over and over! it has garden snakes and pythons that will never bite. they all make the sound of rattlesnakes which makes no sense. the whole movie has some funny lines, some weak effects, but most important a great ending that leaves you like wham bam what the heck just happened!!!!! the whole movie is about a 1, but the ending is a 10, so by my crazy math it gets a 3 overall. when blockbuster has nothing else you want, grab this for mindless entertainment!
