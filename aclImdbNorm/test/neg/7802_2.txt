while the twilight zone was a wonderful show, it was also very uneven--with some great episodes, some lousy ones and many in between. don't believe the die-hard fans--there were some stinkers and this was definitely one of them.<br /><br />in a plot that is obviously meant to be an attack on fidel castro, a near lookalike (peter falk in lots of makeup and a beard) obtains a magic mirror that allows him to realize who all his enemies are so he can liquidate them. while i do believe that castro is a thug and dictator (and tens of thousands of refugees and political prisoners will attest to this), it's amazing how this sort of preachy episode actually makes audiences laugh at the american efforts to marginalize the creep and actually makes castro seem okay!! think about it--serling and company wanted to hurt castro but instead only seemed to be obvious, preachy and silly in the process.<br /><br />it's indeed bad--almost laughably bad when seen today.
