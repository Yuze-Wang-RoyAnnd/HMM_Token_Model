this is wes craven at his worst! this is the very worst horror, if you can call it horror, you will ever watch, esp from one of the masters of horror wes craven, poor direction, poor acting, poor set, poor atmosphere makes this the biggest pile of rubbish ever! the bad guy is totally unconvincing, you couldn't even feel sorry for the guy! the gore, and horror involved in the film is laughable, it's just plain rubbish! the only good points i can think of is, it stars natasha gregson wagner, giovanni ribisi, and lance henriksen, but not even that cast, could stop this from spiralling out of control, and into one of the worst horrors ever. if you still ain't watch it yet, don't bother, you'll only hate it.
