i was totally disgusted with this unnecessary sequel to "the poseidon adventure" a movie which i have given a great comment about.<br /><br />this film is unbelievable from the word go! i agree, why were no other rescues boats around and helicopters? the one that rescued the original survivors had just flown over the boat that michael caine & sally field are on. that was the only rescue crew? hard to believe.<br /><br />the acting is generally poor and the show looks cheap. i really hated the waste of talent from some good actors.<br /><br />don't watch this film unless you must catch sally & michael as lovers.<br /><br />gord
