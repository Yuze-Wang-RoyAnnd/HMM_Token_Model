this movie isn't worth going to the theaters to watch, i did and i didn't like it, the effects on the movie are really well done, and you get a laugh here and there, but the story is really bad, it seemed like they had run out of ideas, and what is that of loki and odin getting along? that totally destroys norse mythology, and i guess they forgot that loki's powers only worked during the night!! if you really must see this movie rent it when it comes out, don't go to the movies for this!<br /><br />they could have done a lot more with this than they did, it felt like they just wanted to do a movie to show off cool animation and effects
