i am a big fan of "auntie mame" with rosalind russell. she really was the perfect actress to play that character.<br /><br />i've heard angela lansbury was very good on stage in "mame" but it's hard to imagine anyone topping rosalind russell.<br /><br />lucy was such a great comedienne that her comic bits salvaged her performance in this movie where i think she was miscast really, they should have dubbed her singing voice - hearing these songs sung at a faster tempo and with strong voices really changes the whole effect. <br /><br />i just saw the stage revival in washington d.c. and i think christine baranski was very good as mame, harriet harris - the nasty chain smoking agent on frasier - played vera and she was particularly good.<br /><br />both would be good casting for a tv movie of this show. maybe if that production makes it to broadway they'll consider filming it.<br /><br />also i think tracy ullman would be good as agnes.
