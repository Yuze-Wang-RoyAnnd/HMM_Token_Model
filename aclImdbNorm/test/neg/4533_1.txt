poorly directed short "film" (shot on hi-def or betacam it appears). it screams student film/video all the way. the premise is limited in scope and the short actually feels a lot longer than it runs. some interesting acting moments and some decent production value, but not enough to lift this film from "the hole" it has fallen into.
