cronica de un desayuno combines the worst defects of mexican cinema, a rare feat nowadays.<br /><br />it's pretentious: it wants us to believe that it is deep, only because some scene is out-of-focus, another is pseudo-surreal, yet another plays with the eisenstein-infante-caifanes tradition of laughing-crying faces, the edition is fragmented, and it is all so solemn.<br /><br />it has a weak script: the main story hardly develops, so it has other three smaller, needless stories, stuck into it. they are only good to make the film last longer.<br /><br />most of the acting is bad. a true feat, baring in mind that many of the best known mexican actors were cast.<br /><br />there is an abuse of unnecesary foul language. to the point that the character of paloma, who symbolizes the dreams of freedom of a child, uses it throughly.<br /><br />it is homophobic. the character played by eduardo palomo is the sorriest, and most punished, representation of a transexual i have ever seen.<br /><br />it is very boring. i ended up envying the people that left the theater before the end of the film.<br /><br />whatever it tries, it has been done better, in mexico and elsewhere.<br /><br />in other words: "para partirte la madre, nada como una mala pel'icula"
