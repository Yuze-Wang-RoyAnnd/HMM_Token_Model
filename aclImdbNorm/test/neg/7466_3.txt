antonio margheriti, director of the enjoyably cheesy cult horror cannibal apocalypse, helms this gothic-flavoured giallo starring gap-toothed 70s icon jane birkin (as well as her massive-conked french lover of the day, serge gainsbourg).<br /><br />unfortunately, despite the inclusion of such treats as a tasty bi-sexual french teacher and a terribly unrealistic killer orangutan, seven deaths in the cat's eye ends up a dreary mess which is a struggle to endure.<br /><br />pretty schoolgirl corringa (birkin) returns to her family's scottish estate after many years away, only to discover that a maniac is murdering her relatives one by one. using the whole array of 'spooky old house' tricks (hidden doorways, dark corridors, creepy graveyards, candlelit cobweb covered rooms), margheriti cobbles together a confusing tale which at times promises supernatural goings-on, but ends up with a lame cop-out ending that is unimaginative in the extreme.<br /><br />'and where exactly does the cat fit in to all of this?', i hear you ask. well, a rather pudgy moggy witnesses each murder thus justifying margheriti's rather cool sounding title.<br /><br />'gory, stylish fun' claims the dvd cover; 'boring pile of dung' says i.
