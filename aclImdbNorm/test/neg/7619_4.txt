i saw this movie for the first time on nbc friday 11-29-02. it was a pretty good movie, but i don't think it would be the kind of muppet movie jim henson would make. i mean first of all, pepe' using the word "sexy" every now and then, and pepe saying "it would suck?" and i defenitly know jim henson wouldn't allow kermit yelling "i wish i'd never been born!" thirteen time a minute. this movie just isn't like a classic muppet movie. sure i can understand nicky holiday stealing the baseball diamond from "the great muppet caper," but a business lady cheating the muppets in a contract for their theater to turn it into a smoker's nightclub. if jim henson was here today, he would hate this movie!
