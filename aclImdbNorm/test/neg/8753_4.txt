yes,the movie is not a piece of art but the first time i watched it i was 10 years old,my parents were out and i stayed home with my two brothers.it was may 1970(i know that because i found a note about the cycle of horror movies that one network had).it's one of the most vivid memories i have with the guys.we ended all in one bed and covered up to the head! our very first horror movie! we kept talking about it for years and laughing about the moment.those were horror movies.nowadays horror movies are always the same.or was it better when we were kids enjoying without analyzing the plot and the cast and the dialogs? most sure it was that.but for me this is a great movie!
