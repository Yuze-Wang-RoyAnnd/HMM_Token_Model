the quickie (1 outta 5 stars)<br /><br />pretty poor movie... an old-as-the-hills story about a high-ranking gangster who wants to quit, passing on his empire to his inept son. of course, it's not going to be easy for someone in that line or work to just quit... so a contract is put out on his life. after throwing a big party an exterminator (jennifer jason leigh, who i guess is *never* going to act in anything other than tv movies or low budget direct-to-video trash ever again) is called to the scene. our "hero" makes a pass at her... offering her big money for a "quickie"... she turns down his offer, even though she needs the money... but winds up staying overnight anyway... even after being brutally harassed by the overzealous son who thinks she was sent to kill his father. ugh. the story just goes on and on... you can see every "twist" and "turn" coming a mile away. weird soundtrack by some group called "the tiger lillies" will drive most people nuts... but i thought there was one kind of cool track towards the end. or maybe i was just excited because i could tell that the movie was almost over? jennifer, jennifer, jennifer... what the hell happened to you?
