i honestly thought this movie was going to be cheesy, even though i've liked alvin and the chipmunks for a long time! i was was very wrong. it was great!!! it has been the best movie i have seen since october! in my opinion, it's the movie everyone should see this holiday season! enchanted (i thought anyway...)was awful, the golden compass was alright, but the ending was pretty crappy to his dark materials fans, and i am legend, well i haven't seen that yet (or national treasures 2) but it looks alright.<br /><br />i'm not about to give anything away, but this movie is great for anyone, especially kids!
