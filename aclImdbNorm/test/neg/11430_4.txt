irvine welsh's follow up to trainspotting hits the screen as three short stories set in edinburgh, all with a few of welsh's trade marks, drug culture, depression, the working class and hibernian football club. uneasy to watch in places, it is no less than very well written, 2 of the stories having a darkly comic twist to them while the 2nd story a serious (and shockingly realistic) plot to it. will not appeal to most, including myself to a point, but will no doubt adopt a cult following.
