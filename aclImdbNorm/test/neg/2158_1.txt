i cannot see how anyone can say that this was a real good entertaining movie. with a few well known actors i found it hard to believe that this was only made in 2005. it's crap! the acting is tantamount to amateur dramatics, poor amateur dramatics. unless you want to laugh loudly at an amazing 100 minutes of pure corn, don't bother to download it or rent it, worst that i have seen in years. it's from the bygone days of acting, where cowboys are shooting 8 bullets from the six-shooters. the more well known the actor, the worse they were, drury was just sad. i was extremely disappointed with lee majors, has he actually stooped to this sort of garbage? it was bad enough when he played the six million dollar man.
