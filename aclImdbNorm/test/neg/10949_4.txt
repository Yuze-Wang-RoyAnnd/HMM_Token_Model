the concept: show 4 families of diverse ethnicities in the fairfax district of l.a. preparing for the family get-together at thanksgiving. i loved soul food and how to make an american quilt {i think there's a law that alfre woodard has to be in all these movies) which similarly offered a pastiche of family traditions, and was prepared for a treat. instead, i felt tricked. they trot out about 40+ characters, and all but two are one-note cliches with no finesse whatsoever. the writers and director should spend a few more years learning about life and learn how loving people of different generations actually do relate. instead, you have a bunch of a**holes getting together on turkey day to act like extra-obnoxious a**holes. now, to an extent, this is what thanksgiving is all about. but, not this misguidedly. and why bother having julianne marguiles, then giving her absolutely nothing to do. this was a chore to get through, and mercedes ruehl is a standout, but i give it a 4/10.
