dire! dismal! awful! laughable! disappointing!<br /><br />right, your trapped in "the cave" with several "hard" men and a woman or two, your being systematically killed by "something" and you still don't get to hear any naughty grown up words!!! a 15 cert' here in england, and you could tell!<br /><br />the egos of the "macho men" was just too much, pass the bucket i'm going to be sick.<br /><br />this movie should never be exposed to daylight and ironically, be kept in the darkest, deepest hole in the ground and be forgotten forever. i have a feeling that this description isn't the first time to pop its his head from a hole in the ground.<br /><br />just like the film the cube, it looked like a good concept but was just let down at the last post by, well its self.<br /><br />this comment contains spoilers alright, its called the cave.<br /><br />thanks bruce.
