this movie and several other movies from the 1950s with a religious overtone, such as the robe, quo vadis, and samson and delilah, unfortunately depict all pagans or anybody who isn't a jew or christian as morally depraved and decadent. the focus is only on biblical-related stories that ignore the world outside the bible. as far as they are concerned, nothing good came from pagan egypt, greece or rome.<br /><br />any movie that preaches about the "one true god" gives a short shift to freedom of religion. the movies ignore the fact that ancient judea's lack of religious freedom made it a fertile ground for religious extremism. most 1950s religious movies also overlook the loss of freedom the occurred after christians assumed political power in the 4th century.
