seriously... i'm amazed at all the good feedback this show has here. all we have in this show is two stupid kids who keep doing an annoying laugh and they do occasional funny things only in like... 2 of the shows, while most of the others sucked... as then they comment on music videos which i cannot stand personally while they either love or like.<br /><br />in most episodes, the only things you will hear are the repitive "let's go score with some chicks", or "i'll kick your ass beavis", or the better yet and usually used quote "that was cool", and above all, their annoying laugh.<br /><br />if you want a good animated show, try the simpsons, ren and stimpy, south park, this show is just not worth the time or energy it takes to watch this awful mtv series truthfully.
