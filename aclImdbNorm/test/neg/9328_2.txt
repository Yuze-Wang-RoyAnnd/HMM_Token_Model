well, after seeing "beginning" i thought why the hell they burned schraders version and did that poor one. but now, after seeing "dominion" i deeply understand this decision. even they got it not much better.<br /><br />sorry, but this movie is really crap. some good moments, but a really boring story-telling and some major plot-holes are killing this movie.<br /><br />i thing the exorcist-story has a lot and in a prequel on this you can built on a lot and give references the audience will like to see. but there is so much little of it in the movie. the effects are really bad - not even tv-standard.
