i laughed at the movie! the script, the acting please don't we deserve better? but now the filming, some of the camera angles were interesting. i did enjoy the film, but it's not to be taken seriously though. i liked it. if it had a new cast and scriptwritter it would be better than all right. it's worth a look!
