i believe that this was supposed to be shocking or something.... all that i can say is....poor goat!!! this flick is so poorly done that the parts that "should" shock and revolt you come across as laughable at best. the characters are so lame and 2....wait....1 dimensional, that i applauded each sick death.....all except that poor goat.<br /><br />
