i was expecting a documentary covering the 1950 to 1965 era of sci-fi and received a big ol' commercial laced with leftist political innuendo by james cameron and movie mogul baby boomer's pushing the own works. 'watch the skies' has in the past referred to the 'giant bug' and 'space exploration' movies from the 1950's including such favorites as "earth vs. the flying saucers, "thing from another world" and "forbidden planet" as well as "them", "deadly mantis" and "tarantula". there are lower budget examples that rarely get mentioned like "space monster", "12 to the moon" and "cosmic man". <br /><br />this would have been a much better documentary had the few remaining actors, directors, stunt men and collectors plus the non-hollywood 'boomer's from the era been interviewed. i only wish there was a "0" rating available since a "1" is much to generous.
