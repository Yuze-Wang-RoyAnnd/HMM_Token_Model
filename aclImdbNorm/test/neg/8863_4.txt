this can hardly be called a good movie, actually it's not even close. but i have to say, that there was a few things that made me... not laugh, not giggle, but something like that. the resovoir dogs parody was one of them. the rest are not important enough to be remembered.<br /><br />to be honest, i was a little disappointed by this movie. the plot sounded like an idea, but it quickly fell to the ground. the whole thing was just to messy and the actors where not good for the characters; most of them simply overacted. there was also a whole lot of unessecary sequences, that was a total waste of film. i do realize that it would make the movie about 20 min shorter, but it would only make it better.<br /><br />now, with the good and the bad things lined up, let's go to the conclusion: two out of six toilet seats up for this one.
