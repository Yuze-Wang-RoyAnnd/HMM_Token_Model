after sitting through the trainwreck that was the first dark harvest movie, i couldn't leave bad enough alone. upon seeing that there was a sequel (or rather what i believed to be a sequel)i had to increase my pain level. seeing that this had nothing to do with dark harvest, that should have been a good thing. we didn't get any killer scarecrows in this one, instead we got a jackass walking around a cornfield screaming out little things like, "girls!" and "can you hear me?" every so often. plus we got two (four if you include the two girls that the director wanted the same effect as the twins in the shining) obnoxious little girls who couldn't act. and the cherry on top of this mess would have to be the corn cop. i should have known this movie was going to be terrible when the dog got an opening credit. how i managed to stay awake through this movie, i'll never know.
