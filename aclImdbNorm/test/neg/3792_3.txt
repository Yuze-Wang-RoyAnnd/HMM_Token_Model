this is a movie with an excellent concept for a story but that got sidetracked but a large number of clich'ed sub-plots, hackneyed and unrealistic portrayed characterizations and performances, and some frankly implausible (and highly coincidental and, not to mention, convenient as plot points to move the story to its inexorable finish).<br /><br />the lack of anything that marked the lead as actually gay, other than some coincidental references to crow bar or that he's gay, was troubling. it wouldn't have hurt to actually show him do something, even if it was just meet a friend for drinks.<br /><br />it's worth checking out and has it's merits. there isn't much, even now a few years after the movie was released, in the way of movies that feature both a lead that is gay, or a significant gay plot line, and that is also about african-americans. for that, it's worth checking out. i wouldn't look too hard for it and i wouldn't waste my time looking for it to own. this is a rental, and not a premium rental at that.
