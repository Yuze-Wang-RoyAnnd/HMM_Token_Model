let me see...i've seen every film lou ferrigno has made. i've seen batman & robin...twice. i've memorized the dances in breakin' 2: electric boogaloo...i've watched unfinished blade runner rip-off student films...yet this film is the most painful thing i've ever seen.<br /><br />this was the first movie for the "straight to video market." so you can thank blood cult for all of those mysterious michael dudikoff films at your local blockbuster. you should know that this isn't even high quality video. this is consumer grade. this is you father's video camera he never uses. this is what you have to look at for 90 minutes.<br /><br />i won't bore you with plot details since i'm getting sleepy just thinking about it, but i will tell you that watching this movie is a form of torture. i only watch this movie when i am angry at myself. so i recommend this film if you are suicidal, or if you are up for a mighty challenge.<br /><br />if you happen to rent this film (god have mercy) you will know what you are in for from the first 10 minutes. this is when you are hit by the usual horror film intro. you know the drill. there's a lot of suspense and build up before some girl dies. yes, you've seen it before, but not like this. this is the most boring intro i've ever seen. i honestly believe that you could get a camera off ebay for ten dollars, grab the bum that most smells like gin and candy, and tell him to film your mom cooking dinner and it would be more interesting than this intro. it bored me to tears. i cried like a baby.<br /><br />another one of the things that makes this film so unbelievably painful is its actors. yes, i've seen bad acting. trust me. i've seen 4th grade productions of oliver twist with more realistic dialog. the lead actor makes me ill. the "supporting" actress is a train-wreck of a human.<br /><br />i will not even comment on the boyfriend. true horror.<br /><br />so, rent this movie if you can find it. you'll never be more depressed that you spent 3 dollars on anything else.
