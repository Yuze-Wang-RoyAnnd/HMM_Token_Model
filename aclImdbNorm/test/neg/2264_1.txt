as an avid gone with the wind fan, i was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters. luckily, the film on its own was a wonderful piece. when the book scarlett came out, i read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together. while the book lacks any true quality, it remains a good story, and, as long as i was able to separate it from the original, was and still is enjoyable. however, i consider the six hours i spent watching the "scarlett" miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life. discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in margaret mitchell's book, this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape, mistrust, murder, and misformed relationships that even the book scarlett stayed away from. the casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film, and even carried through in the second book, and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character. in the novel, scarlett o'hara butler follows her estranged husband rhett butler to charleston under the guise of visiting extended family. after coming to an "arrangement" with rhett, she agrees to leave, and proceeds to reconnect with her o'hara relatives in savannah. eventually, she accompanies her cousin colum, a passionate leader of the fenian brotherhood, to ireland, to further explore her family's "roots that go deep," and is eventually named "the o'hara," the head of the family. while her duties as the o'hara keep her engaged in her town of ballyhara, scarlett ventures out into the world of the english landowners, and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties. she, having been scorned by rhett time and time again, eventually agrees to marry luke, the earl of fenton, until rhett comes along in a clich'ed "night-on-white-horse" - type of a rescue. the "scarlett" miniseries fails even to do this justice. raped by her fianc'e and scorned by her family, the series shows scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed.<br /><br />i heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision.
