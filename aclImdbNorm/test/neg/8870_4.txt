police officer michael (tomas arana, "the church") has his hands full while investigating a serial killer who's been leaving parts of the bodies of the people that he's been murdering at the house of one recently widowed, tracy (joanna pacula). mike has to find a way to stop the bodies from piling up, while perhaps finding love in the process.<br /><br />a feeling of the 'giallo' films of yore pervades this film, even though we know who the killer is from the get-go, and the film contains a few good set-pieces (a scene later in the film set in a school for the blind being particularly memorable), but it doesn't make all that much sense when all is said and done either. all in all, not nearly as good as bava's earlier "macabre" nor his first two "demons" films, but enjoyable enough if you can forgive the rather outrageous plot twists towards the end of the film. a pity the image entertainment dvd lacked extras of any kind, as i would have been interested in some.<br /><br />my grade: c-
