ok, so this is horror? i get horror - but i don't get horrific. black & white is artistic but too much black is overkill.....enough said about the lighting. the story - a serial killer ....... lot's of these around. it's been done in the past and yes, it will continue to be done.....but i hope not. my question is , when will the audience tire of reliving this maddening dilemma? i guess the director thought he would do something different - portray killing children. well that's been done before too. so i guess he had to go to shock value.....have them killed in the darkest of fashions. okay ..... the audience was shocked......sickened....disgusted.....numbed. and getting up out of my seat , i felt all of these things. so was the director successful? yes! absolutely! these are the things he wanted me to feel and i did. now what do i do with the feelings? and more importantly, what is the "message" here? with the amazing talent that francis xavier was "gifted" with.....could he ever consider applying it to making films that speak of, dare i say, coming out of the darkness? i was left in the dark after viewing this film, my soul was assaulted....is that what this craft is about? there are many such films out there - they make the bucks i'm told. so what's up with the people that want to see all these deploring visuals? what is going on in this world that people will pay to be horrifically shocked? would i see this again.....not ever.
