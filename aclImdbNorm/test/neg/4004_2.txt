this film is bundled along with "gli fumavano le colt... lo chiamavano camposanto" and both films leave a lot to be desired in the way of their dvd prints. first, both films are very dark--occasionally making it hard to see exactly what's happening. second, neither film has subtitles and you are forced to watch a dubbed film--though "il prezzo del potere" does seem to have a better dub. personally, i always prefer subtitles but for the non-purists out there this isn't a problem. these dvd problems, however, are not the fault of the original film makers--just the indifferent package being marketed four decades later.<br /><br />as for the film, it's about the assassination of president garfield. this is a major problem, as van johnson looks about as much like garfield as judy garland. in no way whatsoever does he look like garfield. he's missing the beard, has the wrong hair color and style and is just not even close in any way (trust me on this, i am an american history teacher and we are paid to know these sort of things!). the real life garfield was a civil war general and looked like the guys on the smith brothers cough drop boxes. plus, using some other actor to provide the voice for johnson in the dubbing is just surreal. never before or since has van johnson sounded quite so macho!! he was a fine actor...but certainly not a convincing general or macho president.<br /><br />in addition to the stupid casting, president garfield's death was in no way like this film. it's obvious that the film makers are actually cashing in on the crazy speculation about conspiracies concerning the death of jfk, not garfield. garfield was shot in washington, dc (not dallas) by a lone gunman with severe mental problems--not a group of men with rifles. however, according to most experts, what actually killed garfield (over two months later) were incompetent doctors--who probed and probed and probed to retrieve a bullet (to no avail) and never bothered cleaning their hands or implements in the process. in other words, like george washington (who was basically killed by repeated bloodletting when suffering with pneumonia) he died due to malpractice. in the movie they got nothing right whatsoever...other than indeed president garfield was shot.<br /><br />because the film bears almost no similarity to real history, it's like a history lesson as taught from someone from another planet or someone with a severe brain injury. why not also include ninjas, fighting robots and the greek gods while you're at it?!?! aside from some decent acting and production values, because the script is utter cow crap, i don't recommend anyone watch it. it's just a complete and utter mess.
