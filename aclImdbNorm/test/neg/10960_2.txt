i'm no director or writer or anything related to a movie. but watching more than 1 movie everyday has given me the idea of what is a good movie or not. so here it is: the quick and the undead is a rip-off of the quick and the dead. i was thinking that it could be a little bit of a parody of a cool movie with lots of starts in it. but oh no, i was really in for an very big disappointment.<br /><br />to put it simply the movie sucks. i'm a big fan of gore movies but this one just gives you gore here and there but they are not that consistent.<br /><br />but i have to give them credit in creating gruesome characters which has given me a little bit of squirm.<br /><br />if you're a big fan of zombies, watch this. if you're not...better look for other rob zombie films.
