it is unfortunate that between this film, in the valley of elah, lions for lambs, and home of the brave seem to all be based upon common stereotypes about veterans from the wars in iraq and afghanistan. the boozing, the fighting, the short-fuses, the broken marriages, guys freaking out and digging a foxhole in their front yard when they're drunk, etc etc etc.<br /><br />does it happen - yes, but not as often as one would think after having watched any of these movies. i think that it is unfortunate that these directors/producers/writers choose to grind their axe against the political establishment by portraying soldiers in such an atypical way. in this particular film, kimberly peirce didn't even throw us a bone, like showing the new children that were born while a family member was deployed, or the kid who grew up in some ghetto who can now afford college thanks to the gi bill, or the couple who can afford a house, or start a new business, earn their citizenship, etc etc etc. instead, we are treated to the stereotypes because the people who made this film only want to show you the bad side.<br /><br />a couple of issues with the film itself: 1) somebody screwed up by putting phillippe in for a bronze star with v after he led his squad down a tight alleyway after having been baited by a gunman in a taxi. pretty stupid, but yes, it happens. 2) the humvees didn't have any turret armor, so we are supposed to believe it is a near the beginning of the war, yet every soldier and their brother has an acog and every possible attachment for their m4? sorry, don't think so 3) timothy olyphant as a lieutenant colonel? it's hard to believe, but i just checked an he turned 40 in may, so the timing isn't too off. 4) he strikes two soldiers to escape being sent to jail after saying that he wouldn't return to iraq (upon having learned that he had been stop-lossed). so he's a fugitive. then, when he finally turns himself in at the end, and they take him back, he keeps his rank and deploys with the same unit? sorry don't think so.<br /><br />i can only describe it as one giant stereotype of the army and the infantry. do some of the events portrayed in this movie happen to some soldiers, yes. however, in this film you get practically every stereotype in the space of about 100 minutes, and really things just aren't like that for most soldiers returning. i wish the director had made a point of doing a little better research instead of starting off with her agenda and then making a film.<br /><br />of the movies i mentioned at the beginning of this post, the best one is probably lions for lambs, which is more a commentary on the sad state of generation y+ than it is about the wars in iraq or afghanistan or the bush administration. if you really want to see this film wait for cable or netflix it, don't pay cash directly to rent it.
