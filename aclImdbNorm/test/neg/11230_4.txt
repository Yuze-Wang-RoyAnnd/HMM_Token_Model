ken russell directed this weird ( not very ) erotic thriller and if i hadn't known that i would have staked my life that the director was brian depalma . absolutely everything about crimes of passion screams depalma , from the gaudy cinematography that is lit a little too brightly , to the domestic storyline that turns into a stalk and slash plot , to even the title this screams " depalma , depalma , depalma "<br /><br />unfortunately since brian depalma is increasingly seen as a poor mans hitchcock over the years russell should have tried emulating a style of his own . sure an erotic thriller in the style of tommy or billion dollar brain would have been bizarre with a capital b but at least it would have been a unique cinematic experience . stories about prostitutes living a dangerous double life and being stalked by a religious maniac were an all too common sight in the 1980s video market . oh and anthony perkins plays the same role he played in almost every movie he made in the 1980s . yawn <br /><br />the only thing of any real note to crimes of passion is the controversy it caused . i guess the studio were the happiest people to hear this since no publicity is bad publicity , but as for the controversial sex scenes ... what controversial sex scenes ? there aren't any and the only controversy i can think of is of china blue dominating an on duty policeman with a truncheon . needless to say he didn't come quietly ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
