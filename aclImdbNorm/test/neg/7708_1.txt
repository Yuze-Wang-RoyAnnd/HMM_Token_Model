ok i have to admit that i quite enjoyed house of the dead despite its well documented failings. this however was the worst film i have seen since demons at the door. compared to datd the effects are vastly superior. however the plot is weak, the acting reminiscent of everyone's favourite, the porn film, and the decisions and actions of the "characters" consistently verge on the moronic. i feel like trying out uwe boll's latest cinematic outings just to get some sense of perspective over hotd2. i am not suggesting that he is really the cure, more a case of a different disease, but when your senses have been insulted in such an abhorrent manner the only way is up. ok there it is. i have managed the ten line minimum and shall waste no more of our time on the waste of celluloid that is house of the dead 2.
