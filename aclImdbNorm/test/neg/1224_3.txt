lonesome dove is my favorite western second only to the searchers with john wayne. i watch lonesome dove about every 6 months and never get tired of it. i have read all the ld books, although i cannot remember much of comanche moon. i too looked forward to this mini-series and decided to tape it on our dvr so we could fast forward through commercials. unfortunately, i messed up and didn't record the first part, but decided to watch the other parts and try to pick up.<br /><br />there is nobody that can ever compete with robert duvall or tommy lee jones, and i was expecting to be disappointed and i was.<br /><br />although there were so many things that didn't ring true, the most apparent to me was when nellie died the day before and gus was out on the range, it switched over to clara writing him a letter from nebraska telling him how sorry she was to hear of her death. how in the world could she have known the next day way out in nebraska? additionally, it was supposed to be 7 years later after her leaving and her children looked to be about 6-7 years old, maybe a little younger, yet more time went on before they actually moved to lonesome dove, and in lonesome dove they had been there about 10 years or longer before leaving to montana. when they stopped at clara's in nebraska, which probably took another 6 months on the trail, the girls looked to be about 10-13, since they were playing in the yard like little children. the math just does not add up.<br /><br />i agree that the man who played gus had a lot of his mannerisms and looked a little like gus may have looked as a young man.<br /><br />i am also a little confused about one thing. the captive white girl that they brought back - was she the one they captured when they raided austin? they said she had been captured 25 years ago, but if she was the one captured in austin, it was only 7 years later when this took place in the movie. was she captured earlier? i remember seeing a captive girl after they raided the town and don't know if this is the same one. if someone can explain since i missed part 1. if it had been 25 years, she would probably be over 40 years old when they found her since she looked to be grown lying on the ground. also, the way they were ravaging her when they captured her, it is hard to believe she would have lived to go on to be married and having indian children.<br /><br />i have to admit though, nothing is worse than john voight playing call in the sequel to lonesome dove or the unbelievable marriage of lorena to pea eye in the mcmurty sequel to lonesome dove, which was never explained either. also, the way he killed newt off was i hear from spite for them doing the sequel with john voight without his approval.<br /><br />if anyone can clear up these discrepancies, i would appreciate.
