firstly, this movie works in the fact that it is disturbing. i really did not like seeing all these scenes where people get cut up alive, etc. the weirdly erotic introduction gives one a sense of necrophiliactic wonder. it is somewhat... distastefull to me personally. but the movie really works in that respect, and it is suppposed to be scary, so i give it credit for that. yup, a few points there for those scalpels and....well, damned disturbing idea of getting disected alive.<br /><br />but what this movie lacks is an interesting plot, characterization, or real surprises. the whole teen-flick horror genre usually goes in a very simple, predictable way. lots of 'tense' moments, creepy guys who are insane, and the big question of all: is the boyfriend the murderer? this movie fits into the category of "scream" and countless others which have spawned over the 90s. well, i won't spoil it for you, but it's not exactly interesting who is the killer. we find out who it is half way through... and from there on, the movie drudges on, trying to fill in some time... rather boringly to say the least. i was looking at the clock a bit on this movie.<br /><br />the lead actress is great, as usual, but the carboard acting box she is placed into makes one groan in pain... the college girl who is a detective who everyone thinks is insane, but she is the one who really knows whats going on. and the cops? ahhh, they just laugh and eat donuts. very predictable, flat, disturbing at times, and most of all, boring and dull... it's like an american film company took a flight to germany to shoot a movie to make it foreign..... hmmm..... or did they?<br /><br />
