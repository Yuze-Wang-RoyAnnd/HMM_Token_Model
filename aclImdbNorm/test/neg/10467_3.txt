now before i tell you the synopsis this is a non-spoiler review. bone eater hits its mark for being the worst movie of the year. i don't know how these movies even get onto dvd. if i saw this in theaters i would get extremely upset. bone eater is about these people who dig up an ancient burial ground and find some bones. it's the 'bone eater' and the more bones he eats the more powerful he gets.<br /><br />first of all i thought okay well the dvd artwork looks creepy and it sounds creepy. when i rented it and looked at the dvd label it looked scary. but then when i played it in i could agree on one thing- the title 'bone eater' is better than the movie itself. tell me what's more stupid? a bone eater that just attacks by throwing a bone ate you and you disappear? don't worry that's not a spoiler you see that happen in the first 5 minutes. or is it more stupid that 'bone eater' has a horse? you know what i think is the stupidest? the whole movie.<br /><br />the cgi is awful. yeah i thought the idea of 'bone eater' was creepy but once you see the actual thing you think this is some kind of action movie or just a cruel, mean joke. the film felt longer than titanic and this was half an hour. once the film actually has its moments of suspense it just stops. i admit the acting was not the best but actually decent and that the violence wasn't over-the-top but everything else is a stinker.<br /><br />overall bone eater is a film you can skip. if you like interesting movies with great creatures, great cgi, and suspense 'bone eater' is a film to skip. if you like bad movies no matter how cheesy they are then 'bone eater' will satisfy.
