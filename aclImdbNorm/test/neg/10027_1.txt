even by the lowered standards of '80s slasher movies, this one stinks. the usual gaggle of oversexed teens heads for a "forbidden" part of forest, which burned in the 1940s and apparently left a sole angry survivor. fast forward (actually, you'll want to fast-forward through much of this mess) to the present day, where a couple of campers are butchered; the teens follow in their wake, while a semi-concerned park ranger (a sleepwalking jackie coogan) and his healthier cohort (who spins a lot of time tuning his banjo) succeed partially in steering our attention from yards of run-of-the-mill nature-footage padding. finally, more killings--but nothing you haven't seen a zillion times before. if you want to see the kids butchered, opt for sleepaway camp or the first friday the 13th over this
