i almost laughed out loud when during the commentary the director said this movie is original with a strong plot line. there is not one... repeat one original plot line or special effect in this blah movie. <br /><br />the crows.... hitchcock did it superbly back before cgi and even with cgi this film falls short of a well done attack scene. the creepy crawly boy... the grudge did it and did it better. the psycho...done in cold creek manor most recently, however it has been done to death. no pun intended. disconnected/rebellious teen who no one listens to... about a dozen films have used this one right down to beetlejuice. the oozy stuff from the basement... can you say amnityville horror? doors opening unbidden... what lies beneath did it with much more flair. creepy farmhouse... too numerous to mention. <br /><br />the backdrop of metaphysics-- which should have been the central focus, gets lost once you figure out what is happening, which by the way is pretty early on.<br /><br />one thing (of many actually) they never even try to explain in the movie is how they explain to the police that their attacker was sucked down the ooze in the basement, so they really don't have a body. <br /><br />overall... don't bother
