this movie was definitely on the boring side. the acting was decent and the film looks pretty nice, the soundtrack is definitely for fans of kenny g and michael bolton. speaking of the soundtrack, i found it very ironic that a film about telling the truth and not stealing decided to use a song in it's titles that was a blatant ripoff of paul simon's "you can call me al" - except that they don't acknowledge it at all. isn't there something a little hypocritical there? the scene that the main kid was in where he was mimicking a game show host was my favorite. 10 lines? i have to write ten lines about this movie to be included? what a ripoff, i don't think it's too fair to force people to write more than they would just to get it included!
