i never comment on a film, but i have to say that this was one of the worst films that i have ever seen. i feel it was made by a beginner film student and not to put down talented film students, but this was horrible! i did not buy the lead actress and felt i was in acting class with her while she was on film. her decisions were very safe and i feel she was mimicking other actresses in films and not acting and making her own decisions. the direction was very confusing and the sound was louder than the actors themselves. the end may have made a little more sense if there was someone narrating the events and not a song. i love patsy cline but she her songs appear quite frequently in films. maybe the song selection could have been a little more original. the song "crazy" was such a clich'e. as i said before i never comment on films and have seen my share of good and bad, but this was the worst. sorry.
