well, for this abomination of a film, i wasn't expecting anything good. i find steve carell annoying, and bruce almighty was pretty good but there is absolutely no reason for it to have a sequel. somehow, this film was even lower than my expectations, even when i didn't have any. <br /><br />does anyone remember the disney movie noah with tony danza? well, let's just say that evan almighty completely ripped it off in way too many ways for the movie to remain justifiable. actually evan almighty was had the exact same plot outline as noah, with the exception of a few technicalities, it was nothing but a carbon copy of a far-superior movie that was actually funny. <br /><br />another thing, did anyone get sick of wanda sykes' stupid, unfunny, redundant, one-liners that were literally in every single scene? it was completely ridiculous and just dragged the movie down more and more. <br /><br />despite the fact that i basically had already seen the film ten years earlier(noah), evan almighty has to be the most predictable movie i've ever seen. i figured out the entire movie from beginning to end within the first five minutes and eventually realized that it was ripping off noah left and right. <br /><br />in conclusion, if you're a little bit unsure of whether or not you want to see evan almighty, and are already sick of jonah hill playing the same role in every single movie he's in, liked bruce almighty, and don't want to see a predictable, dry, unfunny movie with steve carell trying to act like jim carrey, then please, don't see this piece of garbage.
