this is a great premise for a movie. the overall plot is very original,interesting, and something to think about. however poor production, an obviously small budget, crapy acting from the main character, and several side actors really detract from this would be classic. an up and coming producer should try to resurect this story and give this basicly half hearted atempt a proper release.
