this movie attempted to make stu ungar's life interesting by being creative. what they forgot is that his life was plenty entertaining enough on it's own without having to make things up.<br /><br />a short list of the inaccuracies: <br /><br />1) stuey was not sent straight to las vegas for a gin tournament to pay off old debts, he spent a good deal of time in florida first, and only went to las vegas when he ran out of gin games on the east coast.<br /><br />2) stuey never associated (or played gin) with a casino executive (like the one played by pat morita in the movie.) <br /><br />3) there was no magical turnaround in the buildup to the 1997 wsop. in fact stuey barely made it into the tournament as it was. he snorted cocaine the week before even.<br /><br />either tell the story right, or don't tell it at all. 4 out of 10 stars for michael imperolli's credible performance (the only redeeming quality of this movie.)
