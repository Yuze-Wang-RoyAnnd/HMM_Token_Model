granny is definitely one of the worst horror movies ever made in the history of cinema.<br /><br />the script was diabolical, so bad in fact that i was almost crying with laughter at some of the things they came out with. the acting was almost as bad, they would have been better off casting traffic cones to play the roles (they would have done a better job). the murders were laughable, the suspense was non existent, the camera work was ineffective and the "major" plot twist at the end was disgustingly inappropriate, it just gets worse and worse.<br /><br />"the granny" is possibly one of the most unthreatening "villains" caught on film, she looks like she is wearing a cheap mask from the supermarket (the nylon hair caused endless amounts of laughter) and a frilly nightgown. would you be scared by that??? i certainly wasn't.<br /><br />if you like watching bad movies (see manos, troll 2, michael bay films &#61514; ) then this is a must see. those who don't like bad movies and don't enjoy laughing at shockingly bad dialogue, avoid like the plague.
