movies just don't get worse than this. horrible plot, terribly timed, pathetic characters and effects and yes this is using "b" standards.<br /><br />and for the guys: nothing, this movie is a terrible let down, couple scenes that could have been great but you get nothing but build up with no delivery.<br /><br />this movie appeals to no one, horrible movie,it had bad; plot, acting, "b" flavor, special effects and everything else. plus no nudity or erotics for guys or the girls.
