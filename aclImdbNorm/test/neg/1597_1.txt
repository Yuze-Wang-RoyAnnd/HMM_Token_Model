alright, so not every australian movie is all that good. yes, maybe there have actually been very few with much merit. take away however is an absolute bomb, qualifying as one of the worst movies i've ever seen. i wanted to like it. i figured i'd give it a fair go. i've even met one of the screen writers dave o'neil so i feel kind of a traitor giving this movie a bad review, but... the plot is fairly thin (i won't bother relating it... read the synopsis), which i can forgive: there are plenty of movies that can cover that up with a few decent jokes. unfortunately, take away's jokes cover its plot up like a $2 prostitute's skirt. probably the only laughs that came from the 6 other people in the cinema was at the poor acting and dialogue. take away goes down like a week old dim sim ... you might understand that joke if you see the film but the joke's not worth it.
