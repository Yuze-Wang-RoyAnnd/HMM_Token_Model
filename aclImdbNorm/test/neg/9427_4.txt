an anonymous film which could have been directed by anyone at all.where is anthony mann,the director of such classics as "el cid" " the naked spur" or "the man from laramie"?<br /><br />there are marvelous shots of planes in the clouds,lovingly filmed.the story is very trite ,and almost completely devoid of dramatization.the couple lives an almost routine life and the user who complains about june allyson's choice for the wife ,imho,totally misses the point.with her less-than-attractive look,her hoarse voice,she was the perfect housewife the screenplay needed.at the time,women were barefoot and pregnant:there 's not one single woman among the base staff,even in the desk jobs -.all they had to do was worrying about their hubbies ,who were fighting for democracy and against an enemy whose name we never hear ,but in 1955,it was not hard to guess it.<br /><br />one wonders why a young person who has never seen a mann movie should choose this one among all the great movies he made.
