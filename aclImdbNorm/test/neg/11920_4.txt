!!!! mild spoilers !!!!<br /><br />the premise goes like this : a store gets burnt down and assistant sergio is asked by the father of the man who started the fire to take the wrap to which sergio agrees .<br /><br />so far so good , but there`s a fair lapse of logic involved sergio agrees to do this for the sum of 25,000 dollars but why ? come on guys if you were a good looking white boy would you run the risk of getting a long spell in a tough jail ( a very real possibilty for arson ) for the sake of 25 grand ? i know i wouldn`t , and seeing as you`d have a criminal record no employer would want to touch you with a barge pole so is $25,000 dollars all that much for a life of workfare and welfare cheques ? there`s also something else that seems to have gone without notice from the premise , since mister lumpke has told sergio that his son did the fire he seems unware of the possibility that he may know too much . wouldn`t alarm bells be ringing in your mind about someone wanting to keep you quite if they told you something ? <br /><br />i guess we`re not suppossed to think about such details since a pyromaniac`s love story isn`t suppossed to be an intelligent thriller , it`s a light hearted romantic comedy/ chick flick that`s probably best apprieciated as a girls night in . looking through this comments page it is obvious that the movie has its defenders but as a cynical male i wasn`t too impressed and william baldwin does go way over the top
