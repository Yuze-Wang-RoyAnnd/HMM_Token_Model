after matt dillon's phenomenal performance in crash, most will probably rush to pick up a copy of factotum to see if dillon is for real or simply got a lucky rebound from a great script.<br /><br />well, factotum certainly has its moments, but the plainness of ...everything will most likely turn viewers off. however nothing should be taken away from dillon. his performance is wonderful and full of excellent deadpan humor, proving he's a solid actor with significant chops; it's just a shame about the directing and script.<br /><br />the story is about henry "hank" chinaski (dillon) and his refusal to conform to anything resembling normalcy. he quits or gets fired from jobs in mere minutes, only to find himself back in a dreary pub meeting even drearier women while trying to write a nonconformist novel. we never really know what the novel is about except that it involves "everything" (cancer, movies, you, me).<br /><br />skipping from workplace to workplace and constantly returning to jan (lili taylor, the haunting), a loser girlfriend who's just as dispiriting as himself, hank tries vainly to discover what his life is supposed to hold for him. whether he ever learns what that is is up for interpretation. some may say that he never does, while others might argue that his life is simply a path to obscurity.<br /><br />regardless, there's not much substance to factotum even with matt dillon's fine performance. the story meanders through hank's life without much thought given as to where to take the audience. and that's a shame. dillon's performance would've shone even brighter if given a decent script.
