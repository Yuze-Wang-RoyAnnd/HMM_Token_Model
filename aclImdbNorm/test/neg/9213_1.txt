why i disliked the movie, apart from the sheer ugliness of the actors themselves, is that someone might actually believe such crap.<br /><br />first of all, the second coming of christ will be at the end of words, and when jesus christ will come on judgement day he will not come as he did before, in human form. he will come in his full glory as god and we shall be judged not only for our sins, but also for the consequences of our actions. everyone will! secondly, i have seen the eternal gay pride illustrated in this movie with the all unquestionable "i read the bible last night and it's not written anywhere". well, it is. moses cites on 3 different occasions that men who make love to other men, or women who make love to each other as if man and wife should be killed because these will never inherit the kingdom of god as they are foul! if it truly were for us to follow the bible word for word there would be executions now, wouldn't there? but i think misinforming people does more harm than this would... that was the in the old testament.<br /><br />there are lots of lunatics in psychiatric wards who think they are the son of god, but to make a movie after it truly makes you think of how many idiots out there can make a movie.
