i had heard about this movie through a friend, it was supposed to be a thriller, but what i watched wasn't a "thriller". it was more like a weak attempt at one. amber smith was a bright spot-that may be giving her too much credit. the scenes were she was in bed with actress erika michels were also lame. the two actresses did not seem to click with each other at all. amber smith was way out of this gal's league, and it definitely showed on camera. she did not seem into those scenes at all. i was disappointed because a friend of mine-guy of course-had pumped this movie up to be something "great", but it was actually more like watching dime store porn.
