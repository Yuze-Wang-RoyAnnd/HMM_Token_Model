this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen! the plot revolves around a man named luther who wears metal dentures, bites people on the neck, and walks around clucking like a chicken without the flapping of the arms. he also thinks he's a chicken.<br /><br />sounds bizarre right? well, to me, the more bizarre and weird the person is, the better. the more gore, the better and so on.<br /><br />the movie starts out with the board deciding if they want to release this maniac from their institution. they mention that he has created some dentures in prison that he used to bite people on the neck. he also clucks like a chicken and thinks he's a chicken.<br /><br />if i had a patient like this, there is no way i would release him.<br /><br />first, luther heads to the supermarket and attacks an old woman on a bench and walks away. then, he sneaks in the back seat of a woman's car and she drives all the way to her home.<br /><br />while at the house, luther ties up the woman to the bed. when the woman's daughter and her daughter's boyfriend come home, luther hides.<br /><br />later through the film, a cop comes to the front door and asks about the mother. you can clearly see the daughter is scared out of her mind and crying but the officer keeps asking if everything is okay. she replies that everything is fine. the officer finally gets in his car and leaves. if i saw a woman constantly crying and looking scared, i would want to at least get inside the house to investigate a little.<br /><br />the ending is stupid as well. while the woman in in the barn, she starts clucking and gets luther excited so he starts walking around flapping his arms and clucking like a maniac. she finally shoots him and just sits there for a minute before finally clucking some more.<br /><br />then the credits roll.<br /><br />this is one of the stupidest movies i have ever seen! nothing happens at the woman's house! nothing!<br /><br />i sometimes like campy films but this one really bored me.<br /><br />i give this movie 1 star out of 10. good idea, bad direction!
