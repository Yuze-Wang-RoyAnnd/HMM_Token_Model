ok - i gave it a "3" just because they obviously had no money to make this film, but i feel it might deserve the "2.3" rating it had when i got here. i'm actually helping to raise it's rating, despite being bored for the last hour and a half. i will save the "1's" and the "2's" for the higher budget pieces of crap. at least the makers of "rise of the undead" didn't waste that much money. they did manage to waste 90 minutes of my life.<br /><br />the movie is too claustrophobic for me. the entire movie takes place in the same building, in dark rooms and hallways. with a setting like this, there should have been more action or character development, but there is just a lot of meaningless talk. i didn't get to know any of the characters. there is a schoolgirl and a goth chick but we never find out much more about them. none of the characters seem really likable.<br /><br />terrible movie made on zero budget. no scary special effects. no suspense. really nothing interesting at all here, folks. i admit i downloaded this from the net. it was free but i am throwing it away.<br /><br />sorry to the filmmakers. better luck next time. this one is more like a soap opera than a zombie movie.
