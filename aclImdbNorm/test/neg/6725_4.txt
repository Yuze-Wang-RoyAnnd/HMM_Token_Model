bad acting? yes, but it was not a surprise. stupid story? yes, so what?<br /><br />but why, tell me, mr director, why all that slow motion crap? fight scenes were bad, really bad, because of slow motion and bad cutting. not because of seagal.<br /><br />"what if i just speed this up for 2 seconds and then slow down those next 5 seconds and then... maybe i need to flip the coin to decide?" what were you thinking, mr director???
