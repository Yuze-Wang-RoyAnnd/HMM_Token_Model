i have always had this morbid curiosity when it comes to notoriously bad and unpopular movies. i also have always enjoyed so-bad-it's-good flicks, you're looking at someone who actually liked recent cheese filled kid flicks like catwoman and thunderbirds (2004).<br /><br />so i watched this, and it turned out that all the critics are right about this one. it's a major flop, but unlike a lot of flops, it isn't even enjoyable on any level, not even just to make fun of. it's just one boring cringe-fest after another all the way through.<br /><br />i had been warned. i didn't listen. i am a fool.<br /><br />don't be a fool, don't waste time and money on this pile of trash.
