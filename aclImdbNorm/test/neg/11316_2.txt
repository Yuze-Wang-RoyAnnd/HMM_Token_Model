leslie nielsen is usually someone whose movies i really like (even critically panned flicks like "dracula: dead and loving it" and "wrongfully accused"). so the fact that i'm slamming "mr. magoo" should show that it's a piece of junk. it casts nielsen as the myopic title character, something gets planted on him, and he makes a mess of everything. it seems like the combo of nielsen and director stanley tong (behind two of jackie chan's movies) would make this one hilarious movie, but it doesn't; it seems like they just have people to do anything, and there's no real humor here.<br /><br />so, the original cartoon with jim backus providing the voice was worth seeing, so avoid this movie. leslie nielsen has also done much better, so there's no reason to waste your time on this. also starring kelly lynch, stephen tobolowsky, ernie hudson, malcolm mcdowell and miguel ferrer; they probably don't wish to emphasize this hunk of junk in their careers.
