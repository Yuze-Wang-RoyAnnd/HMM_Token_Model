i have to agree with the previous reviewer. although the kristin erikson did a great job of playing the possessed girl, i seriously don't think that isabelle, the character she was playing, was possessed. i have seen people have psychotic breaks due to sexual abuse, and they never made it clear whether or not the father had actually abused her or not. i also had to watch some parts of it over again, to make it clear as to what the letter said, what the characters' names were, and i'm still not clear on a few things that happened, whether they were real or not. i'm trying to find the "original" story that it was based on, to compare facts, but i can't seem to find anything about it online.<br /><br />it wasn't a bad movie, but some of the dialogue was incredibly cheesy. special effects wise, the movie wasn't bad for a grade b, pretty much, and those possession scenes made it all worth while... that is, if you have nothing better to do. lol
