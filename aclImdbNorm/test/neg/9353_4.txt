i saw this movie in 1956 and again on cable a few days ago. the movie hasn't improved with age. quite the opposite. it's a true spaghetti epic.<br /><br />the trojans are heroic and likable; the greeks are nasty, petty and sneaky.<br /><br />so what if paris ran off with the king's wife? hey...love is love.
