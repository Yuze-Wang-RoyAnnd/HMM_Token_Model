ok, number one-this "film" is a "90's" version of a crappy show from the 70's that no one remembers! number two-as soon as the movie started, i was confused, it was like i walked in halfway through the movie! there was no plot! it was very annoying! horrible wardrobe! call me crazy, but it's just not believable to me that little skinny omar epps can chase down a big grown man, without a gun, and scare him into talking! it's a ridiculous "plot". i'm sorry, but to me, kids these days can't even put their pants on one leg at a time, let alone catch some "evil, underground, killers". i walked out of the theater and demanded and got my money back! i do not reccomend this movie to anyone over 12 years old!
