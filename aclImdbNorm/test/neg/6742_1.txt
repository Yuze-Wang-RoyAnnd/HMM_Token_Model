this movie is so bad there are not words to describe it. if i got a video camera of a monkey dancing for an hour and a half it would be a heck of a lot more entertaining than this. the plot is so dull and unimaginitive it is not even worth mentioning. the best part of the movie was when the credits roled and i got a chuckle out of knowing the lead actors name was james bond iii. just trust me and stay far away from this trash heap!
