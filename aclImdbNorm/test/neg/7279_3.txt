this movie was recommended to me by several people, and after reading all the positive comments from this site i went ahead and bought a copy of the film off ebay. the acting in the film is average and a bit hammy, especially by the family of cannibals, one sequence comes to mind when jupiter is ranting and raving to the burnt corpse, speaking right into the camera. its one of those performances where you just cringe and feel bad for that poor actor. its also evidence of some of the worst editing i've seen, theres a terrible jump cut right in the middle of his "speech". there are a few creepy moments though, and at times the music works well...but overall the film isnt that great and i dont know why people think wes craven is that great of a director. thus far he hasn't showed me anything that i believe to be brilliant, the only thing that improved with cravens films, production to prodution was his budget.
