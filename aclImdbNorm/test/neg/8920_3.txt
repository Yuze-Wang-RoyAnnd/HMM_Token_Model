steven seagal is a thief who specializes in robbing wealther drug dealers, giving to the poor and unfortunate..heh, harlan, the robin hood. anyway, harlan wants to go straight for his girl, jada(mari morrow), so he takes on a job as the driver of an armoured car for a max stevens(kevin tighe, wasted in an underwritten role). max intends to have the millions for himself and his unscrupulous associates, with the intent of using his loader, bruno(robert miano)to bring him the money, but harlan has other plans. escaping the police, hiding the money, and ditching bruno(who had a loaded gun pointed at harlan's head threatening to shoot him if he didn't drive)after evading capture by ramming a huge dump truck, harlan passes out. charged with the murder of police among other things as a result of the damage caused by the high-speed chase, harlan is imprisoned and many wish to know where the money is. harlan joins forces with an inmate, ice(treach), a leader of one of the many gangs in the prison, breaking out with the plans of finding max and eliminating every member of his corrupt entourage. soon dea agent rachel knowles(sarah buxton) becomes part of this scenario thanks to her boss, saunders(nick mancuso)who claims there's drugs involved. also injected into the plot is harlan's desire to save a children's hospital about to close and jada has mysterious dreams regarding max.<br /><br />seagal and treach cut up with each other speaking in gangsta, while buxton spends time trying to help harlan, uncovering the possibility her boss is in cahoots with max. mancuso's character is an odd duck, allowing rachel much leeway despite the threat she is to his career. tighe shows up for five or so minutes tops, which is a shame. seagal's harlan escapes prison and finds each and every rich associate of max's, inevitably discovering his whereabouts after cracking a few skulls, snapping some wrists, and breaking some bones. treach speaks in his rapper speech and seagal tries to answer him in kind, providing some unintentional laughs. as you'd expect, a lot of people get shot and seagal doesn't break a sweat. it's interesting seeing seagal in prison, among the convicts, helping treach out when a group of "eses" plan to take him out.
