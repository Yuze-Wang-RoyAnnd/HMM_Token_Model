i looked forward to spending part of my independence day weekend watching a good film about jefferson. this film was not it. it was rather long, drawn out, dull and unbalanced. too much time was spent exploring jefferson's relationship with cosway and not enough time was spent on his relationship with sally hemmings. the lady who played sally, thandie newton, was absolutely awful. her acting was so bad it was like watching an a1 airhead trying to recite shakespeare. her constant whining voice grated the nerves! nolte's accent made jefferson sound like an ignorant man, rather than a genius. jefferson's relationship with his daughters and their feelings on slavery was also underdeveloped, yet his eldest daughter's rebellion (patsy)is a key event late in the film. the film was too long and the script lacked energy and excitement. on the positive side, the costumes were quite beautiful, and greta scacchi played the part of cosway well. if you want to watch a film about the revolutionary era and/or jefferson, then watch 1776, it's much better than jefferson in paris.
