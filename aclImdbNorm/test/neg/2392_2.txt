a good idea let down by heavy-handed production.<br /><br />quite a bit of the dialogue was unintelligible because of the level of music/background sound, and this didn't help this reviewer. nor did the welsh accents, pretty impenetrable at times. towards the end i lost the will to live trying to follow the dialogue.<br /><br />this movie didn't know whether to be a farce or a black comedy - and they require different approaches. some of the incidents were laid on so thick that they only merited a groan, some were so unbelievable even for this sort of plot that they made the story just not worth following.<br /><br />the acting was in the main good - although the american just came over as a clone of the "back to the future" mad scientist. the little boy was very good.<br /><br />i did watch it all the way through but god knows why: i can't remember laughing once.
