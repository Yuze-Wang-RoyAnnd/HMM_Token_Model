after reading both _river_god_ and _the_seventh_scroll_, i can't begin to express how disappointed i was with this film. while i agree some poetic license may be admissible, this movie is at constant variance with the books, doing an incredible injustice to the exciting, plausible and wonderful stories written by wilbur smith. i can only believe that the writers, director and producers of the movie have never even heard of mr. smith, let alone read his work. smith's vibrant characterizations are converted into wooden stick figures, all historicity is ignored or discounted, the realism of the books has been changed to include phantom monsters more appropriate to a cartoon. and why is an egyptian henchman speaking spanish? geesh, no wonder the movie was made into a tv miniseries! did wilbur smith have any input into the making of this movie? i can't believe that he did. terrible, terrible movie. if you've read either or both of the books, don't waste your time or money watching this money. you will be sorely disappointed, i assure you.<br /><br />only a moment of supreme generosity persuaded me to give this movie a ranking of '2', and that only because of the beautiful, sometimes spectacular, photography.
