reading the other two comments, i had to wonder if i had seen the same movie!<br /><br />perhaps life is drastically different in australia, but, wow - call it sci-fi or fantasy, but people just don't act like this.<br /><br />i couldn't pass up this review without commenting on it myself.. it gets better after the first half hour, but i doubt most could make it that far..<br /><br />yikes.
