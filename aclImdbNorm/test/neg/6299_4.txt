this film tries hard but fails. perhaps to non-australian audiences it may have appeal as a travelogue, but to the native it is merely tedious.<br /><br />anyone who lives here knows broken hill is a rough, tough isolated mining town. if a couple of citified fruits turn up in drag, well it's all so predictable. where have i come across that well-worn theme before? oh yes -- town mouse and country mouse. spare us.<br /><br />i kept hoping it would improve but after the broken hill scene i could see where this was heading and so turned off the tv and went to bed.
