pretentious storytelling such as this always uses the same technique: 1) throw opaque, unstructured threads around to perplex the audience. 2) deal only in `big' topics such as life, death and god. 3) make it appear profound with scenes of life, death, sky, etc. 4) depend on an intellectually weak audience to give you the benefit of the doubt. 5) and finally, laugh all the way to critical acclaim.<br /><br />this movie is pretentious faux-intellectualism at its boldest. not only do these filmmakers not answer any questions, they're afraid to pose the questions to begin with. the film is held together by wisps. directions are raised and dropped awkwardly. pop cultural references are jolting and arbitrary. there is so little to point at, that any critical stabs will miss.<br /><br />critics who found an intellectual base to this movie are afraid to admit the truth: they have no idea what this movie is about. good news: neither do the filmmakers. satisfying attempts at answers to profound questions about human existence demand wit, intellect, poetry, and genius. sadly, this movie demonstrates none of these traits.
