i have to say that i really liked under siege and hard to kill.<br /><br />watching seagal doing his funny martial arts on people. i have<br /><br />been always looking forward to seagal-movies and, unfortunately, i was first disappointed by glimmer man, which i found really bad. the foreigner is probably one of the worst seagal has ever<br /><br />acted in. horribly boring, badly edited, wrongest soundtrack and so on! dear reader, do yourself a favor an stay away from this!<br /><br />honestly: stay away!
