this is the most inaccurate and disgraceful biblical film i have ever has the misfortune to watch. i would like to know why anybody on earth could enjoy viewing this. i am so surprised that a big name like jon voight would agree to act in this disgraceful piece of garbage. many people who may not have read the bible will now be mislead by believing this film was accurate and the thought of that really bothers me. i think the makers have a lot to answer for. the worst thing is that, i believe nobody could make such obvious mistakes with a biblical film, since they can research the bible for the truth, so i believe the makers deliberately twisted what the bible says, and that is something nobody has the right to do and i find that very offensive. there are no words strong enough to describe exactly how i feel about this.
