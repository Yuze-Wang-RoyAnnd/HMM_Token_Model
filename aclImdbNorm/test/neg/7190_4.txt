ok everybody is so enthused by this film i hardly dare add a negative review but i just did not enjoy this movie.<br /><br />i have to say first i saw the film in russian language overdub so i will have missed some dialog, but not much.<br /><br />nice things first. there are some hilarious moments (the elvis impersonator for instance). actors seem well casted, also the russians. efremova is great and goldblum is very good. which brings us to the downsides of this movie. first of all. there is hardly any story and the end we know already: yeltsin wins. so no drama or suspense. they tried to solve this problem with an emerging affair between the actors mentioned above, but that story kind of evaporates.<br /><br />more importantly, the film does not represent reality. the russians at the level of politics and society portrayed in this movie are not funny, they are a serious and dangerous lot. i am willing to believe that flying in some spin-doctors from the states helped yeltsin win his campaign, but the real interesting questions that should be addressed are: who financed the campaign, what did they get in return, how was the opposition handled apart from airing some commercials?<br /><br />so what we have here is a film, loosely based on reality (but strangely avoiding anything that could make the film either historically relevant or just a very good political thriller) without plot or subplot.
