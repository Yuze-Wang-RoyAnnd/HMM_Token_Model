this film is enjoyable if you like poverty row, public domain films from the first half of the 20th century, or are a fan of amateur film-making. the film splices together public domain thrillers together along with newly shot scenes in which the "actors" (with the sole exception of redfield doing a near dead on lugosi rip, all of the "performers" are simply dreadful!) attempt to interact with the stock footage. the "new" footage is covered with digitally added film scratches, as is some of the already substandard old footage (??!!). as near as i can figure out the plot has something to do with a bunch of strangers being brought together on an island for a will reading(?) this film, while boasting a creative premise ala 'dead men don't wear plaid', is a technical and creative wreck. in one dreadfully over long sequence and injured sailor on a ship describes an abortive trip to 'fog island', whatever that is! the "flashback" then incoherently weaves together old footage from totally different eras, and of totally disparate film quality. unrelated scenes from 'the lost world' (1925), the most dangerous game (1932), white zombie (1932), bela lugosi meets a brooklyn gorilla (1952) and some other poverty row productions. this is done over an incredibly bad voice over which seems to have too much room echo as if the audio was recorded on a cheap home video camera.<br /><br />the "filmmakers" seem to think that they are paying homage to the great actors of yesteryear by giving characters the surnames of famous actors (carradine, zucco, ouspenskaya, etc..etc..). this tactic was done cleverly, as well as subtly in 'final destination' here it's just obnoxious! bizarre, and painfully unfunny, jokes about spiderman, dracula, and superman abound. even the old as dirt 'dewey, cheetam and howe' lawyer reference is used here-this was old and tired when the three stooges used it in the 1930s.<br /><br />the film stock and audio, don't match scene to scene, and dozens of different sources are used for lugosi. the finale effect is that he seems to be getting, older, younger, older, thinner, heavier, younger and older again minute by minute. oddly the film didn't use this as a comedy subplot and squanders a good chance for comedy.<br /><br />truth be told though, it was great fun to watch this late at night in bed. maybe thats what they wanted to happen!
