when a hardworking entrepreneur is rejected from a prestigious country club, he starts a battle between the members and eventually buys it from ty webb(chevy chase) and turns it into a theme park/golf course in which everyone can join.<br /><br />this is by no means a good movie, but it is still slightly amusing at times. almost all of the comedy is cheap slapstick and bad jokes except for chevy chase. chevy chase plays one of his greatest roles as ty webb for a second time and plays it great. he is not only the funniest character in the movie, he is the only funny character in the movie. even dan akroyd fails to bring humor to this film which aspires to be a great sequel to a classic comedy but falls to rubble with others shown on comedy central. the movie might have been better if ty webb(chase) had a larger role but instead he was reduced to a minor character and the star became jackie mason(who??) they should have brought back all of the cast and made a sequel the right way! this is a perfect example of what not to do when making a sequel to an already great movie. overall, caddyshack ii is humorous but a large mistake.<br /><br />i do not recommend this movie.
