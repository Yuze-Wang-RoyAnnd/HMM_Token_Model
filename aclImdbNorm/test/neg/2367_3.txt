no way out 2007 was a really bad and if it is the road to wrestlemania they choose the wrong road.<br /><br />chris benoit & the hardy boys def mvp & minn: in my view this was the best match of the night some good wrestling here but not much. 7/10<br /><br />cruisweight championship open(which chavo guerrero won): awful, no high flying at all, really quick and boring. 3/10<br /><br />little bastard & finlay def little bogeyman & the bogeyman: this was more comedy than wrestling, some laughs. 5/10<br /><br />kane def king booker: a decent effort by these two but they could do better. 6/10<br /><br />wwe tag team championship paul london & brian kendrick def deuce & domino:another boring match,no high flying by the champs. 4/10<br /><br />ecw world title mr kennedy def bobby lashley (disquilification): in my mind the worst match of the night. truly awful.i thought ecw was no rules,i was wrong 2/10<br /><br />john cena & shawn michaels def batista & the undertaker: an okay match but could have been a hell of a lot better. 6/10<br /><br />overall this was bulls*it id give it a 3/10
