i don't get it. i just don't get it. "barney and friends" has been lambasted by millions through the years, and i will admit, i was one of those lambasters. any child who watches this show doesn't realize that what they're watching is just a piece of trash. barney is very annoying, and very selfish. add baby bop, and it gets even worse. add b.j., then you have a very creepy television nightmare. then, you get the children. they're old enough to know what barney is trying to teach them! what are they doing there in the first place? it would be funny if barney and his friends appeared on the jerry springer show. that would certainly be one of the wildest moments in television history! even more significant is that this show marked the beginning of the end of public television as we knew it, as we have seen less and less of the more informational and interesting public television programs that aired in the 1970s and the 1980s. what a big difference a selfish son of a gun makes. when this show leaves pbs, a big sigh of relief will be felt among millions of people, but a huge dent will have been made in the annals of television history. a message to barney himself: you may not realize it, but your days are numbered.<br /><br />in a nutshell, there are other choices. better choices.
