the worst ever korean movie! the plot is ridiculously complex, unbelievable, and the film creates not a single shock. it builds up suspense well enough then leaves you agitated providing no shock or jumpy moment. whenever there is a chilling moment you are not bothered by it as you're still trying to work out who is who and what is going on! it goes something like this: a modeling company recruit 4 people for a modeling career. but the owners are not what they seem, they have model dolls of everyone and a strange girl is seen walking about the place and the owners have no recognition of a girl. it turns out that everyone is there for a reason and thats as much as i could grasp. the ending is a muddle of killings and you don't know who's a doll who's real and who's dead! i don't recommend it to fans of korean/asian horror films.
