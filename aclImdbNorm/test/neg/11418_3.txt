my mother forced me to watch this movie with her. she apparently will watch anything with a vampire counsel in it. i was bored throughout.<br /><br />at different points, underworld: rise of the lycans is reminiscent of spartacus, battle for the planet of the apes, the passion of the christ, and mandingo! what it reminds me most of are those italian sword and sandal pictures of the nineteen-sixties (not the good ones) that spend an inordinate amount of time showing greek or roman despots in robes talking and plotting incessantly while you wait impatiently for the muscle man hero and his lover, usually the despots daughter, to do something.<br /><br />this film was in desperate need of some color and suspense. the characters were pretty two-dimensional.<br /><br />the sets looked as if they were constructed entirely of pewter! i wonder how many civil war chess sets were melted down to make this movie.<br /><br />all those wearing fishnet stockings on your arms and black lipstick, feel free to click no.
