not really worth a review, but i suppose it's my duty to warn you all - especially since there are some pretty good reviews of this canadian bomb floating around out there... bad acting and a slow moving, absolutely atrociously boring 'coming of age' tale in which 3 boys lives are turned upside down when a man on the run shows up at their clubhouse in the woods. at firs the boys make good with the intruder and at one point even view him as some sort of a role model... however all this changes... and you still won't care. you will recognize chris penn, whose biggest cinematic impact is corky romano, and a young devon sawa, whose career peaked at 'casper'. i was hoping for a '12 and holding', 'the war', or 'lie' and all i got was a waste of time. this film struggles to keep it's audiences attention and never makes an impact or maintains a note of anything remotely interesting.
