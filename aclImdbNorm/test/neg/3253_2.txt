have you heard the theory of cloning redundancy, where a copy is poorer than the original? caddyshack 2 is a perfect example of that. they try to duplicate everything from the first movie. now, in a few cases this work. robert stack is actually a little better than ted knight, when they play essentially the same character. i actually like randy quaid, who is no more or less offensive than bill murray in the original. but jackie mason is no rodney dangerfield, and worse of all, c2 demonstrated once and for all that dan ackroyd is one of the worst comedy actors of all time. there is very little that i like him in, and c2 nailed the coffin shut on his "comedic" career as far as i'm concerned. he seems to feel the same, sticking more to tuffy like driving miss daisy and hosting psi-factor. other than that, it's mostly, "been there, done that" for caddyshack 2. watch the original twice rather than each version once, and you'll get more for your rental money.
