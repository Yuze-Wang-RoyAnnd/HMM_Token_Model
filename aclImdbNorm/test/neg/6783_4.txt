i watched this film with a group of friends at the 1999 melbourne international film festival and no-one had a good word for it.<br /><br />i happen to love bluegrass and country music so it's not as if i'm unsympathetic to the subject matter. but the problem is that at heart it's a very conservative movie- little more than a filmed mills and boon story. a bodice-ripper of the most simple-minded and soppy kind.<br /><br />it's not just that the love story at its heart, that between reece and dr. lily penleric is more than a tad unbelievable. (why any male would be attracted to the nostril-flaring man-devouring lily is beyond me, and frankly, mike harding as reece seems to be just going through the motions).<br /><br />it's simply that the whole movie is too tame and well-mannered for its own good. there is precious little danger, dirt or drama. sure there's a moment of "excitement" involving a school run by lily's younger sister, but this whole episode is funnier than it is dramatic (it's just so poorly written and acted). and the movie betrays its conservative agenda in the manner in which this subplot is resolved.<br /><br />as for good old reece kinkaid (now, what's wrong with a name like eberneezer bumpass?) i ask you! is the ending of this film believable? fitting in with the character this film had earlier constructed? i think not...
