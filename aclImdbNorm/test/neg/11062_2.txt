a virtual carbon copy of the cave save for a fewer lower budget effects and a slightly different plot. i knew the movie was going downhill when i saw the fake campfire flikering lights clearly reflected in a facial close up of one of the actors. the conflicts between characters and subplots seemed to serve no purpose whatsoever, and added nothing to the film except fewer moments of silence. the acting wasn't as bad as the typical b movie, and there was some believability in their fear, but as professional cavers, they seem to be too psychologically unstable for their chosen profession. overall not worth wasting $4.50 to rent.
