sad... really sad. this movie has nothing (hmmm, well maybe sybil danning) to keep you watching. it also hurt my eyes to see linda blair in this exploitation flick. she certainly deserves better.<br /><br />so what's the story about? let's see... warden john vernon tapes the inmates in rather inspiring positions, while prisoner sybil actually runs the prison and little linda must fight to survive... sounds like a b-movie, huh? it is.
