ghoulies iv starts in a museum storage facility where pvc & leather clad blonde alexandra (stacie randall) is looking for a ancient jewel, after offing various guards she summon the demon faust who she worships & wants to have sex with, unfortunately she lost the jewel so he's not very happy & orders her to get the last remaining one... which belongs to jonathan graves (returning from the original ghoulies (1985) peter liapis) who is experienced in demonic possession & stuff like that after the events of the original ghoulies. alexandra sets about finding the jewel so she can bring faust to earth permanently from the 'other side' to, well i don't know actually. erm, that's about it really...<br /><br />directed by jim wynorski whose very name name sends shivers down my spine when it's attached to a film i'm about to waste 90 minutes of my life on goulies iv is as i expected complete, total & utter crap from start to finish & it's as simple & straight forward as that. the ,ahem, 'script' , cough, by mark sevi has virtually nothing in common with the other ghoulies film except in it's title & that they managed to convince liapis to reprise his role which also has the added bonus of big able to use footage from the original even though it has no relevance whatsoever. the story is almost none existent, the whole film is a real chore to watch, it's incredibly boring & moronic, it's slow, it's predictable, it's squeaky clean as far as blood or gore goes & it has two comic relief goblins whom i assume are supposed to fill the ghoulies quota even though they look nothing like they did in the previous films & are in fact just embarrassing to watch, in fact i think they were practising to be ventriloquist's during most of the film as when they speak their mouth's don't move... you know i don't want to talk or think about ghoulies iv anymore so please believe me when i say this is one huge piece of crap of elephant sized proportions, don't waste either your time or money.<br /><br />dirctor wynorski turns in a throughly rotten film on just about every level, the special effects are terrible as is the whole film. apparently ghoulies iv is meant to be some sort of horror comedy but it misses both targets by the proverbial mile & it is neither funny nor scary. the best thing about this film is actress randall in her pvc & leather outfit running around trying to find the jewel & that's hardly worth sitting through this rubbish to see. there's a half decent runaway car scene with a few crashes but it looks like it was edited in from a completely different film & given wynorski's track record i'm sure it was. forget about any gore as there isn't any.<br /><br />technically ghoulies iv sucks, it's obvious it had & low budget but that simply isn't an excuse for it to be this bad, is it? liapis is back in the cast although he probably wishes he'd stayed away, pvc clad babe randall is easily the best thing about this film which says a lot.<br /><br />ghoulies iv is crap, there's nothing else to say really. i honestly can't see anyone who enjoy films getting anything out of this, i just can't. i can't believe that i'm going to recommend the original ghoulies over anything but it's going to happen now because even though that's crap as well it's a hell of a lot better than ghoulies iv, one to avoid folks & you can thank me later. the things i sit through so you don't have to, honestly...
