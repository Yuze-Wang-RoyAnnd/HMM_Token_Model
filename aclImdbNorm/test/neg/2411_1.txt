i'm sure i saw future kill for the same reason as most people: the awesome poster by hr giger. and like everyone else, i was disappointed to find that the movie could not live up to the poster (giger said that director moore actually begged him to do it). when i first saw this, at the age of 14, i thought it was the worst movie ever made. i'd still think that if i hadn't seen certain movies on mst3k since then.<br /><br />the plot has a bunch of annoying college boys driving into the "mutant city" to kidnap a gang-leader for their fraternity. that's when they meet splatter (ed neal), a mutant/cyborg/psycho who kills the gang leader and blames it on the frats as an excuse to hunt them down and seize power. the rest of the movie consists mostly of chases. a hand-full of frats try to battle their way out of mutant city (which i think is supposed to be la, even though it was made in texas). there's some pseudo-political stuff about the frat boys' society being pro-nuclear weapons and the mutant-society being anti-nuke. there's talk of how splatter became a freak due to radiation. most people develop cancer from radiation, but splatter just shoots spikes and slaughters girls. yeah, that makes tons of sense. at one point, our heroes rescue a mutant girl from two pro-nuke police, and she shows them "how the other half lives." the other half, it turns out, are all punk kids who dance around to a bad 80s pop-band. so our little epic is both dumb and dated. that's really all there is to it. frat boys running around in messed up buildings while guys who look like bikers try to kill them... oh, and it's the future.<br /><br />i don't think you'll have any doubt about why ron w. moore never made another movie. this thing is a real stinker. if you like giger, buy his books (they have the poster without the horrors of the movie), or just watch alien again. future kill is a waste of time that nobody needs.<br /><br />if this description makes the picture sound good, there's another crappy movie that does the same thing, only bigger and better: after the fall of new york. it's crap, but it blows future kill off the screen.
