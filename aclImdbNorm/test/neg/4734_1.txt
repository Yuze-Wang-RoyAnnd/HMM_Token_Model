this is the worst movie i've ever seen, and it takes the price of the rotten movie of 2007 (which is made by me), anyway this movie misses every single ingredients of a good movie, i mean come on the actors had a bad performance, the story is just crap. i'm really, really disappointed they could have done better stuff, than this piece of junk. i've just wasted my time and my money on this movie. i wish that the production company could give back my money. anyhow i'd high expectations on this movie, and i've got disappointed. i don't recommend anybody to watch this. so if u wanna waste ur money on something do it on some thing else than this piece of junk.
