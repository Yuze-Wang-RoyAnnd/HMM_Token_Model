i remember when this show came out. it was originally advertised as a mini-series. at the end of the last episode it said "to be continued" to the dismay of all the people who had watched the whole boring beyond words thing. it ended as it was supposed to, so yes, you can blame the series for having no ending. the plan was for there to be another obviously if ratings had been higher, but it was a boring show that way too long, and annoyed people by not ending when it said it would, so they never made any more. quite a few of the comments blame its cancellation and lack of ending on the viewing public, when the truth is that for this show that is not the case, it ended the way it was actually planned to end, it is just a lousy ending.
