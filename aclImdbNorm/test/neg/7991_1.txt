this movie is such a total waste of time. i can't understand anyone sitting through this piece of trash. oh, i would have loved it when i was seven years old. i think a seven year old child may have written and directed it.<br /><br />there's no script, no acting, just rubbish. the best acting is that by the fighting roosters. i think i could whip these ninjas and i am not someone you'd consider tough. totally unconvincing and did not spark the least bit of interest. i was yawning, and laughing, by the end of the first ten minutes of the film. this is one that would turn people away from martial art movies. great comedy, bad action flick.
