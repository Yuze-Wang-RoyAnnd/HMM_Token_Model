the horrific production doesn't qualify as a "film." it was obviously shot on video tape, and very poorly at that! there is a constant screaching sound for the audio(sounds like a bad microphone), which is so annoying that you sometimes cannot understand what the characters are saying. badly dubbed-in music will suddenly appear in a scene, and the entire editing of this thing rates about a zero!<br /><br />the plot is contrived and ridiculous. a late 20's gay man trying to hide his live-in lover from parents visiting? please! and the reaction the mother has when she finds a picture of her son kissing his boyfrioend is beyond melodramatic and rolls right into stupid. talk about a stereotypical view of gay life! the acting is worse than a porno movie, and the direction is very poor!<br /><br />as far as "production" goes, there isn't any!<br /><br />this title is simply a lame videotaped attempt to call itself a "film." there is no heart and soul to give it even the smallest bit of praise.<br /><br />it's just a stupid waste of time, so avoid it at all costs! bad acting! bad writing! bad directing , and the title of "producer" is vanity as this trash probably costed them the price of the videotape they shot it on.<br /><br />this ametuer garbage has no business getting released onto a dvd as it's deceptive to the cunsomer. i cannot stress how horrible this "sugarplum" crap is!<br /><br />
