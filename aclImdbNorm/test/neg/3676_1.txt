this movie is total dreck. i love val kilmer and was very surprised earlier this year by "felon" (a good movie!). the entire dvd box is misleading. val kilmer while being billed as one of the main people in this film, is in the movie for about 2 minutes. even the summary on the back of the dvd is not entirely true. this could have been a good movie but the direction was horrible and the plot was about as thin as a sheet of paper. usually when a movie is this horrendous you can sit back and laugh at it. this film though is so bad and boring i actually fell asleep to it (which i never do during a movie). avoid at all costs!
