this movie was just horrendous. how could anybody like this movie, and for the ones who liked it because of the jokes, they should really take a long hard look in the mirror and ask themselves if stereotypes are not bad. ignoring the face of the racial stereotypes, this was just awful. it never had its moments, if it paid homage to 1980's, "airplane!", it needs to pay some more. awful acting, terrible script writing, even for a movie with mo'nique or tom arnold. this movie was bad from the beginning, but people might have seen the whole thing, by the thought that the plane would crash. one of the worse movies ever, stay away.
