what an utter disappointment. forget this abysmal film and get hold of the tv series instead. what on earth were they doing making the american president relatively sane? all the politicians should have been bumbling buffoons (peter cook is good as the british pm). it lacks the biting satire of the original, going instead for "lowest common denominator" slapstick. 1 out of 10 if i'm being generous! this is unfortunately yet another example of a remake which totally misses the point of the original, the difference with this one being that they were both written by the same people.
