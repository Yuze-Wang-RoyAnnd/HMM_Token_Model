this is a perfect example of the 90's mainstream horror crap.nothing is scary here and the film is almost bloodless.yes,there is some violence,but everything is politically correct like in a tv movie.this is not a completely bad picture,i can safely say that i found it quite enjoyable.however a lack of the originality really hurts "voodoo".all in all if you are a part of the mainstream audience and pseudo-horror movies like "scream" are your favourite then you'll love "voodoo",but if you want something very gruesome avoid this film.
