i carefully checked if there's another movie named as this one, and there isn't ! but i really don't think we all saw the same movie ! there's no way ! how can you vote more than "1" for this movie ?! the idea of this movie let's say it's acceptable. oh, and the acting of dan gordon (chris) is quite good. but those are the only two things acceptable in this project. the others are... awful ? it's a very delicate word to describe the acting of the other actors, the directing, the (so said) "special" effects, even the way that the crew was filming ! i don't even like the way that the camera operators were moving to record the scenes ! this may be the most miserable film i've ever seen. i really don't remember a movie lower than this one... maybe there is, but... i don't think so... ehh, what's done, it's done... that's the movie and there's too late for anyone to change anything. i've voted "1", but my realistic vote starts with a "-" (minus) in front....
