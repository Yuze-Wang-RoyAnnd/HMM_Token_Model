having read this story a while ago i was very excited to see the movie. i read the book again. it is one of my favorite nicholas sparks books. what i think what makes the story is the relationships. that was the down point for me in the movie because i think the relationships were poorly expressed in the movie. i have no idea what the point of changing main characters roles (tim's and alan's characters). the movie didn't at all capture john and savannah's relationship. maybe if you haven't read the book you might like this movie, but i thought it was so dull compared to the book. i thought channing was a great pick for john,but i had a feeling he was going to bring all young adults out to watch it, so i think it was more geared towards them. the ending cuts the whole point of the book out so i was also unhappy with that. i was hoping the movie was more like the notebook or a walk to remember and the way they captured the books. i do feel like i wasted a friday night out and 10 bucks on a sappy love story, not at all the story i was expecting to see.
