about 20 minutes into this lame excuse for a movie, i realized it reminded me of one of those annoying people at work who're always telling really lame jokes or doing extremely unfunny things, because they think it's funny and are trying to entertain everyone. <br /><br />this film is billed as starring traci lords, she's not that bad of an actress, but her lines aren't funny and she's not the star<br /><br />the acting is some of the most god-awful i've ever seen, except for lords, the girl who plays casey, and maybe the colonel-who seems oddly out of place. i can't imagine why a retired military colonel would want to start a snowboarding academy. do those even exist?<br /><br />the budget would've been better spent coaxing these women into doing a full length porn feature. <br /><br />"freddy got fingered" currently has a 3.5 score, "frostbite" has a 2.7. i'm baffled these two movies are within a 1.0 to each other, fgf is "the godfather" compared to this garbage.<br /><br />1/10 stars
