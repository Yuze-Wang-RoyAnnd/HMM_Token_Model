dee snider is the villain in this movie and his bad acting and overacting kind of ruined it for me. the whole movie just seemed to take itself too seriously. it tries to achieve the dark atmosphere of "seven" without the good acting. the movie highlights the urban industrial rock / tattoo / body art "subculture" and expects us to be impressed (scared?) by the size of a guy's nose ring. i'm not a expert on movies but the script and acting in this movie are just awful. dee snider looks the part of the villain but his acing is downright horrid. i recommend not wasting the time on this one unless nothing else is available.
