a few years ago i saw the scent of green papayas by the same director. my feelings about both films are in fact the same: beautifully shot, but terribly slow and boring. i saw this film in a sneak preview, and left after half an hour. couldn't stand it anymore. how can one make an interesting film about people who are constantly telling each other how happy they are, and how perfect their lives are.........? i had a fantasy about a forgotten american g.i., still wandering around in the vietnamese jungle, who was not aware the war had ended. how he would suddenly pop up in the film, and would start emptying his m16 at the characters in the movie. the red of their blood would make a beautiful contrast with all the green plants in the film........... so i was not very much gripped by this film! time to leave!
