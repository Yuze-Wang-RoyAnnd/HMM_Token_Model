...and that's saying something. no matter how bad a movie gets, i'm normally able to sit through it so i can judge the full movie. through this one, i made it about 20 minutes.<br /><br />maybe it was the dvd, or maybe it was my laptop, but i could not hear the dialogue, even with the volume turned all the way up. sound effects were fine, so with the volume turned up to hear the dialogue, i was blowing out my eardrums with the effects. as much as i wanted to see this thing through, i wasn't going to sacrifice my hearing for it.<br /><br />from what little i could tell about the plot, the movie was one big flashback by the main character's daughter. it seems the mother, a military pilot, had to flee her ship because the one person on her ship she trusted turned out to be one of the enemy and now he is pursuing her across a desert planet.<br /><br />the only thing i liked about the movie was the look of the main character; there was something i liked about her hairstyle.<br /><br />oh well, looks like this one is going into the dumpster...
