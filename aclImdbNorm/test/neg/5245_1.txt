good: technomusic accompanying medieval swordplay. also, the movie looks sleeker than most b-movies, but let's face it: quake or doom has more atmosphere.<br /><br />bad: unintelligent plot, no acting and totally unbelievable universe. i am usually able to see the potential of even very bad movies; heck, i love a good b-movie like "split second" and the likes. but this one has has nothing but boredom and clich'e to offer... totally predictable from start to end. oh, and i forgot the lousy special effects, they look more like an old playstation game than anything out of myth! the use of a classic poem to sell this sucker offends me!<br /><br />conclusion: quite simply boring. if you want to see lara croft, buy the game, it's way sexier!
