this film may be great, but it is a complete ripoff of bill forsythe's comfort and joy. c&j is one of the sweetest films i've ever seen without becoming diabetic.<br /><br />it's ok if you do like it, but realize that everything in this film is a direct rip-off.<br /><br />the original is http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0087072 i can recommend almost anything by forsythe - local hero, gregory's girl, that sinking feeling. i better go rent some tonight. local has a young peter capaldi, and an old burt lancaster.<br /><br />unfortunately he's given up film-making after some really crappy hollywood treatment. sad.
