this has to be one of the, if not the worst movies i have ever seen. after watching this piece of sh*t i felt as though i should write to madonna and demand compensation for my time, but now i feel that i should write madonna and demand a great 80s album (considering she can't record a good album to save her life anymore) in return for this disaster. <br /><br />on to the movie itself, which can be summed up like this:<br /><br />it consists madonna jumping around acting like a spoiled teenager who lost her way. she is trying to impress this absolute douche of an actor who plays "the lawyer' in the movie. but, the best was the ending. i was staring with my jaw on the ground into the television as the credits rolled by thinking to my self, "that's it? that's the ending? what a piece of sh*t!". if madonna wasn't a pop icon at the time of this film, this movie would have single handedly destroyed her career. and the funniest thing of the whole situation was that i just watched the damn movie to see where they placed the song "who's that girl". well, guess where they placed it?...................................at the end!
