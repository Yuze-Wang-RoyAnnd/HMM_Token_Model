i hate to be too critical, but this one really was bad. i like the baldwin brothers, i just wish there was more talent evenly spread between them. i did like the general plot, but there was just too much 'trying' and not enough actual 'doing' as far as quality acting was concerned. <br /><br />my favorite character out of the whole thing was bald cop. he reminded me of dmitri valtane ( jeremy roberts, i believe ) from start trek 6: undiscovered country. just, without the hair.<br /><br />if you have hollywood video's mvp program and are really trying to get your money's worth, then through this in with one of the three mvp movies you pick up. it's worth it for a few laughs.<br /><br />the single most impressive special effect in the whole show is the sound of stephen baldwin's rifle firing. i suppose that lets you in a bit on the quality and excitement of the rest of the show.
