first off, i just want to say that this show could've done well, way better than it's doing now. what brought it down was certainly the acting. miranda cosgrove, who acts as the main character carly, looked almost worthy of her own show when she was on drake and josh. unfortunately, icarly was a big let down. not only can miranda not act convincingly enough, but she's incredibly stiff when she moves. she looks as if she's not sure how the character "carly" would move or stand. in the very first episode at the end when she throws the hat up, her arm doesn't ever leave her side from her elbow up. even when she was dancing she looked like a stick in the breeze. and the singing? the theme song was great, only because drake had been in it, the music was pretty good and miranda's voice sounded fake. i have to admit, the plot and settings are good, unrealistic, but hey, that's nick. they're practically known for stupid lines and characters. but wow, is icarly the worst of them all.
