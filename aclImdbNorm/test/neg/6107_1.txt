the film is a gross misrepresentation of orthodox lifestyle and practice. never will a jewish court enforce a divorce between childless couples. although the concept exists in jewish law, the conditions are too numerous for it to actually ever take place. childless couples do find it difficult to cope with their childlessness in a community where children are a very important part of life, but nowhere are they "rejected" by their community as depicted in the film. they are treated with extreme sensitivity. in fact, many great rabbis have lived their entire lives without children and never considered divorce.<br /><br />the depiction of yosef, a horrible human being, is meant to - perhaps subconsciously - show the behavior of a typical orthodox male. in reality, it is as typical as a violent drunkard rapist is typical of secular society. both exist in their own worlds and both are despicable.<br /><br />it is surprising that so many people form their opinions about a society based on a movie (by someone who is personally biased against a community). i have always thought that it is only the orthodox, because of their narrow-mindedness and insular lifestyle, who judge all secular people based on the violence and immoral conduct they read about in newspapers or see in the movies.
