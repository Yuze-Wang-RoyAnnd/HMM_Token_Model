i have no idea why people are so crazy about the show. it is so boring. the jokes are not even close to what we usually say funny. it's like, alex say something that is not funny nor interesting and then suddenly there's a laughing sound background. my friend and i just looked at each other with blank look as if we asked each other, "what's so funny?!!". seriously, every time we watched that show, you wouldn't hear any laughing or coughing. just a blank look. so we stop watching it. i am personally a fan of sitcoms, so i tried to watch the show. but the show us such a disappointment. this show might be one of the worst comedy sitcom ever...
