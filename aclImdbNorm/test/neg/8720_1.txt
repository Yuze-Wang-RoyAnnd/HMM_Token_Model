this is a total piece of crap. it is an insult to the awesome book by frank herbert. they have mangled the story and characters. the acting is average to bad. the only character done right and played well is duke leto, played by william hurt. unfortunately, he dies pretty early in the story and then its all downhill from there (not that its a very tall hill to begin with).<br /><br />the 1984 movie was directed by the legendary david lynch. i was not overly impressed with the movie, but considering the technological limitations of the time, they tried their best. amazingly, the crappy mini series makes it look so much better by comparison. it was at least somewhat true to the book, which i really love. <br /><br />they had the chance to do it right this time, sadly it was not taken.
