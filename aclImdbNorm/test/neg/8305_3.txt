low budget, but still creepy enough to hold your interest in another take off on the familiar frankenstein story. this movie is also known as lady frankenstein. the alluring tania frankenstein(sara bay)fresh from medical school arrives at her father's estate to find that he is still up to his old tricks. baron frankenstein(joseph cotten)is murdered by his own creation and now his daughter decides to carry on the family tradition by creating herself a lover. this is closer to being an eerie melodrama than horror flick. supporting cast features mickey hargitay, paul whiteman, paul muller and herbert fux. a rainy night could amplify the atmosphere. still a fun watch.
