**spoilers** the killer in the movie doesn't wait a second as we see him sneaking into a girls shower and hacking her to death taking her severed and bloodied arm as he makes his getaway. we then get this official looking prologue, as if were watching a true story, stating that a number of gruesome murders were committed in the late fall of 1985 in a small mid-western collage.<br /><br />grandfatherly looking, and hearing impaired, sheriff ron delboys is baffled by this murder and later when the murders of local collage students, all women, continues his run for state senator is in jeopardy with him bumbling the investigation at every turn. there's at least two times when delboys says that they'll never be another murder as long as he's on the case and within minutes another murder happens.<br /><br />finding a golden amulet at the scene of each murder the sheriff's daughter, the collage librarian, tina finds this reference book about withcraft indicating that the amulet is a symbol of a witches cult that originated in the early 1700 just after the salem witch trials. this cult was out to avenge the 19 accused witches hung by the local townspeople back in 1692 and they went out at night killing men and women of authority and taking off with a body part. when the body parts would form a complete person they would be burned in an occult midnight bonfire ritual.<br /><br />you never get a handle to what's exactly happening in the movie "blood cult" not just because it's totally disjointed story but it's ever more outrageous and grad-school level acing especially by charles ellis playing the butterfingered sheriff ron delboys. getting himself into more trouble then even the on the loose killer could have gotten him into. the bumbling sheriff delboys ends up with his head busted coffee spiked as well as almost burned alive, after being dismembered. the only reason he wasn't is because he seemed to have dreamt it all up while under the influence of some strong and unnamed drug.<br /><br />there's a weird dream sequence in the movie suggesting that a number of highly respected members of the community are members of the witches cult that's responsible for the sorority murders. the movie doesn't bother to explain at all if the dream, that the drugged sheriff delboys had, was a dream or actually a real experience on his part by dropping the whole thing as if it were cut out of the movie!<br /><br />getting out of the hospital and staking out the collage sorority house, while munching down a bag full of mcdonald cheeseburgers, sheriff delboys finally comes face to face with the killer. shefiff delboys find out to his shock and amazement that not only does he know who he, or she, is but he's also willing to let the killer escape!<br /><br />the very first straight to video motion picture and it shows. not only would no one it their right mind be crazy enough to pay admission, at least with the video you can tape over it thank god, to see this disaster but no movie-house owner would dare play it on their screen without the danger of the outraged patrons, in a justifiable show of righteous indignation, tear the place apart!
