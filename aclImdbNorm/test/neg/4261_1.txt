and the worst part is that it could have been good. but something horribly wrong. first thing first, they should not have cast amitabh bachchan in this film at all. he is too much of an icon to tackle such a delicate and controversial topic let alone the role itself. <br /><br />secondly, ram gopal varma ought to be ashamed of himself for taking the classic story of lolita and turning it into a pathetic predictable slut-fest. his lolita is named jia (played by newcomer jiah khan) and when we meet her, she is devoid of any inkling of stolen innocence or that delicate naivety that one would normally associate with the complicated tale of the original lolita who in the original story, gradually becomes nymphet. varma's jia is already a whore with her eye on the prize even even before the camera meets her. and he exercises no chastity in the way his films his leading nymphet. from constant panning shots of her crotch to fixations on her vulgar gestures and mannerisms, mr. varma makes sure he has left not one person in the audience less than uncomfortable with his voyeuristic pedophile camera angles. <br /><br />oh and let's not talk about the non-existent chemistry between jia and her so-called friend ritu (bachchan's character's daughter). these girls are supposed to be best friends yet look like worst enemies even before anything goes wrong between them. nothing they do together is believable until they become enemies. maybe mr. varma should have worked on that aspect of his script rather than focusing on destroying any credibility amitabh bachchan might have had left as an actor. <br /><br />the worst part of the movie is perhaps the subservient portrayal of the character of bachchan's character's wife. her role was so underwritten and ridiculously wooden that it's impossible to actually feel any pity or concern for her. i actually felt like reaching into the screen slapping her for not reacting like any normal woman would. instead she just stood there looking irritated and helpless, as i imagine much of the viewers of this film might feel after watching this train-wreck of a film. watch at your own risk.
