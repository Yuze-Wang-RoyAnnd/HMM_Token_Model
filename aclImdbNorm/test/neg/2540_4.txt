this movie was different from most of jimmy cangey's films of the 1930s in that it was not done by warner brothers/first national, but was a loan-out to a smaller studio. because it was a "poverty row" studio, the production values are lower than you might be used to seeing with cagney films. plus, the plot is certainly one of the strangest i have seen. instead of him being a gangster, he was a good guy in this one--fighting for the law. this isn't all that unusual because cagney frequently played lawmen--such as an oss leader (the forefather of the cia) of fbi agent. but, to make him an investigator for the bureau of weights and measures was indeed odd--especially since, at times, he acted pretty much the same way he did in the movie g-men! <br /><br />all in all, a time passer and that's about it.<br /><br />finally, the videotape i saw this on from memory lane video was perhaps one of the poorest i have ever encountered. the sound was terrible and scratchy and the print looked very white and had lots of torn film and gaps.
