this television show, is a idiotic waste of time if you want to learn<br /><br />about animals watch the discovery channel. if you want to watch<br /><br />nincompoops on television just watch mtv. mtv stands for music television<br /><br />not nitwit d-listers preforming retarded skits or bratty kids crying<br /><br />their hearts out for not getting a bmw for there 16th birthday. i bet<br /><br />that if you like this show i bet you love viva la bam, and jackass huh? i think my iq dropped ten points watching this show. <br /><br />this is a combination of two shows jackass and the animal planet<br /><br />some people think this is a good combination.<br /><br />i on the other hand think it is retardant.<br /><br />and if you notice its a lot like jackass<br /><br />and viva la bam<br /><br />just a note, this show is horrible
