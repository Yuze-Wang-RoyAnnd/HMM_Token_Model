why wasn't this voted for best picture of 1998? this has to be the best movie ever. it makes something like citzen kane look like utter crap, come on, citzen kane wasn't even in color! i love this movie, it has to be the best movie i've ever put money down on. i am still shocked that it wasn't nominated for anything!<br /><br /> if 10 is the highest you can give it, i give it 20!
