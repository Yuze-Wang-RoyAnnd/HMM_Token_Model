now i've seen it all. just when i thought it couldn't get any more pathetic and cheesy than "woodchipper massacre," just when i thought dialogue and acting couldn't get worse than "nail gun massacre," just when i thought "don't go in the woods" would retain its title as lousiest slasher film ever, along comes "the last slumber party!" somehow, this cheap, wretched manure manages to avoid lewdness, but it remains terrible! i couldn't believe my eyes--for once i can't complain about excessive (or in this case, any) nudity in a slasher film, but it still managed to make me crimson with embarrassment for renting it. never before have i seen such horrible acting, dialect, direction, writing,....i could go on forever with this list! here's a quick run-down:<br /><br />a mental patient somehow escapes from the loony bin, dresses up like a surgeon, somehow finds out where his doctor lives, and breaks in while the doctor's daughter is having friends over for the night. then begins the most stupid killing spree (ripped off from other movies such as "slumber party massacre" and halloween") this side of the universe. the characters have negative iqs, which suggests they are not human. then again, i guess they are not, since they have the tendency to bleed kool-aid when they get cut, as the slasher likes to show use when he holds up his scapel to the camera in way too many scenes. it is only 80 minutes...how many times must we look at that scapel like that before it consumes the whole movie?...which i suppose wouldn't be all that bad of an idea in this case! there is one moment where i thought maybe, just maybe, the director would make it interesting (a second killer was added), but alas! it was not to be! and then to insult even further, there is a stupid super cop-out sub-ending and an even stupider final conclusion. that probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but i would hate to give away the dumbest few scenes in movie history to those two or three fools (like me) dumb enough to rent this sewage.<br /><br />i sure hope that, by writing this, i have saved 80 minutes of someone's life. i get on my hands and knees to beg anyone still thinking about renting this: please, please, please don't! this is a fan of the slasher genre talking; i know what is good for you! the only real victims in this rattlebrained, asinine nonsense are the poor morons that have sat through the whole toilet tank! zanatos's score...since there is no negative point scale, i have to give it a 1, but a below-average 1 at that. avoid it at all costs....please!!!!
