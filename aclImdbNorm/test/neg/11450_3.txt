i must have been in a good mood to give this shameful, predictable, embarrassing movie even a 3. what's wrong with it? let's start with the gratuitous sex although i admit the rotational style of bonking was something i had not seen (nor experienced) before. and i guess they also saved a few bucks by showing the same sex scene three times. then there are the inconsistencies. the "oakville tribune" seems to be in a green part of whatever town it was supposed to be. (hamilton ontario???) yet in the scenes on the roof, it appears to be in an industrial area with a steel mill belching smoke and flames. also, the inside of the building --- the newsroom --- the stairways --- seem much bigger than the outside. spoilers here then, when our intrepid reporter finally gets fired, she comes back to the building several times, once after hours. hardly likely. the ending is also pitifully predictable...the classic bait and switch caper in which the good guy turns out to be the bad guy. but my major objection is the fact this is yet another movie financed with canadian and ontario tax credits which is ashamed to set itself in canada, yet again proving that the canadian film industry is craven and opportunistic. a country's movies must do more than just provide jobs. they should reflect the culture. it's bad enough that the american studios use toronto as a stand in for new york. but it is embarrassing and infuriating when canadian producers (in this case, canwest global) do it with help from the federal and provincial governments. in a word... bah!
