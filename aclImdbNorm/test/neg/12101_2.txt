what a waste of energy and money. what a waste of what talent there was.<br /><br />emilio estevez was completely wasted and mostly unused throughout. jon lovitz was very mildly amusing but pointless. harry dean stanton - why bother? and was it just me or can kari wuhrer barely act in this one.<br /><br />the story was pretty non-existent and really disjointed. one of my biggest problems was the reaction of the characters to the events that transpired. like the surf "dudes" giving up their lives every time they were threatened in the last half? how about that you never saw them surf once!! the set-up to some scenes took way to long with not enough pay-off to make us give a damn. nothing in this "movie" felt really true or genuine.<br /><br />the only good things i can say is some (very little) of the scenery was filmed nicely and a few scenes were mildly interesting. don't see this when there is so many better pointless movies out there.
