well i watch tons of movies and this one really sucked ... big time. i am sure we are all sick and tired of the low budget ploy to make vampire movies using some "martial arts teacher" turn "actor" type of movies. i am also so tired of the guy knowing some form of fighting technique and then able to fight his way through a somewhat boring movie. i forced myself to watch it and one of the main reasons were that the lead actress is quite pretty (ha-ha) well i hope this helped a bit and if you have time and want to give your brain a rest watch it!!! well hopefully one day this type of movies will not be released but then hey where will all the low budget actors go :-) <br /><br />the movie also contains many bloops but that i will leave to you to find because it adds quite a bit of fun while watching and also if you a bit of a perfectionist it will bother you ;-) cheers!!
