... what a porn movie would look like if you took out the sex and just left in the bad dialog, cheap sets and bad acting, you would have galaxina.<br /><br />this film came out when the original star wars proved there was a market for science fiction. this in turn lead to some gems such as alien and a revitalized star trek. unfortunately, it also led to some bad movies, and this was obviously one of them. (i say obviously, because i hadn't even heard of this film until a few days ago.i missed it when it came out in 1980.) <br /><br />here's the underlying problem. dorothy stratton couldn't act, so for most of the movie, they didn't even let her try. i understand her tragic death has given this film an undeserved cult status, but for the life of me i can't understand why.<br /><br />clearly, the movie tried to spoof star wars, star trek and aliens, but they clearly don't understand than when you spoof something, it has to be funny! this movie wasn't, or at least, the comic timing on jokes that could have been funny weren't. science fiction is ripe for parody, as spaceballs and galaxy quest proved. this movie, however, did it poorly.
