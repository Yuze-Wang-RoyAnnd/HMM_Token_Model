in yet another miserable attempt to make a quick hollywood cash-in of one of televisions greatest masterpieces, peter segal has created a monster. taken out of context, if one did not know brooks' work before viewing, the movie would be a lame big budget film that isn't sure if it wants to be fat joke and stupid comedy, or just an ordinary action film with nothing to move on. however, as a young generation y'er who just recently spent two months obsessing over the five seasons of get smart, the 60's tv show, this movie pained me from the moment i entered and saw steve carell dumbing down the part. the backstories, agent 99 getting plastic surgery and 86 as an analyst who was formerly morbidly obese, shames the complexity of the original duo and paints a flat boring reevaluation of them. it seems the screenwriters, unable to be truthfully funny in both dialogue and situation, fell back on lame set-ups for don adams famous lines, flashbacks to fat camp, references to carell's part in the office in the interview style camera angles they have, and a female chauvinism that falls flat on its face.<br /><br />for those who have seen the original, the writers of this movie thought they'd include some memories. they mention herbie, fang (now a worthless tiny furry dog that carell covets), the shoe phone, the cone of silence, and his classic red car and the doors and phone that intro'd the show. the classic music is back, but now everything is updated, generally for the worse. cone of silence is now some weird blue telekinetic force field, control headquarters are right under a museum that preserves control's past. the movie lacks any creative random tech, and replaces it with crossbows in swiss army knives. lots of the "humor" in the movie is carrel hurting himself, or another character being hurt, whether it be carrel spending two minutes shooting himself accidentally with the crossbow, or getting punched by security guards, or throwing up in airplanes. in the original, smart would insult a big foe, attack him with no success, and try to buddy up with him before getting pulverized. in this one, he attacks without success and gets pummeled. it seems the screenwriters didn't understand the humor was established with the dialogue and not the pointless violence. it's like they took the names from the show, and cut out all that made it good in the first place.<br /><br />the poster hides carell's face beyond that of hathaway's. the movie likewise, shies away from anything that could make it good. they intertwine the classic music with the over-dramatic action and romantic music in big-budget films. whereas the original fed off a campy feel, this one replaces quality with massive doses of cgi explosions and pow sound effects. i was really looking forward to this, as i finished the original series just two months ago and it ranked in my top five shows of all time. however, this was a massive disappointment. the credits say they collaborated with mel brooks and buck henry, but in all the things i've read on the internet, they were largely left out of the writing process. in conclusion, if you want to waste your money on a cash-in with little value and no respect to its namesake, go for it. but be prepared that the ride is not how you remembered it.<br /><br />ps: i almost forgot the george bush humor. they mention "nuculor", falling asleep at fine art, president's working for their vice pres, and appreciating tackles over solving real problems. if you're into hearing the same jokes you heard 3-4 years ago in big budget movie form, chuck your money here.
