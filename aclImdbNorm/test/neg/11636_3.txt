this movie didn't do it for me, an avid snl fan for the past 14 years. jamie gertz' portrayal was ok, but there was something so off-putting about the movie itself. the facts presented in the movie are totally skewed. but merv griffin produced it, so that would explain a lot. he was never on snl, nor had anything to do with it. the points in her life when she was on snl are backwards. when we first see her on snl, walking through the studio with lorne michaels, the logo on the wall is circa 1988-1989, not 1975. and let's talk about the cast -- who are these people?? i have never heard of a one of them. truly dissatisfying. this movie shows why tv movies are just that, tv movies.
