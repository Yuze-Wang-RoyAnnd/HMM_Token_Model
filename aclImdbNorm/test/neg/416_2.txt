ron howard and his "editors" only had one job to do... follow the guidelines of the book which was "rich", "mysterious", "moving" and highly cinematic in its approach! <br /><br />what they did? they changed everything and i mean everything! what is left is something that has no right being called "angels & daemons"! <br /><br />i really love the book and find it very hard to see it being treated this way!<br /><br />i wonder what was the opinion of dan brown himself for "this" film.<br /><br />i really have no patience to sit down and right the 1.000.000 changes they made, it is pointless.......
