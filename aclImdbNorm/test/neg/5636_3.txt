i didn't know anything about this dvd when i hired it. had a quick look here at the comments but decided to keep an open mind. obviously an independent film and low budget but that didn't worry me. i will watch anything with derick jacobi and as always he played his part well. what a pity no one else did. i had watched 'atonement' a few weeks ago with vanessa redgrave and she was sublime. in this she seemed to just turn up to read the lines. in my opinion the main mistake was in casting vinnie jones. to be honest i saw his picture on the dvd cover but didn't notice that he got top billing. a sticker was strategically placed over his name! it was watchable and i quite liked the dickens story alongside present day. maybe with a more capable actor playing the lead this might have worked better. still it was weak.
