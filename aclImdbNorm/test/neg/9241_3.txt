harmony korrine - hate him or hate him? on this evidence, loathe might be a better word. not him of course, just everything he does. but it could've been so different because the first ten minutes of this film promises so much including a fantastic idea of a michael jackson impersonator falling in love with a marilyn monroe impersonator. fantastic. and set in paris! this could be great. but unfortunately, korrine may spark the odd decent idea but because he is an awful writer, the story fails on every level and the audience walkout i witnessed about an hour in is proof positive that he is the most boring and pretentious film-making out there. apparently the walk-out rate at its premiere in last years cannes festival was quite shocking. instead of focusing on the two protagonists, he switches the story stupidly to the confines of a ch^ateau to introduce a bunch of other impersonators making the whole experience tedious and narratively barren. when will the independent cinema stop funding this upstart?
