the mtv sci-fi animated series "aeon flux" is brought to life with charlize theron playing the title character, a freedom fighter who fights oppression in the walled city of bregna, 400 hundred years into the future. for her latest mission, she has been sent to kill the city's leader trevor goodchild (marton csokas), but she uncovers secrets along the way.<br /><br />aeon flux falls under the category of good premise, mediocre execution. interesting story yet the film was a little dull. a lot of people are saying that this is one of the worst movies of the year and that's not true at all. it may be a disappointing film but it's an average film at best. i have never seen the cartoon version of the movie so i can't compare the two. it's probably better because they have a chance to explain the story more. the film is not that confusing but it's easy to get lost if you're not familiar with the material. the acting was alright, nothing special. charlize theron gives a good performance and seems dedicated to the film. the rest of the cast also give decent performances including jonny lee miller, frances mcdormand and marton csokas. there are also more than a few interesting characters in the film including sithandra, aeon's friend.<br /><br />the problem with aeon flux is that it takes itself too seriously. it carries the same serious tone throughout the entire film and that gets a little tiring. there's no humor and the film becomes a little boring at times. this is the same problem that elektra had. because the film is so serious, the dialog sounds cheesy and the serious scenes seem forced. the action scenes are pretty good but that's not what the film is really about so don't go in expecting just an action movie. the twist at the end isn't mind blowing but it's still a nice ending and better than other thrillers that have come out this past year (hide and seek). the costumes are little weird but still look nice and interesting. the visuals were are also done well so the film at least looks nice. so, the movie may be a case of style over substance. interesting to look at but may not hold your attention for a very long time. in the end, it's not the best film out there but it might for a decent rental. rating 4/10
