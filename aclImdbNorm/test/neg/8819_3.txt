this early film from director bob clark ("porky's", "black christmas", "a christmas story") didn't really pump my nads like i expected. in fact, it straight up annoyed me. it's about a theater troupe who sail to a burial island, consisting of dead criminals, where they plan to conjure some evil forces and resurrect some corpses... the leader of their group, a conceited black-magic enthusiast and possible homosexual, attempts to summon satan's help with the re-animation of an exhumed body, which fails so they take the corpse to the nearby, deserted caretaker's house and play with it... nothing interesting happens until the last fifteen minutes or so when the undead finally spring from their graves and go after the desecrater's. the make-up effects are okay, the gore is very minimal (pg rating), and the extremely irritating characters are focused on way to much, which really got on my nerves. i guess having group of terrible actors bickering for an hour was suppose to equal some "comedic" status, yet i found no humor in it, whatsoever. the entire concept is just ridiculous - how these kids are willing to dig up and monkey around with a dead body for as long as they did. the characters are stereotypical and bland and the movie is just plain boring... don't waste your time with it...
