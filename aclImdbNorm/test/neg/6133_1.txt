okay, first i should say that i assume this was just made by a group of friends with a limited budget. with that in mind, it really shouldn't be compared to blockbuster features and my rating would be higher. but still...<br /><br />after giving it a chance, it still violated some basic film-making rules to such an extent that both the viewer and the amateur director in me cringed. a lot.<br /><br />think: blair witch in a car but really boring.<br /><br />think: you left your camcorder on the dashboard and recorded yourself getting lost in the park at night for an hour, then making your friends watch it.<br /><br />the scariest part (possible spoiler alert... if spoiling here is possible) was at one point the picture rewinds and you might think you will have to watch it all over again. scary.<br /><br />silliness aside, this is a pretty good idea for a low-budget lets-go-make-a-movie-tonight film. but the concept walks a fine line between being really good and really bad, and let's just say it wasn't really good. there were just too many parts where nothing happened. at first i thought that was the director's plan -- you were supposed to be lulled into a sense of security and then really scary things would start happening. but...no.<br /><br />i kept trying to find good things to say about it (and i had plenty of time to think), and i'll say the music was kinda cool. and i have to give the female lead credit for standing around by herself looking scared for a really, really long time. but that's it. the actors playing "infected" people looked as if they were making fun of zombie movies. or they got their motivation from the bug wearing his edgar suit from "mib." chances are, if for some strange reason you're going to watch this movie, it's on dvd or tivo, so you can fast forward it whenever waiting for something to happen gets too difficult.<br /><br />i hate to be so critical of something, but at the same time i've watched a lot of similar movies and nothing has ever been this painful. if they just chopped a half an hour out of it and added some scary stuff, it might be decent. maybe that'll be the director's cut...
