one wonders how flynn could have failed so badly as a cinema release in 1997 with guy pearce aptly in the lead role. it is not often that the casting of someone so famous is so exactly right. flynn was a stumbler at the box office and did not end up on cinema screens in australia...even after la confidential...! from a dazzling nude scene in the first few minutes (presumably by guy pearce) flynn gets off to a fairly robust and interesting start. sadly, flynn runs out of steam after about the first 35 minutes and with the entrance of hammy steven berkoff in a detour to new guinea, (looking and acting like he wanted the klaus kinski role in fitzcarraldo) the film starts to resemble a tele movie rather than a major cinema biography. believe it or not, by about the 70 minute make, it is boring and you are glad to see it over. but such promise! pearce is flynn! but the movie caused a mutiny at the box office and unlike the bounty, sank without trace.
