if you really really really enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt-mirrors, eating non-ants, and conquering the world with a voice-over narrative, then this is the movie for you. basically, a couple of scientists working out of a bio-dome communicate with highly intelligent ants (the most intelligent actors in this film) in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination. throughout the movie the two scientists (and a girl they rescued from the ants) use everything at their disposal (computers, green dye, and horrid acting), but to no avail. i guess they just couldn't afford any pesticides because the movie would be over too quickly.<br /><br />the title of the movie "phase iv" is something of a mystery. this is not a spoiler, but "phase i" starts right after the opening credits whereas you don't reach "phase iv" until the end credits roll. apparently the director knew the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed phases 1 - 3 throughout the movie as a kind of progress report: "hang in there buddy! only 1 more phase until final credits!" as a mst3k episode, this one wasn't very good for two reasons: 1) this one is from the season 0 on ktma when they were first starting out so the riffing is not as good as in later seasons; and 2) this movie is so bad not even j&tb can lighten it up. there are one or two gamera references as they had just finished riffing 5 gamera movies.<br /><br />the movie does have a trick/surprise ending, but i was so glad to reach the end the effect was lost on me.
