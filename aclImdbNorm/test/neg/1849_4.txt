inferno starts off with a fairly impressive for a tvm starscape effect . we`re also introduced to a scientist who`s called heller . don`t you get it ? heller , hell-er , inferno . so i guess someone on the production had some intelligence . however it does become more and more obvious as the tvm progresses that intelligence has been discarded throughout the storyline in order to appeal to an american tvm audience <br /><br />the story itself is overwhelmed by subplots featuring umpteen stock tvm characters like the tough liberal schoolteacher who`s trying to save a home boy from a life of crime , the doctor who`s lost his medical licence etc . in fact the story concentrates far more on these characters than the approaching disaster that all the potential tension and drama the scenario might have had soon goes up in a puff of smoke , and being a tvm we just know that there won`t be a downbeat ending <br /><br />there is an onscreen problem i noticed and that is everytime there`s an explosion there`s a massive fireball which looks ridiculous not to mention physically impossible . look at the scene where the national guard are in a fight with a gang . a soldier fires a grenade into a tower block and the whole building explodes in a fire ball . what a small greanade containing no more than a few ounces of high explosive can do that ! no it can`t . there`s also another scene of army engineers blowing up a dam with plastic explosive and the same fireball effect is seen . can directors please note that high explosive is not the same as napalm <br /><br />having said that i did find inferno highly watchable for a tvm and at no time did i find myself wanting to turn it off . it did have some potential and let me repeat the special effects are fairly good considering the budget and it`s not as bad a tvm as some people are making out
