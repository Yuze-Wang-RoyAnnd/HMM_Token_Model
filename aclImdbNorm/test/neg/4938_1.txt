ok this will contain spoilers. now i have never seen such a large pile of poop since the laxative/feed mix up at the elephant enclosure in the zoo! it has more plot holes than moth eaten lace and as for the 'realistic' plot line. well sexual slavery is a dreadful and very real world wide problem and this pile of bilge utilises this plague as a plot device to titillate and tease, shame on everyone involved for that piece of questionable judgement. but back to the film, if you were going to kidnap people from an airport, some of the most secure and camera happy places in the modern world by the way, then why plant a stoolie on the inside of the van who does bugger all until the plot needs a twist. just wait until you are out of the airport, pull the gun, handcuff the passengers, drive calmly to the warehouse and kill the guys, job done. on the passengers side, on at least three occasions the good guys have the bad guys incapacitated and are armed, waste them! once in a movie it can just be acceptable not to put a bullet in the bad guys skull, but come on three times! and after he's killed most of you. also the guy is willing to put down the gun to stop a scarred cheek but kills a girl for a yeast infection that could be cleared up with $20 dollars worth of drugs. i could go on and on about the amount of holes in this but i won't waste any more of my time. suffice to say that i have rarely been so insulted by such a dreadful piece of drivel and as for the real problem of sexual slavery, girls go voluntarily to new 'jobs' in distant lands and are abused, raped, and often killed by the gang master who meets them off the boat/plane and takes their passports and freedom. this s**t is an insult to anyone whose life has been affected by this! do not waste your time!
