underwoods goofy story about a young man(arquette) who convinces his friends that they should kidnap frank sinatra jr. (nicholas). the film is written ridiculously, direction is odd, dialogues are out of place and scrambled, the actors didn't do it much justice either, arquette is annoying throughout, ian nicholas was nonexistent, macy was decent, but only because hes a pretty good actor and probably just tried his best not to come out of this project with a totally embarrassing performance, he was at least tolerable. this is a stupid film in my eyes, boring at times, not entertaining, just a film that i wouldn't recommend to anybody. imdb rating: 5.5, my rating: 4/10
