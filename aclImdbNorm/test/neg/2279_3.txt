director/screenwriter allan burns seems to have patched two different scripts together before coming up with this minor outing: a comedy about infidelity and a melodrama about loss and sabotage. it results in a wincingly unfunny film. christine lahti plays a crass, cynical tv news reporter who makes friends with aerobics instructor mary tyler moore and is soon having dinner with moore and her family--only to discover mary's husband (ted danson) is lahti's secret affair! burns has a strange, stop-and-start rhythm to his dialogue which is neither realistic nor effective (just increasingly annoying, because nothing important ever seems to get said). rail-thin moore, looking alarmingly frail in her leotard, has a radiant smile but doesn't convince as danson's wife, and danson gets stuck with a paltry, thankless role (he's just there to be a cad). the movie attempts to cover all the bases in a classic case of overreaching (woman's role in the workplace, the tv news-biz, the cheating family man, the working wife and mother who wants more, a woman's need for female friendships, et al), but nothing substantial comes out of these ideas since burns only half-heartedly examines the issues. as a writer, he is surprisingly free of punchlines, but is devoid of a purpose as well, and the heavy plotting just gets all fouled up. *1/2 from ****
