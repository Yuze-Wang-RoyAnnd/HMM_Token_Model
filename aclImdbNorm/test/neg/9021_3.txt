what distinguishes some of the 'lone star' films (and many others in western and adventure films of the early thirties) was their lack of what we recognize as formulaic story telling. to be sure they had good vs. evil (the basic element of any western), boy meets girl and some stock characters, such as the old rancher and his beautiful daughter or grand daughter, and sometimes the evil banker or other businessman, but the way the action played out was often different from film to film.<br /><br />'the lawless frontier' features earl dwire in his big star turn (not) as (for some inexplicable reason) pandro zanti, a 'half apache, half american posing as a mexican who speaks the language fluently.' his biggest posing as a mexican seemed to be his outrageous mariachi clothes. the only plot seems to be that he wants to steal ruby, the granddaughter of "old dusty" (gabby hayes). when meeting her for the first time, dwire gives her a long once over look that puts him in the big leagues with sexual predators. you'd think that because the opening scene shows zanti killing john (wayne) tobin's father off camera, it would play a bigger part in the film. it doesn't. too much chasing back and forth between heroes and villains.<br /><br />we get many good stunts, though, from yakima canutt, including pulling ruby up on his horse when he rides by, jumping on 'renegades' and knocking them off their horses, a horse leap off a cliff into a lake, and even the same slide down the sluice sequence that was in "the lucky texan" (1934), although this time the mighty yak uses a body surfing log instead of straddling a tree bough, and its inclusion is just as illogical this time too, since they are in a desert.<br /><br />the high point is clearly john wayne's measured and methodical well photographed walk across the desert after the fleeing and stumbling zanti with those fantastic basalt cliffs of red rock canyon (seen in countless serials, westerns and science fiction 'moon' movies) framed behind him. no final gun duel at fifty paces with the heroine running from the wooden steps of the bar to embrace and kiss the conquering hero in this movie! when john wayne finally catches up with him, zanti drinks poisoned water from a waterhole and dies.<br /><br />after a couple too many chase sequences, zantai's gang is finally captured in dusty's cabin, emerging one by one from behind a swivel cabinet that apparently leads to a canyon, now blocked off by having been dynamited. no riding off into the sunset or obligatorily kissing the girl: the final shot is ruby, now mrs. john tobin, on the telephone to the now sheriff john tobin, "what would sheriff tobin like for dinner?" the film also has poor lighting and editing at the beginning, the pacing is slow, some parts with the sheriff cause it to drag, and the horse chases fill up the film. so despite the different and unusual elements, it comes off as one of the weaker lone stars.
