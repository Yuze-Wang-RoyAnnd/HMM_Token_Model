i work in an office on weekends, and there is a tv that only gets one channel. so, i don't have the option of turning to something better. i keep it on, though, because it provides a little background noise. sometimes, i get a decent movie/show. not today. today, i got "breaker breaker." the city looks like a third rate set (which, of course, it is). all the actors and bad guys look like they just graduated from stuntman school. i have seen better dramatic enactments at a carnival. the special effects (flames at end of movie are more fake then michael jacksons masculinity). even the horse at the end of the movie was a terrible actor... a badly acted, badly shot, badly written movie.
