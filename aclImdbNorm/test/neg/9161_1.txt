i'm surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie. even my 4 and 6 year old were bored. the chipmunks are cute...but the storyline is overly obvious. not recommended for young ones with the least sophisticated tastes.<br /><br />we did hear a few laughs from the audience while we were in attendance; but i wondered why.<br /><br />i don't admit to ever being a 'chipmunks' fan, but i expected to be entertained. it's not even an 'escapist' movie as far as i can tell. simply a heavy handed view of 'success too young spoils'. we've seen more than enough of that with britney spears, et al, haven't we?<br /><br />don't bother.
