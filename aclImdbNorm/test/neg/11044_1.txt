this movie was one of the longest movie watching experiences of my life. while i like how the director, chan-wook park, handled the revenge, the move as a whole was terrible. oldboy is only billed at 1 hour and 55 minutes long but it feels like it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell this story. i will say that the english dubbing was done very well and the movie was easily understandable. i felt that some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and a lot of the dialogue repeated itself. also, if you have an aversion to annoying voices, then avoid hearing hye-jeong kang (she plays mi-do) speak. if you are looking for a movie to kill time and make you feel morally superior to others, then watch away. if you don't want to watch a movie filled with incest, bad dialogue, unnecessary fight scenes, gross torture scenes and confusing flashbacks, then this is not the movie for you.
