well, this stripped my nerves raw, they got that right. i first rented this movie back in the 80's, when my friend opened a video store that carried every rare movie he could find. he also carried all the shock, horror, and exploitation movies he could dig up, and i went through almost of all them. previously i had seen blood feast and 2000 maniacs, and the wizard of gore. they were gruesome (especially for the time period), and the wizard of gore got pretty nasty. the gore-gore girls, however, was the one i remember as being the most disgustingly gory.<br /><br />i rented it on dvd a little while ago because i wanted to hear the commentary, and thought it might have some cool dancing and clothes. i forgot that it was made in the early 70's, so fashion had kind of gone downhill by then. i also realized this was a movie i didn't really need to see more than once. it had amusing parts, but gaaaah! it was much more disgusting than i remembered. i'm very jaded to movie gore but a couple of times i just got too grossed out and had to look away. this wasn't a good choice of movie to put on dvd all crisp and cleaned up with better sound and picture quality. the commentary is amusing in parts, and interesting (i think hg said the budget was $6100.00) maybe hg lewis wasn't feeling well that day, but he sounded tired overall and also had the nerve to get offended when the interviewer from something wild compared him to ed wood jr. sorry pal, but you're not exactly martin scorsese yourself.<br /><br />the extremely thin plot is about a series of murders of topless go-go dancers in strip clubs. a cute reporter and a really unattractive private detective team up (sort of-he can't seem to stand her) to try to solve the crimes. henny youngman owns a strip club. a bunch of really ugly murders happen.<br /><br />i'm going to apologize in advance because i don't want to sound like i need to lighten up, but this movie was so misogynistic it p***ed me off more than "company of men". mainly because the main character's and the director's extreme dislike for females- and the audience- just oozes from every frame. it's not just the murders. the highly unattractive detective goes out of his way to treat the female reporter like dog dirt at every opportunity, for no apparent reason, (he's not exactly a threat to george clooney, like i said) and she still follows him around like a puppy. she faints upon seeing a horribly mutilated body and he looks distastefully at her, then pours cold soda from a can onto her face to wake her up. later he calls the police to report the crime- "no...no hurry...she just seems to have...lost face." this guy is the hero. you can imagine how the other characters feel about women. i could go on and on but you get the idea. please note that i am making this movie sound much more politically correct (and much more fun) than it actually is.<br /><br />most of the cast are the type of actors you pray will never take their clothes off- not too easy on the eyes, so don't watch the movie just to see the nudity unless you're not too picky. the go-go dancers all look like they desperately want to have the scene end so they can get their $10 or whatever the going rate hg paid them was and get their drug fix. ok, it's not quite that bad, there was one dancer that looked like she might have been a pro and also one other cool dancer with a huge afro that didn't look as miserable as the rest, but still not too thrilled. the only slightly entertaining things were a couple moments of brief unintentional humor, such as when a policemen in charge at a murder scene angrily yells "get outta here before i have you all arrested!" not to a bunch of reporters but to some other policeman calmly going about their work (they mutter and stroll off, though). henny youngman is kind of funny though, like lewis says, he said his lines so fast that they almost needed subtitles (i'm sure he was trying to get the whole day over in a hurry so he could get paid and get the hell out of there, though he doesn't look like he minded watching some naked chicks).<br /><br />might be worth seeing just out of morbid curiosity- for the era the movie was made, it was probably the most gruesome thing on film at the time- or if you're really big hg lewis fan and find him or low-budget film-making by anyone fascinating. otherwise, if you've seen it once, you've seen it and can move on to other disgusting but much more entertaining low-budget movies from the early 70's...this movie doesn't even come close to, say, "pink flamingos" when it comes to the skip-the-popcorn factor. if you've never seen an hg lewis movie, i recommend you try "blood feast" first instead, you'll have a much better time.<br /><br />
