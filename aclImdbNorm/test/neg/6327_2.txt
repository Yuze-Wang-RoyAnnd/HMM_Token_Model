okay, the only reason i watched this movie is because krista allen is in it. since i admit to watching days of our lives... i know her as billie. oh sure, perhaps there will be a reason to watch this movie.. that would be the soft porn area. they seem to exel at that. and little else. i would hope anyone renting/buying this movie rented it only for the sex scene's. because if they bought/rented it for anything else, say quality tv, they may die of a heart attack. this movie involves little imagination whatsoever. while i do have a good laugh at it's stupidity, and perhaps i'll buy it myself, i am but a fool. rent before you buy on this one. 2 out of 10. (note i have yet to give a movie a 1 star. the sensual scene's alone gave itself and up from a 1. if they hadn't a straight 1 in the pot and i want a refund if it hadn't.)
