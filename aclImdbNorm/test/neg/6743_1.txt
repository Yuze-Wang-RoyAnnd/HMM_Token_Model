absolutely nothing is redeeming about this total piece of trash, and the only thing worse than seeing this film is seeing it in english class. this is literally one of the worst films i have ever seen. it totally ignores and contradicts any themes it may present, so the story is just really really dull. thank god the 80's are over, and god save whatever man was actually born as "james bond iii".
