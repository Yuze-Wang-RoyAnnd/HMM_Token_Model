it used to be that video distributors like sub rosa and brain damage films would release low-budget, shot-on-video horror films to a select market of gorehounds that ate them up with glee. that's acceptable to me, because you could see these movies from a mile away with their shoddy box art and cheesy titles.<br /><br />now we have lions gate getting into the mix, only they have decided that it'd be better to sucker in poor saps by putting a "professional" looking cover on it and charge the same price as one of their higher-budget, professionally made features. do not be suckered in by this! granted, if you've seen dark harvest 1 or 2 than you already know what to expect with 3 but there is a place for movies like this and it is not on a video store shelf beside professionally-made features.<br /><br />i am a fan of independent cinema and have watched several low budget, shot-on-video productions that were still a worthy rental but this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the "acting" (if you can call it that) was abysmal. it was amusing to laugh at the horrible line reading for a minute or two, but eventually it was too much to take and became unbearable. the story is bad, the dialogue is worse, the acting somehow manages to be even worse. the only possible saving grace to this would be one disemboweling scene that still manages to be awful but is an award winning effect when compared to the blood splatters after a girl is slapped or the mannequin decapitation.<br /><br />it took me three tries to make it through this entire movie and i only did so because i paid good money to rent it and felt like i should at least finish it all the way through. stay away - stay far, far away from this one.
