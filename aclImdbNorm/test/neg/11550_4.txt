"escanaba in da moonlight" is the first showcasing of jeff daniels writing and directing talents.<br /><br />i've seen worse debuts but this one isn't that great.<br /><br />"escanaba in da moonlight" starts off like as a decent parody of this part of american culture. as we follow rebuen soady (jeff daniels) on the eve of deer hunting season 1989. he is getting close to the record of oldest soady to never bag a buck.<br /><br />the film takes places in the upper regions of michigan and has all the normal cliche characters. but there is a warmth there that tells you, this isn't being mean spirited.<br /><br />well, reuben is heading off to the soady deer camp and before his wife (kimberly norris guerrero) gives him a native american necklace, his lucky hat, and two-forms of liquid you probably don't want to know about.<br /><br />anyway, she is really the only one who believe in him. he finally gets to the camp where his dad, albery soady (harve presnell) is waiting and his brother remnar (joey albright) is soon to show.<br /><br />okay, let's fast forward this. in here there are some laughs, a few moments when i chuckled a loud. but most of the jokes here are used a few to many times.<br /><br />but the biggest draw back is the spiritual/native american happenings. just when you settle in with the characters these strange things occur. but the special effects are so cheap all it is, is a big flash of light and then head quickly bobbing back in forth. <br /><br />and the ending, well it is worthless.<br /><br />the move itself wasn't bad, the quirky character, and fun parody were good. but it should've stayed at that. instead of having stupid spiritual awakenings that look like rejected scenes from some demon possession movie.<br /><br />i give "escanaba in da moonlight" a 4.5 out of 10.
