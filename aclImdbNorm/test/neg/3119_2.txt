i'm accustomed to being patient with films because i've generally found it usually pays off. but a few works take tedium to new levels and enter the realm of provocation...."last year at marienbad" comes to mind. well, "pola x" ain't no "last year at marienbad". i can count on one hand the number of films i've walked out on over the years. "pola x" achieved membership in that august group. in my defense, i believe i made a valiant effort to stand my ground - hoping things would turn around. however, i finally threw in the towel just shy of the 90 minute mark - quite respectable under the circumstances. "pola x" does not come anywhere near living up to the promise of carax's earlier work. after a 10 year hiatus, that must have been bitter for him indeed. melville is still spinning in his grave!
