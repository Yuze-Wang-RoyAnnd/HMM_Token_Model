only one word can describe mr magoo - slapstick. unfortunately this isn't no airplane. looks can decieve, and that's exactly what mr magoo does. based on the old cartoon, leslie nielson plays magoo, a bumbling near blind man whop stumbles upon a pair of jewel thieves. now he must hunt them down using...blindness basically. and that's all this film plays off. the blindness of mr magoo. now maybe if they had some funny jokes involving this, but pretty much it's just one of those " droopy dumb grin on your face because you're too ashamed to admit you payed to see this" films.<br /><br /> but mr magoo isn't as bad as it's hacked up to be. it's at least got some funny jokes, and it's good wholesome fun for the whole family (nielson tried to make a "naked gun" for families in magoo, but it's no where near as good as that). so see it once, you might hate it, you might love it, whatever. i personally didn't hate it, but i sure didn't like it, or even rate it "okay." 2/5 stars for mr magoo-<br /><br />john ulmer
