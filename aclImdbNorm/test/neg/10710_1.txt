warning: this could spoil your movie. watch it, see if you agree.<br /><br /> to think that we as humans can not learn from the past. the futuristic society portrayed glamorized what hitler believed, obliterate a race of people (in this case men) for the benefit of society. it made me sick to my stomach. also the plausibility of a y bomb is insane. even in war our instinct for self-preservation will prevent the extinction of humanity. we made mistakes in the past ie: japan, hiroshima and nagasaki in '45 but because of that we avoided a bigger mistake in '63 during the cuban missile crisis
