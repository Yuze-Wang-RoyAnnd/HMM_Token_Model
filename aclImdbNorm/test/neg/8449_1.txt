i was duped as well. here i was expecting all sorts of man eating pirahnas and what the hell do you get.<br /><br />an hour and a half of nothing, but awkward silences with some weird guy, who isn't weird enough to be scary.<br /><br />i thought there was no way $5 could be too much for a movie.<br /><br />damn i was sooooo wrong. it was very hard to watch the whole thing.<br /><br />don't fool yourself. its not so good that its bad. its not even that kind of movie.<br /><br />its nothing. an hour and a half of absolutely nothing.<br /><br />piece of crap!!!!!!!!
