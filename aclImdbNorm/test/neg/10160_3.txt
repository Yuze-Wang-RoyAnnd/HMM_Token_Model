i had seen this movie when i was a boy (before wwii) and was surprised that the local library had a copy. saw it again after some sixty years and forgot how bad it was. this is an example of a movie that was not a "a" movie. no editing, poor script, weak acting and not much directing. should not even be as high as a "b" had a laugh at how jaded i've become over the years. seems to me i thought it was good when i originally saw it.
