movies like this give independent films a bad name! this simply a boring compilation of vingettes, with no structure whatsoever. i wouldn't be surprised if the screenwriter was completely stoned. if you want to see a good stoner comedy, watch "half baked." it's no award-winner, but at least it made me laugh. the film was obviously made on a micro-budget. every scene either takes place in someone's house, someone's apartment or some outdoor location. if the writing was good and the dialogue was interesting, i would've ignored the film's budget (like in the case of edward burns' films), but obviously that's not the case this time around. <br /><br />i quote robert deniro from "a bronx tale" when i say, "there's nothing in the world worse than wasted talent." everybody in the cast is talented. luke wilson, alicia witt, brittany murphy, jeremy sisto--all talented performers! and they all have been in much better movies. the actors give it their all, but they couldn't go too far with such a lame script. the only scene i found interesting was jack black's cameo, where he sings a song about being in the woods. and of course, there was the brief strip club scene at the beginning, which i also found appealing. <br /><br />the characters are uninteresting and the story barely exists. many movies are awful, but at least you understand their intentions. what was "bongwater's" intention? the world will never know. <br /><br />my score: 2 (out of 10)
