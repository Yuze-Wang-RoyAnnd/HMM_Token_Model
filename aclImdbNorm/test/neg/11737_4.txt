the 1998 version of "psycho" needed to be set back in the 60's, rather than present day. the headliners would have done a good job with the setting. there were two scenes that just stuck out like a sore thumb. the first one was at the beginning of the movie when marian crane (anne heche) was sitting at her desk. her boss took his client into his office because "it was air conditioning." i imagine that the majority of arizona businesses have air conditioning. the other was the meeting of lila crane (julianne moore) & sam loomis (viggo mortensen). lila sporting the walkman seemed like an exaggeration to update the movie. the movie did spook a number of the viewers in the theater.
