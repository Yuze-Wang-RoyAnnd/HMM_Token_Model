ugh. even the ever-popular diane lane could not save this movie, and the most exciting thing about the movie was seeing if rourke's face would move. one has heard so much "gossip" about his botched face lift, etc., so like an accident on the side of the road, we just had to slow down and see the wreck. the plot was thin. here we have a very professional mob hit man who somehow latches on to a wild and uncontrollable punk/crook, and throughout this movie we're wondering why this guy stays with this idiot, let alone gets together with the guy in the first place. then the crime that was not even committed has the pro to go after the witnesses. he would have popped them right then and there. but then, we would not have had a movie then, would we? and why did the realtor even agree to the extortion? there were more holes in this flick than in my colander. the acting was horrid, the entire movie predictable down to the minute, and even the ending. and so much could have been done to make this a much better movie. but if you have about 90 minutes to kill and not have to use any brain cells in the process, then this movie is just what the doctor ordered.
