ghost story has an interesting feminist revenge tale premise, a-list veteran actors, colorful flashbacks with nifty look-a-like youthful counterparts of the old men. scary staccato music heralding the approaching horrors, atmospheric new england winter weather, and an excellent charismatic actress in the title role. ghost story could have been much more effective in black and white and in eliminating some of the more lurid special effects, and to presenting a more cogent screenplay (we should not have to be wondering about why the two trailer-parkish acolytes are in the script) the biggest detriment of the film is craig wassan (definitely separated at birth from bill maher) who from perhaps editing or just bad acting, is totally ineffective. he seems to "specialize" in wide-eyed, wide-mouthed reaction shots; not a lot of personality here. the revelation however is alice krige, pale-faced, enigmatic, terrifying underneath the placid exterior. however, her eva galli is creepy even before she meets her fate; i mean, a young woman who says things like "i'd like to take a bite out of you" or "dance with me, you little toad!" is already not in the land of the living. ghost story would have been much better in a low-key, val lewton mode. the overdone special effects completely undercut the chill factor.
