this movie is a definitive 5. i finally caught it on hbo the other night. i remember when it came out in theatres telling a friend that it would never be a hit because americans didn't want movies about history, especially movies that were more about ideas than action. i don't know if that was the reason fmlb didn't do well, but now, having finally seen it, i can add a few observations of my own.<br /><br />first, while dwight schultz has been fine in star trek and the a-team, as the lead in this movie he is off-putting. i kept expecting him to shout out jon lovitz-like, "i am act-ing!" he phrasing and tone of voice sounded like he was trying very had to be an act-or, on a stage where he had to emphasize strangely various words and phrases. <br /><br />second, i enjoyed the sly positioning of paul newman's character as a manipulator who, at every turn, strives to herd these cats (the scientists) along to get to his goal. <br /><br />third, there was some discussion of the moral implications of creating the a bomb, and whether the us should use it. probably not enough of this, or as in depth as warranted.<br /><br />finally, there seemed to be an awful lot of twists thrown in for dramatic effect. i don't know how much of the events in this movie are true to life, but things like having the test bomb slip in its chains or having a lab accident caused by a spilled coffee cup (and a scientist killed as a result) were stretching the bounds of believability. maybe that stuff, or events that were similar, really happened, but it sure felt like various scenes were added solely for dramatic effect, which undermined the whole tone and purpose of the movie.<br /><br />fmlb was ok. i need to read more about the actual events to know if it was over the top or just mostly accurate.
