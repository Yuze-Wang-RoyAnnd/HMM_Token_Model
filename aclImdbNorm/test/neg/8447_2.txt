the movie is great for venezuelan tourism, birds, birds and more birds. only 1 piranha. nice scenery. the only highlight was the alligator seen during a very long and boring motorcycle race. the end when caribe drowns is a definite hollywood prop. there is no definite storyline. it goes from venezuelan scenery to a rip off of easy rider to diamond mining and a ruthless hunter going crazy for some reason who gets it in the end. a very low budget movie that could have been filmed anywhere with outtakes of venezuela. william smith is a very talented actor that has made some very good movies. like all actors they all need to have at least one bad film don't waste the $5.00 on the dvd.
