i'm sorry to say this but i didn't enjoy this movie at all. it was just too boring. so boring that i couldn't watch the rest of it. it's not as interesting as the lion king or aladdin. that's why i hate this stupid days because these days are just not what they used to be. the movies that disney have released lately really sucks! i miss the old days when they used to produce good movies like the lion king, aladdin, pocahontas, cinderella, the aristocats, and robin hood. this movie is really awful. i really tried my best to be interested in this movie but i just couldn't. i don't think i could recommend this film to anyone. i would recommend the ones that i just mention above.
