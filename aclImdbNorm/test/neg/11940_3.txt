when i saw the trailers for this movie, it looked like a good romantic comedy. i expected some light fluffy fun. instead, i was bored and a little depressed.<br /><br />honestly, there was no chemistry between the leads at all, and the movie had little, if anything, that was funny about it. the little girl was adorable - when she cried, i cried - but i thought they might have used someone a little bit younger in the role.<br /><br />either way, the movie was filled with long, dull silences or swelling opera music. i'm not anti-opera, but i would have preferred them to spend that time letting us get to know the characters, who were all stiff and underdeveloped.<br /><br />i was really disappointed in this movie. the whole time i watched it i kept thinking of how much better it could have been.
