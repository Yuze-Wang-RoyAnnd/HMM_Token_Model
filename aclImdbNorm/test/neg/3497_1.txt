'bland' is probably the word i'd use to try and start describing this film. i only watched it because it had a good rating on here and i was so let down.<br /><br />basically the film is about racism in a post 9/11 america and the director went at it with a sledge hammer! there was no subtlety in the film at all and it felt as though they were trying to achieve a kind of magnolia feel to the film - which is never a good idea as that film was three hours of tedium and confusion only for it to start raining frogs at the end...<br /><br />all in all a huge disappointment.
