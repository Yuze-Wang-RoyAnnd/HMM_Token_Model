(the beginning might be a spoiler...)<br /><br />"the eye 2" is the sequel to "the eye". it's about a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an incident happened to her.<br /><br />the sound effects scared the hell out of me though momentarily but that's the only scary thing. some of the scenes from the prequel are comparatively similar and repeated so the chilling effects certainly have chilled. <br /><br />"the eye" has quite a frightening and indelible impression whereas "the eye 2" is a forgettable horror-cum-drama film. omit watching this. watching "the eye" is good enough.
