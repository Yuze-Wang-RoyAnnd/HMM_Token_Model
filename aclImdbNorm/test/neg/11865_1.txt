it seems that all companies that are enjoy with the taxes taken by romania for picture,grant the image that disappear since 1994 .they are hardly try to get the oldest car the had founded, but they never take pictures of the lamorghini,ferrari,aston martin and all new mercedes that are more the you can find in some important countries.<br /><br />a second problem is that they filmed in some neighborhoods in bucharest where they had the possibility of clear the streets and put garbages on dressing people with i don't know maybe '90 clothes a making them seem so stupid that you will realize the script was maybe a second hand bought from ebay or worth.<br /><br />i wist for future to keep making movies in us and to make good money there than to give us a little bit and shame our country.i have no reason to believe that someone will understand the message(beyond my english---:sorry)
