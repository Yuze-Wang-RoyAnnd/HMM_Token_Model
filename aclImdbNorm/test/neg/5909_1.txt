eddie murphy and richard pryor team up in this would-be comedy about nightclub owners being squeezed by organized crime. eddie murphy wrote and directed this obnoxious ego trip, and therefore has no one to blame but himself for its failure. this is a genuinely bad film, so completely devoid of energy and humor that it serves only as a example of murphy's contempt for his audience. it would be remarkably easy to continue beating up on this movie, but i will show it more mercy than it showed its audience and stop now.
