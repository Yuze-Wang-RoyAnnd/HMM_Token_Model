i hoped to learn something from this movie, but i was disappointed. it is all about rommel and lauds him as a great general, but at no time in this entire movie did we ever get an idea of why he was great. what made him so successful? was it his drive, his unwillingness to accept defeat, his discipline with his men? i was looking for a patton-like rendition that really gets into the character, but this fell way flat. most of the dialog is contrived and sensationalized, and feels stale and artificial. there is some good action here and there, but not much. the tail end of the story, which discusses his involvement in the plot to assassinate hitler, was the most informative part and probably the most interesting. but as a history lesson on germany's greatest general, this was a failure.
