the girls might be prettier if you're their accompanist or a $#!+-faced onlooker. what i'm sayin' is that it'll take special circumstances for a non-whince reaction to this effort. the delivery of many lines appears to be distractingly unnatural for some actors. lighting seems to be a problem, too, although failing eyesight may have accounted for my frequent squinting. and if you view this film, be open-minded enough to accept elements that no zoo or circus would reject: they are the above and below-ground creatures who feasted on dozens of campers near an empty louisiana mansion. that's the discovery of a trio who is dispatched from their printed media to investigate the deaths. then, two of them disappear, and the survivor is part of another threesome who take up the hunt. eureka! i just realized what one of those aforementioned "special circumstances" would be - unconsciousness.
