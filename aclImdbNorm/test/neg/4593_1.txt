"speck" was apparently intended to be a biopic related to serial killer richard speck. there is, however, not much killing to be found in this movie, and none of it is explicitly shown. the most disturbing scene in the entire movie is perhaps when speck stomps one of the eight unfortunate nurses to death in her own bathtub, yet even this is merely implied, and not shown, save for a few unconvincing downward thrusts of mr. speck's leg. the most entertaining part of this movie is most likely the voice-over, which should be a testament to the mind-numbingly boring nature of this movie. every aspect of this movie is horrible. unless you have a fondness for boredom, don't bother. this movie only clocks in at 72 minutes, but it feels like an eternity.
