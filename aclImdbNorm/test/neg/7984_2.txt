oh my god, i was so expecting something more entertaining than this when i downloaded this movie, seeing as 1903 was one of my fave years for movies ever, but it sucked! the "plot", although i'd hesitate to call it that, is about some dumb elephant. it slowly makes its way onto some platform and gets electrocuted to death. lame. even for a short film, the plot was too thin to keep my attention. edison is, like, the worst director ever. plus, the elephant has no screen presence whatsoever. and the ending? wow, that wasn't predictable at all. *sarcasm*<br /><br />the picture quality is horrible too. you can barely tell what's going on most of the time. the only positive thing about this movie is that unlike most other un-scary horror flicks this didn't spawn eleven sequels. other than that this is a complete waste of money and 1 minute of your life you'll never get back.
