i felt last night's episode was slow and kinda of boring at times. i honestly don't think it has to do anything with the writing. because i know the story was well staged and tried to keep things in place. i thought it wasn't that bad but overall, i didn't enjoy it. the most blame has to do with the director of that episode- stephen williams. i always hated stephen williams's directing. if jack bender continues with this episode from the season premiere, he would have kept it in a good pace and keep things float to keep things interesting. i'm glad jack bender is directing next week's episode and it'll be much better and i'm glad he got first syaid episode to direct and i'm curious what he will pull off this time since stephen williams had directed too many syaid episodes before.<br /><br />i always keep thinking that stephen williams needs to be thrown off from the show. he doesn't even do anything interesting with the show.<br /><br />why does the opening have to be done with a target thing while being in the helicopter? it was so boring! bad perspective of camera work too!
