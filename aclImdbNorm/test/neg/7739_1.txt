every boy eventually learns the lesson that just because a girl is good-looking, it doesn't mean she's good. well, lemme tell you, at age 19, lesson learned. it's hard to tell what's worse: kathy ireland's acting skills, or her ultra-high-pitched voice; the one that sounds like a screeching mouse on helium scratching its tiny little claws down a blackboard. with an incomprehensible plot set in outer space with dwarves that want kathy ireland's bones for some obscure reason, this movie is just wrong on so many levels. if there were ever a candidate for a mystery science theater 3000 revival, this would be it.
