the giant claw is in fierce competition with films like, 'robot monster' and 'plan 9 from outer space' for worst film of all time. a phony looking giant vulture attacks 'lionel trains' in this completely unconscious film. the script is so bad that everything the characters say to one another is ridiculous. it's no wonder that this film is a prime target in the movie, "it came from hollywood," where this gem is hammered for the line, 'a bird as big as a battleship', with gleeful, endless needling. the line pops up relentlessly through the course of the film, so there's no escaping it. there are several shots from, 'the beast from 20,000 fathoms' and 'earth vs. the flying saucers' among other sci-fi films from the 50's to beef up the scraggly vulture's attacks. at one point the big vulture is responsible for a few deaths, so the military puts the entire world under martial law and no one is allowed to go out of their homes. of course, the huge buzzard is mainly concerned with pursuing the stars of this classic, jeff morrow & mara corday, wherever they might be. yet the director is so lame that he doesn't even provide for a few honey shots of pretty mara in a decent dress and black heels for a little relief from the tedium of this zero star thriller. that's the second time this blunder has been made. in 'tarantula', mara corday struts around in hot dresses for the whole film, but is relegated to pants throughout, 'the giant scorpion'. the budget for this film must have been not more than thirty or forty thousand dollars and i doubt whether morrow or corday got more than three thousand to make it. it looks like the whole thing was shot right out of somebody's garage.
