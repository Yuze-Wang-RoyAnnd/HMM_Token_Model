some people thought this was funny because they loved the political issues discussed in this piece. i, however, am so tired of the state of the two party system in our country that i can't stomach propaganda from either side. i was hoping for a horror show, but got "cute" zombies and partisan bull crap. i watch my horror films to be scared. this didn't even attempt to be scary. also, this doesn't have the wit of romero in his political/cultural satire laced in his movies...this was a blatant, no-imagination story that was hard for me to stomach (for the wrong reasons). on the bright side, if you hate bush...you'll love this (i'm not condoning hate or bush with this statement)
