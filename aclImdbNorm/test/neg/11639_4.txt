a man in blackface lands in a spaceship and meets a girl who lives in some sort of shack with a monkey. he hooks her up with a telephone, and she teaches him how to charleston. then they fly off in the spaceship, leaving the monkey behind. cringe-inducing blackface aside, this short film makes no sense. i think that's the plot, but i'm not sure by a long shot. you can't tell that this is renoir at work, despite his characteristic humanism. good use of slow-motion, though. can be found on the ny film annex's series of experimental film videos, no. 18, i believe.
