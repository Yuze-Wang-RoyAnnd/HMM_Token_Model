for any fan of nickelodeon who used to watch the network in the 80s and 90s, there was always something good on. you had entertaining acts like you can't do that on television. you had weird but good shows like pete & pete. you even had cartoons that taught morals like doug. but just like disney, nickelodeon has fallen down the tubes, limiting their demographic to shallow preteens and giving us poor excuses to come up with new, innovative shows. as i tried watching zoey 101, i just shook my head in disgust.<br /><br />the setting couldn't of been more fake than this one. each character attends a boarding school called pacific coast academy, boasting everything that a spoiled child wants. a sushi bar, laptops everywhere, flat screen tvs in every room, cool dorms to hang out, etc. the kids in this show are rarely seen in class and there doesn't seem to be any real teachers. it looks more like a place that you would spend on a nice summer vacation rather than to work and study while preparing for college.<br /><br />the characters were also a factor that turned me off. every episode consists of boy problems, situations that they caused themselves, and troubles that should be solved. each character is a stereotype. zoey (jamie lynn) seems perfect in anything she does, and each of her friends ask her for help when they feel they are in grave danger. only leading her to have no other side. i've been through school and i can tell you, nobody is like that. chase is dumb. logan plays the arrogant tough guy. quinn plays a nerd who is highly unrealistic in what she does. michael is an idiot. lola is a clone of nicole. dana is just well, a tough person. why not use some originality? something that is unique for these characters, and different from other personalities? is being stereotypical the best the creators of this show can come up with? instead, these actors are dull personalities with the sense in that there is a lack of creativity involving their roles. there is nothing here to be amazed or surprised at.<br /><br />not only that, but the show is clearly for the intent of aiming for kids of adolescence, facing a stage in that they must evolve from being a child to being an adult. through that period they must learn to study on their own, make their own decisions, and do what's right for them. zoey 101 contains nothing of those values. in this case, we are supposed to believe that looking good and having a stereotypical personality is all you need to succeed. i'm sorry, but that simply isn't true. people can't expect things to be handed to them like the actors in this show are and just let those things sit there. if i expect things in zoey 101 to happen in real life, then i would be living in a fantasy world locked away in a dream house. nothing in this show relates to those who face health and money issues. neither does it relate to kids wanting to learn something meaningful.<br /><br />so in conclusion, zoey 101 is a show made by nickelodeon that only falls flat on it's face. it displays a horrible message for kids and i highly think the show itself is simply inappropriate for them. sure, it doesn't have morbid violence, but it teaches everything to make a kid act and look stupid. a horrible show, and should be forgotten with the rest of the garbage nickelodeon has been making in recent years.<br /><br />1 out of 10.
