i really liked the movie 'the emporer's new groove', but watching this was like coming home and seeing your wife having "relations" with a llama. seriously, this movie was bad. it's like club dread after super troopers. i am supposed to write 10 lines, but i don't even know what else to say. i laughed a couple of times, but only because i was drinking. a movie like that should at least be funny when your drunk. it was not. maybe llamas are just funny and regular cartoon people aren't. either way, just stick with the emporer's new groove if you want a funny, cartoon, llama-themed movie. line 10 is this line right here.
