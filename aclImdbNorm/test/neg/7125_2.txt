i am a huge fan of the first four ju-on projects. i own them, and watch them every few months. i lend them to co-workers and friends just so they can get a good scare from quality japanese film making. i think takashi shimizu created a great story, and presented it very effectively in these four installments.<br /><br />i was somewhat excited about the grudge 2 opening in theaters. i saw the first american grudge before watching the four originals. the grudge was actually pretty good. of course, the originals are better, but i got a good halloween scare from the 2004 american grudge.<br /><br />the grudge 2 started off badly, and went down from there. i kept waiting for it to get better, to make sense, to show shimizu's talent - nothing like this happened. the thing that's great about shimizu's ju-on work is the story. true, it's usually told in a disjointed style that you have to think about to connect its components, but it is still a great story. there was no story in the grudge 2. it was a series of gratuitous deaths from characters that you never had time to even start to care about.<br /><br />the editing was atrocious. disjointed (as in the japanese originals) is one thing, but the complete randomness of scene sequence was exhausting. i just kept thinking, "this is so stupid," and, "no - he didn't really sell out this much did he??" it made me want to walk out of the theater, run home, and watch the original work, simply to reassure myself that shimizu has not always made this dumbed-down, generic, boring, non-sensical, thrown-together tripe.<br /><br />if you really have your heart set on seeing this movie, i suggest you wait the 2 months to rent it. really. two of the five people in the theater with me walked out about 45 minutes into it. i debated on whether to do that myself. going home and cleaning the house actually sounded like a better way to spend my time at that point.<br /><br />i am truly shocked at how bad this movie was. let's pray sam raimi doesn't put out more cash to make the grudge 3. it's just not worth it anymore. sigh.
