it's rare to see film that strikes out in every aspect but "caligula" surely must hold this title. i'm not sure what is more horrendous; the violence, the sexual perverseness, the acting or the plot (or severe lack thereof).<br /><br />the two and a half hours basically follows the ascension of the infamous roman caesar "caligula" to to throne in 37ad and shows the atrocities and perverseness he supposedly committed whilst in power. the acting is lifeless and dull - but that's just the tip of the iceberg. obviously knowing that this film was severely lacking of anything legitimately interesting, the directors decided to throw in as much nudity and orgy scenes as was conceivably possible. but don't be fooled, these scenes don't ease or take focus away from the hideousness of this film. the camera work is shoddy, dialog is laughable in fact you'd have to congratulate malcolm mcdowell (playing caligula) for keeping a straight face through such farcical lines. and then there's the violence....<br /><br />if you are about to see the film be prepared. some atrocities are committed in the film (not just through the writing) but through disgusting violent acts which are of little point or purpose other than to repulse the viewer. this is only objective this movie achieved. one must wonder how the makers of this film thought that bestiality, necrophilia and castration (just to name a few) would be appealing to anyone. when it belatedly ends after two and a half hours you take nothing from this film other than some disturbing images and the knowledge that you may have witnessed the worst film ever.<br /><br />you've been warned
