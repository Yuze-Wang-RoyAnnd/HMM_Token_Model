ya know, i have no idea how everybody else's teenage life was, but this does not reflect the folks i knew and hung around with let alone, myself. and just in case if you're wondering..no..we weren't pristine/clean cut/pat boone type teens. (if there was ever such a thing!!!!)<br /><br />look, i'm not saying being a teenager is easy. the better, well actually the best teen movie of this time is "fast times at ridgemont high". now those kids i knew and were as realistic as it got back then (and maybe now).<br /><br />this was crap. this was a low rent version of fast times and even then it didn't do much for me. it had a few moments, but not enough for me to recommend this, or even claim "this is how it was for teens back in 1982". i couldn't relate. the lead girl (girls) did nothing for me and please if they really wanted to keep their virginity, they would have, in which case, this film would not have been made. pure crap and a bad staple to be left behind as a time-capsule cinema for teens/young adults in the early '80's.
