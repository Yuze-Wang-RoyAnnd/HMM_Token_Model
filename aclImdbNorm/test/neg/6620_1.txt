there is a reason chairman of the board got a 2, (which is too high) this movie flat out is one of the worse movies of all time and i seen my share of rotten films. chairman of the board stars two of the most annoying actors/people today, carrot top and courtney thorne smith. carrot top just isn't funny anymore and wasn't in this piece of trash. courtney thorne smith isn't any better, just watch "according to jim" and you will see a prime example of what i am talking about. chairman of the board got a 1 from me, because that is low as you can go it is that bad. i am a little shocked that this piece of junk isn't on the imdb bottom 100 somewhere, i would put this in the top 5 on that list, but its slowly working its way there.
