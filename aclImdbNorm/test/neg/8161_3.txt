i must say, i found this movie very disappointing. yes, i know maltin gave it 3 1/2 and others think very highly of it. but, well, the opera sequences were god-awful. i take it jeannete macdonald is an acquired taste. yes, in the short sequences i have seen her with nelson eddy, she is immensely preferable to him. but on her own...god, i dislike opera and despise operetta, and she is basically intolerable. at one point i had to cover my ears. gable is just ok, and tracy is thrown away. the plot is annoying in the jm never simply tells gable she loves him and the opera and why can't she do both? instead she suffers silently (or not so) with the compromises she makes. the supporting cast is distinctly unmemorable. besides the star three and jack holt (and i suppose his mother), they all are just background and forgettable. the eq sequence is the only thing that saves the movie. and just. yes, it is fairly spectacular and moving. but the "oh god is great" seems very contrived. i immensely prefer "in old chicago" as far as old time disaster spectaculars go. spare yourself on this one.
