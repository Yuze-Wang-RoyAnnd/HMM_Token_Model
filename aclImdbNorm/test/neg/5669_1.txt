if you think hannah montana or the suite life are at the bottom of tween sitcoms then you've obviously never watched icarly. icarly is without a doubt the worst show i've ever seen. from the lifeless acting to the low budget sets the show reeks of cheapness like last week's chinese takeout left to simmer in your overheated car.<br /><br />the show revolves around a pretty, perky, and "supposed to be" funny girl named carly, as she and her friends make a live web show called icarly. carly lives alone with her older brother who seriously needs some counseling or something, because he's a few cells short of a brain.<br /><br />the plots of the shows are highly ludicrous and unbearably annoying. but having to watch carly and her friend, sam, do their little icarly show-within-in-a-show is even worse. they basically show weird pictures and stick things up their nose as the laugh-track plays over and over. i mean seriously, every two seconds the laugh track seems to come on for no reason.<br /><br />so, what's the point of this review? you may ask. just to ridicule icarly? well, yeah, but i'm also warning you to beware of this show. because seriously, if i had to choose between watching icarly and barney? no questions about it, i'd choose barney.
