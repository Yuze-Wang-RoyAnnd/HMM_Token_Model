the somewhat-belligerent brother of a suicide finds that he and his mother grieve in much the same way (by acting out) but that dad is morose and blaming himself. writer-director dan harris gives us a dysfunctional family torn at the seams, characters with question marks hanging over them, and then lays all the story-points out in the most obvious terms: suicide! secrets! gay shame! family sickness! ultimately aiming to wrap things up with a tidy bow, harris wants to make sure we don't miss a trick, initially giving us thoughtful material to ponder but then spelling everything out in an elementary, sentimental fashion. sigourney weaver's bemused performance as the family matriarch is dryly disengaged and she's a joy--that is, until harris gives her a make-over (complete with sensible new hairstyle). it's the cinematic equivalent of a condescending pat on the head. ** from ****
