although this movie has a slow, dream-like, almost mesmerizing pace, and an interesting, though possibly not entirely accurate, description of a rural french constabulary's criminal investigation practices and personnel, i find it, ultimately, impossible to recommend. i think this movie is simply a setup piece to advance one person's -- the director's, one presumes -- disgust with heterosexuality. certainly, human sexuality in all its forms can have their revolting moments, no denying that! but to choose the bad uniformly at the expense of the good, as this film does at every turn, suggests a warped sensibility at work. in short, if you enjoy watching homo-eroticism masquerading as compassion, and the depiction of heterosexual lovemaking and the female form in a hideous and degrading light - then this movie is for you. i don't , and it wasn't.
