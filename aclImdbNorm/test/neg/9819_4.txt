disappointing film with walter pidgeon as a hunter who goes to germany to assassinate hitler. when he is discovered, he is coerced into signing a document stating that he acted on orders from england. his refusal to sign the document brings us to the plot of the film.<br /><br />pidgeon is pursued back to england by the evil george sanders and his cohort, john carradine, who speaks little, but is again as always, the embodiment of wickedness personified.<br /><br />along the way of being pursued, pidgeon meets up with joan bennett, the latter displaying a wonderful cockney accent.<br /><br />the story gets bogged down somewhat as love develops between the two, but again as we approach world war 11, realism becomes the object of the day.<br /><br />the near-ending scene in the cave between sanders and pidgeon is nicely realized but we know where that arrow is going to go to.<br /><br />very interesting that while pidgeon is fleeing nazi germany, he meets up again with a young roddy mcdowall, one of pidgeon's many co-stars that same year in the memorable "how green was my valley." how green was "man hunt?"
