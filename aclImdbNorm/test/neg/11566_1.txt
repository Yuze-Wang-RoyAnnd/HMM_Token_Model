in fact it was awful. the main chick in it who gets topless was obviously sleeping with the director at the time. it was shot at some warehouse most likely owned by family or friends. also they chose not to bother coming up with a story. sure these are ways to cut cost, but are they smart ways of keeping costs down? no they aren't. at the very least they could have found a middle school student in a "creative writing" course. those kids may have at least had a lesson about story structure. at the very least, they could have read up on 3 act structure but acting obviously wasn't a priority either. watching these jerks run around in funny clothing that was stupid by 1980's standards was an embarrassment. the fact that none of these actors committed suicide in humiliation is probably a testament to the limited distribution this film received. had the actors actually seen the final result of their hard work, there would have been a line of people waiting to jump off the brooklyn bridge.<br /><br />i'd give this movie 10/10 stars but it only deserves 1 for being released at all. this movie should be shown to film students everywhere. it's better than 90% of student films i've seen and wow is this movie a piece of shiiiit.
