this is the second adaptation of charlotte armstrong by claude chabrol for the screen:the first was " la rupture" (1970)(from novel "the balloon man" )and it's really a pity no one cares about it.it's chabrol's sleeper,and i urge any of his fans to see it.<br /><br />"the chocolate" cobweb was not that strong a detective story to begin with.i read it 20 years ago and forgot all about it.the movie promises some good things at first,though,then finally disappoints to a fault.this is a confusing chabrol movie,mixing elements of the heyday (circa 1969),and a lotta tongue-in-chick stuff coming from the eighties ,the likes of 'poulet au vinaigre",not one particularly memorable work.<br /><br />part of the disappointment comes from the cast:this is a distressingly poor gathering:jacques dutronc plays like a zombie,isabelle huppert reveals herself a somewhat limited actress,finally rather vulgar .it worked in "une affaire de femme",it does not here.they are not supported by the young couple :both are bland and unremarkable.actors from the past,say,stephane audran or michel bouquet(both in "la rupture") were brilliant and contributed to chabrol's then unique atmosphere.<br /><br />the story itself is undistinguished:beginning as some kind of "serious" "la vie est un long fleuve tranquille " (besides,a character hints at etienne chatilliez's very funny movie),the movie drags on and on as a laughable psychological drama afterwards.we will not congratulate the young female pianist ,who,after all she learned about her wicked hostess,agrees to drive a car along a dangerous road.<br /><br />because he makes too many movies,chabrol frequently releases turkeys.one wonder why people who wants to watch one of his movies should choose this one among all his stuff up for grabs.<br /><br />it seems that chabrol's bourgeoise satire has finally given way to leniency.in "la rupture" the first armstrong adaptation-an average detective story which chabrol completely transcended-,you should hear audran say "they have so much money!".here ,chabrol has lost his bite,his strength.
