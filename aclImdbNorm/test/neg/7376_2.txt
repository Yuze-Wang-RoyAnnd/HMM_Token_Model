i'm writing this as i watch the dvd. i grabbed for the laptop and went to imdb during the first song. i didn't know anything about the movie except that a friend said that the show was supposed to be good. it has a decent netflix rating too, so here i am.<br /><br />maybe on the stage this worked. but i have to say that the sight of chorus boys dancing and singing completely naked just seems silly. and the lip syncing to a prerecorded score adds to the strangeness.<br /><br />most of the songs and routines are about aspects of male nudity. this is my idea of nothing, sorry. the score, so far, is generic show tune music. nothing memorable, or particularly melodic. everything is to serve the lyrics. which, i have to say, sound like they were written by a committee. each song is essentially one extended joke. if the jokes were ten seconds, they might work. these single several-minute-long jokes don't.<br /><br />i'm now watching the movie by chapters--a few minutes until i get the gist. kind of in the hopes that one of them will be different, or entertaining enough to keep me from going on to the next scene. nope.<br /><br />okay. i'm finished. so here's what i think. if you have any experience or long-standing appreciation of musical theater, avoid this--it's just not quality. if, however, you're a gay twenty-something and have never seen or heard a musical comedy, you might be entertained. or maybe this would hold your interest if you've never seen a lot of attractive naked men. <br /><br />i have.
