lucille ball tries to look 30 years younger than she actually was in this poor excuse for a musical.<br /><br />the movie features some of the worst choreography ever seen laced with the constant threat that lucy might break into song with her bourbon voice at any moment. lucy's total lack of talent as a singer and dancer sinks the film before it can begin and aside from die-hard lucy fans, no one is likely to fancy it very much. bad costumes and cheesy set designs don't help. further proof that lucy wasn't good at anything except making stupid faces.<br /><br />directed by gene saks.
