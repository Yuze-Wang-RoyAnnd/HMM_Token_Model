i must preface this comment with a sort of admission: i suppose i just have a soft spot for the original 60s-70s tv series. i think the filmmakers here blew it from the get-go as far as casting: in a supposed remake, audiences would look for reflections of the hip, athletic linc (clarence williams iii), or the cool, with-it michael cole, and so forth. instead, we get giovanni ribisi as a poor-little-white rich boy who comes off as just pathetic, like he is in all his roles (in the office i used to work in, i amused myself once by creating a fake movie poster, casting various actors as members of the office staff; guess who i cast as the dorky son of the company president?). danes does ok as the new julie, but none of the characters have much to do, as the story just sort of sits there, mired in conventionality. so it's quite forgettable, besides. what was i talking about?
