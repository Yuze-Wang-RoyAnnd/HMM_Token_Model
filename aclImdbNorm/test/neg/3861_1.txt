i have seen many movies over the years and i am a big fan of comedies.<br /><br />but this so-called comedy almost reduced me to tears. it is without a doubt the worst movie i have ever witnessed, the worst.<br /><br />i remember hearing about this movie from a friend, and decided to view it. if i could i could turn back time, i would. i will regret for as long as i live, the time i wasted watching this rubbish.<br /><br />the storyline is so insane; it just makes no-sense at all and leaves you confused. there is a scottish mob and a german headhunter who are after pestario 'pest' vargas (john leguizamo), the scottish mob after $50,000 dollars and the germans after his head.<br /><br />in trying to escape the pest, takes the form of many disguises. but in doing this we witness some of the most annoying, worst, mind numbing acting, dialogue and sounds in cinema history. this movie annoyed me so much; by the end i was full of aggression. i was so angry that i had wasted so much time watching a movie that would surely drive depressed people to almost certain suicide. i mean how can there be hope when a movie like this can be given permission to be made?<br /><br />i know people have their own opinions, but the most shocking thing about the pest is that people actually like it. why? what is funny about a man that is annoying from the very first second to the last? a man who cannot act? who has an annoying voice and confusing face?<br /><br />i sat through it thinking the movie would get better, surely it would. it did not. usually, you want the good guy to survive, but i wanted the germans or the scottish mob to find and kill the pest, anything to put me out of my misery. there is nothing funny, interesting or normal that happens in this movie, its just plain annoying and confusing. the jokes are dead even before they are told. i feel sorry for the cameramen who have no say in how the movie is made, but actually have to film this drivel. i wouldn't be surprised if they are receiving counselling.<br /><br />if you want to remain sane and part of society, my advice is to never watch this movie. i'd rather lock myself in my room for 5 weeks and go without food and water than watch this movie again!<br /><br />i don't think i'll ever hate anything more than this.
