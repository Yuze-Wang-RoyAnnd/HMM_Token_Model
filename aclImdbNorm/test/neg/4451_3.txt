a man comes to the office of the psychiatric dr. sammael (joan severance) claiming to be the demon asmodeus (kane hodder), the torturer of the 13th level of the hell, and he would like to tell weird things. he tells that he had made a deal with lucifer to become human again. he should knock-up his virgin sister mary elizabeth (alison brie) on the day that their mother died and she should kill six people and deliver the anti-christ, and then he would escape from the pit and reborn. when mary elizabeth gets pregnant, her stressed and abusive sister catherine (denise crosby) does not believe that she is virgin, but their father and former obstetrician albert martino (james callahan) examines his daughter and sees her intact hymen. meanwhile the church discovers the truth about mary elizabeth's pregnancy and sends the priest and former military father anthony (eddie velez) to spy mary elizabeth. she is dominated by the fetus and forced to kill a truck driver, lars (jorg sirtl), who is the lover of her tenant and friend jennifer (azalea davila), and jennifer herself and eat their hearts and drink their bloods, but she believes that she has nightmares. however during the ultrasound, she realizes that she is carrying a monster and she asks her father to stop her pregnancy. but it is too late.<br /><br />the awful "born" is a b-movie (actually a z-movie) that believes that is a great movie. the result is a pretentious and disappointing production, with an incoherent and absurd story without humor and terrible acting and direction. the plot is a complete mess: there is a priest that is a hit-man and former soldier; a demon in existential crisis going to a psychiatric; a father that examines the virginity of his daughter; two female-demons (succubus?) that stand naked like a statue with both hands covering their sexes; a character that is a slut, and only exists to expose her beautiful body. there are many scenes with free and cheap nudity. but the worst is the acting: the unknown lead actress alison brie is histrionic, with ridiculous voices and grimaces. sorry, ms. alison brie, but i hated your annoying performance. i have not recognized joan severance, who has a good performance, since i still had the image of her youth. denise crosby performs a hateful character and like everybody, she got older but she is still a good actress. i believe that if the writer and the director had included some dark humor and assumed that this movie is a b-movie, the story might have worked better and better. my vote is three.<br /><br />title (brazil): "o anti-cristo" ("the anti-christ")
