this movie is one that belongs on the cutting room floor. for one, the opening sequence does not put forth the element of 'gang' related subject. if it wasn't supposed to then at least they got that part right. secondly...whats with all the glancing to the left and then to the right??? they even do it in synchronous style. nowhere have i witnessed a member from a rival crew walk up to a bar, look for someone, from the outside lookin like he is all that and a bag o chips at a barbie and walk away without even being confronted let alone get 'what for'. i wasted money on the rental price and am glad i did not purchase the dvd itself.<br /><br />if this was made by college( t.a.f.e ) students then at least they gave it the old aussie try. better luck next time.
