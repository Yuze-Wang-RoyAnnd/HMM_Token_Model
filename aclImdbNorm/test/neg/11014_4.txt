this is another of those films i can remember from when i was a kid and i recently managed to acquire it off ebay - 20 years on, it's nowhere near as good as i remember it being.<br /><br />the story is 'vaguely' kick started, by a 'cosmic event' (there's another extra film-crew member in the credits for 'weak story development') which makes collective ants become super intelligent. ant species who used to war with each other have ceased rivalries and are now working together. the thing i wanted to know throughout was, to do what exactly? you never find out what they want. nigel davenport and his sidekick travel out to the desert where bizarre ant activity has been noted, and begin to study the ants from an impregnable igloo shaped laboratory. probably the most chilling scene in my opinion was when the two scientists visit the giant square in the crops (like a square version of a crop circle) a result of the ants chomping away.<br /><br />this film was not very scary quite simply because you don't know whether to fear the ants or like them. all you know is that the ants want people to leave the area so they can get on with their hijinks - but you don't find out whether they are really baddies. it ain't a sci-fi because the 'cosmic event' explanation is too vague to be properly taken into account. it is deffo more of a chiller. tbh the flares, daft hairstyles, tight shirts with big collars and nigel davenports unnaturally big facial hair-do freaked me out more than the ants! did you notice that there are only six actors listed in the credits? yup, that right - six, and you won't see any other human beings in this film at all. not even in the distance! this is a plainly obviously low budget film which is a bit watchable because you probably won't have seen one like it. i can't think of any anyway. the filming of the ants is pretty good, they must have done months and months of filming before they had the shots they needed to stick in the film. you may well say to yourself 'how the hell do they get the ants to do that?' over and over, but it is all quite simple. you will also notice that the film makers sacrificed millions of innocent lickle ants to make the film too, so animal rights peeps stay away! good for novelty value, but you may not watch it more than once.
