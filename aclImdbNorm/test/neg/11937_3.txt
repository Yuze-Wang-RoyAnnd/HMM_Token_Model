i had high hopes for this film when i saw the listing and decided to watch it on tv, uninterrupted by commercial breaks. i've liked lee van cleef in many movies but i'm afraid that having the other characters call him chris repeatedly doesn't turn him into even a reasonable facsimile of yul brenner's chris.<br /><br />i found this movie to be a complete disappointment - the music sound track tried to impart the magnificence portrayed in the original but it too failed to bring the film up the the standard of the original. the rich textures of the characters in the original were mostly missing from this film. i guess if you haven't seen the original it would be okay. too many clich'es and too little depth to the characters. i missed the humanity and compassion and the three dimensional characters of the original.
