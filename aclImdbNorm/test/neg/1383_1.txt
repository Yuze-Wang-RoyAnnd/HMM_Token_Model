the tagline for this show is, "he's speaking his mind. we're hiring extra lawyers." if you look back in time, any classic raunchy comedian never prided himself in being controversial. richard pryor's tagline wasn't, "i'm crude, racist and daring." that's basically how comedy central is marketing this show - in your face, non-pc and "honest" - but how can a television show pride itself in being this way? where's the humility and humbleness? and what suddenly has made carlos mencia this huge figure for comedy central? let's start at the beginning - dave chappelle cancels his show (which became unexpectedly popular and controversial) and comedy central is looking around for someone new to push. they hire this guy named ned who claims to be a mexican, even though he isn't. they splatter his face on a few tv ads and make it look like they're being "daring" by unleashing him upon the public.<br /><br />i've seen a lot of hateful topics on the forums for this show, and i don't agree with "mencia's" detractors. this is not an awful show. it had me crying in laughter a few times. when it's funny, it's very, very funny. yes, it's juvenile - but so was chappelle's.<br /><br />the problem with carlos is that he uses a lot of the same material over and over. and he's too obvious. the overt marketing put aside, "carlos" has now said beaner so many times i have lost count. he's trying to make it the next famous line (like "i'm rick james, b****!") but it's way too obvious.<br /><br />in terms of repeating himself, carlos uses many of the same jokes over and over. for example, on one episode he said he'd love it if all mexicans disappeared from america overnight. he'd wake up and an american guy would be saying, "room ser'vuce!" in a southern accent.<br /><br />he used this exact same joke - verbatim - when he appeared as a guest on adam carolla's talk show. it was a great deal less funny the second time around, because he seemed more desperate.<br /><br />is "carlos" funny? i think so. there are some outrageous moments on his show. but he focuses too much on trying to be controversial rather than just going with the flow and letting his comedy naturally progress. repeating silly little catchphrases over and over again coupled with goofy faces and loud vocal screams does indeed get old quite fast...i just hope carlos - or his writers - can give a new edge to this show, because right now it's starting to dwindle in repeat hell.
