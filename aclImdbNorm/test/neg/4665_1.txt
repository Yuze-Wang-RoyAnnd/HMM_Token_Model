this movie has bad writing and bad editing. it is difficult to follow what is going on because nothing any of the characters do makes much sense. some major calamity occurs every 30 seconds. as a result, none of the "action" sequences are at all interesting. the movie is two hours worth of "throw away" scenes which are connected merely by the fact that they share common actors. this movie doesn't even have enough of a sense of humor to be a good "bad" movie.
