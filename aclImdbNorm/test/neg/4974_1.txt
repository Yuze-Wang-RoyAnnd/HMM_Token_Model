i started watching this because i was looking for a nice 'background' comedy for my sunday morning. then i noticed that this was going to be a road-movie and i decided to actually watch this.<br /><br />first 15 minutes were awful, but i wanted to give this a chance, because i never judge a movie without watching it throughly. then things started to get little better. this seemed like a nice road-movie about friendship.. but then the movie started to get horrible predictable clich'e-twists and when the movie was over it left you feeling like you had wasted your time. did this have anything to say? why did they even make a movie like this? and i wasn't expecting a modern citizen kane, but still, i have several ideas how this movie could have been improved.<br /><br />so take my piece of advice; leave this alone and go watch a real road-movie. there are many of those. i won't make the directors of those movies seem bad by putting their names on this review.<br /><br />1/10
