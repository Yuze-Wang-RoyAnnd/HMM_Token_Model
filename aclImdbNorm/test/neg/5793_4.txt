if you thought herbie trying to kill himself by driving off a bridge in 'the love bug' was daft, wait 'till you see him acting horny in this bewilderingly silly second sequel. dean jones is back as the driver who competes in the paris to monte carlo rally; this time his sentient vw falls in love with another car in the race, a lancia driven by julie sommars. by this point in the series the energy and charm is lacking even more than in 'herbie rides again'; the movie is overlong and threadbare, although it's watchable thanks to the return of jones's typically likable performance, a few funny bits, and the cast's frantic mugging.
