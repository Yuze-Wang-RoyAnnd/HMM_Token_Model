teenage exorcist is one of those god-awful films to video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent entertainment for low brow sexual antics, adolescent humour, and empty writing. this film delivers exactly what its was trying to deliver. it is about a girl moving into a house where a baron de sade(hmmm) once lived and finally being drawn to him through her own inner demon. her sister and brother-in-law, along with an irish priest, her boyfriend, and a pizza delivery boy, try to save her and exorcise her demon. well, not much here in way of horror or suspense. in fact, one line from the film pretty much sums up what to expect. mike(the girl's brother-in-law) has tied her(the name is diane by the way and she is played by brinke stevens) up after trying to chainsaw her sister. he removes a gag from her mouth and says something like, "this won't be the last gag we see tonight." indeed, it was not. the special effects are cheesy and poorly crafted, and the film makes use of this by playing on its comedic appeal. some of the lines and situations are funny. robert quarry, old count yorga himself, really steals his scenes as an irish priest. he hams it up wailing biblical verses and crooning irish songs. you know you are in trouble, however, when eddie deezen gets top billing. deezen does his schtick and has a couple nice moments as well, but the material is just too threadbare than to be anything more than teenage sophomoric time filler. michael berryman, from the hills have eyes, also has a brief but interesting cameo in the film. as for the other thespians, well, they are all pretty good at being pretty mediocre. stevens is lovely in fishnet stockings and french-cut panties, but beyond that don't expect too much more from her. her sister is played by elena sahagun, and she shows a bit more than brinke(a very lovely young lady by the way) and out acts brinke by miles. her husband, played by jay richardson shows off his ability to act and be funny amidst mediocrity. again, not a bad film to waste a little time that involves no thinking on. if you are a robert quarry fan, watch it for his performance at the very least.
