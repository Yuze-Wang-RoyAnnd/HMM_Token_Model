i had a hard time sitting through this. every single twist and turn is predictable. you're sitting there just waiting for it ... waiting for it ... and yes, there it is! just as you predicted at the very beginning of the movie. or 10 minutes out. et cetera. <br /><br />smart writing? no. <br /><br />torture porn? no, there's no nudity. other reviews calling this torture porn are most likely written by people on heavy drugs. unfortunately there's no torture and no nudity (yes, no nudity).<br /><br />there's no suspense at all in this "thriller". the only good part about this movie is the ending, but i'm not going to spoil that.<br /><br />i'm giving it a 2/10. a 1/10 would be a horrible b-movie. this movie had better acting.
