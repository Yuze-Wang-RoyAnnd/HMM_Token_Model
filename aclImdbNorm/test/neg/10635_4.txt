how could a film dealing with illegal mexican immigrants being robbed and beaten over the border be dull? well, "border incident" is.<br /><br />no wonder that song and dance man george murphy's career ended not long after this terrible film came out. politics was certainly a way out for this future senator who dies a horrible death in this slowly paced film. the film stereotypes the typical mexican migrant farmer worker as dimwitted and awfully dull.<br /><br />the film only picks up in intensity once the identities of murphy and ricardo montalban have been discovered as federal agents for the u.s. and mexico respectively.<br /><br />disappointing at best, we see similar problems in our very own society today.
