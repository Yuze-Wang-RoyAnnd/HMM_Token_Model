the first thing you should know about "zipperface" is that it was shot on video, so it has that peculiar "home-video-ish" look that is terribly distracting and makes it hard to take this seriously as a "real" film. and "zipperface" indeed looks as if a bunch of amateurs got together for an attempt at a "real" serial-killer thriller. it's not quite that, but it's not as bad as it looks, either. having a woman as one of the two detectives on the case puts a spin on the exploitation genre. dona adams gives an appealingly amateurish performance in the role - her obvious inexperience in front of the camera somehow works for her. plus, she puts up a great fight against the killer at the end. the red herrings appear ludicrous at first, but ultimately they work - i guessed the killer incorrectly. and you have to wonder if perhaps tarantino had seen the zipperface guy when he came up with the idea of "the gimp" for "pulp fiction".
