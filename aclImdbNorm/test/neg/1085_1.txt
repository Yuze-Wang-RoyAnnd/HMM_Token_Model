this film was sheer boredom from beginning to end. ok, so i salute boorman for raising the worldwide recognition of events in burma, but that is all he achieves. about 10 minutes into the film i thought "oh no, here we go again", and i could have told you exactly what was going to occur in the next 80 minutes or so. patricia arquette was out of her depth in such a role, and her acting was wooden and unconvincing. mind you, being saddled with such an awfully conventional script, maybe boredom set in, and was such reflected on the screen. a lot of the film was just plain laughable. at one stage, arquette's elderly companion is shot, and he is prostrate on the ground. in the next scene, he is sprinting through the forest, obviously attempting to break the world 100 meters record! - or maybe he's just trying to run away from boorman!!. if you find it hard to sleep one night then play beyond rangoon on your vcr and you'll be snoring in no time. i very rarely critisize a film as heavily as this, but in this case it is completely justified.
