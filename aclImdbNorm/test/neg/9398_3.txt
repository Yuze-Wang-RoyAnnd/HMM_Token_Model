diane lane is beautiful and sexy, and tuscany is gorgeous but this film is no better than mediocre and that's being generous. the story line is grafted onto a travelogue and remains thoroughly uninvolving.<br /><br />set in (let's say) a suburb of newark, the plot would be deemed ridiculous. all that saves the movie are the tuscan countryside and occasional scenes set in florence and positano, and a film of the while-the-sun-sinks-slowly-in-the-west variety would have served better to show what it certainly one of the loveliest locales in all the world.
