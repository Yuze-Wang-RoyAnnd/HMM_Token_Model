i really loved the millenium series, starred by lance henriksen, which is why i bought the film. obviously at some level it was a mistake. mutant/monster films are usually very bad and this film is no exception.<br /><br />the basic idea itself is not totally judged to fail (well nevertheless this film would never have been a success, even with a good director & actors), but the way it turns out this is just a b-class movie. the scenes that are supposed to be scary seem more funny to me and the critter is not credible at all.<br /><br />however, watching this film with group of friends in restless mood makes this film shine as it is so unintentionally hilarious.
