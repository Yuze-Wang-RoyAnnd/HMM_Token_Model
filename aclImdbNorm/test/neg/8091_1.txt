this is movie is garbage, it looked really funny on the previews but i didn't laugh once through the whole movie. do yourself a big favor and don't waste your money on this, don't waste anyone's money on this. i gave it a 1/10 believe me i would have given it less if i could have. i'm a 15 year old guy and i thought it was trash if you wanna see a good movie go out and see jay and silent bob strike back.
