i was actually looking forward to this movie. the commercials made it look real cool and action packed. and i heard that claire daines' character was arrested for assault so i thought that maybe she would kick a lot of ass and that would be cool. but noooooooo!!. their was hardly any action at all and the character were all kinda bland. the only saving grace was omar epps and even he didn't help this movie much.
