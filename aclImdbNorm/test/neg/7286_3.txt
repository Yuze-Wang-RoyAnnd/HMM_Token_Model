hi there. i watched the first part when it came out, and i don't remember having left such a bad impression on me as this one.<br /><br />first, the animation is choppy, wooden, not worked on, lacks naturality - i understand the drawing style was to be of some 'atlantean' kind, but, it could be done with the usual disney finesse... see "tarzan" to see what i mean. if i didn't see the disney logo in the beginning, i would never say it was a disney movie.<br /><br />second, the plot was more like a pc game style, like a good old quest. not that it was bad, but it lacked a story that binds the viewer to the characters and their goals. it was inconvincing, at least. the film was meant for children, but this was waaay to childish at times.<br /><br />third, the music... i would say it was improper, but it just fits the whole scene with the plot and animation...<br /><br />overall, i think this was some kind of an amusement, just by-the-way kind of project by several apprentice animators, just to fill in the count for disney movies. sorry to hear that from myself, a big disney lover...
