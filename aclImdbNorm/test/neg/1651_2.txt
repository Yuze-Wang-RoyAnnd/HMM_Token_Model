here's another of these modern-day ultra-sleaze comedies in which dysfunctional families are supposedly hilarious. know wonder people once asked, "what ever happened to pauly shore?" well, shore didn't disappear, but his career took a nose-dive, that's for sure. movies like this one, didn't help.<br /><br />in "son-in-law," shore plays an incredibly-obnoxious character called "crawl," and yet he's the most likable of the family! his father is a profane idiot; his mother is totally incompetent, his young brother is a sex maniac and his college-age sister is a real snot.<br /><br />watching an hour and a half of totally-unlikeable people was tough to do. i certainly wouldn't watch this again, or recommend it to anyone but die-hard shore fans. adam sandler took pauley's shtick and went a lot further with it.<br /><br />the following is an excerpt from the imdb title page here under "biography" and it explains why i am not the only one who was disgusted with this movie.<br /><br />"........but his lunacy was dismissed as crude, dumb and, for the most part, unfunny. his film career quickly tanked. this downhill spiral was not helped by the failure of his failed fox sitcom "pauly" (1997) in 1997. lambasted unmercifully by both critics and media alike, he was soon becoming a running joke and forced to lie low and ride out the storm...."
