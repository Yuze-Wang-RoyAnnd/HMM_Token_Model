watched the director's cut last night...glad it was free rental, even a dollar would have been too much for me to pay to watch this attempt at "film noir". the anachronisms (modern telephones) were annoying to me, not clever, seeming more like budget constraints than anything else. the "non-traditional" casting i also found distracting. if i have to stop following the story to wonder "what the heck is the black chick/drag queen doing there?" then the storyteller has failed me. again, not clever in my opinion but annoying and irritating, and very film school final project-ish. and for pete's sake if you are going to shoot in black and white at least use some of the techniques used in old films that take full advantage of not having color. there was no use of nuance in the lighting, no shades of gray, no depth, no texture...just black and just white...boring!
