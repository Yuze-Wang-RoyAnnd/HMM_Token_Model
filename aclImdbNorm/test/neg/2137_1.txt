boring, horrible piece of italian euro-trash about a scientist who seems to spend most of his time guzzling beer(this is what makes him american, right? our scientists spend most of their academic life soused out of their minds, sure. that's where all the really great theories come from), who's studying something(dolphin calls, fish migration patterns, who knows). he hears a weird sound through his headphones, proving that his radio is picking up a station in jamaica. at the same time, a jack skellington girl with one of the worst, most bleached manes of bad 80's hair that it has ever been my pleasure to witness is trying to calm down the dolphins in the seaquarium she works at, as they're apparently upset about the amount of fish she's been doling out lately. the beginning of the film was a really badly colored storyline about two annoying, very italian people who's boat is attacked by something unseen under the water. the whiny woman is never seen again(best part of the story), and the guys' corpse is found with no legs. the dim, alcoholic scientist(who has an inexplicable, english- american- italian accent) and the stick girl with the hay hair begin to theorize that there's some kind of giant monster lurking under the seas off the coast of italy...err..florida.<br /><br />they enlist the help of an electrician to set up an underwater mike, so that the monster can sing karaoke. this guy has a beautiful girlfriend, who's only drawback is that she pronounces peter "pey-tah", but for some reason he's sexually drawn to the anatomical skeleton with the frizzly hair, a situation that leaves one blinking.<br /><br />the dubbing is awful, the editor a spaz, and the storyline generally a yawn. there's a bit about how this weird scientific corporation genetically engineered this monster giant shark-squid-barracuda thing for some reason that makes no sense, and a really unpleasant greasy haired guy goes around killing women, again for no apparent reason. a stupid sheriff and his bulked up deputy are along for the ride, along with a female scientist(who we know is smart because she wears huge glasses). at one time the woman scientist takes on the huge, terrible monster(yeah, right, ed wood's giant octopus was more believable) with only a small handaxe, and she wins the contest. hooray for skinny little women, who obviously make the best monster hunters!<br /><br />the solution to the problem of the giant thing is to blow up half of the everglades, leaving a dead zone for several miles in every direction. to hell with ecology and the environment, right? we have to kill this giant monster! at the end, the electrician and his broomstick love ride off into the sunset on her vespa, which is o.k. since she's gotten over her colleagues' death and he's not very upset that his girlfriend got whacked by the crazy guy with the greasy hair. hooray for true love! wait a minute, isn't there something fishy about all this...
