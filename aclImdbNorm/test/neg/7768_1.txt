appalling, shallow, materialistic nonsense. how women (and gay men?) can enjoy this rubbish is beyond me. no self-respecting man would ever want to be with one of these neurotic gold diggers. what is even more concerning is that so many reviewers say they relate to the women on the show. if that is the future of women, lord help us all. showing your independence and being respected as equals with men should not be about spreading your legs every three seconds with a different man. i think this demeans women and does not do them justice. but this review is no rant against women. fans of this show say it is "hilarious" and "rivoting" but every time i have watched this show i have just struggled to stay awake. despite the narrative of the reporter woman, at no point in this show is there even anything close to something that could be considered a rational thought. so, it's not entertaining, and it's not informative, so why would you bother watching it? one out of ten stars.
