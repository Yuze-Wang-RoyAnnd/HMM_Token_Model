we've all seen bad movies, well this one takes the cake. i've seen that junior movie box staring back at many times from my many journeys to the horror section at the local video store, and i was a little interested, it looks like it pays some homage to texas chainsaw massacre, so i thought i'd get it. mistake! junior sucks hard, long, and with commitment. in other words it's really bad. although it does win my award for most creative use of a bikini top. avoid!!
