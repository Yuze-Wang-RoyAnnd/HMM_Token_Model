i recently rented this promising mini series, i didn't even know they had adapted it for television. i was really looking forward to it since the book icon is one of the best spy thrillers i have ever read. what a disappointment it was. the plot only loosely resembles the one in the book, the characters are completely miscast and there's some appalling acting. a shame really. the story behind icon is perfect for the silver screen, but i think television budgets just aren't big enough for a decent adaptation of this spectacular book.<br /><br />forsyth deserves much, much better than this. avoid and stick to the book, which is a must-read.
