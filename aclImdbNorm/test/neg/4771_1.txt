if you value your life in any way, shape, or form, you will do yourself a courtesy and pass by this seemingly "interesting" movie on the dvd rack.<br /><br />i know what you're thinking, "i saw the preview and it looked great!" however, buyer beware, i fell into the same trap. one of my friends expressed certain reluctance to watching this movie, but i forced her to sit it out. oh, how i regret that decision.<br /><br />like most horror movies, the movie starts out cheerfully in a sunny mexican resort where two couples are lured to an ancient mayan ruin by a fellow resort-goer. upon arrival, they are disturbed by the appearance of two jungle people who are all but oblivious to their greeting shouts. as if this isn't ominous enough, the tour group casts aside large plant growth and declares an unused path consumed by wildlife a perfect route to their destination. i guess it wouldn't be much of a movie if they utilized rational decision making and turned around just then, but, well, this wasn't much of a movie anyways.<br /><br />after some hiking, the sixsome (the resort goer brought a friend) stumble upon the ruins and at once their doubts are dispelled by its beauty and history. that is, until frantic tribal people emerge from the jungle armed with a vengeance for no reason in particular, shouting in an indecipherable language. since when are brutal verbal assaults assuaged by calm, patronizing language - don't ask me - but nonetheless, the cast tries anyway, to no avail, obviously. suddenly, the sixth trail member, dimitri, is punctured with several arrowheads from the mayans and all hell breaks loose. a gunshot finishes the job and the horrified travelers retreat quickly up the ruin.<br /><br />now, if there was ever a plot to this movie, it ended here. the introduction took at most 20 minutes and it was unfortunately the best 20 minutes of the movie. on top of the ruins, the now fivesome realizes they are stranded by murderous locals and proceed to make countless good decisions, one of them being to use a withered rope to lower one of their members into the bowels of the ruin. needless to say, the adventurer is seriously hurt and then trapped within the ruins and the two girlfriends are gravely injured trying to rescue him.<br /><br />the rest of the movie continues plotlessly, with no real horror, only only blood and gore, as displayed when one girl yanks a plant growing within her out, gushing torrents of blood and then again when somebody's legs are cut off, only to have the same plat from within the girl strangle him later.<br /><br />my only satisfactions in this movie were observing the very attractive jonathon tucker, playing jeff mcintire, grow increasingly more frazzled and distressed and sitting long enough to ascertain that almost all of the cast dies a horrible, gruesome death. their simulated pain seems an adequate compensation for the time suck that was this movie.<br /><br />supposedly, the storyline goes that the ruin is an ancient house of of dangerous spirits with an evil, flesh eating plant to ward off and consume unlucky visitors. unfortunately, i got no such warning from screaming bloodthirsty plants and the only evil thing relating to this movie that i am truly horrified by is the script writer.
