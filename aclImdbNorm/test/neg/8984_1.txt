i don't leave imdb comments about films but this.... this film was bad. very bad. i fast forwarded through most of it, stopping where i hoped the acting had improved since the last scene, only to continue with the fast forwards. formula plot -- once the obvious murderers were discounted, there was only the one left. and that was in the first five minutes. scene by scene it felt as though i'd already read the script before because there were no surprises, no mystery. the tori character... bad bad acting. a true waste of time on dvd and a definite 'let's go to bed early' option if it's the only thing on television. if you watch this film, you will find yourself realising you'll never be able to get back the time you've just wasted.
