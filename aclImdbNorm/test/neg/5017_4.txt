bobcat goldthwait should be commended for attempting to do something different with this surprisingly heartfelt film, a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of being honest about everything. melinda hamilton stars as amy, a girl who has had oral sex with a canine in the past on a lark. she struggles with telling her fianc'e, john. of course the truth does rear it's shaggy ugly head. the film deals with the fallout of said escapade. the movie is well-acted by all, save for perhaps jack plotnick as dougie, who never really felt like he mashed well with the picture. and the film while solid enough seems to miss it's mark a few times. every single person in the film struggles with massive hypocrisy and all our a tad hard to relate to. bobcat should be commended for doing something different, as i said before, but different does not always equal good and this pales ever so slightly not to goldthwaits own directorial debut, the criminally misunderstood "shakes the clown"<br /><br />my grade: c-
