this movie looked fun on the cover and i honestly thought 'how bad can this be?' little did i know. out of the gate the dialogue was unbearable. it was contrived, unrealistic and not even interesting. dialogue on upn syndicated television shows is more natural sounding. the story was implausible and had nearly zero play-off at the end. the end with the snake is almost confusing and seemed staged. the only remotely interesting character is rose mcgowen's, who is mute which prevents her from being ruined with cliche ridden garbage dialogue (well, at least until the end when even she has to speak). the only thing that even gives this a 3 over a 1 or 2 is rose mcgowen's nude scene. truly awful. save yourself the trouble and rent something more interesting like a barney video.
