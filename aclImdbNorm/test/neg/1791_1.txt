of all the films i have seen, this one, the rage, has got to be one of the worst yet. the direction, logic, continuity, changes in plot-script and dialog made me cry out in pain. "how could anyone come up with something so crappy"? gary busey is know for his "b" movies, but this is a sure "w" movie. (w=waste).<br /><br />take for example: about two dozen fbi & local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer. inside the jeep is ma and is "confused" as to why all the cops are about. within seconds a huge gun battle ensues, ma being killed straight off. the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them. the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet/pellet. ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough. truly a miracle, not since the six-shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle.
