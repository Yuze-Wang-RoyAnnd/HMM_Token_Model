this really is a cringe making exercise. dressed up as a tribute to fire fighters it contain stupid scenes of "we're just a bunch of wacky guys" in the midst of the "my goodness this can be really dangerous" parts. mostly it is just plain dumb. you couldn't believe for a single minute that real fire fighters act like this. it is so awful i couldn't bear to watch at times. if my daughter hadn't rented it and then insisted on seeing it through to the end i would have had no option but to turn it off.<br /><br />thing is i'm a john travolta fan. every interview of his i've seen just raises my opinion of him. i think this was one strictly for the money. i'm sure he'll be happy when this one gets forgotten.
