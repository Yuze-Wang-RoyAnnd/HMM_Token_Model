james cagney plays richard gargan (nicknamed "patsy"!), a former gangster now overseeing the surly lads as the new superintendent of a state-run reform school. tepid genre entry wherein cagney's the whole show; he dominates the picture, but only because there's not much else of interest going on. jimmy gives just what's expected from his hard-boiled persona, which can be satisfying if you're in for a quick fix. the direction (by archie mayo, though michael curtiz was said to have helped) is straightforward without being particularly gripping, although the narrative slips in the second-half, grinding the film down to a messy conclusion (with even cagney's patsy getting lost in the shuffle). remade in 1938 as "crime school" and again in 1939 as "hell's kitchen". ** from ****
