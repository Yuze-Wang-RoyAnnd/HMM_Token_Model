if you never have read the book and never intend to read it in the future, go on and watch the movie (6/10). it is a nice fantasy movie with well done cgi, nice acting, a beautiful environment and an above-average fantasy story.<br /><br />if you have read the book like me about 10 times or more and really love it, don't expect too much (or better: don't expect anything at all). the story is totally different from the original book. this may explain that the movie is voted 1/10 from people around 40 or more (like me) and much better from people who most probably never read the book before and thus expect nothing.<br /><br />most of the differences between movie and book are not really necessary and change the setting (in my opinion much to the worse): <br /><br />- the magic in the book works with rituals for classic magical effects. (changing weather, creating illusions, transform into animals, ...) in the movie the magic is more like "jedi-school for the middle ages" (tm) (wooden sticks instead of lightsabers). that the devil is looking like emperor palpatine (after part iii) doesn't make it really better.<br /><br />- the mill in the book is not totally cut off the world like in the movie. in the book the story is set near dresden, which krabat visits one time with his master and also he visits some nearby villages for festivities. (this part might have been changed to cut costs.) i also don't understand why in the movie the mill is located in the hills while the nearby graveyard is set in the high mountains.<br /><br />- the whole surrounding is the average run of the mill fantasy medieval style. lots of mud everywhere, dirty faces, not an orderly kitchen, only very rough houses. the book never suggested such an environment.<br /><br />- in the book the master tries to make krabat his successor but krabat rejects. krabat is somewhere between admiration, distance and silent rejection. in the movie krabat rejects the master always openly like a stubborn schoolboy.<br /><br />- the movie is set in 1647 instead of around 1720. this makes it impossible for the master to tell some stories from his youth probably around 170x. ok, the stories are missing anyway in the movie.<br /><br />also some explanations given in the book would have been helpful and would not cost so much minutes: <br /><br />- in the book all work done at day is effortless and work in the night is like normal work. this explanation is missing in the movie. sometimes the boys are sweating and sometimes they are happy.<br /><br />- the book explains why only a few "gesellen" try to confront the master: if the master dies by any mundane reasons, the "gesellen" are free and keep their magical powers. if the master dies at the confrontation, all will lose their power forever.
