simply i just watched this movie just because of sarah & am also giving these 4 stars just because of her,on the other side this movie was easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen. theacting was horrible. the script was uninspired. this was a movie that kept contradicting itself. the film was sloppy and unoriginal. its not like i was expecting a good film. just something to give me a jump or two. this did not even do that. <br /><br />he worst thing is that, the more i think about the overall plot, the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we keep finding. a real shame really, as i'm fairly sure that there was a good idea lurking in there somewhere...<br /><br />i'm perhaps being a bit harsh giving the film a 4/10 but given the actors involved and again sara obvious writing talent, this film really should have delivered far more.
