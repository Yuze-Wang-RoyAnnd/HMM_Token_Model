it is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen, and who will die. it is about 4 women and a man who on a vacation. this was made during the end of the ultra nazi seventies, when blonde women were supposedly ultra american survivors and brunettes were all deserving of death.<br /><br />this movie, like the others of that era, contrives to bring this about, and the viewer knows this. there is no mystery or suspense. the people squabble, but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time, it is laughable.<br /><br />the five people happen upon two savage young characters, and go nuts. everyone is nuts, so that the director-writer team can justify their nazi propaganda.<br /><br />for some reason, the guy is attracted to the blonde, who is really not much to look at, and ignores a super hot looking brunette that any heterosexual man would go nuts over. one must remember that in the seventies, movies were meant to appeal to women and not men.<br /><br />totally crap and totally depressing.
