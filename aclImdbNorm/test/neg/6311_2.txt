it's really just terrible. quaid overacts more than shatner. the part where elvis walks in and says "you can have it all" just kills anything that might have been good in this movie that's bad enough as it is. drug use was completely snow coated, the only thing that had anything to do with his life was the bit about him wedding his cousin. quaid also looks nothing like lewis and has dark roots and eyebrows. i wish this could be re-made in the future with someone who doesn't try so hard. a bigger budget wouldn't hurt and maybe more about his actual life. i was very, very disappointed in quaid. don't watch this movie or you will be too.
