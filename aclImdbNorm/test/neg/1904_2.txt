if you need a clue as to whether playmaker is decent or not, look to its star, colin firth, who refers to it in an interview as "absolute rubbish -- i sincerely hope no one ever sees it."<br /><br />the script and plot are ludicrous, the female lead is unconvincing. the only thing worthwhile is colin firth, and he seems slightly embarrassed throughout.<br /><br />for diehard firth fans only -- the shower scene alone is worth the $3.99 you might have to shell out, should you find it in a video cutout bin like i did.<br /><br />i'm happy for mr. firth that his days of taking projects like this one are over!
