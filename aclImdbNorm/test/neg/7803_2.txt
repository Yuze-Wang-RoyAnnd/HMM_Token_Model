patsy kensit and some random australian bloke star as a duo of wannabe tough coppers in the middle of investigating a series of art-gallery related murders, but in between they can still find the time to shoot juvenile shoplifters and suspect the brand new wife of the male cop of being adulterous. the serial killer suddenly isn't important anymore when the supposed lover of the wife (who's basically just a co-worker of hers) is found murdered and the male cop becomes prime suspect. "tunnel vision" is a really dull, implausible and tension-free aussie thriller that obviously imitates popular sex-thrillers like "fatal attraction", "disclosure" and "basic instinct". the characters are extremely one-dimensional and pretty much every good-cop/bad-cop clich'e is extendedly described in the script. the struggling position of police women in a corps full of men, the shoot-first-ask-questions-later mentality, alcohol problems through stress, etc etc
