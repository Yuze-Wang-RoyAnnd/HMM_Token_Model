i was pleasantly pleased with the ending. i just saw this movie yesterday, and was going to turn it off, but changed my mind. it was not at all the direction i thought the story would end on. thats about all positive i can say about this film. all of the actors are nobodys, especially the lead. while she is an attractive young woman, she'll never make it big. the writing, direction, and acting are wooded, sort of like what you would see on daytime soaps. the filming locations were very clever in making you think it could be anywhere, instead of blatantly tipping off it was in canada. as this was shot entirely in canada, i'm assuming the entire lot was canadien, which is not entirely bad as some recent canadien tv productions: "cold squad", "stone; underover" are quite well done.
