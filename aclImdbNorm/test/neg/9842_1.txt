this film is terrible. not only is the story unbelievable, the situations the characters put themselves in are so silly, to the point where it isn't shocking. i find it sad that daisy eagan, star of broadway's the secret garden, decided that this would be a career step. the idea is interesting, two young girls coming of age very quickly. but the sex isn't even arousing. the film is silly, the story is silly, the performances are silly, and the whole concept while interesting falls flat. i'm sure all 14 year old girls make out with guys after they've had their first period and tried to flush their panties down the toilet. better luck next time guys. my scale * t-scale *
