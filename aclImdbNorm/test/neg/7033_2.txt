this was an appallingly bad film! ashley rose orr was horrible, she had none of shirley temple's charm at all! those ghastly smiles she would do when she scrunched up her piggy little eyes in a way that i think was 'supposed' to be cute and make the audience go - "aahhhh bless!" it just made me want to slap her. she must have simpered "oh my goodneth!" about a hundred times throughout the film. also she could barely utter a sentence without accompanying it with a fake giggle. horrible horrible film .. if i could rate it minus 10, i would. don't waste your money on this piece of rubbish, go out and buy a genuine shirley temple film!
