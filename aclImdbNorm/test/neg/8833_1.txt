i'm sorry but i just honestly cannot see why anyone would actually like this. it's stereotypical and real homeschoolers are nothing like they were on this show!! personally i'm glad it got canceled after the first few episodes. i mean, this kind of show would certainly be alright if everyone knew that homeschoolers weren't really like this, and the whole story was just for the show, but unfortunately not everyone is aware of this. if anyone out there that watched this actually believed this is what goes on in the life of a homeschooler, then i honestly feel sorry for them. this reminds me of the kind of portrayal they have of homeschooled kids in "mean girls". it's sad, really, that people think this way. this is complete garbage, imho.
