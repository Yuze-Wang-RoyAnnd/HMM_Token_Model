i was told about this film from a friend who saw it late night during the week he told me it was so bad that i had to see it! so i went on an auction site and bought the film. this is probably the worst film i have ever seen. it makes you laugh when it really shouldn't. terrible acting and terrible storyline. plus he looks nothing like michael jackson?!<br /><br />i still recommend buying this film as its one of the funniest things you will ever see. van peebles is a joke in this film.<br /><br />robots cant bluff... psyche!<br /><br />i have to say though the special effects are actually amazing... psyche! dvds were probably even out when this film came out but if i had my way it would be a straight to vhs release yes people it is that bad!
