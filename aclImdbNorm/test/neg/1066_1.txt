i truly hate and despise this film and the filmmakers behind it.<br /><br />sure, i'm all for making a hard hitting and honest film about youth and youth culture.1987's "river's edge" is an excellent example of a well-made teen drama. however, what i take exception to is the infantile, grubby and sensationalist approach that the makers of "2:37" took.<br /><br />a prime example is how it raises so many issues and yet fails in any significant way to comment or reach a resolution on even one of them.<br /><br />my other major problem with this film, apart from its complete plagiarism of gus van sant's "elephant" (surprised van sant didn't sue) is its 'bull loose in a china shop' attitude to quite delicate issues such as incest and particularly suicide.<br /><br />in short, avoid this film like the plague and anything that this filmmaker ever is involved with subsequently. i've heard that his motivation for making "2:37" may or may not be based on lies. having seen the substandard result, this doesn't surprise me in the slightest. this is a glorified student film exercise that has no place whatsoever being in a cinema or on dvd. pure and simple.
