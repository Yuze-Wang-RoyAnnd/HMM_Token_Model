the original wasc isn't by any means a must see movie in the genre. in fact, if it weren't for it's chilling first 25 minutes there wouldn't be any logical reason for watching it. the remake takes those 25 minutes and turns them into a mediocre 85 minute teen horror flick. <br /><br />now, i don't have anything against pg-13 horror movies but the tendency surrounding them is getting lame. when you see the pg-13 rating you expect a movie filled with false scares, teen t.v. or music stars, and a plot that has been used for several times. don't even ask for gore or violence. <br /><br />i know that it's not correct to compare both the original wasc and the remake, but i think that it's necessary to do it because the whole idea of the new one is based on the beginning of the original. the tension that is felt through the first movie is not present by any means in the remake. not even with the amazing settings or great use of lightning. no tension, suspense, thrills...nothing. the movie goes too slow before it gets a little "interesting", and that's when the stranger appears. the chasing sequence is probably the best part of the movie because at least there's a feeling of "what will happen next?". but that's it. the situations that set up for the climax are predictable, boring, and lack of suspense. the original has merits for having suspense in the most important scenes, and also, for a chilling climax for the most important scene of the movie. <br /><br />now, i understand that this is a pg-13 horror movie but, if you pay respect to the original. why change it's most important situation? the children are not supposed to survive! after the ending i felt like this movie was pointless. so the baby sitter was playing cat and mouse with a wacko...that's it?. then, the sequence at the hospital was plain stupid. and worst of all, it means that a sequel may be on the way. <br /><br />camila belle is the best thing about the movie. she delivers a cute, believable performance. she needs to pick better projects although this role will gain for her thousands of teenager fans. <br /><br />please, don't watch this movie. some people say that in order to support the horror genre we are supposed to support any movie that comes out. i don't necessary agree. if we ignore movies like wasc then the producers of horror movies will understand that we won't accept crap. we want good horror movies, not lame flicks filled with false scares. <br /><br />watch the original "when a stranger calls" instead because it's first 25 minutes are way better than the whole (pointless) remake.
