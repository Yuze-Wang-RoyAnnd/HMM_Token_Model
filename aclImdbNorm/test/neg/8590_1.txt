i just got back from "ags". after seeing it, i'm convinced that no matter how much it's written how he extensively researched the film, stone never has watched an nfl game in his life. great cinematography ? give me a break. the game montages were almost unviewable and 90% of the other shots in the film were close-ups. was there anything in this movie that wasn't brought up in "north dallas forty" ?<br /><br />aging star player ... check. young hot shot .... check. painkillers .... check. owner who doesn't "get it" .... check. crazy off-field behavior .... check<br /><br />also, it's the playoffs in dallas (i.e dec or jan) in an outdoor stadium, yet people sitting there in tank-tops and shorts ! and what was with those lights ? were they playing in a japanese kabuki theater or a sports stadium ?<br /><br />and the strategy shown in the game was laughable. it's fourth & 1 inside the "sharks'" 30. dallas leads 35-31. kick the frigging field goal. not only would this had made sense football-wise, but you'd then have an even better final sequence where they could have scored and had to go for the two-point conversion. hell, tie the game w/ the extra point and stone could have made it an even 3 hours with overtime.<br /><br />were the lame montages of "old time" football players supposed to be a tribute to the game ? give me a break.<br /><br />and the script ... ugh. more cliches than you can shake a stick at .. oops, there's another one.<br /><br />"slapshot" was better than this movie. by far.<br /><br />1/10.<br /><br />skips this at all costs.<br /><br />
