once in a while it is good to see a really bad film like this, just so you know how decent an actor keanu reeves is by comparison. the premise of this story is good: teenagers go out on a boat, meteor lands in water, aliens kill teenagers. what's not to love about that, if you're into scream thrillers? but i should have known something was up when i read it was only 75 minutes long. i thought, "i hate judging movies by how long they are. who says a movie has to be 90 minutes?" but once i took the dvd home from bbuster, i was shocked at the awful production quality, acting, directing of this completely amateurish piece of garbage. the only reason i watched it to the end was because i don't have cable tv, and i already paid four bucks for it. however, there was one ray of light: the actor who played "chris" is actually decent, and far outclasses this dreck. first of all, the special effects were cheap and unconvincing. then the aliens--the costumes seemed interesting (rubber suits) but since most of the film takes place in the dark, you don't really get to see them! and hardly any of the actors were convincing enough to suspend disbelief. finally, i must say that the dvd jacket was made with much higher production standards than the film itself, which felt like a rip-off, so beware of that when you rent other dvds. save your $4 and buy a pint of beer.
