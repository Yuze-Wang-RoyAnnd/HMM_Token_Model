the director infuses this film with false depth by repeating a gimmick throughout the film. every single shot in this movie is 3 times longer than it needs to be. you could easily cut out 1.5 hours of this agonizingly long 2.5 hour film without eliminating: one word of dialogue, one image, one event, or bit of movement.<br /><br />this was one of the most gratuitous wastes of film i have ever seen. other reviewers have called it pretentious, which is an understatement. l'humanite is pseudo-intellectual trash designed to be anti-hollywood so that the cannes judges could assert their independence from the oscars.<br /><br />the imdb reviewer states: "unlike hollywood movies - which usually force the audience into overdrive - this forces the audience to slow down and look at some of life's tiniest and most mundane features in great detail." you would have to be catatonic to stare at some of these images this long and move as slowly at these characters. this isn't real life unless you are heavily medicated.<br /><br />finally, i felt that schott'e's portrayal was a sad rip-off of peter sellers' masterful "chauncy gardner." he uses the same facial expressions and postures. he even gardens! in many respects there are parallels between these two movies. the main difference being that "being there" moves along and doesn't rely on shock and gimmicks to create a meaningful experience while questioning various things we take for granted in life.
