cameron mitchell plays an actor who is dating a young actress who used to date the head of a movie studio (she's too young for both of them!). at a party, when he's lighting his cigarette, the studio boss throws a high alcohol content drink in his face, and he catches fire. in the hospital, his face is entirely bandaged and he still lights up a cigarette! he becomes the resident sculptor of the movieland wax museum and palace, where he also lights up cigarettes!<br /><br />mitchell recovers, more or less, having really poorly done burn makeup on one side of his face that looks like gray spackle and tape, and an eyepatch. when mitchell isn't smoking, he's killing people. well, he only kills people sometimes, since he prefers to inject them with something that puts them in a sort of waxy coma. if he doesn't administer it regularly (and he never seems to remember), they start to move again a little, although they're in a sort of hypnotic zombie state. not all his sculptures are people, though. he evidently does have talent as a sculptor.<br /><br />the ending, which seemed to have been struck from a much poorer print than the rest of the movie, is really absurd. they seemed not to know what to do, and went back to the title for an idea. apart from the oddly grainy final shots, the rest of the movie is in fairly good shape, except for the audio in some scenes which sounds like it was run through a blown speaker. definitely not one of the better wax museum movies.
