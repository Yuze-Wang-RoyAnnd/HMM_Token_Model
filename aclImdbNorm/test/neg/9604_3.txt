alright! a sci-fi/horror/action b-hybrid directed by jim wynorski and in the final scenes we get to see a cyborg with a defleshed metal head killing off multiple people! as with any wynorski-flick, he throws in a whole bunch of crazy ideas and subplots that mostly don't lead to anywhere. but "storm trooper" is more like a two-movies-for-the-price-of-one kind of deal. on the one hand we got the drama/thriller part (as such the film opens) with carol alt killing her incredibly annoying & ungrateful husband (a plot that simply leads to nowhere). and on the other hand we got the 'escaped cyborg on a rampage' part, "night of the living dead"-style. with carol and the cyborg being the ones trapped inside the house and a bunch of special ops/bounty hunters playing the role of the zombies, trying to break into the house. needless to say this flick is not up there with the greatest. zach galligan (of "gremlins"-fame) especially is painfully bad and corey feldman (in a small supporting roll) is once again completely wasted on this movie. wynorski even rips off one of his own movies here, since i am 99% sure he used some stock footage of his previous film "976 evil ii" (the scene with the exploding truck and the motorcycle). yes, it's so not good and so much fun. this is strictly for wynorski-fans only. and i am one of them, in case you didn't know already.
