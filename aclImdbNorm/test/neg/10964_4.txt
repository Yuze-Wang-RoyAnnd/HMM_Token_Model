the plot of the movie is pretty simple : a viral outbreak turned the population into flesh-eating zombies. those who left became "hunters".<br /><br />well, first of all, this is not the worst zombie movie there is. among the worst are "zombiez" and the infamous "zombie lake".<br /><br />in fact i think, the idea for "quick and the undead" was very good, just executed poorly. considering the budget they had to work with, this movie looks very good. i wasn't bored at all while watching it. special effects were solid, although they did use cgi once (fat zombie getting shot in the head), but everything else (gore, guts) was rather good. acting is awful however. our main guy looks like young clint eastwood, other "actors" are not even worth mentioning. as far as the plot goes, they didn't work enough on the development of the story.<br /><br />bad : acting, low-budget. good : special effects, idea for the movie.<br /><br />overall, this flick deserves 4/10 from me. it's not as bad as people say. imagine a zombie western, then watch this movie.
