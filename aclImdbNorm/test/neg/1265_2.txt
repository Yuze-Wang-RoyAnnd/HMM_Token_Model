i happened upon a rare copy of this early almodovar film with high expectations - almodovar is a prolific contemporary director, i enjoyed his 1988 film "women on the verge of a nervous breakdown", and i had read one or two very positive reviews of the film. well, i must have missed completely the humor that the reviewers saw in this film. i just found it incoherent, tasteless, and boring. yes, there are plenty of innuendos, people in drag, and crude sexual situations, and yes, these elements may have shocked audiences in 1982 (which was almost certainly almodovar's intention), but much of the shock value has probably eroded over the years, leaving a limp storyline. beyond that, the whole movie seemed very chaotic, none of the characters were particularly sympathetic, and for a "comedy" - even a dark one - i just didn't find this film funny. i suppose it is possible there is a very select audience for a film like this, but i'm just not part of that audience, and not sure that i want to be.
