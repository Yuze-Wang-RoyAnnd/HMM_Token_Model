fred astaire is reteamed with rita hayworth one year after their big hit for columbia, "you'll never get rich". that was the movie which put hayworth on the hollywood map, yet her performance in this wan romantic musical hardly gives a suggestion why she was so suddenly popular. down buenos aires way, a tyrannical hotel owner demands that his four daughters marry in order of age; one may think film takes place in the 18th century, but no, it's modern-day 1942. astaire is an ex-hoofer-turned-gambler who goes back to dancing to earn some money, getting mixed up in impersonating a letter-writing admirer to hayworth's stone-cold society beauty. fred gazes at rita with a brotherly smile, but she's so mannequin-like (lip-synching to her songs like a wide-eyed wind-up doll) that all romantic sparks quickly sputter. they do dance together quite comfortably, however, and the jerome kern score is unmemorable but not too bad. ** from ****
