this movie was boring. very much like underworld, only even less interesting. it's not much of a werewolf movie and no where near a horror film. the lead couple were boring. i totally didn't care about vivian and aiden. and there was so little character development that i didn't care about any character in the film. the plot was paper thin. the transformations were basically nil. i did like the wolves themselves, might as well have have done a wolf documentary, i would have liked that better. i wouldn't recommend this movie. i didn't find it fun or interesting. it just drags and everyone in it is a boring drag. this movie could win an award for how not to make a werewolf film.
