this film is slow. this film is cheap. this film makes friday the 13th look like a best picture nominee. the acting is crap. the special effects are crap. no one dies for like 40 minutes and all the people do is act badly. the only thing that saves it is it's ability to make you laugh at all the stupidity going on. the funniest part is watching the heroine "fight off" the attacker. she supposed to be trained but she fights like a 70 year old. they spend pointless scenes on people who don't die and no scenes on people who do die to the point where you don't even know why they are dieing. i love slashers but this is just crap.
