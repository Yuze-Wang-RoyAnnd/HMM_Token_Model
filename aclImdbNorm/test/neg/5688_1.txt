the film begins with a 30 minute explanation about the war, the human cyborgs, battles, history, and then dumps 2 actors into a gravel pit. they run around this gravel pit/desert area for about an hour shooting at each other. that's it. must have cost about lb10.00 to make, with change. avoid.<br /><br />marks out of ten: acting -9 sets 1 costumes -9 direction -50 production 1 titled intro 4<br /><br />i think to improve this film would be to: lose the commentary. (let the watcher decide what's going on). remove some of the awful cgi. add some techno rave music to it. they might just rescue it.......
