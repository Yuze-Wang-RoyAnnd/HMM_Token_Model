this was so bad, i want god to give me an extra two hours of life having had to sit through it.<br /><br />first off, the acting was uniformly bad. there was barely a plot, unless "shaggy dog story with a guy in a rain poncho and skeleton mask instead of a dog" counts.<br /><br />the editing was was all over the place, and the slow-mo shots of the "gore" (red corn syrup flying through the air--doubtless flung using a spoon) got irritating after the tenth time, and infuriating after the hundredth time.<br /><br />i like michael rooker. he's done some good work. this was not good. this was less than good. and by that, i mean that it sucked. hard.<br /><br />for god's sake, don't watch this movie.
