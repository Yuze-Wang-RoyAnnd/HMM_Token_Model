updating of the clare booth luce play and the 1939 movie is a major disappointment. the cast of women is excellent, most of the individual scenes work but nothing hangs together. there is no connection from scene to scene almost as if the film was crafted in parts and then assembled in a vacuum. granted the story of a woman dealing with her husband's infidelity and how she is helped and hindered by her friends is a less shocking one now in an age when divorce is so common, but at the same time its just as timely as ever, i just wish they could have managed to connect all of the pieces together because as it stands now you really don't feel pulled along by the plot. wait for cable.
