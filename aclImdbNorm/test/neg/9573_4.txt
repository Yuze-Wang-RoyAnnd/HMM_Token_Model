as i write this in november 2005 i've become aware that the great british boom of cinema has come to an end and while people will claim much of this is down to the british government not giving film makers tax breaks i think the cause is much simpler - a lack of diversity on the part of producers over the last few years . let's have a look at what the brits were producing 1995-2005:<br /><br />funky gangster thrillers . lock stock and two smoking barrales was a truly great and thoroughly entertaining film and people went out of their way to ape guy ritchie's style with usually disappointing results <br /><br />romantic comedies . yeah okay i do realise four weddings , notting hill etc were produced by american studios but they're still vaguely " british films " . unfortunately because they're guaranteed to make a profit for the studios they have to follow a winning formula which usually involved hugh grant playing hugh grant for the umpteenth time <br /><br />black comedies . can anyone explain what a black comedy actually is ? in the british context it's usually a rambling film with often contemporary political statements made and which often resembles mike leigh's naked <br /><br />jasmin disdar's beautiful people is a good example of the third type of british movie . filmed in 1999 but set in 1993 it opens with two men having a fight on a bus and it's later revealed that one's a serb and one's a croat so we get a bite sized rundown of what was happening in the balkans at that time , though what's the odds of two former enemies in the balkans bumping into each other on a london bus ? this sums up one of the major flaws of the movie - irony takes precedence over likely situations , you can appreciate the final irony of the subplots but is the outcome likely ? perhaps the greatest irony is the title of the film . it's called beautiful people but certainly this audience member found them clich'ed stereotypical people that i couldn't believe in as three dimensional characters
