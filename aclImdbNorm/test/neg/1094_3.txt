with hong kong heart-throb andy lau and veteran star ching wan lau, "aau chin" has everything going for it for the beginning part of the movie, unfortunately, the movie falls apart at the end.<br /><br />andy lau plays a sophisticated thief who only has 4 weeks to live, but still has one thing unfinished... he pulls an elaborated scheme tricking the police into helping him... however, the police is hot on his tail.... can he pull it off before being caught?<br /><br />the build up of the movie is good. bits of pieces of clues are left behind for the audiences to try to guess at the real intention. unfortunately, the build up leads to a disappointed final showdown. it feels as if in the middle of the script, the writer has changed and that all the build-up becomes disconnected.<br /><br />a 3/10 ....
