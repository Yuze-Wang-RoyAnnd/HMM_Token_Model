like another reviewer, my wife bought this movie as part of a 20 movie family pack. i guess you could say that this was a decent made-for-tv movie for 1980, but it is super-predictable and the acting, except for robert conrad, is generally sub-par. the football scenes are nothing special and seem to mainly act as filler for the movie. the movie is very dated now, but a decent remake could probably make this into a good movie. however, is that really necessary? i mean, how many "underdog sports team works together for the big game with the undefeated guys" movies do we really need? this is probably a good movie for your younger kids if you find it in the bargain bin, but a sports movie buff will find it lacking.
