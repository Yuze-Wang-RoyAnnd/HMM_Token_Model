dresden had great expectations because of its spectacular theme and its high budget. i was really looking forward to it and i really wanted it to be good... but it is not. the only good thing are the special effects that are very well done, but, like in a really bad hollywood blockbuster, everything else is missing.<br /><br />it is poorly written, the screenplay tries to fulfill genre-rules with standard suspense/love- story elements but there is no depth or originality at all. it's way below average. the next thing: it is also poorly directed. it has this uninteresting tv-directing-style with lots of close-ups and wanna-be-great-action by fast editing where actually no action or suspense is. the actors are not bad but there is no performance that is touching in any way.<br /><br />i don't know... they obviously try to do a typical tv-movie and not a film for the cinema, where its alway good to have some edges and a clear visual style. but why do they try to fulfill typical commercial hollywood-rules? it really feels like the screenwriter did a weekend- class with some american scriptwriting-guru and then delivered this mess. is there no producer who is responsible for the project who has an interest in dramaturgy/ visual style or plain in simple this magical cinematic moments that make some tv-movies great ?!? do they think that an tv-audience is stupid and doesn't need to get a high quality- movie experience? the downfall was a very good example for a good tv-movie but there was probably some executive or producer who knew what he was doing.<br /><br />don't waste you time with this one, rent "downfall" instead...
