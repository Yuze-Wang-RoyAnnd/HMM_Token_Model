i watched this movie on video the other night and found myself dozing off throughout this uninspired snoozefest. first of all, one of my biggest pet peeves is when movies like this are characterized as horror movies. it is a thriller! get it right!it has no monsters or anything supernatural. it is simply a movie about a twisted serial killer (actually there is a very small body count so it is more of a serial torturer movie and it did a good job of torturing me.) the basic premise of a man luring teenagers to his house of horrors through online chat rooms could have made for a great movie but we only see him lure one pair of teen girls through the internet at the very beginning of the film. one of these girls turns out to be a local detective's daughter and he gets emotionally involved in the case. the film quickly changes from a potentially intelligent sado-masochistic thriller to a boring old cat and mouse game between the incredibly dull detective and the psychopathic captain howdy/carleton hendricks played adequately by writer/producer/twisted sister frontman, dee snider. the occasional attempts at meaningful poetic one-liners about the positive effects of pain and the like from snider are laughable. if he is attempting to get people to subscribe to these opinions through this film, he fails miserably and (unintentionally) makes light of them. the directing by john pieplow (whose only previous directing effort was jurassic women, which i will let the title speak for itself) was uninspired and there was something wrong with the editing which resulted in the film being disjointed with a few scenes completely unrelated to the plot, unless the screenplay is at fault (which is quite possible.) this film a completely unsuccessful attempt at a thriller trying to pass of as a horror movie that's only achievement was making me squirm at the sight of a few graphic bodily piercings. if you see it at your video store don't waste your money but if you need something to laugh at one night and strangeland is on cable, you might as well watch. 3 out of 10
