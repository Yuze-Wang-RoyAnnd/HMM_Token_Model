i find it terribly ironic that "left wing" hollywood continues to hedge its bets, making these awful lukewarm movies that neither condemn the war on terror nor embrace it.<br /><br />if you're a sixties survivor and a committed pacifist, and you're hoping for an all-out condemnation of war like born on the fourth of july or all quiet on the western front, this movie will really feel like a rip off. none of these soldiers actually question this war, or any war, or the idea of war. they just gripe about having to do another tour.<br /><br />on the other hand, if you're a patriotic american who wants to see a story of courage and honor, this movie will really feel like a rip off. none of these soldiers loves america, or even loves the service. the way they pout and sulk makes them come across more like suburban teenagers than blue collar tough guys. it's not we were soldiers, and it's not sands of iwo jima. it's not even mindless action, and the war scenes are less rambo and more buffy.<br /><br />ryan philippe so completely cannot carry this kind of movie. though he's devastatingly sexy, in a rough trade, men's room, bisexual sort of way, it's hard to picture him as a slow-talking' texas boy who wants to stand up and be counted. this is no sgt. croft in mailer's the naked and the dead. he's more like joel in truman capote's other voices, other rooms. he can't sell you on the idea that he's been in combat and done his bit, or that he wants his woman and wants her right now. he fizzles on the battlefield and in the bedroom scenes, looking as if he would much prefer to bend over and take a good stiff attack from the rear.
