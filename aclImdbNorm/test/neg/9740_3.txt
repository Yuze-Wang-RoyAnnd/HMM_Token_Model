this is a stupid movie. when i saw it in a movie theater more than half the audience left before it was half over. i stayed to the bitter end. to show fortitude? i caught it again on television and it was much funnier. still by no means a classic, or even consistently hilarious but the family kinda grew on me. i love jessica lundy anyway. if you've nothing better to do and it's free on t.v. you could do worse.
