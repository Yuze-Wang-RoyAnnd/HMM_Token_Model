"milo" is yet another answer to a question nobody ever asked.do we really need more slashers?i for one think we already have more than enough.i guess the professional tall guys overcharged so in this one we deal with a murderous kid that's also a zombie or a ghost when he feels like it.a long time ago,he drowned but that didn't bother him and he still kills people("friday the 13th",what's that?).one day,his survivors have a big reunion and as a surprise twist,milo comes to pay them a visit.through some really bad shots that show everything except the murders the cast is thinned out till only the final girl is left to find out milo's dull,i mean dark secret.she and her friends have been dying to know.once discovered,milo goes on yet another murderous rampage(isn't it his bedtime yet?) and the girl,well she screams a lot.the acting is not even bottom of the barrel,the barrel refuses to be associated with it.milo can be one creepy bastard from time to time i give him that,but some movies just can't be saved without a great script or gratuitous nudity.
