any evening with jonathan ross now means to me his wit in first hassling and upsetting with carefully chosen words a 78 year old man by phone and then suggesting he and russell brand should house-break and masturbate him while he slept as a way to say sorry for making obscene phone calls to him. kinky! and illegal. for a really big laugh maybe next time he should try it on someone he knows well, like his boss? or a follower of abu hamza? would he be amused if someone did it to one of his daughters?<br /><br />over all the years i've perhaps seen less than 30 minutes of bbc star man ross's chat show because i find him so loathsome, some of the guests i saw were ok though - probably most of them who ever appeared were ok for all i know. as a chat show it seems pretty poor though
