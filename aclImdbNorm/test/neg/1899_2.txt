what a frustrating movie. a small southern town is overflowing with possibilities for exploring the complexities of interpersonal relationships and dark underbellies hidden beneath placid surfaces, as anyone who has read anything by carson mccullers already knows. this does none of that. instead, the writers settled for cutesy twinkles, cheap warm fuzzies and banal melodrama. the thing looks like a made-for-tv movie, and was directed with no particular distinction, but it's hard to imagine what anyone could have done to make this material interesting.<br /><br />the most frustrating aspect, though, is the fact that there are a lot of extremely competent and appealing actors in this cast, all trying gamely to make the best of things and do what they can with this--well, there's no other word for it--drivel. a tragic waste of talent, in particular that of the great stockard channing.
