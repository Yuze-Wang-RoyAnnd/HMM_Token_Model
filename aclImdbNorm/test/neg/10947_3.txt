the film was half over before i managed to figure out what was going on. it's a dog's breakfast of a movie about four family thanksgiving dinners. the cliches and stereotypes tumble over each other. when it's all over ten hours later --- well, it seems like ten hours --- you're puzzling over what it was all about. i don't want to see a movie about dinner table squabbling. there is enough of it in my own family. the turkeys looked pretty good. the rest gave me indigestion.
