watching the first few moments, you realize it's going to be a parody - and certainly it *is* a parody, but i'm not sure of what (a fairy tale? an opera? a hollywoodian c-movie? - if there was something like that), and i can assure you it's not worth watching. it's simply a pointless film (cf. a good parody is everything but pointless), with pretentious, shallow speeches of extremely sketchy characters. it's like a commedia dell'arte. or better, it's like a botched commedia dell'arte. and the score... sung in an intentionally incompetent way (something greenaway will use much more efficiently), it *is* painful to listen to (unless one wears some sate-of-the-art earplugs, haha). go for quality movies (e.g. a. mitta's how czar peter the great married off his moor, 1976) and steer clear of this mistake.
