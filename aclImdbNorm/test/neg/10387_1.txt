this movie had very few moments of real drama. after the opening minutes the film descended in a spiral that didn't quite take us to hell and back - viewing was pure purgatory to say the least. the acting was more horrendous than the subject matter of the film and at times i couldn't stop laughing. the continuity between some of the scenes was dire - characters disappeared from scenes without explanation only to be replaced by other characters who minutes earlier had been some where else. surely this was a spoof of the exorcist. the collection plate at the church must have been full of copper the day mr russo signed up for this one. do i speak latin? et tu brutus.
