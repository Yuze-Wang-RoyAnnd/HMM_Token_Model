this movie is trash because, out of many reasons, it is based on mark furman's book, which is also trash. let me must say that mark furhman is a racist pig that is just looking for another way to get himself into the spotlight - and others that right this type of trash belong in jail. for the movie itself, being based on the book, was horrible as well. the only reason that this murder case became such a big book and movie was because the guy is related, thru his aunts marriage, to the kennedy family and it is ridiculous that people still believe that this family somehow has the ability to make and cover up murders - they are just a family and middle america needs to get over the obsession. this poor guy, and his family, have been hounded by the police for years, they couldn't get tommy so they went after micheal. its amazing that he went to jail with all the evidence that supports that he didn't do it, besides the facts that the statute of limitations, among other things, should have kept this trial from being brought back after twenty years for the love of god, don't watch this garbage
