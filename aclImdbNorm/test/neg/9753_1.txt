the actors cannot act. all dialoague was plagued with bad accents and loss of character. channing tatum never moves his lips or changes his facial expression... ever.<br /><br />the story is nothing new at all. some kid from the street gets involved in a professional world of dance and it turns his life around. that coupled with the whole incident involving the little kid is taken straight from you got served and save the last dance (i'm not saying that those movies were any good either, but that is to say that this movie brought nothing new to the table).<br /><br />and the dancing... there were only 3 dance sequences in the entire movie and 2 of them were taken straight from the commercial. perhaps i'm being overly critical because i am a dancer, but maybe thats what needs to be heard. channing tatum is not by any means a b-boy. his little solo in the parking lot had little style, technique, or any wow factor, all of which are part of a street dancer's criteria. all of the jazz and ballet in the movie had nothing to offer except bad technique and a few acceptable twirls, but nothing more. the grande finale left me thinking "... ok, now they're gonna get serious" all the way through the end when i realized it never was going to happen.<br /><br />i'll admit that im sure it is difficult to make a good dance movie, but step up is no exception to the rule. you got served, with the exception of its inconsistencies with street dance culture at least had the dance aspect. save the last dance was garbage, and so was just about any musical from the past 10 years (although i was impressed with moulin rouge)... look to center stage for ballet, look to beat street for hip-hop
