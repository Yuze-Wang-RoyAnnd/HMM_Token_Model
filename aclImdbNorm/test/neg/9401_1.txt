well to do american divorc'ee with more money than brains buys a rundown villa in tuscany. (much more money; whilst having to dicker over the price, she subsequently manages to cook sumptuous buffets for her workmen and wander around italy indefinitely with no job or apparent means of support.) interminable boredom and the inevitable italian lover ensue; this is a chick flick in the most pejorative sense of the term. lane acts like an unskilled clueless teenage ing'enue throughout - which dynamically clashes with her seriously fading looks - along the way smashing into a variety of (mostly italian) cardboard stereotypes, dykes, divas, senile contessas and gigolos among them. bloated with unnecessary scenes, the most ridiculous being a clumsily inserted and pointless recreation of the fountain scene in 'la dolce vita'. (a similar conceit was used in an effective and appropriate narrative context in 'only you', norman jewison's vastly superior ode to italy and romance). 'tuscan sun' may be the most vacant piece of cinema of the last decade, despite its admittedly well-lensed panoramas of italy. bonus negative point for the extraneous lover parachuted in at the last minute to provide requisite hollywood ending for its targeted audience of oprah-brainwashed housewives. avoid at all costs, unless, of course, you view oprah and dr. phil as pinnacles of intelligent discourse.
