this is one of the strangest things on tv. it is set in a bizarrely underpopulated midlands superb called leatherbridge which seems to be the dullest place in the country. it features a bar with no visible staff or customers, a university with no students, a police station with no criminals and a doctors' surgery with more doctors than patients. the story lines are dire - every episode revolves round a bizarre medical issue acted out by a variety of brummie extras who can never actually act, and for some reason the doctor always ends up round their house solving their problem. pretty entertaining for its pure comedy value, but i cannot believe that this thing actually masquerades as a serious drama. bonkers.
