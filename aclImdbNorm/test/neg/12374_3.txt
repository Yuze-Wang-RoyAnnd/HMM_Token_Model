before we start, may i say i hope you've already eaten when you're reading this. why? because, after i'd seen this film for the first time, the bird's look and sound made me want to eat chicken after the words 'the end' had appeared on the screen. so don't say you weren't warned.<br /><br />fred sears might have directed "earth vs. the flying saucers" (an okay film and one of the bigger examples for tim burton's "mars attacks"), but "the giant claw" is not that giant a film. yes, it's a prehistoric monster that flies in the air, attacks planes and cities and occasionally treats itself to a man on a parachute. the beast is giant except in the scenes where it's considerably smaller, but who needs consistent proportions in a movie? scary? it could have been, but not if the plot is hopelessly silly and the monster looks like like a puppet that ran away from sesame street.
