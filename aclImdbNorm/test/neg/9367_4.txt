i awarded this presentation 4 stars. they are all for the script, which has been butchered beyond recognition in places. what can possibly be said? they took one of the finest plays written in the last century and methodically robbed it of its heart, humor and humanity. i don't really blame the actors, who are probably doing their best with shoddy direction and incomplete characters (because the very complete characters of the stage version have had their insides -- and insights -- ripped out). i do very much blame the director, who seems to strain to find ways to undermine the script. there are so many awkward pauses, awkwardly re-staged moments and awkwardly re-imagined line readings in this tv movie that at times, i forgot ever loving the play. i'm not one of these people who thinks that genius plays are automatically inferior on film (quite the contrary), but this particular genius play has been tremendously under-served by this outing. now i hope they'll make a *real* film of this play. the world deserves it.
