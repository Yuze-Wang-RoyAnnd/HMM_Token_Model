at least for me. i have been following the career of mr. almdovar since the beginning and i was not crazy about this film. i think penelope cruz was miscast, the type of woman she is portraying does not look that good, she makes the character unbelievable. also, the singing scene was just weird. i do not get the point and the lip-sync was awful.<br /><br />as spaniard, another thing that drove me nuts are the accents. why people coming from the same place have such a different accent? the difference between the two sisters is notable and makes no sense. and the village? are we in 2007 or 1950? i found myself trying to explain to my american husband that many of the things in the movie are "old school", things are not like that anymore.<br /><br />i was expecting more but this time mr.almodovar did not deliver, at least for me. i am not saying that miss cruz does a bad job, i am saying that she does not belong there, not portraying that character.
