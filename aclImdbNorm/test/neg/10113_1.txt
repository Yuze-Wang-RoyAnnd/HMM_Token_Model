i don't even understand what they tried to accomplish with this movie, i mean really. you got this guy running from a bunch of cats, because he's dead, but in order to be really dead this girl has to shoot them? and they leave a corpse even though normal people can't see them because their dead? the script already has a hole in it the size of nebraska, then you have the main character played by susan paterno who just drones up her lines in a monotone, boring voice and with so little emotion on her face she might as well have starred as a female terminator robot. it's absolutely horrendous and i don't even understand how i managed to see it all the way to the end of the movie. the end being just as stupid as the entire movie mind you, and with absolutely no reward in it for the viewer what so ever. they might as well have called this movie "the little movie that could choo-choo ka-choo."
