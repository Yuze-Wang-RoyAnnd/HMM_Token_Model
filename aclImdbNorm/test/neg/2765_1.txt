fellow noir devotees, be not deceived, this is a stinker...poorly filmed, poorly acted and there is nothing...nothing here for the film buff looking for yet another solid b-movie from the goldmine of the 40's & 50's era of classics. i gave it a try based on the relatively high rating on imdb. there's no accounting for taste, but i found nothing in this movie to recommend to other imdb members. this is a classic example of having watched a movie and feeling like you have been cheated out of x number of minutes that it took the movie to get to its thankful demise. to have alan ladd on the cover of the dvd/tape is nearly fraud, he is on camera less than two minutes and has almost no dialogue! this isn't this gun for hire folks...it is a classic in the lousy sense of the studios cranking out fodder on no budget...we all search for the great ones... save your time on gangs, inc./paper bullets...it is lousy!
