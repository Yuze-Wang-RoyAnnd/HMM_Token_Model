a coming-of-age story about a teenager rebelling against the church and her minister father in a small norwegian village. the countryside setting is picturesque but the story is rather pretentious and plodding, with much of the film devoted to quoting scriptures. it's like watching a religious propaganda movie. theisen, who has made only one other movie, is pretty good as the sensitive young protagonist, as are sundquist as her strict father and riise as a woman that theisen is fascinated with. the film aims to be fresh and charming but feels rather stale and tired. director and co-writer nesheim, who has worked mostly in tv, is not up to the task.
