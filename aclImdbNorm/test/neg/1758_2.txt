her embalmed look was totally inappropriate for the role. her face remained too white, hair too coifed, clothes etc. too clean (and well-fitting, especially her father's old hat and coat in the scene where inman comes home) for any sense of accuracy. it would be one thing if the production had allowed all the other actors to remain clean and perfect, too, but she was the only one who didn't get messy. there was never even a smudge on her powdered cheek. are we to believe she was the only person in the civil war with a bathtub and a mirror? she certainly looked like the only one who used them. tweezers, too; i mean, what's with those eyebrows? she looked absolutely mean!<br /><br />the love story was implausible. she only went over to the guy because someone told her that he had said he thought she was cute. so, she goes over to tease him, then flirts with him a couple more times, and suddenly this is a love on a par with odysseus and penelope? please.<br /><br />i should have known better than to expect anything better from the man who brought us "the english patient." my reaction to that one was the same as elaine's on seinfeld: "it sucked."
