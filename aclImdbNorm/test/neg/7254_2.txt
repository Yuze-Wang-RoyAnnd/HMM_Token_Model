watching this film made me wonder, just why was universal putting out films like this? they had a wonderful string of films with all the classic horror films. the dawning of the atomic age brought on an onslaught of giant creature films. spiders, ants, praying mantis'. with the deadly mantis, we have a giant praying mantis flying around the arctic, scaring eskimos, and being hounded by the armed forces. the bug reaches a tunnel in new york where the soldiers eventually destroy it. of course, this is all made much more watchable by viewing it on mst. who thought it was a good idea to start the film out by showing a giant map?
