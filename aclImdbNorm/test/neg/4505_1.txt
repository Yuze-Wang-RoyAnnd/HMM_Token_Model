the evil is about a big house where a bad spirit is foolishly unleashed to torture all inside. what a washout of a movie! there's not a single scary scene. not one! richard crenna overplays a nothing role. there's some animated ghosts, a disfigurement by power saw, and a ghost-rape. after nothing special happens for almost the whole movie the evil gets personified into...victor buono. great! where did the filmmakers get the idea that buono is scary. he looks like he was on the bum for a guest starring paycheck to pay his liquor bill. by then its too late to turn it off, because the damn thing is over. i felt like throwing the videocassette out the window. please avoid this junk! hopefully it will never see the light of dvd and will fade into obscurity.
