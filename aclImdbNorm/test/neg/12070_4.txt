once again woody allen seems to be completely devoid of any inspiration other than recycling himself. here we have a mock documentary (like zelig), the structure of the film is a series of anecdotes (radio days, broadway danny rose) set in the 30's (zelig, purple rose, bullets over broadway) about a low-life (deconstructing harry) who believes being a genius absolves him from being a jerk (ditto). given this film and deconstructing harry, one wonders if this is allen's justification for his own actions with mia farrow's adopted daughter; yes, i was a jerk, but i'm a genius so you gotta love me.<br /><br /> allen has only produced two good movies in the past ten years; the fine but overpraised bullets over broadway, and the excellent but largely ignored manhattan murder mystery. his other efforts range from trifles (new york stories, mighty aphrodite), to edgy yet experimental (husbands and wives), to pure drek (alice, scenes from a mall, shadows and fog, celebrity, deconstructing harry). his films no longer even try to have a narrative arc, and his humor seems to aim at wryly amusing, not funny. after deconstructing harry i stopped seeing his films in theaters; after sweet and lowdown i may stop renting them as well.
