despite strong performances by minnie driver and tom wilkinson, this film fails to ignite the imagination of the viewer.<br /><br />by the way, what has become of ms. driver? she had such a potential in the film industry.<br /><br />this to me was almost like an 1850s version of yentl without the musical fanfare. with the death of her father, driver takes a position as a governess to a christian family, hiding her jewish identity.<br /><br />while i realize that this is a period peace, it was awfully dull even for 1850 england and scotland.<br /><br />the lady of the house is most irritating with that sing-song voice of hers. i expected her to refer to driver as dear at any moment. what kind of name is mary blackchurch? i know that driver is trying to pass herself off as a christian, but does this name signify all the way?<br /><br />in the interim, mary finds love with the young charge's father (wilkinson) and his emotionally unbalanced son.<br /><br />in the end, the only thing that we see accomplished is that mary has found a profession to provide for her family-photography. did we really have to be subjected to what was happening throughout the film?<br /><br />the early scenes of judaism practiced in 19th century england and the cholera epidemic at the end could have been played up more. there is a definite underlying feeling of anti-semitism by the wilkinson family but that's never allowed to come out.
