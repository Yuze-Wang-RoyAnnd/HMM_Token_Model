lucio fulci, a director not exactly renowned for his subtlety, ill-advisedly tries his hand at black humour in touch of death, a made for tv movie about lester parsons (brett halsey), a psycho who seduces and murders rich widows in order to pay his gambling debts.<br /><br />starting off with a wonderfully gory scene in which the lethal lothario disposes of his latest victim via chainsaw, mincing machine and hungry hogs, touch of death starts promisingly enough, but fulci soon loses control of proceedings, introducing a weird sub-plot involving a mysterious copycat killer and some heavy handed 'comedic' scenes. there are several more graphic murders which, in true fulci fashion, are extremely violent and gruesome, but even the high level of bloodletting doesn't stop this from being one of fulci's poorer efforts.<br /><br />as i have found with many of his other movies, a comprehensible storyline is not exactly high on the agenda when lucio is behind the camera. this film has many peculiarities which left me more than little perplexed: why didn't lester dispose all of his victims using the dismemberment method seen at the beginning? why are all of his victims either hairy or disfigured? what the hell is that ending all about?<br /><br />fulci is considered by many to be one of the 'greats' of horror cinema; i don't understand his popularity, finding the majority of the films of his that i have seen so far to be generally lacking both decent narratives and technical proficiency. touch of death certainly does nothing to change my opinion.
