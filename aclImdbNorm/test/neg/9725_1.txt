from the beginning of this film,with it's "the lost boys" rip off opening sequence, to the bad wire work and even worse dialog ending, this movie slimed along at a snail's pace. "the covenant" came highly recommended from some of my co-workers, who i am thoroughly convinced were playing a practical joke on me. at least i hope that was the intention and their taste isn't that bad! this movie was not much longer than an hour and a half, yet felt much much longer then that. the story was so basic that it could have been summed up in about 15 minutes, maximum. they could have at least filled the rest of the movie with some entertaining magic or fight scenes, however someone decided,(maybe the director, but i don't know if anyone really "directed" this movie) that it was going to be filled with some poorly executed "artsy" camera shots, and nonsensical scenes of the "boys" swimming and getting into bar fights. about half way through this film i thought that maybe bashing my head against a wall would be more entertaining, and partially to rid myself of this horrible dirty feeling i had for continuing to watch it. . so i did bash my head against a wall, and i did enjoy it more then the movie! i watched it all the way to the bitter end, hoping it would eventually offer me more enjoyment. nope,my efforts were rewarded with "how about i make you my whee-aytch!" i vomited, and then just felt embarrassment for the screen writer and pity for the poor actor who had to deliver this drivel. the acting really wasn't as bad as other reviewers seemed to think, but even the most talented thespian could not saved this work, and work it did, on my nerves! i give movies a chance, even bad ones because they usually offer some form of enjoyment, and this actually wasn't the worst movie i have ever seen. after it was over i did feel like watching the movie "stealth" again and wow it was so much better this time around! oh yeah case in point, don't bother with this movie, really, don't. watch a few episodes of "charmed", and watch "the lost boys" after having a fair amount of alcohol, and you will be a much better person. if you do fall into the same trap that i did and watch "the covenant", make sure to keep all sharp objects far, far away from yourself, you'll thank me for it.
