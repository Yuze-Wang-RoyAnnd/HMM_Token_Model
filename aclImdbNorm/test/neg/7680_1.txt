there are bad movies, movies that are horrible, and then there's a tiny, rarified body of movies that are so horribly bad that, even after seeing them just once, the sheer awfulness makes it impossible to forget them even decades later. this is exactly such a movie, and it's hard to believe that the original film in this series was actually quite good. let's see, george kennedy, the cigar chomping "tough guy" mechanic of the original has somehow been promoted to airline captain, and, after the concorde comes under missile attack (don't ask), he resorts to stunts like shooting a flare gun out the cockpit window despite (presumably) flying at mach 2, all the while doing the sort of wild high-g evasive maneuvers that would have ripped the wings off any real airliner, never mind the effect of the passengers! but the absolute worst part of the film, at least to dedicated airplane buffs like myself, is that this atrocity "starred" one of the coolest, sexiest, and most technologically remarkable planes ever to fly. the concorde (or, just plain "concorde" as its pilots refer to it) deserved far better, this abomination is the equivalent of taking a high class beauty like audrey hepburn and putting her in a "porky's" sequel. thankfully, the release of the ever hilarious "airplane!" the following year brought the whole "airport" franchise to a well deserved halt, as anyone even contemplating a fifth installment would have been laughed to death by studios and movie fans alike. <br /><br />1/10
