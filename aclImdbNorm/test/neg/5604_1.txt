what a production, what a waste of screen-time and money. here is what some european so called producer think, of a scifi movie. take former model, alexandra kamp, pair a with an us c-class actor and get one of film business most notorious producer harry a. towers. towers then finds some obscure munich based prod. house, tandem communication, rola bauer, and then mix it all up with no script whatsoever and you'll get "sumuru" - a priceless gem among the worst movies ever done! get a live people, and do something else, whatever you do, no movies please!! to top everything, producers went to south africa for filming, what you see on screen is one giant sand hole, where the "action" takes place, between extremely bad actors and extremely bad fx that any film student would do better.
