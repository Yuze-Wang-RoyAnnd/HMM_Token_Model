i saw recently saw this at the 2007 palm springs international film festival and i can't believe that this is sweden's official submission to the 79th academy awards to be considered for best foreign film. producer anna anthony last year also had sweden's official submission for best foreign film with zozo. i wasn't personally a fan of zozo but at least it had some production value to it. this could have been shot as a high school film project. as a short film it may have worked but as a feature film it is as lost as it's characters. this is a story about five twenty something friends who live in a small swedish town and have no goals or hopes or ambitions for the future and like to live in the past of their long gone childhood. actually falkenberg isn't like some remote northern swedish village. it's a popular summer resort with a population of city and townships of almost 40,000 and lies between two major southern coastal swedish cities of g"otborg and malmo. the characters are likable enough guys but if they were high school age kids with a bleak or confused attitude about what they plan to do with their lives i would undoubtedly care about them more. they are however long past the point where they should be making plans to deal with adulthood. if they want to stay in falkenberg forever than certainly there must be some jobs in the tourist or fishing industry instead of just riding bicycles, drinking, smoking pot and occasionally painting a house. maybe if they hung around with a girl or two in their circle of friends, of which girls are absent from this film altogether which doesn't make sense. jesper ganslandt makes his directorial debut and co wrote the film along with the cinematographer, of which i use the term loosely, fredrik wenzel. the acting isn't too bad. i would give this a 4.5 out of 10 but despite it's submission for consideration for the academy awards i would not recommend it.
