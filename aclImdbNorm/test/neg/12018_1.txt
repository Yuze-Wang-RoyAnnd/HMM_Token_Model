i saw this movie in the theatre and it was a terrible movie. the way michael oliver who now turn even worse in the sequel is the biggest intolerance i cannot bare. junior upset his father because he would not go to school which got his father ben madly insane. also the crazy dance ride operator is not fair to junior for not letting him go on the ride. and that lawanda dumore is as horrible as a serial killer to junior because she made threatening insults to junior which is why i cannot tolerate this movie. even if the movie is re-released back into theatres in the extended version, i still would not see this movie because this movie is not something i can even tolerate. in fact, it stinks!
