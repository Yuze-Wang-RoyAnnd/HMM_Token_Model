1st watched 10/29/2006 - 4 out of 10(dir-john stephenson): mildly entertaining story of a group of five kids who are forced to live with their eccentric uncle while their father and mother fight & work in world war i as england entered the war. they are told not to go in the greenhouse of the uncle's mansion, which of course they do over and over, and they discover a sand fairy who them daily wishes that only last until the sun goes down. this is the "it" referred to in the title, created by the jim henson group and voiced by eddie izzard. the problem is their wishes usually bring about other problems that they are supposed to learn from. this part of the movie is not done very well because it's obvious the children, primarily the freddie highmore character, do not learn from them but instead keep going back to "it" to solve their next big problem. "it" is not nearly as funny as it could have been with the comedian eddie izzard really not given much opportunity to improvise and kenneth branagh is wasted as the eccentric uncle, although he is the best character. the children are fine as far as their acting abilities but the story probably would have been much better going into the fantasy realm but they did have a human story to tell as well, which probably caused the confusion with the filmmakers. so, all in all, this was an ok film but could have been much better.
