i had watched this on italian tv as a kid and recall being fond of it - in view of its mixing live-action with animation; however, it was universally panned at the time...and, catching up with it again after all these years, i have to admit that the critics were right! <br /><br />what must have seemed wondrous to a child's eyes is actually very poorly done, not to mention boring for a fantasy-adventure; fatally, both star (ex-'angry young man' richard harris) and director (action expert hunt) are ill-suited to the material! at least, michel legrand's score (with lyrics provided by scriptwriter don black) is serviceable - if not exactly inspired. by the way, a number of well-known personalities are featured among the voice artists on this british-belgian co-production (julian glover, bessie love, murray melvin, robert rietty, vladek sheybal, graham stark and, this being his last film work, michael bates).<br /><br />while the essential plot points of jonathan swift's classic novel ('giant' gulliver becomes the pawn in a war between the little people of two neighboring countries and, on escaping, ends up in a land of real giants) do emerge here, it's done on a strictly kiddie level (with stereotyped characters though, thankfully, little intrusion of the comic/romantic variety) - which renders the whole venture somewhat pointless, outside of its intrinsically experimental nature, since max and dave fleischer had already done a splendid feature-length cartoon version of the book way back in 1939!
