this movie states through its protagonist that the world is essentially sadness and pain and those that ignore this have blinders on. one can argue whether this is true or not. but even if you accept this as true, the movie's ending either a) disputes this by saying there can be some good in tragic situations or b) forgets this and uses a cliched montage in order to leave the audience feeling uplifted.<br /><br />that the movie metaphorically acquits its protagonist by presenting him as a sympathetic character despite any evidence for that sympathy shows contempt for the supporting characters who were the most compelling in the film.<br /><br />so what you have in this film is a script that is not consistent in its theme and direction that does not bring the ending into sync with the rest of the film. there are excellent performances given by every member of the cast especially spacey, olin, martin donovan, and ann magnuson. it's a shame that they weren't supported by a better writer/director.
