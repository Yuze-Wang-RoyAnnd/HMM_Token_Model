this was a pretty dull movie, actually. i think the problem with a french horror film, is that the french must be easy to scare or something, because this movie wasn't just that frightening. the special effects with the mummy's ghost looked like they didn't even belong in the film, as though someone put them in during post-production to spice them up, because the actors barely react to them.<br /><br />the plot just kind of meanders, which is the opposite of real storytelling. i guess this was based on a french tv series, where they had to distill it down to a two-hour movie.<br /><br />the plot is that a mummy is brought out of storage in the louvre, which apparently has such weak security that this girl and her boyfriend can break into it multiple times. (so that's how people keep stealing the mona lisa!) the boyfriend and the police officer from the 1960's version of this film get together and try to exorcise the demon.<br /><br />so i'm not sure if this mummy was supposed to be a bad guy or not. he kills two guards during the course of the movie, but he just wants to get to the afterlife.
