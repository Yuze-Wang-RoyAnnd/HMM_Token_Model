first, let me mention the fact that, in spite of its title (<<stories>>, in plural), there is only one kitchen story. as to whether isak died or not at the end, i'm not so sure since, in one of the very last scenes, his pipe is seen lying on the table next to the two cups. on the dvd cover, there is a reference to tati. it claims that the film is <<tr`es dr^ole: rappelle tati !>> (<<very funny: reminiscent of tati!>>. the great jacques tati relied mainly on mime and silent deadpan attitudes to achieve his comical effects and to offer his critically satiric views of his 1950's french <<modern>> society. of course <<kitchen>> does take place during the 1950's and it does offer some (rather faint) satirical references to the absurdities of bureaucracy and there are some long moments were no words are uttered -- but they are not really funny. are all these small details enough to make <<kitchen>> a <<tatiesque>> movie ? this being said, i have to admit that <<kitchen>> does deal with the sometimes false objectivity of scientific research versus the <<truth>> of human subjective emotions. generally speaking, the movie was agonizingly slow, with nothing much happening -- with barely any <<dramatic impulse>> : the involving parts were the set up during the first 15 minutes or so, and during the last half hour or so. indeed, the last segment was -- finally !!! -- interesting and moving. it might seem that it was a short subject, of less than an hour, unduly stretched to some 90 minutes. now, about the set-up (a <<scientific>> observation on the behavior of single males in their kitchen): at first it seemed very promising -- with the charting out of the comings and goings of bachelors in their kitchen as a means to determine what new inventions would be most useful to come up with. but very quickly this premise turned out to be just a prologue, an <<excuse>> to introduce the real subject which was only fully developed towards the end and which was about loneliness and the invaluable bond of friendship. pity ! i honestly wanted to like that movie. yes, it seemed so promising when i heard about some of its unusual little <<anecdotes>> -- which were indeed there and which i enjoyed -- such as the burning of a man's nose hair (instead of using scissors to cut it off), the <<investment>> of having a huge quantity of <<valuable>> black pepper stacked away in a barn, the role reversals (the observant becoming the observed), a man's mouth emitting sounds from a radio program. and there is also a sick horse becoming the catalyst of half-hidden human despair, the relative importance of right or left side car driving in sweden and norway (a reflection of the importance for each of these very close neighboring countries to affirm its individuality ?). am i the sole person who did not fully enjoy that film ? does this necessarily mean that i'm wrong ? perhaps it's almost generally praised <<fine points>> were, in fact, <<too subtle>> for me ? perhaps... could my individual views on this movie ironically reflect the very essence of the film itself -- which would be the vital necessity to have the right to differ, to affirm one's individuality and not to follow blindly society's trends and opinions ? each one of us has the right to have different personal views and not to be a slave of the demands of one's bread-winning <<dictatorial>> demands: often, we do have other alternatives that would allow each one of us to be useful to our society while respecting one's inner principles. in short, being true to oneself -- the way that in that film folke (isak's <<scientific observer>>) ends up by giving up his job while preferring to stay in his new friend isak's house and help his out with the tasks of his farm ... and so, <<vive la diff'erence>>, as the french say !
