spoiler alert!!!!<br /><br />i don't go into 'high tech' movies expecting them to be 100% accurate on all things computer related. but somehow, even the average 'i have a computer' user is supposed to believe that:<br /><br />1) a computer professional with a top secret, special data<br /><br />2) is going to keep the primary copy of said data on a 1.44 floppy<br /><br />3) and make absolutely no backup of this special secret data<br /><br />even high school students back up their homework for goodness sake.<br /><br />also this is the worst represntation of a computer nerd ever. even though she is super cute we are supposed to believe that she has no friends, neighbors, extended family, or coworkers who can identify her. even the unabomber had a family that could turn him in.<br /><br />end spoiler<br /><br />these aren't just minor mistakes that had no bearing on the movie - these are the major plot points that fueled the storyline. the characterization was awful, the plot wholly unbeleivable, and if you haven't seen this, don't bother.
