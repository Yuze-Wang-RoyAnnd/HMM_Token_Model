waters's contribution to the world of cinema has to be searched with a telescope, and then when/if something is found (by sheer chance and lots of luck) it has to be analyzed with a microscope.<br /><br />and after it has been analyzed it would get discarded into the lab's "rubbish bin for totally useless things". one single atom of that microscope is worth all of his movies combined.<br /><br />cb is etremely campy, and intentionally so. the usual jw stuff: comic-strip dialogue, simplistic plot, moronically cheerful characters, chewing-gum pop, overacting etc. waters knows that he is incabaple of making a movie of quality, so he hides behind the mask of the "intentionally cheesy film-maker" - which supposedly makes him a special kind of "anti-artist". but in the world of cinema, being an anti-talent often gets mistaken for talent, which is exactly what waters had hoped for - and eventually got. it's a con act. charlatans infest the world of cinema and modern pop art; it's a plague.<br /><br />perhaps we have john waters to blame for inspiring baz luhrman to make all those horrible, dumb turkeys. it's like a virus: one waters creates five new bad directors, and then these five each create more, and so on. where will it end? with "dancer in the dark"? can that bomb actually be topped?
