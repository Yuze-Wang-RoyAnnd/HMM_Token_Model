a `wacky chick' flick. a beauty contestant winds up dead and the usual suspects are rounded up. another entry in the vein of the texas cheerleader, this is an average example of its type.<br /><br />yasmine bleeth turns in her usual wholesome girl performance, and jill clayburgh does a good job as her stressed-out slightly obsessed mom.<br /><br />some mildly funny moments listening to the vapid self-serving pr coming out of contestants' mouths. (`i'd like to own a restaurant so i can give left-over food to the homeless.')<br /><br />you have to ask yourself what people are using for brains when they think a cheerleader spot or beauty crown is worth killing for!<br /><br />
