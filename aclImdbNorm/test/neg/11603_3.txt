perhaps the wildest outlier in alfred hitchcock's career is this straight-out comedy vehicle by the director, pairing carole lombard with robert montgomery as a couple who discover a mistake has invalidated their marriage. where do they really stand with each other?<br /><br />contrary to what others say, there is an element of suspense here: the idea that these two miserable people might escape each other, free to inflict their awfulness on some other, undeserving mate.<br /><br />it's funny reading comments here about how miserable lombard's ann smith plays out in this film, because montgomery's role is as much of a heel. he manhandles ann, snaps at witnesses, short-shrifts clients - just the kind of lawyer who gives his profession a bad name. ann is overbearing, too, of course, the kind of wife who holds her husband hostage from work for six days over a petty squabble, bringing up things like what he did in paris when he was 20 and hadn't even met her yet. "i forgave you that!" she says, as if it was big of her.<br /><br />for david, a revoked marriage is an opportunity to have a little illicit pleasure with his "mistress" before tying the knot for good. for ann, it's an attempt at premarital sex that must be repelled with a bottle of champagne to the head, followed by expulsion from their apartment and her life.<br /><br />the acorn doesn't seem to fall far from the tree, as ann's mother is scandalized into apoplexy when she learns what david tried to pull: "oh my poor baby! thank heaven your father is dead!"<br /><br />that's a rare good line in this laughless, unlikeable comedy.<br /><br />you can call this an example of the "remarriage comedy", in which the bonds of matrimony are challenged in order to be reaffirmed. you can also call this an example of what roger ebert calls the "idiot plot", in which the storyline depends on the main characters acting like idiots. hitchcock seems to have a laugh at uptight american morality, but can't really do much more with it than a jokeless scene where an older couple is scandalized by the sound of loud plumbing.<br /><br />lombard died within a year of this film's release; it was the last film of hers she lived to see. what a shame it couldn't have been something better! she was overbearing in "my man godfrey", too, but in such a likable way you didn't just have to go with her, you wanted to. here she plays for laughs that aren't there while sadistically breaking david's chops again and again. montgomery rolls his eyes a lot like groucho, a study in smugitude.<br /><br />the only really decent thing in this movie that lasts more than a few seconds is gene raymond as david's law partner jeff custer, who makes a play for ann and acts with honor and decency. raymond underplays his many reaction shots, and even a drunk scene, all to good effect.<br /><br />***spoiler***so decent a guy is jeff that ann ends up rejecting him for not fighting david after she goads him into a confrontation, calling custer "a lump of jelly". jeff exits the scene, leaving ann and david together for their future murder-suicide. here's one custer that managed to escape a massacre!***spoiler end***
