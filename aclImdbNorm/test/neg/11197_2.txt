i mean, come on! this movie had such nice potential but it's like they ran out of money to finish the script and just telegraphed the whole damn rest of the movie about 2/3rds of the way through. characters start spouting this movies whole reason for existence to other characters who didn't ask for the information on extremely flimsy premises. they also fall into some stereotypical behavior because that must be what's expected in this genre of movie. it's really pretty sad because this movie could have been so much more.<br /><br />i was really hoping this would be a good movie. there was some good acting. mark hamill does an excellent job until the movie falls apart, so does sally struthers. it was fun to see them working and succeeding at their craft. majandra delfino was pretty good for awhile until her lines just became untenable. i felt sad for her that she had to say these lines that just shot the whole movies credibility for any thinking movie goers. brad hunt does an excellent job. he really has a surprising range of talent judging from another of his movies i recently saw, lucky 13. (which was a piece of crap). this guy could be a star if he could pick the right scripts and get lucky with the right director.<br /><br />almost forgot! the music was so heavy handed you might think this project was handed to some minor film school to be scored. i call this kind of music "teller music" because you can just tell what's coming next based on the music. less is more sometimes.<br /><br />cut half of the music from this movie, get a good film editor, a small rewrite or two and this would be a very good movie.
