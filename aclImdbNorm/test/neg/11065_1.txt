there seems to have been some money behind this film, but it would be impossible to imagine a film this badly planned and executed if i hadn't actually started watching it.<br /><br />to begin with, once we are in the cavern with the characters (the usual young adult stereotypes we've been meeting in horror films since the early '80s), the film is shot almost entirely in close-up. since the actors are wearing helmet lights, this means all we see are glaring lights alternating with utter darkness - we never get to see what the characters see; so when they shout out "look there!" we are left to beg "what?! where?!". ultimately the film has a nauseating, confusing strobe-light effect, with no sense to it until we get to the end.<br /><br />and i won't tell you what 'the end' means - but you will recognize it if you've ever seen the old early '60s arch hall laugh fest"eegah!" with richard kiel.<br /><br />but what crazy person would ever want to make a variation on a theme like "eegah!"'s, long remembered as one of the worst films ever made?! but that's what we have here, folks. except that, unlike "eegah!", "the cavern" is not anyone's idea of goofy fun. it is unwatchable. (i ran it at x2 the normal speed, just to get it over with, hoping i would actually be able to see something by the end of the film; but when i did, it was just stupid.) this film did provide me with one satisfying moment, though; since it only cost a couple bucks, after i got it out of the dvd player, i was able to smash it with my own hands - what a relief!
