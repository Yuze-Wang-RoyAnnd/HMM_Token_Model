a long time ago, way back in the early '80s, a late-night tv show "fridays" came to abc, trying to steal the limelight away from nbc's badly-listing "saturday night live". it didn't but it did introduce some repugnant sketches and semi-talented "comedians" to the world. like mark blankenfield, for example.<br /><br />which, in a roundabout way, brings us to "jekyll and hyde... together again". which is repugnant in ways all its own.<br /><br />blankenfield is about as subtle as a pew full of whoopee cushions going off after communion. and about as tasteful, too. this is just his drugged-out druggist character he played on the ill-fated "fridays" show stretched out to feature length. and if you didn't like him there, why are you reading this review?<br /><br />any time it takes more than one or two writers to write a movie, that's a bad sign. then when it goes for dunder-headed jokes that would get you thrown off every improv stage in the western hemisphere and replaces gags with gross-out, things can only get worse.<br /><br />a comic take on a robert louis stevenson story? about as good an idea as making a sitcom out of poe's "fall of the house of usher".<br /><br />aside from a few (very few) gags that give a slight grin, this whole film is an exercise in waste - wasted actors, wasted film, wasted opportunities.<br /><br />no wonder they showed original author stevenson turning in his grave. what more observant a review could they give themselves?<br /><br />no stars. no, not even for armstrong, who should have known better. <br /><br />"hyde" from this one.
