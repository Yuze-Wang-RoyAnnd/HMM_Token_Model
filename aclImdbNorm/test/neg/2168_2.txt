i understand that this was llyod kaufman's attempt to save a movie that was the pits. the whole movie is voiced over since the audio reel was junk. the voice overs were so bad and terrible quality. as much as i love troma, they tend to be a little heavy on the voice over work. the acting was terrible. one thing i did enjoy from this movie was the quick cameo of trey parker doing the aristocrats joke with a goofy wig on. there are a lot of big director dudes in this movie like james gunn and eli roth (friends of lloyd kaufman). again i think this was llyods attempt of saving a crappy movie and trying not to lose 1000s of dollars. i won't go on and on but this movie was a mess. check out other troma titles.
