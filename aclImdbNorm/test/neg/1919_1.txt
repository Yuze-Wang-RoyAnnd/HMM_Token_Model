where to start, where to start....hmmm...well how about some of the stiffest, most unnatural, unbelievable and camped-up performances one can imagine? how about stereotypical "characters", situations and locations? or what about a manipulative, cloying, utterly wretched script? i can't think of one element in this movie that was original, worthy of watching or interesting.<br /><br />note to all you josh hartnett/chris klein/leelee sobieski fans - enjoy their collective fifteen minutes, folks, because they're not going to be famous much longer...
