the other reviewer was completely correct about this one. the writing was awful, the acting was awful, the subject was awful. the actors looked like they were not really into the movie, like they almost *had* to be there. there were some unique camera effects, but they were not really germane to the story (or what there was of a story), and they weren't produced particularly well. <br /><br />i suppose they were trying to piggyback on the success (can i say that?) of the other eschatologically influenced movies (omega code, left behind). and yes, it does make christians embarrassed when these types of movies are produced. i would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially a non-christian.
