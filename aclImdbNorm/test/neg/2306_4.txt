even though this film was nothing special as such, i am drawn to comment on at least one factor that ruled in its favour - that of the lead female performer in the film, dyan cannon. in spite of the film's ridiculous storyline and what she goes through here, hers was the best acting job in the film, making the unbelievable seem more plausible. her raucous scene with the gay photographer david hemmings has to be seen to be believed. good work, dyan.
