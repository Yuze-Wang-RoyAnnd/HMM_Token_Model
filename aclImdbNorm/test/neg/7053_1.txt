this movie should have ended as soon as the joke about bebe's kids is told in the opening. i liked robin harris and most of his comedy but the really funny routines were not meant to be something the whole family could go see. liken it to taking the point of one of jerry seinfeld's jokes and attempting to squeeze the joke for as long as you can in order to turn it into a movie. this movie had to be self-serving because i can not find anyone who found the settings or antics familiar. whats most funny about this movie is the gumption of the writers and producers to pass it off as something of value. 1/10 stars because there is no half star.
