i really wanted to like this movie. the previews looked marginally funny but i figured they put most of the funny stuff in the previews. in this case, they not only did that but they twisted the clips so that they appeared much funnier than they were in the real film. i like john travolta, uma thurman, vince vaughn, the rock, cedric the entertainer, etc. so i wanted to like this movie but it just never seemed to do anything.<br /><br />i saw get shorty and did not particularly care for it. too slow and unfunny for me. this movie is certainly no better and, if anything, is worse. there were a lot of opportunities for some good comedic moments but it took none of them.<br /><br />the acting was okay but even john travolta seemed toned down. cedric was okay but he was too reigned in to be really funny. vince vaughn and the rock were pretty good and ready to be funny but they just let it all pass them by. i wish they had been given a chance to follow through with the funny things they set up but instead it just kept going back to the same old thing and back to just setting vaughn and rock up to be funny (though never allowed to really deliver that punchline or comedy).<br /><br />overall, this was a very disappointing movie and i am glad i only saw it on video. at least it was cheaper than the theater.
