i remember seeing this years ago, it had a reasonably promising start, with an interesting premise, but then it degenerated into nonsense quite quickly. uninteresting characters, failed attempts to add drama and tension, and a bit of simplistic philosophy thrown in too, all culminating in a terrible ending. <br /><br />simply, it's trash. <br /><br />before i saw this tv film, i didn't think i would ever have any film that i thought was the "worst" i had seen, but after i finished watching this, i knew that from then on, if anyone asked me what the worst film i had ever seen was, i could say without hesitation - "the second coming".<br /><br />avoid.
