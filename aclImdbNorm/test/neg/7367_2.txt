from the second the music swelled (second one of the movie) and it was movie-hack tripe, i knew i was in for a very long ride. horrendously clich'ed - (i laughed a lot and knew how the plot ended well before the ending) - they didn't use louisbourg particularly well and the costuming and hair were kinda awful. (my particular favourite makeup moment is that the only way they age depardieu as far as i could see was by putting a straight hair wig on him, instead of wavy). i could go on about the ridiculous unsuitability of the music for a long time -- the movie could be improved massively by an 18th century score. <br /><br />(eta: ah, it's that horrible moviemusic guy patrick doyle who's responsible for the score - say no more! he should not be allowed near historical movies -- he should stick to 20th century settings.) <br /><br />the "visit to the notable people portion" was also hilarious particularly his little visit to madame pompadour who was not particularly convincingly played. <br /><br />i thought the only actor who appeared grounded in the century at hand was michael maloney as james murray. he absolutely stole the show for all 30 seconds he was on screen. tragically, he made you see what the movie could have been.<br /><br />the love scenes did have some heat - the two leads were stunning together.<br /><br />the most awful scene for historians is where they're at the big leavetaking dinner in britain before wolfe sails and he lifts his glass and says the first two lines of "how stands the glass around" aka "why soldiers why" as if it's a toast. absolutely excruciating failure at historicity, much better to leave it out. thousands of people know the damn song and thousands more believe the rumour that wolfe and company sang it (probably drunk, not all stuffy like this bunch). daft.
