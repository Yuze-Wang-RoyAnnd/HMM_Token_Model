some things just won't stay dead. they just have to keep coming back for more whether we like it or not. i guess some people like to beat a dead horse. the first 'ghoulies' was a surprise hit and it's first sequel was an even better film. the third film took a more comical approach and by this point the little buggers were starting to overstay their welcome. i guess someone out there in hollywood thought it was a bright idea to resurrect the franchise, but the outcome will likely disappoint fans of the previous entries.<br /><br />pros: the acting is actually pretty good for a movie like this. a silly, but fun score. moves at an alright pace. some cheese for those who love it. some pretty good action-packed sequences. has a bit more plot than the others and unlike ii & iii at least attempts to link itself with the original.<br /><br />cons: not nearly as much fun as it's predecessors. though it has more plot than before, it's a pretty ridiculous one. poor effects. the original ghoulies only appear in flashbacks and here they're replaced with two trolls who serve no purpose other than to be comic reliefs. speaking of comedy, all attempts at humor are lame. is a direct sequel to the first film, but there are so many loose ends. for example, i thought jonathan was done with black magic after what happened in the original? not that it was spectacular in the others, but this film's direction is especially bland.<br /><br />final thoughts: the first three 'ghoulies' movies are a bad movie lovers' dream. this fourth, and so far final sequel (let's hope), is a bit of a letdown. sure there's some fun to be had, but it just isn't the same. the others are low budget too, but the people involved put a lot more into them. see if you're a completeist or you wanna see beautiful women in skimpy outfits. otherwise just stick with the other three.<br /><br />my rating: 2/5
