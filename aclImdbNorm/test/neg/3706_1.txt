the capture of bigfoot is one of the silliest and worst movies of all time. i love sasquatch and bigfoot movies but this one is just a sheer waste of one's time.terrible, terrible, terrible!i watched this movie last night, and it was all i could do to finish watching.i understood that this weird crazy man wanted to capture bigfoot,but that was the only thing that made sense in this movie.it did have some amusing parts though.there was this very cheesy and corny disco club with very bad disco dancing that seemed to go on for far too long in the movie.i think the director was trying to fill time.the worst thing was the way the bigfoot looked.the obvious man in a suit looked like a pink faux fur bigfoot.it was laughable.if you want to see a very bad bigfoot movie, then i suggest that you purchase this movie.personally, i wasted my time and my money on this one!
