the title of this documentary is very misleading. at no time during the documentary do they show how the introduction of the nile perch fish into lake victoria has cause any of the problems facing the town of mwanza, tanzania. the film tries to place the problems of tanzania on an environmental cause but the truth of that matter is the problems stem from a parasitic outside force. the documentary is very slowing paced with no narrative what so ever. instead it relies on small blips of text between none related segments to display bits of information that do little to add or expand of the subject matter. there are only two attempts to discus the environmental effects of the nile perch fish. one is a small segment about 10 seconds long where they interview the factory managers where the fish is processed and he briefly mentions how 50 years ago the nile perch was introduced into the lake and it consumed the other fish species. the film maker makes no attempt to follow up on the matter or go deeper into it. the second attempt is when within this documentary they film the showing of another documentary that is discussing the environmental impact the nile perch has introduced, and again no real attempt is made to expand on just how devastating the problem has become. <br /><br />the subject matter that this documentary does delve into has nothing to do with the perch fish itself and more to do with the problems facing most african countries. the film tries to link the introduction of the perch fish with aids, poverty and pollution in tanzania but never makes a direct connection. as any intelligent person well read with problems in africa, the problems shown here are not unique to tanzania but affect most of africa and have nothing to do with the fish. it would have been great if the film makers would have shown how the local economy or life was before the fish was introduced and how it has been negatively impacted by the introduction of the fish but they don't. the fact of the matter is that many of the people they interview say that the fish has provided jobs and opportunity for many. yes things are bad within the town of mwanza but they are far worst in other parts of the country and continent for that matter.<br /><br />a weak attempt by the documentary makers to link the fish to famine problems in tanzania is quickly discredited by the documentary itself. first off tanzania is a very large country and lake victoria is only a small portion of the country. many of the individuals interview actually say that they can to mwanza, the fishing town on the lake, to find a job and feed their families because things were so bad in other parts of the country. <br /><br />this documentary is very weak, has no narrative and makes no attempt to actually link anything they display to the nile perch. it plays on people's emotions by displaying images of the devastation of poverty, famine and aids making no attempt to show you how any of this is unique to the lake victoria region of tanzania or directly related to the perch fish. the fact is most of the problems have more to do with war, globalization and christianity than and environmental effect of the perch fish itself.
