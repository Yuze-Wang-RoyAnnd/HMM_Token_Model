i didn't watch this show that much when i was little. and i think i only watched 1 episode which was about railroads i believe because i liked trains and still do. even then i thought it was a baby show. i mostly watched arthur. the songs are pretty weird too. and i don't think it's that educational either. they just sing some dumb nursery rhymes. this is a dumb show, any adults who like it are crazy! if you want some good kids shows, watch something like arthur, mister rogers neighborhood or even better pee-wee's playhouse. i thought sesame street was boring when i was little but even that is better than barney. trust me, this show is pretty dumb, there are other kids shows that are better than this one. i can see many of the reviews here that a lot of people don't like this show. now there are some mature people. i hope they take this show off air soon.
