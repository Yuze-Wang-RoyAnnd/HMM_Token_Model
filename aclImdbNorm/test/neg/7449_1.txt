the first robocop had a sense of cynical wit and a sick sense of violence. it was a fine line to walk, but paul verhoeven pulled it off and the film did so well, they made a sequel. how awful. (possible spoilers ahead - though anything that could spoil this is beyond me).<br /><br />irvin kershner is not the director for this type of film. he clearly did not understand the wit of the original and as a result the massive over-the-top senseless violence looks really bad - and worse is very distasteful. even worse is the musical score. leonard rosenman was an old man from another era and the heroic, light music does not match the images on the screen at all! what was he scoring?! the great american hero?! worst of all, he completely eliminated robocop's theme from the first film, which was so memorable and perfect. can you imagine a superman film without john williams' fanfare, or indiana jones, etc.? how could he do that?!!<br /><br />the plot is just a collection of ideas that don't gel. in beginning we see robo "stalking" his old wife. fine, good idea. but, they completely drop it after that. then, there is this a stupid idea of the company reprogramming robo to be nice. that's thrown in for 10 minutes and then is immediately dropped. or, the silly idea that the repulsive 10 year old drug lord reminds robo of his son - once again, a weak motif that is shown briefly twice and dropped. this may work in a comic book, but not on film and frank miller was unfortunately too inexperienced at the time and threw every idea in along with the kitchen sink. it doesn't work as a whole.<br /><br />some people here seem to be praising the corporate bashing in this film and the privatization of the police. that is the best part of the film that is consistent with the first. however, in the original, the old man was a tough business man out for a profit, but ultimately fair in the end. in this film, he is just pure evil in his lust for money and power. you can't just change characters like that for no reason. and nancy allen's character is useless in this film, whereas in the first she was essential to robo's search for himself. she is as gratuitous as the violence in this film.<br /><br />and the violence, yes the violence. i enjoy many violent, bloody films when they serve purposes and are meant to tell a story. irvin kershner seems to get off on human beings being blown to bits, shot to pieces, children lusting for death and torture and peoples' desire for drugs. he doesn't know when to stop. do we really need to see every last innocent bystander (even people trying to help others) get shot up???? it is inferred when we see the bad robocop shooting repeatedly! instead mr. kershner proves he has very little taste for this type of work and creates an abominable mess that is a terrible piece of pop art and worse, a disgusting message of violence for any young person watching this film.<br /><br />no, this film isn't meant to be message-y and i certainly don't watch robocop movies or alien or predator movies for that reason. however, when you go too far and cross the line, much of what you do must be put into question. and as for this film, in the words of the evil kid drug dealer's last words as he dies, "it still sucks".
