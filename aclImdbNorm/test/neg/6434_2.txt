now the television schedules (in england, at least) are crammed with home improvement, bargain-hunting, house-hunting and cookery shows in the afternoons, the chances of any of the terrestrial broadcasters digging out a complete obscurity like this to occupy a couple of hours of screen time on a slow afternoon are slender, to say the least. but back in the eighties, the bbc did just that, and guess what, i watched it. and it's a testament to the overwhelming weirdness of this hungarian-american co-production that i can still remember large chunks of it, over twenty years later. to begin with, the eponymous hero appears briefly during the opening titles, only to vanish again for at least half an hour. (imagine an american tail re-edited so feivel is nowhere to be seen, and you'll appreciate how confusing this is.) there's a supremely bizarre bit of animation where one of the characters gets his elaborately waxed moustache tweaked and stretched, complete with a boingy sound effect that causes him to go boss-eyed. probably hilarious if you're stoned, but to a child, quite disturbing. speaking of which, the infamous 'hippo cull' scene is represented in an abstract manner - clouds in vague hippo shapes are struck by lightning - but it's still pretty unpleasant. in fact, this film is pretty cold and uninvolving throughout, a sad state of affairs hardly helped by the strange-looking production design, all muddy colours, wobbly lines, bloated forms and that uniquely european bleakness reminiscent of jan svankmajer, only not as compelling. then, to cap it all, we get songs by the osmonds! this isn't so much an awful film as a deeply misguided one, not so much phantasmagorical as a rather bad trip.
