before i saw this movie i believed there were two kinds of bad cinema. (1) your average, completely uninspired fare (i.e. "constantine"), and (2) the work that is charmingly bad, or so-bad-it's good (a la "manos the hands of fate"). now that i've seen "dr. gore" i know there is a third kind of bad movie: the utter crap sandwich. that will be irrevocably tattooed on your memory. a work that is mind-bendingly execrable. anathema.<br /><br />i have hated certain films before, but i've never hated a film so much that my loathing reached its thresh-hold and became self loathing! have you seen a movie that not only makes you regret losing the hour you spent watching it, but makes you grieve for another hour after that? mystery science theatre disciples beware, this is soul-sucking cinema. go rent "circle of iron" or "the killer shrews" instead.
