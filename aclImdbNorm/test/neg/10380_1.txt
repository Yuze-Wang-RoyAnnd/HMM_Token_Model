while this movie did have a few scary moments (great use of music and film angles to build suspense), it's obvious director ethan wiley and scriptwriter ellary eddy didn't waste any time researching their subject matter; which also makes me question their claim that the exorcism scenes were overseen by a genuine catholic bishop.<br /><br />amongst the many inconsistencies: <br /><br />* jacob the roman catholic priest, when we first meet him outside the church, is wearing an academic robe over his clericals rather than the typical alb, chasuble or surplice. academic robes are commonly worn by protestant ministers in liturgical denominations, not roman catholic priests. <br /><br />* jacob the priest quotes some obscure and disturbing scripture about the angels taking up weapons. he attributes it to st. paul. this verse is not from st. paul's writings, neither is it in the bible. i can't even find it in the gnostic scriptures. <br /><br />* jacob tells his bishop he doesn't believe in demon possession and turns down the request to study exorcism but does a complete 180 (later that same day?) within minutes of talking to possessed isabelle. sure, it's possible; but a little unrealistic. see father damien as a priest/psychologist in the original the exorcist for a bit more realistic portrayal of a skeptic-turned-believer. <br /><br />* miguel, the former priest turned farmhand, is the first to try an exorcism on isabelle. he quotes scripture, and she quotes back. he says "i see you know psalm 65" - she corrects him "that's psalm 67" - they're both wrong. <br /><br />* miguel, the former priest who just got done performing an exorcism - making the sign of the cross, calling on the name of christ, applying holy water, etc. - tells jacob he doesn't believe in church and he doesn't believe in god. (maybe he's just conflicted?) jacob enlists him to put on home-made vestments and have another go at it anyway. <br /><br />* miguel, the former roman catholic priest, crosses himself backwards (or eastern orthodox-style). as an hispanic roman catholic who used to be a priest, he should've crossed himself forehead to sternum, left-side to right side of chest.<br /><br />i had to read into the little side stories to get the notion satan was messing with the whole family, not just isabelle; but even in the end it was hard to say for sure if anyone was really guilty of the images in their heads or if it was all demonic trickery (except for the sheriff - it's pretty clear he was guilty).<br /><br />on the positive side: isabelle was creepy - in my opinion she was the best part of the whole movie and i liked the plot twist with claire.<br /><br />i'm just not sure if the movie was meant to be serious or a spoof.<br /><br />listening to the running commentary with cameron daddo and ethan wiley, i'm inclined to believe it was a joke.
