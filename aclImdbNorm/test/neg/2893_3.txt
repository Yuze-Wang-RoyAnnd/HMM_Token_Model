this is a really really bad movie. however it's good to laugh at the horrible ideas and "special" effects. the plot centers around an eu space agency that discovers a 10th planet that orbits directly opposite the earth. they send a maned mission (they have been to mars and have yet to discover this planet? is anybody stupid enough to fall for this?) to the planet and can you believe it, it's the mirror image of the planet they came from. most everything is predictable from that point. honestly from the title of the movie you can guess just about everything. the only surprising thing here is a maned space program run by eurpoeans :) there really can be no excuse for the plot concept or execution. so it's good for a laugh or maybe if you are in an altered state of consciousness.
