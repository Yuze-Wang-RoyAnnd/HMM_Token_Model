that someone could have conceived this nonsense and then got it produced is incredible. that it actually aired on television and advertisers actually paid to be associated with it is mind boggling. this stomach-wrenching excuse for kid's programming is almost too vile to comment on. i've burned -- yes burned -- any barney tapes that people have given my son. to find this awful programming in my library was an unpleasant surprise. and where, tell me where, do they get those smarmy kid actors? have their parents no sense? those kids will be on drugs before they're teenagers. geez. the final insult is that i have to add this extra line to the review to get it on imdb.
