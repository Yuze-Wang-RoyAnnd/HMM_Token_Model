the first time i saw a commercial for this show was when my sisters were watching the kim possible movie. the commercial showed sadie and her friend discussing the meaning of the word nothing.it is one of the stupidest commercials i've ever seen. basically, they go back and forth with lines like "nothing is a thing, so technically nothing is something,". when i saw that, i figured it would be yet another lame lizzie maguire knockoff by disney. but i had no idea how bad.<br /><br />fast forward about 3 weeks, when my sister turns on the t.v. naturally sadie happened to be on. what i saw had to be one of the most unintentionally funny shows i've ever seen. how'd it go? something like this:<br /><br />sadie, a vegetarian tree hugger, has an incredibly unhealthy,obsessive crush on the very monotone and poorly acted acted out owen. for some reason, her friend margret decides that owen needs to be "tested" to see if he is as good as he seems. what exactly do these tests involve? well, one thing they do is put a cockroach on her notebook. why? so that she can be squeamish and ask her monotone knight in shining armor to get it off.how is this a test? because if he squishes it, he's mean and uncaring and doesn't believe that bugs, as sadie puts it, "are innocent animals too,". they spread disease and pestilance! they deserve to be squished! but of course, owen just brushes it out the window, and sadie is still in love. but that's not all! margret says he needs to be challenged one more time, on something that "no guy can pass". this one involves shoving scarves down their pants( yes, you read that right)and walking buy him to see if he notices their large butts. predictably, he doesn't notice, and we see sadie in her bizarre and strange notebook world. sadie decides that she wants to be with owen forever,raise a family with him, and as she puts it, "live like wood ducks with their brood,". that's just plain wrong.<br /><br />bottom line: this is the strangest, most insane show i've watched. for those who like to make fun of dumb stuff, you'll love it. for anyone else, skip this show.
