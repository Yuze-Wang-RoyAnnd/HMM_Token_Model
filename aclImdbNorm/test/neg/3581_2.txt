i don't know what has happened to director abel ferrara. ever since the "body snatchers" remake he seems to have lost it. "king of new york" and "the bad lieutenant" remain two of the best films of the '90s: searing indictments of a decade gone wrong. with films like "'r xmas" (whatever that means) and "new rose hotel" he seems determined to disgust and bore his former supporters. this film has no life in it. while he gets excellent performances out of his actors in all of his projects the result of this mishmash of ideas just doesn't jell. whatever the point is -- that the new breed of drug dealer is more or less the same as any other upper middle class new yawkuh -- gets lost in the mind numbing script and boring direction. <br /><br />i saw this opening night at the 4-plex in downtown l.a. in the lobby, while buying tickets, i was surprised and delighted to see it filled with a large, racially mixed group of men and women in their twenties and thirties. then they started into the theater but it was the theater that was featuring "8 mile" not "'r xmas"! the theater showing "'r xmas" (keep in mind, this was opening night!) had a total of 4 people watching it, myself, my wife and two others! <br /><br />way to go, abel!<br /><br />2/10
