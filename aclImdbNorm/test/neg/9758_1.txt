as i watched this movie, i felt as if a plastic bag was slowly closing in around my head. the acting was horribly stifling, and it was bad acting. the most brilliant piece of acting in the entire film was the guy who had to play laid-out-in-state-in-a-coffin. i felt nothing but relief when it was finally over. i was expecting that this film was going to be some real tragedy, with some deep psychological intrigue in the aftermath. all around it was stupid, no beginning, no climax, no ending, just rambling on and on, and the plastic bag kept getting worse. let's get real here. this is an awful movie.
