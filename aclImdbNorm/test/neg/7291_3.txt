what the (beep) is going wrong with disney the last years? are there totally run out of good ideas? where is the magic? where are the good animators, the good songwriters, the good directors, the good... okay, i know, walt himself and the famous "nine old man" can't come back. but is this a reason to crank out countless of those cheap sequels and slowly but surely destroying the ideals of walt disney? i never rent or bought a disney-sequel of what movie however. because i had read much enough about its (absence of) quality. but "atlantis: milo's return" was aired today on tv in germany and so i watch it. it confirmed my doubts about sequels. it was absolutely boring. flaw animation, primitive color-rotation, simple characters, some unsuccessful tries to simulate the famous multiplane-camera with cgi, mediocre music and a patchwork of different, simple stories. it looks absolutely not like disney! not like disney i know! it looks like one of the countless, cheap and simple animation-series like "dragonballz", "beyblade" etc. that aired every day on tv for children.<br /><br />my first reaction after showing this crap, was to load "bambi" in my dvd-player, to see disney's immortal magic, depth, spirit and charm again, to see disney on its climax again, to see the awesome art of handmade animation again. "bambi" was the first (and until today the only) movie that i give 10 out of 10 stars. but "atlantis: milo's return"? no magic, no depth, no charm, no spirit... it deserved only 3 out of 10!
