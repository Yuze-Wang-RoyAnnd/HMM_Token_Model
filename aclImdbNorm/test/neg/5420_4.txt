tandem is an odd slice in the japanese pink genre-as it has the requisite sex-scenes and misogynistic tone that is all but required for these types of films-but also throws in a disjointed drama/dark-comedy storyline that seems like it'd have been better suited for a different type of film. <br /><br />the film starts with two lone guys at a restaurant-each daydreaming about a previous sexual encounter. one is a mutual subway groping, the other a pretty typical (for this type of film) semi-rape scenario. the two pervs meet and start talking after one lends the other a cigarette. they hang out for an evening and talk a bit about their respective sex- lives. the film is inter-cut with flashback scenes of both of the men's interactions with the women that are central in their lives. the two men have a falling out and the film ends on a weird but predictable note... <br /><br />i really don't know what to make of tandem. it sorta comes off as a soft-core, 'odd couple' type of anti-buddy-film, but doesn't really explore the subject-matter to any satisfying degree. there's also not much of the typical extreme sleaziness often so prevalent in these types of films-so i can't really figure out what the point was. i also cant quite tell if the film was supposed to be funny, depressing, or both.  i think that tandem could have had some potential as a more serious drama film with a dark-comedy edge- but as a soft-core sex film that tries to be too 'smart' for its own good-it just doesn't work.   can't say i hated this one-but can't say there's anything notable about it either. 4/10
