actually, son of the mask did make me laugh a few times...mostly due to the cartoonish jokes that made bugs bunny and roadrunner so funny. the cgi is very impressive and is used extensively in this movie. garfield, for example, is no where on par for cgi, but i would give it the same vote.<br /><br />everyone knows the story...which wasn't that bad for a kids movie. yes, it is a kids movie...and therefore should be treated as such. jamie kennedy is not very good in his role. his attempts to act "crazy" are not very good and overall acting is poor.<br /><br />everyone else is not too bad.<br /><br />basically, my 2 and 5 year old watched the whole thing without complaining. at least i was able to sit through this.<br /><br />there is no way this movie is worst than **shudder** class of 1999<br /><br />4/10 for the cgi and a few laughs.
