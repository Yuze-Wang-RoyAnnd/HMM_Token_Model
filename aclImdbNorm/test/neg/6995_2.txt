the film listed here as having been made in 1980 is not the film which is available from something weird video in their "driver's ed scare films vol. 5". for one thing the 1980 version is in color. swv has on this disc an earlier version (1972) of the film made in b&w for wlwt television channel 5 in cincinnati. either way this film is notorious. however, unlike most other driver's ed films, this was intended for television broadcast and viewing by the general public. thus the level of carnage has been ratcheted down. it's still a pretty grim exercise in exploitation of bloody death for a purported educational intent. i live in the cincinnati area and i remember this thing being shown every year around prom time on channel 5. if you're looking for one film that demonstrates the tone of this uniquely american film phenomenon, "the last prom" is pretty typical - morose, hyperbolic, extremely didactic, heavy on melodrama. whether it really affected any teenager's driving at all is anyone's guess.
