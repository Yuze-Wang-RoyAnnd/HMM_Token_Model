i can't believe i actually spent almost three hours of my life watching this. this must be one of the most unbelievable, predictable and cheesy television movies i have seen in a long time. i was hoping for some good special effects and action, instead i spent the entire time rolling my eyes and yelling "oh come on!!!", at the screen. the dialog is shallow and obvious, the acting strained at times and as the story moves along, isn't it just funny how everything happens at the same time... not to mention the obvious and nauseating ending... now i've seen more than my share of disaster movies, i am a big fan actually, and think that often they can pull off completely unrealistic stuff as long as it's done in a fun way, but this is definitely not it. this is just an insult to intelligent viewers everywhere. what were they thinking when they made this movie?????
