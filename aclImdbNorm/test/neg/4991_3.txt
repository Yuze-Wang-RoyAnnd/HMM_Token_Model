when i first became a father about 5.5 years ago, i was prepared for many of the sacrifices i'd have to make. i knew i'd have to change diapers and take them to swimming lessons and attend many a freezing santa claus parade, but i wasn't ready for the kind of sacrifice i made last night. this, in my humble opinion, is cruel and unusual punishment.<br /><br />underdog is bad. it's not quite karate dog bad, but it makes the shaggy dog feel like pulp fiction. if underdog were a television show, i'd recommend flipping on by. not even the presence of puddy and the voice of banky edwards can save it. bow. wow.<br /><br />it was also just about the best 80 minutes i've ever enjoyed. james was seated to the right of me and michelle to the left, and i spent more time watching their reaction to this talking, flying mutt than watching the screen. at 5 and 3 years old, they were the target audience, and this movie nailed the target. there's a scene where underdog belches loudly in another dogs face and michelle thought it was the funniest scene ever captured on film. when underdog was flying into outer space, james was literally at the edge of his seat, mesmerized. the kids absolutely loved underdog, and that's why i was there. that's what last night was all about.<br /><br />unless you're accompanying someone under the age of ten, you have no business wasting a second of your life watching this brutal film. but if you are looking to kill 80 minutes with your four year old, i won't judge. i had a blast.
