okay. i really tried to tap into the (so called) silly & surreal humor that this film sets out to be. i'm told that the japanese version of this film is much shorter than the one shipped to america (go figure!), and has less political references. apart from all that, i found this sexual/political farce just as boring and pointless as standard porn. the central female lead is easy on the eyes, and could actually act. i would love to see her in a non pink film where she could actually flex her acting muscles (and no,not the ones you're thinking of). it's obvious that japan can (and does)produce just as much crap as other countries. i couldn't recommend this to anyone, with the distant possibility of someone who has a jones for asian porn. go see a real japanese film.
