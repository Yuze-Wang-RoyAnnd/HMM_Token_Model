this movie is one of the worse movies of all time. i'm kind of upset this movie isn't on the bottom 100; it deserves a spot at least number 60 or 70 on that list. this isn't just a film i think is bad in a campy-fun sort of mst3k way; it's just bad. this is one of the few films that i really, really hate. freddy got fingered is in the same category of bad.<br /><br />so the story in this one goes that the daughter (gugino) goes to california to go to school and comes back with crawl (shore) and he tries to learn to be a farmer. then the boyfriend tries to set shore up so that the girl will leave crawl and go back to him. it ends and what's left of the audience can leave.<br /><br />the main purpose of this movie is for pauly shore to mug for the camera and try to be funny; but i'd say about 100% of the time he fails at that. their horrible inaccurate and out of date view of farms and farming is offensive and there's nothing in this movie worth seeing. if you think of seeing it: don't. the one time i saw the movie it felt like i was watching it for 5 or 6 hours. if you've already seen it; you have my sympathy.
