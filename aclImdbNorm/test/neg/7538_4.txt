after seeing purely belter i came onto this site to review it , but not only that i also had to check out the resume of the screenwriter / director mark herman . as soon as his name appeared on the opening credits i knew that i had seen his name before somewhere and after checking i found out he wrote and directed the film version of little voice one of the most underrated feelgood british movies of the 1990s <br /><br />purely belter is an entirely different kettle of fish . it's a grim stereotypical view of geordie life and a very unfunny one at that . everyone is either a wife beater , a single mother , a shoplifter , a drunk or a junkie . since many scenes are set in a school the pe teacher is a sadistic bully and that's the closest the film ever gets to reality . oh and everyone is very foul mouthed which adds to the grim unlikable atmosphere<br /><br />i didn't like purely belter much while i watched and now that i know who mark herman is i like it even less . with little voice herman proved you can make an amusing uplifting comedy featuring northern souls but i had to ask where his undoubted talent went in this movie ?
