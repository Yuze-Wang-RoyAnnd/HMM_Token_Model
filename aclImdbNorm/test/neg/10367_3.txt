this one and the one prior "toulon's revenge" and the next one seem to be completely different from the first two movies where the puppets were not so nice. it is basically choose your series, the first two go together and paint the puppets as killers, while the next three are a series of them being the good guys. this one plays out to much like some cheesy television series episode to be as good as part three was and i never really had the urge to try and watch part five of the series. basically, a kid gets the puppets while some strange dark lord or something sends his evil puppets out to kill, this dark lord looks like some sort of enemy from one of those live action japanese shows like ultraman. the movie is over before you know it though so it has to get credit for not inflicting you with a very painful to watch movie. just to many plot holes and things in it for it to be considered an okay movie. you do get to see the guy who played toulon in the last movie though then you have a very anti-climatic battle and wham the movie is over before it really begins.
