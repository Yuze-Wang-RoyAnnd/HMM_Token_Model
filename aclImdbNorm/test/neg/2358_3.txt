if i wouldn't have had any expectations of this film, it might have received a 5 or 6. as it stands, i give it a 3. the acting is poor, the factual accuracy of the drugs it discusses is lacking, and i feel no empathy whatsoever for the characters.<br /><br />i watched 'adam & paul' immediately before watching this film, and i both laughed and cried on several occasions. this film did not strike even a similar chord. the directors of 'human traffic' may have some off-hand experience of ecstasy, but there is no demonstration of actual drug-related semantic knowledge here. in fact, i find it rather offensive and contraproductive to the strife of making current drug laws less politically oriented.<br /><br />watch 'requiem for a dream' if what you're looking for is an amazing, touching film about drugs.
