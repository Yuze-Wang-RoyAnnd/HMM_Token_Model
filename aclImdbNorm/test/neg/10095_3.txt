"in the sweltering summer of 1958, the deuces, a gang of brooklyn toughs, find their turf threatened when the leader of a rival gang, the vipers, is released from prison. leon (stephen dorff), the deuces' leader, tries to guide his boys through bloody brawls to keep the vipers out. but when his brother (brad renfro) falls into a sultry - and dangerous - relationship with annie (fairuza balk), the sister of a viper, and his own girlfriend is brutally attacked, leon and his gang are plunged into an all-out war to save his brother, his girl - and his neighborhood!" according to the dvd sleeve description. this is definitely no "basketball diaries".<br /><br />think of it as "west side story" getting hit over the head with baseball bats and steel pipes, stickball having left brooklyn with the dodgers. "deuces wild" has some cool hollywood sets, 1950s cars and soundtrack songs; and, much of it is nicely photographed by john a. alonzo. the story and direction never get beyond these strengths, which enables the film to peak during its opening minutes, and proceed downhill. the cast looks good when you read the credits, but translates into an ageing, flabby mess of phony pompadours, blood, and brylcreem
