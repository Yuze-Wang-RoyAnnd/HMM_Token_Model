yes i really found this film distasteful. <br /><br />i didn't like the sandra oh character, she really annoyed me. it is unlikely she would be accepted into rural italian life due to the fact she is non-white. this was a bit of pc nonsense. <br /><br />the film is also offensive to italian men. for instance, the one man she (diane lane) has an affair is turns out to be a caddish cheat. but guess what: at the end your typically plasticky american brick-head turns up, all cheesy white smile and tan, and she finally finds what she wants all along: a real american man, and now she has colonized another part of the world. <br /><br />in fact, this film is quite racist in its depiction of italians and the way it subjugates them as either smarmy lotharios or backward peasants. <br /><br />the photography was good but the film and its attitude were trash.
