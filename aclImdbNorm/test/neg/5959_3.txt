ok, so i have recently been collecting a lot of vipco and hardgore titles on dvd and i have to say that this one is one of the most disappointing ones. a more recent film compared to other titles in the hardgore catalogue this was a straight to dvd release. i've always been interested in the myth of el chokeberry ever since i saw a documentary on it as a teenager. however this film is a terrible let down shot on tacky dv the storyline and acting are terrible, it took me three goes to watch this film all the way through. while cheap 80's and 90's horror films are good because of their cheap budgets and comedy this film is not.<br /><br />check out some other titles in the hardgore series first, boneyard for example is older but much much better.
