poor old robert taylor. other than the feds, nothing much has gone his way - this almost-shocker is a wasteful ninety minutes and not much more. it's one of those cheesy detective-crime flicks with the narrative of the lead character the whole way through - usually that's reserved for comedies these days but this film takes itself way too seriously! a pity; australian films, particularly in the 2000-01 periods, have been of exceptional quality overall - but i suppose there have got to be a few misses. why even make a film like this, that obviously isn't going to be any good?
