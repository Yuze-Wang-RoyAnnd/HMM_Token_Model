being an american service member please believe me when i say that this movie in no way accurately portrays the emotional state of our soldiers/sailors/airmen/marines returning from deployments.<br /><br />that being said....<br /><br />this movie is one large steaming pile of clich'e. the acting as awful (with the exception of the little girl) the character's backgrounds are weak and laughable, and plot is ludicrous.<br /><br />this movie is so bad i made an account with imdb just to warn anyone with half a brain away from it.<br /><br />canadian writer/director francesco lucente should be really, really, really ashamed of this movie. if he disagrees with us foreign policy, he should write a letter to the us government, not punish the entire english speaking world with a monumentally crap film.
