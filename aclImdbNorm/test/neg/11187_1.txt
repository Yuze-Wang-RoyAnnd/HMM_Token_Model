when something can be anything you want it to be or mean, it's bound to register with someone as being rather special. but just as the shape of a cloud in the sky may appear to one of us or remind us of a battleship, and to another of his aunt's rear, and yet to another absolutely nothing other than a cloud, this does not make this cloud meaningful except for the viewers' interpretation. anyone who might find throwing a stuffed giraffe out of a window brilliant, or worthwhile for that matter, without relating it in some context, is possibly merely trying to impress us with his or her intellectuality.<br /><br />submitting to this movie as the dreams of a madman does quite nicely, especially since there is no standard or expectation for what said dreams would be like, and even if we were mad ourselves, this would hardly give us sane reference points for comparison. a love affair with this movie entails the same risk as seriously interpreting nostradamus. whatever real meaning was being conveyed at the time might be buried in the private jokes, musings, or provincial minutiae of its day, and to a select few radical intellectuals at that! i did spot a bit of an agenda even with my limited capacity though.<br /><br />the movie is definitely anti-fascist and to some extent anti-italian. i noted that although the years 1929-30 were years of great public works and urban renewal in italy, any indication of this seemed avoided. furthermore, (avant-guarde academic spinners take note of this for your next class) the very short cropped haired man with the mustache in the party segment near the end is a caricature of victor emmanuel iii and his tall female companion none other than queen helen, formerly princess of montenegro. without an understanding of potential historical relevance, even the apparent irrelevance is beyond the competence of academic or other intellectual poseurs who would bask in irrelevance to impress us.<br /><br />i gladly add my own paint buckets to the defacement of this cinematic joke. but in an adaptation of the famous mot by the little boy; the movie really has no face (to deface). paint would help it burn though.
