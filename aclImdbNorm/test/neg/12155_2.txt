the worst film i have seen in the last 12 months. the plot of the story was uninteresting, the movie ended when he became gingesh khan, i always thought there happened something really interesting afterwards. i knew that mongolia and all the areas where the movie played have beautiful landscapes but the movie didn't profit from that. the jokes where really poor. the narrator, gingesh himself, could have told a bit more about mongolian history, traditions etc. my co-viewer knew nothing about that at all so he was a bit lost. i was so looking forward to see this film but was really disappointed after all. it was one out of 3 movies i have ever seen in cinema where i considered to leave before the end.
