some people say this show was good in it's early years! i disagree with all of 'em. the show is just plain stupid and pathetic. my mum hates it, i hate it, my dad hates it, i don't know about my sister but oh well. here some reasons why:<br /><br />1. the characters: babies being used as grown up style characters are stupid. the babies are just precocious and annoying. the grown ups and adults are dumb and unappealing. the worst character is that angelica pickles (she really does it in for your ear drums when you had a long, hard and miserable day at the office) and also that kimi finster who appears later on; she is too over optimistic and a pain in the butt. she can't decided whither she is french or japanese: it doesn't matter know; you are a american citizen know and that's that! oh, what am i talking about, all the characters from this show suck!<br /><br />2. the stories: the stories are unoriginal and dumb. the make it like the babies go off on a great adventure, yeah to the back yard shed. in one episode, that little goofy brat, tommy pickles the leader broke in to a television's control room and literally almost destroyed it. don't give kids any idea to smash up normal t.v station's control rooms (they pay a awful lot of money for them in real life). i can imagine what the broadcasters must of felt like airing this episode, they will probably start staring at their machines throughout the day scared that a baby will brake in. sad!<br /><br />3. over rated!: the show has been dragging on for years now and people are still making up stories and new series and spin-offs for this. get off! the simpsons have been going for nearly the same amount of time as this but they are much better and funnier than babies. the show is just plain over rated! people, where is your common sense!<br /><br />anyway, i surprised t.v stations across the world want to air this series even off today. the show is utter junk and should have never been produced. the two movies for this cartoons sucked just the same! 2/10
