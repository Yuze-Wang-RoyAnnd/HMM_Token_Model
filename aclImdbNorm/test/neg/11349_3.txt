any of law & order's, csi (take your choice of city), and homicide: life on the street's weakest episodes is superior to the strongest episode of bones.<br /><br />david boreanaz is stuck in crappy angel mode, and emily deschanel portrays "bones" too... unrealistically. the actors as a whole have terrible scenes together, be it with forced acting, or just awful lines.<br /><br />the murders become predictable after a while, as the foreshadowing and clues are just too obvious.<br /><br />music is okay, though really unnecessary at times.<br /><br />all in all, bones is hardly the show i'd recommend watching during the weekdays as it is a carbon-copy of better shows with unreal characters and ever-dulling stories.<br /><br />skip this if you can.
