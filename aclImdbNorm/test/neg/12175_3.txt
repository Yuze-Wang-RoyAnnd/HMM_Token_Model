the appeal of this film has to be the artsy euro style, because there's absolutely no substance. a bunch of stuff happens that seems to be going somewhere... but it never gets there.<br /><br />it's difficult to come up with a full 10 lines of commentary, because this film is such a totally empty experience. there's lots of nice photography of a cemetery, some really lame zombie effects, some flashes of what might pass for surrealist humor, and a feeble, existentialist ending. these elements undermine each other. just when you might be enjoying the creepy mood, there's some silliness with bouncing heads or zombie sex. to keep from screaming with boredom, you clutch at the minimal story line - and it disintegrates into ridiculous illogic. it's like someone took several half-baked b movies and tossed them in a blender.<br /><br />what comes out is mostly a film *about* meaninglessness - and *not* a good one. clearly, it will impress that category of art-house fan who sees emptiness as indistinguishable from depth. everyone else should stay well clear of this dreary mess.
