i give this nonsense a 2 instead of a 1 because there is a worse show called haunted homes. but this kid and his buddies conduct their investigations like total idiots. they assume that there are ghosts from the get go and if they ever find rational explanations behind the experiences they have to be drug kicking and screaming into admitting it. but beyond that, the show's whole format is incredibly annoying. even though a lot of it seems scripted, the college educated kids who make up the the cast can barely speak english but still insist on trying to use "big" words they obviously don't understand. and head investigator ryan's ridiculously self important voiceovers make me just want to throw the tv through the window. (and he looks stoned all the time). in short, this group make the guys from taps on ghost hunters look like mit scientists!
