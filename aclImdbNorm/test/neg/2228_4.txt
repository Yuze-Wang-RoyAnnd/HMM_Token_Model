all those who criticize the sopranos for its stereotypical portrayals of italians haven't seen anything until they've gotten a good look at this cornball gangster film which focuses on a family so irritating, you almost want them to be rubbed out.<br /><br />the parents in this clan aren't so bad, but their two little boys--one a total brat, one cloyingly cutesy-poo--are insufferable, while their older good-for-nothing son and pollyanna daughter ably compete for audience contempt. but the granddaddy of them all is, well, granddaddy. as played by chic sale (in full "dag-nabbit!" mode) he serves as the films moral compass, throwing in lots of diatribes about "dang, dirty foreigners" for good measure. if these are the good guys, it's no wonder the actors of that era who played baddies became the big stars.<br /><br />not that there are any stellar performances to be found among the criminal actors, but they at least acquit themselves better than the grating leeds family. the incompetent police officers aren't even given enough screen time to bring things down any further. only walter huston, as the district attorney, elevates the clich'e-riddled material in his futile attempts to breathe some levelheadedness into these dolts.<br /><br />the film deserves credit for being an early entry in what would prove to be a very popular silencing-the-witness formula, and it doesn't flinch in its depiction of the hard-bitten underworld lifestyle, but there are quite simply better--and less xenophobic--examples in the genre.
