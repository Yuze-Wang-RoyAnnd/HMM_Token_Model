dennis quaid is tryin' hard to prove us that jerry lee lewis was a dumb guy. and he's doing too much to prove it. tv sequences are very good, like a photocopy of old black and white footages. music is fine too, because mr. lewis himself is singing. but the rest is just hollywood b-movie style, with the fifties happy days complex. i think the only good thing in this movie is to see young winona ryder.
