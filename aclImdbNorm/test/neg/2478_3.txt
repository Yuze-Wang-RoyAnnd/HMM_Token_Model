1) if you want to make a movie that deals with social realism it's quite important that the audience identify with the characters that are being portrayed. 2) the audience can't identify with characters that are highly stereotyped or with situations that are to obvious. 3) if you got a bad actor then you can't build any character. anyway, even if you got nice actors their job will result ridiculous if you force them to speak with a fictitious andalusian accent.<br /><br />jes'us ponce ignores those 3 points and also makes some cheap jokes that are completely out of place. his script is so predictable: a woman comes out of prison, she meets his old junkie boyfriend, life's tough, etc. whatever, the fact that the story is everything but original wouldn't be that bad if only ponce weren't a complete incompetent writing and filming.<br /><br />i wonder how long will they keep giving money from our taxes to make movies such as this one.<br /><br />*my rate: 3/10
