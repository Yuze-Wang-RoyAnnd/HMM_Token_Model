i just have watched icon on dvd and despite being a great book, the movie is a weak substrate from it. those responsible for the writing should be banished to siberia. why they maul the great story with all kind of c-film subploys which are totally irrelevant to the story is totally beyond me.<br /><br />yet the filmmakers and cast do there best to make something out of it, but at the end the film was not satisfying at all.<br /><br />can someone please make a decent movie out of this to show how it is done. i'm sure that the crowds will rally for such a masterpiece novel turned into a book, not into a cheap c-movie.
