as i read the script on-line, i thought "capote" needed a trim. having just seen it on ppv, i can tell you it wasn't trimmed, it was butchered like that poor family! example: in the script, truman dubs shawn "adorable one"; here, he is "mr. shawn".<br /><br />bad enough the amateurs behind this movie de-flame capote and bash his circle (are we to really believe they thought so little of nelle, they mangled her little opus like an obnoxious in-joke?), they turn perry smith into this oh-so-sensitive victim, even as he's shown dispatching the clutters. it's one thing to fudge the facts, it's another to drop the ball: the executions were carried out between 12:45-1:19 am, april 14; truman is shown at the prison 22 hours later!<br /><br />i was totally underwhelmed by the "acting". keener doesn't even try to sound like an alabama native. the way cooper kept shouting "alvin!", i was waiting for the chimpmunks to show up! hoffman gives us not the charming gadfly, but a pathetic suck-up who sees an horrific act as his ticket to the big time. when hoffman whines about being "tortured" by the endless appeals, i wanted to give him a shotgun so he could do us both a favor and blow his brains out!
