tagline: the lucky ones died...before watching this.<br /><br />i've never watched a bulgarian movie from 1920's, so i can't say this is the worst movie ever made, but it surely is the worst movie i've ever watched. i can't almost remember it.<br /><br />all i can recall is a family of stupid people who don't do anything right. their car has one wheel out of four stuck in the sand, so they decide that there's nothing to do and prepare to live the rest of their lives there. then there's an old man who is aware of the existence of a band of cannibals in the whereabouts but has never considered the idea to report the fact to the police.<br /><br />and, speaking of the police...if those freaks have lived around there eating humans for years, lots of people must have disappeared...how come the sheriff didn't suspect anything?<br /><br />but i gave up asking questions after the first five minutes or so. the rest is bore. an hallucinated unbelievable bore.<br /><br />i will be merciful and won't speak about the dialogues. and the acting. and the effects.<br /><br />i will only mention the final scene, where the freak girl eliminates a snake (the snakes! they come out in the end, what the hell do they have to do with the story?) with a sniper-precise throw of a stone, demonstrating the full disregard of mr. craven for reality and for things that happen on planet earth in general.<br /><br />i believe there have been riots when the film was first released in 1977.<br /><br />even being eaten by a cannibal wouldn't be a fair punishment to the director for this attack on intelligence.
