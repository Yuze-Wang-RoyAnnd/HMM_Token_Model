this is the third movie in a month i have watched that did not go the way i expected. the first two being the black dahlia and hollywoodland, neither of which gave any new ideas of who committed the crimes.<br /><br />i have always had a fascination with ufos and was so excited to see a new movie on the subject of ufo investigation that was not a comedy. but after about 30 minutes, it all went horribly wrong.<br /><br />i could have stood for the acting, the camera angles, the stereotypes if only there was a good story about chasing ufos, but none here. i am not saying there was anything wrong with the subject matter, but netflix pushed this movie as a ufo skeptic and a ufo believer investigating multiple sitings.<br /><br />i stopped watching about half way thru. can't believe i wasted that much time with this one. please don't make the same mistake i did.
