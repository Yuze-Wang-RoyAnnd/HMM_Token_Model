i am willing to tolerate almost anything in a sci-fi movie, but this was almost intolerable. while a few of the special effects are very cool (landscapes) this is no 'battlespace' rather a disjointed weird mother/daughter relationship with sci-fi concepts thrown in. the acting (wooden), framing and shooting (kindergarten film school) and with "hand-to-hand" combat scenes funnier than any hong kong chopsocky movie, this film bores. the plot line is convoluted and the devices used to move the plot along (narrator), unexplained scene jumps and plenty of deus ex machina reinforce the idea that writer cum director is not a good idea. save your love of sci-fi for something else instead of losing a bit of it here.
