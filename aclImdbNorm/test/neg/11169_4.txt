these days, asian horror films are among the best in the world, noted for their atmosphere and reflection of contemporary society. this is not one of those films! instead, "the record" is a mediocre slasher movie highly derivative of american movies like "i know what you did last summer" and "scream". the plot is familiar - 5 teenagers accidently commit a terrible crime, but cover it up swearing to secrecy. one year later, they're being stalked by a knife-wielding maniac (with the decidely unscary disguise of a hospital sterile mask and an orange jumpsuit). it doesn't help that the teenagers are a generally unlikable group (this is one of those movies where the killer's motives seem pretty reasonable) and there are numerous stupid plot setups to keep the story going. the direction of the movie is unsubtle, more influenced by mtv than by current asian horror films (like "the ring"). the last third of the movie isn't too bad though, delivering some decent suspense scenes, though there is probably one "twist" too many in the end. 4/10
