lance used to get quality support work from james cameron. heck, he even had his own tv show (millenium) for a coupl'a seasons. why is he doing this? couldn't he find some better way to pay his bills?<br /><br />i love a good low-budget movie. some of them you can laugh at simply due to their ludicrous premise, their textbook stereotyped characters, or often times because the actors are related to the director/producers. but, this movie has no redeeming value. i didn't laugh. i didn't cry. i only had this sick feeling in my stomach. that feeling was quickly identified as pity. at one point, lance henriksen was an a-list support actor. he's been in terminator (he was going to be terminator before arnold showed up), aliens, aliensiii, classic b-movie pumpkinhead, among so many others! i wanted to send him money after this. maybe we should start a support lance fund or something.<br /><br />then again, for making this thing...maybe not.
