there have been some great television movies in that past. epics such as "roots" and "lonesome dove" come to mind. category 6: day of destruction will not be remembered for advancing the cause of made-for-tv movies. a laughably bad story, surpassed only by the horrible screenplay, cat6dd, as i like to call it, inspires more sympathy for the actors involved than terror in nature that the movie was supposed to bring out. that sound you hear during the movie is supposed to be the sound of wind, but instead it's actually the careers of randy quaid, brian dennehy, and thomas gibson (greg, of the dharma & greg duo) plummeting faster than houses and trucks and cows can fly away from one of the 15 tornadoes we see in the first 5 minutes of the movie. the movie was advertised as "nature gone amok," instead we get a lame story about how 15 different weather systems conspire to produce 150 degree days in chicago, then a blizzard the next day from a hurricane that was in the gulf of mexico that combined with a storm system from canada but actually had it's origins in a jet stream changed by global warming.... enough!! it didn't matter what the story was, the acting was terrible, the words the actors said were dumb, and 13 scientists throughout the country had coronaries after hearing the dribble that came out of the movie. i didn't care what happened to any of the characters, the special effects were sub-par, even for made-for-tv standards, and the story lines were pointless. all in all, i really really dislikes this "tv event."
