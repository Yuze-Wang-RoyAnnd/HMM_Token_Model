although allegedly autobiographical, this movie demonstrates very little insight both into the protagonist's psychology (resulting in a flat, fragmented characterization) as well as into larger-scale historical processes, and my hope of either learning something new or improving my understanding of contemporary iran remained unfulfilled. instead, i found my sensibilities somewhat dulled as a succession of bearded islamic villains replaced each other taunting, torturing or killing the wantonly victimized prototypical middle-class iranian whose western cultural sympathies were patent (and whose exoneration the movie quite blatantly seeks.) the deeper understanding the movie does seem to demonstrate is that of the mass-media market, as it serves to nourish prevalent occidental folk-ideologies (i.e. a "crowd pleaser"). <br /><br />what redeemed the movie from being outright boring was its creative animation - genuinely minimalistic imagery which, nevertheless, always kept the screen rich, expressive and unambiguous - no small fete for which i do give it some stars.
