that is what this movie is. good god the special effects suck in this movie. it is difficult for anything to suck more than this movie's plot, but the special effects manage to pull it off. let me try to explain just how bad this movie is.<br /><br />first, there is the plot. there are four punk-ass teenage dirt bikers who are riding around in a forest in duluth, mn. one of them is a dumb-ass and tries a ridiculous jump and breaks his leg. a paramedic comes to help him, but gets stranded with them when the helicopter breaks. then all five realize that there is a forest fire, which we see is started by some guy dumping tons of gas all over the forest. all they show us is his boots, and they show scene after scene of this guys boots walking around dumping gas and starting fires. meanwhile, the teenagers try to escape the fire, only to find that boot man has somehow managed to get ahead of them (while they were speeding through the forest on dirt bikes!), dump gas all over the area they were riding through, and start more fires. he does this several times, and the paramedic finally catches him and starts him on fire. i won't spoil the ending, but this guy's resilience will have you shouting "what the bloody hell?!?!" at the screen. anyway, they are now surrounded by fire, and their only escape is through a mine which is filled with methane gas. yes, methane gas. i'm not even going to try to describe the ending, because it is too ridiculous, and you'll enjoy it more if you don't see it coming. which you won't, because you can't possibly expect what happens. this is because of the second major problem with this movie: consistency.<br /><br />is some semblance of consistence too much to ask for? apparently so. i cannot even count the number of broken limbs in this movie (they keep breaking arms and legs while crashing their bikes). i think each character breaks at least one limb, and several more than one. they then limp around until the scene ends, and then forget that they're supposed to have broken limbs. there is one scene where three of them who are supposed to have broken legs start dancing. but then their injuries suddenly return when the plot needs them to.<br /><br />finally, the cgi. if there is a hell, it consists of watching the fire in this movie. all they did for the forest fires is line the dirt paths with cgi fire. you can clearly see that the only cgi fire is along the paths, and all of the trees more than two feet from the path are left untouched. and then they zoom out and show the whole forest being engulfed in flames. it's hard to describe in words how ridiculous it looks, but i assure you that the ridiculousness is quite impressive.<br /><br />this movie is one of those so-bad-its-good types. there are some occasions where it descends into the painful-bad category, but for the most part it stays above the line and is laughably inept. i can't wait to check out the other nature unleashed movies that came in the four-pack with this one.
