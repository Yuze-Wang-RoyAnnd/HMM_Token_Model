today, being president's day, my wife and i had "the notebook" dvd, checked out at our local library. it's a movie released in 2004 that fell beneath our radar, as we are big movie goers. i'm a published author with hopes of screen playing my first book. i'd noticed references to "the notebook" in reviews of other movies which is why i brought it up about us watching and this morning provided the perfect opportunity. we both really liked it. it made my wife cry; we could relate to many things in it with our own, continuing love affair and even i fought back choking up.<br /><br />this afternoon, after lots of chores, yard work and eating, we decided to actually catch a matin'ee. when we got to the theater, having seen most of the current batch of films playing, we elected to see "victoria day" which for some reason was not at the theater, even though both imdb and my phone movies showed it playing there. so, instead we looked at the poster for "dear john" and that it was written by the same writer as "the notebook", making it the obvious choice as we enjoyed 'tn' so much.<br /><br />what a disappointment! first, the characters did not have the same believability or sense of empathy as 'tn'; and we kept commenting throughout all the similarities -- two dozen or so -- quickly causing us to realize this movie was nothing but, as another reviewer commented, "a poor man's notebook!" it had a real 'cash cow' feeling, meaning the sparks simply threw a story together, based on the exact template of 'tn' simply to make a quick buck. not only that, after the 'bug-eyed' trollop improbably 'dear john's-john' for the wimp cancer patient, we ridiculed the movie with each, passing soapy stupid line all the way through to the end. there were only about 6 of us in the theater during this 4:45pm monday matin'ee and my wife even told me to keep it down so i wouldn't ruin it for the others...it was so bad.<br /><br />seeing this on the heels of 'tn' ensured that the rip off similarities were vividly recognizable and sparks blatant, cheap attempt at template writing painfully obvious. we only wish we could've seen "victoria day" instead...no matter how bad it might've been after seeing this poor entry to cinema. and oh..., for the last 30-minutes, i kept saying "...don't give that cow the coins ...don't give that cow the coins?"
