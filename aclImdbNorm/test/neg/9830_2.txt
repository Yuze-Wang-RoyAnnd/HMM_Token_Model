if you have ever wanted to know more about cab drivers, then this is an excellent movie to watch, for informational purposes only. i can just hear it now, "wait, just wait a second! why don't we follow a cab driver through his entire day! cabbies are funny, and so are the people they meet, and they only talk to each other for just a couple of minutes, so the other actors should be cheap! harry, you take care of production, joan, you've got materials, brian, you go round up some actors and we'll all meet back here tomorrow to start filming!"<br /><br />the first 90% of the movie could not have been any worse had that very thing happened. at least with no planning whatsoever, there is always the element of surprise to be found. some of jim carrey's movies have stuff added as they go along and they always do well at the box offices. the problem here is that the first 90% is pretty well scripted out, and it pretty much sucks. paul dillon plays the cab driver in chicago who is working all day. we pretty much see what he sees. people get in and out of his car and he drives all around town. he talks to those people for a few seconds and then we get some more people. <br /><br />i'll admit, there were a couple of funny bits here and there. a religious family tries to talk the cab driver into going to church with them, he takes a pregnant lady and her husband to the hospital, breaks up a rich businessman from his girlfriend, a poor girlfriend from her boyfriend and takes a rape victim home. i guess the moral of the movie is that a cab driver is more than a cab driver and has a larger sphere of influence over the lives of his passengers than you might originally think. for some people, he's just a means of getting from here to there, but for others, his very ordinary words help change the direction of their lives.<br /><br />the last passenger of the day is used to try make sense of the rest of the movie, and to a small extent it succeeds. it had a bit of that deathbed repentance feel to it where the good majority of the movie sucks and then at the very end, it tries to make it all better in just one or two changes. i wasn't too impressed with the movie as a whole, but there were a few bits and pieces worth watching again. as far as the actors go, paul dillon is it. john cusack, gillian anderson and julianne moore are all in this, for about 30 seconds each, but don't watch this for any of them or you will most certainly be disappointed. i will give the other people invovled some credit that it's not your ordinary movie they have produced here, but it wasn't a very good one either. there just wasn't enough material to keep you going for an hour and a half. it was a decent effort, but it failed none the same.
