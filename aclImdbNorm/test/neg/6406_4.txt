there was a time when joel schumacher was ranked quite high on my list of favorite directors. back in the late 80's and early 90's, when his name was attached to several great films like "the lost boys", "flatliners" and "falling down", he truly was one of the most gifted directors in hollywood. then came the stupid "batman" sequels, unfortunately, and after that it seemed as if every potentially sublime screenplay turned into a gigantic mess in schumacher's hands. both "8mm" and "phone booth" could have been much better films and even the incredibly imbecilic concept of "the number 23" should have been processed into a slightly more compelling and entertaining movie. literally from start to finish, "the number 23" desperately attempts to be a mysterious and uncanny thriller and therefore uses all the dreadful clich'es from the big book of cinema history, including heavy-voiced narration, flashbacks, disorderly structure, characters with multiple personalities, numerous plot twists that grow increasingly absurd and sinister asylum settings. nothing helps, however, simply due to the sheer silliness of the basic formula and the clearly uninspired engagement of cast & crew. as much as you try to associate with the lead character and be open-minded regarding the insane theories, this still remains a movie about a two-digit number and two-digit numbers aren't scary. walter sparrow (jim carrey in a rare non-comical role) is a bored animal trapper whose wife agatha gives him a bizarre book on his birthday. the book tells about all sorts of devilish theories and strange coincidences that are linked to the number 23. walter almost promptly identifies himself with the book's protagonist (a sleazy detective investigating a grim case of suicide) and begins to spot copious examples of the 23 enigma in his own private life. i did some research on google and wikipedia and, apparently, this whole 23 numerology nonsense really exists and certain people honestly believe that most catastrophes and accidents are directly connected to this evil number. well, that's just
