i admit to a secret admiration of the original love thy neighbour tv shows - mostly because they exhibit the kind of exuberant brashness and bad taste synonymous with so many programmes of their era - but i'd be lying through my teeth (very uncomfortable position) if i pretended that this big-screen spin-off is anything other than an abomination. the opening scenes of wanton vandalism are not only pointless but baffling as well - it's never explained why the film opens with a tracking shot of people trashing each other's houses - and nothing improves from there. by the time the film unearths the oldest joke in the book - the horrible dragon of a mother-in-law turns up unexpectedly to stay - is followed by the crashingly obvious revelation that she's developing a soft spot for the black neighbour's father, moving her bigoted son to ever greater depths of self-righteous, ignorant rage, most discerning viewers will have switched off. take that as a warning, unless you're keen on cheapskate spin-offs with terrible acting, static direction and the overall comic flair of a burning orphanage.
