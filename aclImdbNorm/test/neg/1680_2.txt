an elite american military team which of course happens to include two good looking women and a guy who can't quite grasp teamwork, lots of bats, some terrorists, and a spetznaz team that acts like the gang that can't shoot straight -- all thrown together in a jumbled plot with mediocre acting. this one has nothing much going for it. the characters are not compelling. even the setting, which has great possibilities, looks like something out of the middle of rural pennsylvania, not an exotic boreal forest in eastern europe.<br /><br />the bats are certainly ferocious looking. they can even pick up a man and fly with him for a few feet (harpies?) or chop off an arm. you see delta force surrounded by hundreds of bats with a guys shooting assault rifles and pistols at them and bat flopping to the ground. it would be like trying to shoot skeet with a rifle from a distance of 3 feet. utterly clueless. the dialogue is rancidly unrealistic, with boy/girl jokes and flirts in the middle of tense parts of the mission. one of the team is blown up by a mine and the first one on the scene just stares sadly at his body, stunned, not even bothering to take cover or secure the area. in fact after the rest of the group shows up he talks about how the area is laid out like a minefield -- thanks for the heads up bub.<br /><br />if you want a contrast in how a horror movie involving a small military group can be done well on a low budget check out outpost. harvest is not the movie you want to see. in fact i think i'm going to give it a two instead of a three if i can make it through the second half. seems unlikely at this point.
