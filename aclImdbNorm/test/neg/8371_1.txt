as i was watching it, i was getting ready to compose a blasting, lambasting critique of this "film," (it is actually video), but then i saw that someone already did. i pretty much agree with him. but then again, it looks like a lot of effort and millions of lira went into it, so i guess you gotta give them some credit for trying. however, that being said, anyone who doesn't already know the lovecraftian world and that this is what they were trying to convey will probably think, ... well, i suppose, that not only is it really bad, but it makes absolutely no sense. thank god i read part of the other review ('twas a little gushy, maybe?) which revealed that this guy also did "the shunned house," (which looked pretty bad, judging by the dvd box), so now i can avoid it and save my mind from any further exposure to such desecration of the brilliance of h.p. lovecraft.
