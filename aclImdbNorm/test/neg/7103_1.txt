sometimes a movie cannot easily be classified. such a film is "tank girl", part cartoon, part comedy, and part action flick. i'm sure somewhere there is an audience for "tank girl', but it is extremely small, perhaps punk comic book readers. most viewers will be looking for an early exit or living with the fast forward button. the only redeeming quality are short bursts of humor "find me a microscope and a pair of tweezers", but these tiny moments of comic relief are far outweighed by the sophomoric action sequences. there is no character development, which is not surprising, since the source is a comic book. do yourself a favor and avoid, avoid, avoid. - merk
