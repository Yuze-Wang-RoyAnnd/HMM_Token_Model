uncle fred olen ray once again gives us a little of his retromedia "goodness" in the form of this soft-core cinemax non-classic.<br /><br />a numb-nut pair are out looking at rocks when they come across a swirling vortex a "black hole" as the intelligent dolts put it. pretty soon an attractive cave girl from one million years ago happens into out time-line and she beds her way into the future. pretty soon her studly other half makes his way into the future as well and blazes a path through the beds of the future.<br /><br />ray again delivers a passable (but barely) smut-fest that has horrible acting but some decent skin. yeah it's barely titillating but heh! if worse comes to worse it will cure you insomnia.<br /><br />s10 reviews: 1/5 or 3/10
