i understand that the budget was low on this film, but come on this is really terrible film-making. the script is just plain awful and that was the free part. the effects aren't bad, but this film plays out like a conventional r-rated movie with lame scares and cut-away violence rather than a no holds barred unrated gore-fest that was intentionally made for video. who were these guys kidding? like this would have been released in theaters.<br /><br />the acting is terrible. the editing, another free aspect of the film, is beyond amateur, and the plot, as i said before, leaves little to be desired. there's nothing original about the film. gore fans, avoid this one. to the filmmakers: try for something original next time, or stop making movies all together. you're not good at it. people hate a trashy rehash, especially one of such low caliber. avoid! it isn't even worth making fun of.
