voor een verloren soldaat , for a lost soldier, is a sad example of how not to translate to film a touching, complex psychological study, of that most magical time in a man's life, when he is still a child, but starting to become a man. the novel records the real life experiences of rudy van dantzig, as told thru the boy jeroen, during the waning days of wwii at age 11 as he deals with his incipient sexuality, and his deep fears of abandonment as he has been sent to the province of friesland, north of holland by his parents because of the lack of food in amsterdam and has not heard from them in many months as the postal service has broken down.. the arrival of the liberating soldiers in the film, is presented in a painfully corny way, with the soldiers providing entertainment vaudeville style. then one soldier, walt, romances jeroen and the pair is presented as two frolicking males.who consummate their love in a sexual experience. this taken in stride by the 11 yo jeroen. the reality was somewhat different: jeroen describes his encounters with walt, 6 in all, in detail but in oblique language. but there is no misunderstanding their nature. walt is aroused to an intense passion by jeroen, during which he handles him roughly, so that in their final meeting, jeroen is bruised and suffering a painful wound on the shoulder where walt has bitten him. during this encounter, walt rapes jeroen, twice. jeroen could have easily avoided walt after their 2nd encounter, when walt first assaults him as walt is clearly anxious to keep his abuse of the boy from the other soldiers. why jeroen keeps seeking walt out is a mystery of the human heart and not explainable, by me anyway. what the film leaves out is the aftermath: the nightmares, the dejection, the frantic search throughout amsterdam on the chance of finding walt, for jeroen loved walt, and nothing could shake that.
