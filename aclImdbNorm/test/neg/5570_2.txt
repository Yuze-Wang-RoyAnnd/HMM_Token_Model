i only watched this because i saw a couple of good reviews for this, so i was expecting at the very least a half-way cheesy movie. toybox doesn't even deliver that. there are so many problems with this flick, that i don't even know where to start, so i will list a couple of main issues (once again, spoiler warning. just read them, it'll save you the trouble of watching this later).<br /><br />one, this movie starts out with, and often mentions, the mythical folklore of both celeste noir (a witch, who the main character claims she is the reincarnation of), and the mid-folker (or something like that, an evil man with a big smile who cuts people open with hooks and sells their innards in pies). i liked that, it was a cute concept, anything to do with pies is simply enjoyable. but then you watch the movie and it's all about this idiot girl and her boyfriend (and what was the deal with him? was he psychic? did he have powers? why did he keep seeing visions that even the so called 'witch' didn't notice??), and them meeting their insane family. not really insane, they just argue a lot. that's what most of this movie is, arguing, and they barely touch on the supposed myth ever again except in a couple of confusing scenes that you can't make heads or tails of.<br /><br />in one scene, berenice (the main witch-related character) wanders off and does some sort of ritual by candle light. it seemed rather important, but absolutely nothing happened after she did it, it just wasted more of my time.<br /><br />and who the hell was that guy with his dog? you see him walking towards the house from the very start of the movie with that evil red-eyed dog, and then he finally gets there and gets killed? what the hell?? was he the mid-folker? was his dog possessed? did someone kill the dog? they never really showed that. also, any scene involving the vicar was completely pointless and only served to weakly explain the lame ending. it was like they had all these interesting character ideas and they all went nowhere! the boyfriend, who obviously had some sort of powers but never explains them. the grandmother, who appeared to also have some sort of witch powers, but never used them. the vicar, who...ok, never mind, there really was no point for his existence at all. and then there was berenice and her stupid amulet. could she really do magic, or did she just use it to reflect light and blind people? this was a complete waste of time, and the only reason i give it two stars at all is because a) berenice is kinda cute, and b) it mentioned pies. save yourself the money of renting this and dear god don't even think about buying it, unless wasting money is a new fad.
