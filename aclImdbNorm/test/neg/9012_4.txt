what a travesty of movie ratings injustice - a 2.1 on the imdb scale as i write this. folks, this is a lot closer to a 3.0, i'll even go out on a limb and say 4.0 where i've put it. come on - how can you have a movie about a net of static electricity surrounding the earth and alien amorphic cell structures, and not give it at least a 4.0 for creativity? then you've got all that great dialog like - "dave, look at the composition of this mud." you know, i don't think they ever got back to that mud. no matter, this is the kind of flick that 'z' movie diehards live for, and i can now rest easy. actually, i saw this quite a few years ago without the proper appreciation for it, along with corman titles like "attack of the giant leeches " and "the wasp woman". i don't know what the fascination might be, but to quote a character from the film - "whatever it is, it works fast!"<br /><br />back to that alien amorphic cell structure - i liked the idea of a third element competing against your standard red and white blood cells. when astronaut john corcoran (michael emmet) returned from the dead, i had visions of a scene that might have been a precursor to 1979's "alien", but that was not to be. instead, budget restrictions limit the picture to a de-feathered big bird knock off, even though that concept was still almost a decade away. who knows where one idea leaves off and picks up with another? <br /><br />look, this is not that bad. not that good, but not that bad. anytime you can hook up crash landing astronauts with alien beings committed to taking over the earth, you've got a winning combination. throw in the cheesy monster factor and you're on your way. just remember - "a wounded animal that large isn't good".
