i would be one of the few people who owns a copy of this classic. but i dont only own 1, i actually own 2. its that good.<br /><br />well, when i say good, i mean bad. but i will try to do a thorough review. i even watched 'born a ninja' which one of the other reviewers here mentioned, to compare it to this. and born a ninja is actually worse, but not quite as funny.<br /><br />and is this ever funny. everything about this movie is poor. everything. the plot is absolutely stuffed (note the 'you'll need to keep me alive if you want to know where to find your wife'). every action sequence is stuffed too. our hero danton is more than a hero; he can stab people with twigs, take 3 bullets in the heart at 50 cm away without even bleeding, and tie a rope up to a tree which, when an enemy steps on it, ties a knot around the enemies leg, picks him up, and throws him 50 metres into a bunch of spikes.<br /><br />the acting is so bad it is impossible to comment on it, but it should have you rolling, especially dantons 'jump out of the ground and growl at the bad guy'. oh yes, and the bad guys: somehow, it seems they resurrect themselves 5 times each in the movie. perhaps it's just that there weren't enough actors, but in a movie of this calibre? i doubt that.<br /><br />the 'plot' is about how danton was a soldier in the vietnam war, and now his colonel is hunting real people for training for his mercenaries. the colonel just happens to pick up danton, then danton fights back. this is just the excuse for a rambo clone, with most of the movie being danton slaughtering soldiers. and i really cant explain the plot any more cos there is nothing else to the movie. it still rocks though.<br /><br />what else could be wrong you ask? dont get me started. hand grenades which actually go off at the actors' feet because the explosion is the size of a match.scenes where there are 5 people chasing danton, then the camera cuts away and back and there are 7. the way that every time danton loads the grenade launcher he is against the same background even though he is in completely diffrent locations. and the worst part is when danton pushes the plastic boulders onto the enemies, and one enemy is completely untouched by the boulders, so he doesn't know what to do so he half heartedly dies without even being touched. it's ridiculous!!!<br /><br />but funny. very, very funny. this is one of the few movies i can thoroughly recommend to everybody, cos if you dont find it funny, you are 1 in a million. and for the rest of us it's magic.
