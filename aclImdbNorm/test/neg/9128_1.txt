koyaanisquatsi is simply the best film i've ever seen. it's a masterpiece where everything is at the right place. some scenes are not "nice" or "beautiful", but the camera never peeks or intrudes. this is exactly what's happening here. the camera is used to intrude, to disgrace and to ridicule. there is no magic flow here, no sense of greatness or respect. instead some scenes are cobbled together without greater purpose or plan. the music is disturbing. just as i rated koyaanisquatsi the best film ever made, this one is the worst. it's a "pure" movie, too, but this is the negative form, exactly that which should *not* be done.
