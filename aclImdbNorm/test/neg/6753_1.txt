this so called movie is horrible! the actors cannot act. there is no plot. i believe they need to start from scratch and film again. i hope that they can correct the acting flaws in this movie. i would like to see the trailer after they shoot it again. maybe there is hope for it. i am not out to hurt feelings but i believe high school kids can do a better job. the wardrobe could have been much better. sorry, but this just did not do it for me. i normally enjoy the trailers from this site but... this one i cannot find entertaining. i hope they take criticism well because i believe they will get much much more from others in regards to this film.
