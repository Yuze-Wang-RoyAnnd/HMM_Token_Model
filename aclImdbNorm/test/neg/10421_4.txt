what is it about the french? first, they (apparently) like jerry lewis a lot more than the us does. second, they (seem) to like edgar allan poe's work more than just about anyone else does. it's got to be the "beaudelaire effect".<br /><br />don't get me wrong...i'm a poe fan myself. but this trilogy manages to make three of poe's below-average stories into...well, i'm not sure what they're made into.<br /><br />"toby dammit" is a fine fellini film, but it has nothing to do with poe's story, at least in terms of theme. it's enjoyable on the first viewing. terence stamp does a good job with an interesting role. however, it has nothing whatsoever to do with poe or spirits of the dead.<br /><br />"metzergenstein" is a big mess. how did vadim's films get produced? it's just awful...not even up to amateur film school standards. depending on the dvd menu you have, try to skip it and save your time.<br /><br />"william wilson" is actually the segment that is most faithful to poe's work. it does not have much style, though, even if it includes the strangest snowball fight i think that i have ever seen on film. (it looks like the boys are throwing tissues, or maybe handkerchiefs, that have been rolled up into balls.) <br /><br />my advice is to skip "metzergenstein", watch "william wilson", and then, if you're a fellini fan (i'm not) keep "toby dammit" on while you cook dinner or make a snack.
