this story had a good plot to it about four elderly men that share a deadly secret concerning a young woman that they met 50 years ago. after all this time, the young woman returns to seek revenge on the men. this story occasionally made me nod off during the movie in the middle of tiring elevator music and the ever so consistent thunder storms. but it is well worth the wait in the end when we find out just who the mystery woman is that keeps plaguing the old men in their dreams and interfering in a young man's life. the most of what i liked in this film was the suspense in which the young woman appears to the men just before their deaths. the special effects were something. every time i heard her call out to them i would think "not that face again." but it was a good movie, i just wish that the pace was not as slow or the acting not as tiresome. and what i also liked about the movie was the flashback of the 20's, very authentic as well as the costumes being original.
