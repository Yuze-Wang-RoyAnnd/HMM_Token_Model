this film was bad. i believe elton (or is it mike) wong starred in it. anyway it was the wong that didn't have that goofy grin and looks meaner. he plays a man who is hit over the head and suffers brain damage. he recovers and gets revenge. gordon liu is the only one worth seeing in this film, but he doesn't get to do much. but what little he does seems to make the<br /><br />others pale in comparison. also, the film has some cheesy rubber hawk that the wong guy controls. this film is not worth renting or buying.
