this movie is a pile of rubbish , and to try and base it the first is just a farce , the main thing that let it down for me was the usage of the one liners out of the first one , which once said by classic actors such as sam elliot can not be reproduced in any way , i mean when dalton phones wade in the 1st , and he ends the call with stay cool that was great , but when the chump rings the dea agent back home and he ends the call with stay cool it doesn't have the same ring now really does it , there are other ones but i cant be bothered to post em up , but i hope u get my drift ,they should of named this roadhouse wannabe ..........
