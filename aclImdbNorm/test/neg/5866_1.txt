man were do i start,everything about this cartoon from the episodes,to the stories,script, an animation is to me the stupidest,dummest and most annoying cartoon that walt disney television animation ever created and made ,im so glad that both toon disney (2006) and disney channel to stop airing it in the u.s. as of this may 2008.<br /><br />believe me it's a wise choice to skip this out cast and black cloud of a cartoon,if you watch it don't say i did not alert an warn you.<br /><br />your in for a boring and down right dull and confusing time,i wish and pray i never even saw 1 episode of this cartoon buzz lightyear of star command. if i could i would have the part of my brain removed that remembers watching it,yes it is and was that bad.
