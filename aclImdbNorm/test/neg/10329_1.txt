this movie is #1 in the list of worst movies i have ever seen, with "lessons for an assassin" on the #2 spot.<br /><br />the acting is lousy (sorry, sandra bullock, but even your performance was horrible!), the music score could have come from a bad x-rated movie and the story was downright ridiculous. it had this in common with a typical action movie: the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of one-syllable words. but contrary to the average action movie, there was no real action in this one. boring.<br /><br />the only reason i continued watching it was in the hopes that at one point, there would be at least one interesting scene in this movie ...<br /><br />thumbs down on this one.
