i'm watching this film as i write this. it's about 45 minutes into the film and there's been so much back and forth and empty drama, i don't quite see where it's going. no facts, just enough to leave you making assumptions. the acting of main daughter is painful. how did this ever get made??? not the best of lifetime films.
