perhaps i'm just a simple person, but i prefer movies that somehow make me care about the people in them. i couldn't care less about anyone in this movie. this was supposed to be a comedy? maybe the humor was too subtle for me (all the way down to the nano-level). the thing about it is, it missed on so many things. there were characters that could have been funny, but they weren't. there were characters that you could have liked, but you didn't. for instance, the guy who thought the beatles ripped off his songs. there was so much potential there, but all he did was talk like a beatle and complain about how they ripped him off. haha. and the previous poster talked about the 'i am the walrus' scene like it was special. what? he played 'i am the walrus' on an old piano and sang out of tune. is there an inside joke there? it sure stank at face value. this movie has the feel to me of a movie people say they like because it sounds 'intellectual' or 'hip' to say you like it, that you get the whole metaphysical art/garbage message the artist is expressing. if you want to be entertained, stay away.
