my friend recommended this movie to me.is should have known not to watch it because my friend is kind of a video game nerd. but the name and the cover made it look good for some reason. i was so wrong. i mean first of all, what is up with their suits? and the acting! it seems like they got the people off barney. except for ben kingsley. and why was he even in this movie? did he think it was a comedy! but i have to say the special effects were pretty good. but that was like the only good thing in it. i mean seriously, the movie is worse than pearl harbor. and thats actually an understatement. everyone must have thought "oh i am getting paid so it doesn't matter if its the worst movie in the world." i would understand why someone would make this kind of movie if they were directing, acting, producing, writing, and getting their hopeless life best friend to do filming and editing. probably one of the worst sci-fi movies ever. one truly jacked up film
