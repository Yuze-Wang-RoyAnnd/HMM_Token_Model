clearly this film was made for a newer generation that may or may not have had an inkling of charles bukowski's work. the autobiographical henry chinaski character in bukowski's stories was brilliantly portrayed to perfection by mickey rourke in 1987's 'barfly', also starring faye dunaway. anyone who has seen 'factotum' should certainly see 'barfly' to get a better look at how bukowski wrote his character. 'factotum' lacks the greasy seediness of bukowski's screenplay and the fearless hopelessness of his loner hero. the inadvertent humor that bubbles through in the dark desperation of chinaski's misadventures doesn't work for dillon as it did so admirably for the overweight filthy blood-soaked rourke. rourke's character makes the pain and pleasure of the previous night's misbehavior a place-setting for yet another grueling ugly day in the life of a drunken misanthropic unknown writer. dillon's character misses these marks in favor of a strutting, handsome, relatively clean-looking wanna-be writer that scarcely passes for any moment in that of chinaski's story. dunaway's sleazy heroine wanda is the perfect complement to the ne'er-do-well henry. the women in 'factotum' can't hold a candle to dunaway's 'distressed goddess' and the use of more profane sexual subject matter in 'factotum' proves to be more of a crude distraction than a tip of the hat to bukowski's raw and unapologetic portrayals of dysfunctional relationships. i was stunned at how many of the exact same scenes were used in 'factotum' (marisa tomei buying all the stuff and charging it to the old man is an exact rip-off from 'barfly').<br /><br />if you want to see the best bukowski stories on film, see 'barfly' and 'love is a dog from hell' (which also goes by the title 'crazy love').
