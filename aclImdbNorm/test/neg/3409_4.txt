first off just to say i didn't get the edition i thought i would - i chose the italian version over the r2, but what actually arrived was a uk release from 1998 - claiming to be a special edition - i never knew there was a uk dvd release - but the promised biogs were not actually on the disc - just a couple of duff trailers. anyway - as to the film itself - just as i was recovering from "night train murders" my second genital mutilation thriller turns up in the same month - this time in (an italian) uk nubile schoolgirls are being offed and teacher fabio testi - (unhappily) married but nailing one of his students - becomes the main suspect. joachim fuchsberger is the detective on the case. sorry to say i was less than entranced. it was watchable but more than equally miss able,and aside from the aforementioned gruesome nature of the crime, the "surprise" killing of cristina galbo which was actually "spoilt" by the dvd cover telling me about it - grrrrrr!!!! and a surprise twist that cast the "victims" in a new light - i thought this was very routine. itwont put me off the two "sequels" though. with karin (hannibal brooks)baal and camille (i spit on your grave") keaton.
