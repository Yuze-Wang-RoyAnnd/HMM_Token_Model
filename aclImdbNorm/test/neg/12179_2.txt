secret service agent jay killion (charles bronson) has been assigned to protect the president-elect's wife, the new first lady (jill ireland). she is a very difficult woman and killion has his hands full. she is the victim of numerous assassination attempts, all directed by the president's chief of staff, who wants the first lady dead. this movie insults your intelligence with not only the story line, but also with the lack of realistic locations. for example, in the scene depicting the inaugural parade, the first lady is in a rolls royce convertible with agent killion and without the president. also, we know what washington, dc, is like weather wise in january, and not only is everybody "top coat less", you can even see some palm trees in the 70 degree and sunny weather! (obviously filmed in hollywood, not washington, dc). this movie is a joke. it is not worth your time.
