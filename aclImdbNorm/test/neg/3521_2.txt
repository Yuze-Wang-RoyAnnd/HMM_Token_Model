usually a movie that starts bad stays bad in a monotonically descending pattern. this bad movie started to seem to get better before going into a steep dive. the acting, save for the male antagonist, was awful. the plot was essentially a set up for the final main scene, which is probably good as performance art, but it was wasted in this movie. not sure why this movie was made.
