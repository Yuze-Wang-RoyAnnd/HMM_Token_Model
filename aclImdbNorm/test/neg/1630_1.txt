i saw this one on the late, late, late, late show back when mst3k was just a twinkle in joel hodgson's eye. i had the privilege of seeing it without knowing exactly how bad it would be. i didn't know that a woman with an arrow in her chest could run "to the ends of the earth" in about an hour and a half (thank god her father gave such specific directions) and then take days to make it back to the castle with help. i didn't know that a sword wielding barbarian-type could run into the forest and create a hanglider and flash powder bombs in under 30 seconds. i had no idea how disjointed a movie could be.<br /><br />it's a bad thing children, a very bad thing. if you enjoy bad movies, go for it.
