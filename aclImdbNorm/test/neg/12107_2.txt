one can only sit in utter amazement at this mess of a film and be amused at some of the raves people have bestowed upon it. the biggest problem seems to be the director's inability to make up his mind as to whether it's black comedy, farce or a combination of both. it meanders all over the place in search of direction and has some utterly embarrassing performances that might be better suited to bad sitcom. what a shame to see the talented dianne wiest's comic talents squandered and the ever annoying jane birkin is so over the top she's more bothersome than usual.<br /><br />perhaps a lot of the positive criticism is due to the "quirky french" nature of the film - therefore, it's labeled "smart" or "genius." it's neither. instead it's bad tripe that leaves a rather rancid after-taste. merchant-ivory should stick to the serious stuff as they certainly have no comprehension of comedy.
