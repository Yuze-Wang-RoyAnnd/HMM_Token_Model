what a sucky movie. this is without a doubt a low-class b movie. the german elite stormtroopers assault russian bunkers en masse like an old ww1 battle. the acting is mediocre, the plot thin and threadlike. it's hard sometimes to follow where it's going. the action sequences are pretty worthless (when it shows any), except for the fact that they do use authentic equipment/vehicles from ww2. this is in no way on the same level as "saving pvt. ryan" or "platoon". lots of worthless attempts at character development, which lead nowhere. old theme good officer/bad officer that's highly predictable. even the action sequences look like a 12yr old kid set them up. i could have directed better. too bad this is the same guy that did "das boot (the boat)", because that was a dang good movie. he must have partied too much after that success because he sure lost his touch when it came to this film. i bought it on dvd, better to rent it instead.
