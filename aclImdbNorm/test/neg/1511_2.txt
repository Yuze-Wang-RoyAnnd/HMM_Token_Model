(as a note, i'd like to say that i saw this movie at my annual church camp, where the entire youth group laughed at it. i bought it when i saw it on a shelf one year later, if only for the humor i derived from a bad attempt at making an evangelical movie.)<br /><br />lay it down falls short of many movie fans' expectations on several different planes. most of the problems lie within the impersonal acting. regardless of the nice cars in the film, or the truth in christ's sacrifice for you, as a movie and witnessing tool, lay it down hardly delivers. <br /><br />most good opinions of the movies are supported by christians agreeing with the message. while it's easy for a christian to agree with the points delivered, the audience hardly ever witnesses life outside a clich'e. the fighting scene between ben and his brother is horribly dubbed. and there are at least three blatant typos in the subtitles.<br /><br />i encourage anyone to watch the movie a second time with the director's commentary on. it really helps you understand just why the movie was written how it was. the director's views on secular society are practically opposite of what would cater to a movie-goer's needs: he shows a pedantic understanding of nonchristians, as well as some points of religious conflict; most of the editing, he admits, was rushed, but "satisfactory"; he thought the over-used transitions and themes to be effective; and was completely happy with the acting. <br /><br />he also inserted motifs that he was rather proud of: -all (read: most) of the names are significant. ben destin = "been destined", gus pelman = "gospel man", nicky d = nicodemus. -the car doing donuts is symbolic of the circling nothingness that is a life without christ. -when ben leaves on pete's motorcycle, he crosses his crutches to form a "cross".<br /><br />i'm not making any of those up. he throws around things like this in between saying while street racers and the like "blow their brains out with guns", and how "god is in control when your born and when your die". yes, that was not a typo. he really says that.<br /><br />i have (little) forgiveness reserved for this movie. the "cool cars" and "good message" don't do jack to make this movie good. however, the movie was made from a group of unprofessional individuals on a budget less than 1/100th of "the fast and the furious's", and the time limit was unforgiving. with that in mind, i give it a score of 2/10, instead of the 1/10 i so dearly think it deserves.
