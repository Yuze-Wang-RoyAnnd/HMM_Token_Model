i was suckered in by the big names. rob lowe, mario van peebles, burt reynolds, and the fact that it was an independent film. unbelievably slow beginning: 35 minutes, two dreary songs and a botched rip off. i didn't care about the characters, and the plot never tempted me to even pretend it could be realistic. i can't believe this is what makes it to the screen. i loved watching this film because it felt so good when it was over.
