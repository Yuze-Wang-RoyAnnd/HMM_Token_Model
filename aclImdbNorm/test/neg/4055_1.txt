whenever i see a video like this, i have to ask myself how it was financed. hbo or showtime or whatever must pay for the production company to go through the motions -- to hire someone who may or may not actually speak english to get high and hammer out something approaching a plot, to pay strippers with terrifying boob jobs to bounce up and down on grossly waxed dudes' torsos, to find people to design and light sets, to purchase the rights to cheesy techno music, etc. but i have to imagine this has to be a vanity project for whoever's serving as executive producer... he had to have nailed all of those girls, right? and bro's not wrong about the "spanish looking" girl, but to call the cops "stunning" is awfully generous. in fact, i'd go so far as to call them something much closer to "hideous," or "fugly." watching these women writhe around -- sometimes *clearly* high on pain killers -- was so far from erotic that my testicles actually ascended inside of my body. gross.<br /><br />why waste time with this when there's so much freely available hardcore porn on the internet? i wonder whether the popularization of internet video will slowly kill the softcore video industry... one can only hope, right?
