a film about an interesting and sensitive period of history, filmed in beautiful surroundings, managed to present an appallingly trivial and clich'ed production, grossly clumsy script, poor continuity, intrusive slushy music, sugary casting, and pallid acting. <br /><br />it was a toss up between the script and the acting as to which was worse. the script probably won - the historical background, backstory and character descriptions were spelt out in painful detail in the dialogue. .. actually words can't describe quite how bad this film is.<br /><br />in a pre-release screening there was a massive exodus from about thirty minutes in. at about an hour many of those who remained were laughing loudly. i should add i am a francophile, i am fascinated by canada, and love historical film. this really was a one off.
