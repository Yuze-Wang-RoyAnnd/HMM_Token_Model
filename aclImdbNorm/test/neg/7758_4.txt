1960's kid show with ex-vaudevillians playing handy men for hire. as you can expect they are a disaster at everything they do. over the course of the 11 minute episodes (leaving 4 minutes for commercials in the 15 minute time slot), they do things like set up a fence between warring neighbors, help a magician on stage and deal with a found trunk and wallet.<br /><br />growing up i had never run across this show (which appears to have been shot in new york). i thought i had run heard of or seen a most of the children's shows from the period either through having watched them as a kid or viewed them at nostalgia conventions. until alpha video released it on dvd i had been completely unaware if its existence.<br /><br />the show plays like the three stooges mixed with abbott and costello as done by people aping the routines. (indeed one of the pair claims to have created the legendary "slowly i turned..." routine that abbott and costello perfected). its not bad, but its really not good either since everything seems watered down. the timing is often off (though that maybe due to bad direction) and the jokes were recycled years before the show first ran. odds are you've seen it all before . on the plus side its the type of thing that would be perfect to introduce very young kids to the magic of vaudeville style comedy, however its going to be trying for parents to sit through even with the short episodes.<br /><br />for nostalgia junkies only. everyone else should look to seeing an abbott and costello or three stooges original.
