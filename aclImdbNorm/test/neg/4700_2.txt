it seems incredible that the same decade which brought star wars to the silvery screen disgorged such unutterable tripe as this and many other 'adventure' movies. i am reminded of the similarly lavish, but equally wretched 'ashanti' outlined elsewhere.<br /><br />whatever motivated a-list actors to sign-on for such wastes of celluloid is frankly beyond this writer. they must have been very, very desperate. to be perfectly candid, roger moore's appearance in any movie is the kiss of death. although extremely handsome in his youth, his entire acting career has been predicated upon an ability to raise one eyebrow. every emotion from a to b is conveyed by this simple stratagem. his were the dog-days of james bond. lee marvin on the other hand has featured in some very worthy outings, perhaps most memorably 'paint your wagon' and 'the dirty dozen'. he has a comic streak, but he is much better when he plays it straight.<br /><br />the excellent ian holm is a throwaway, hardly recognisable blacked-up as a mute african. everyone else just turned up for their pay-cheques.<br /><br />the only plausible and watchable element is the german cruiser. it looks like a very large model. but it is believably massive and appears authentic - as do its crew. the rest isn't even hokum. the childish comedy jars with the brutality and violence in a story that meanders clumsily about, as if the script itself had had too many whiffs of lee marvin's gin. here is a director who simply doesn't know where he's going. there are hints of 'the african queen', a snatch from 'the pride & the passion', 'gold', and one or two other rip-offs from movies who's titles don't come readily to mind.<br /><br />strangely, i have seen it 3 times, each occasion it has been shown on television when i have been laid low with a cold or the flu. perhaps that is influencing my judgement - but not much.<br /><br />compare it with any indiana jones movie and you will see what i mean.<br /><br />i have given it two stars; one for the battleship and the other because it finally comes to an end, though heaven knows it takes long enough to do that.<br /><br />time for another lemsip, i think.
