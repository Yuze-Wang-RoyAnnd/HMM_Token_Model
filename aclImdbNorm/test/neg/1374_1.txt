it doesn't take balls to make-fun of retarded people. having to listen to mencia insist that he is brave to make "retard" jokes is intolerable. also, it doesn't take balls to bite off of the chapelle show. the racial game-shows, the racial olympics, it seems like a lot of the skits are merely reworked chapelle show skits, that are just way less funny. <br /><br />but the most irksome thing in the show is his insistence that he is just marching to the beat of his own drum, when he is actually marching to the beat of many over-worked, over-done drums that have been drummed many times.<br /><br />i hate this show. i hate that it presents itself as a voice for latin america.<br /><br />and no carlos, i am not trying to censore you. if people like it, then keep it on. but i personally think that it's a bad show.
