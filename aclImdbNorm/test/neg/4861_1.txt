i would have liked to put 0.5 but unfortunately i can't. who can write so bad scripts (i saw the movie five seconds and knew the "bad boy" would be sutherland - needed to pay his taxes, when you see how good he was in redford's movie, "ordinary people" and others ! -).<br /><br />though i don't like it, but i had no choice, i saw the movie in french, but i know that hearing the real voices of sheen, sutherland and hamilton would have not change things, except maybe making it more pitiful.<br /><br />what makes me sick is that people earn their living making this bad stuff (i forgot to speak about mr waterson, far away from the woody allen's movies he once used to play in).<br /><br />we had another movie on another french channel : a silly james bond with brosnan (i am not talking about the real bonds with connery(please it's the end of holidays, wake up !).
