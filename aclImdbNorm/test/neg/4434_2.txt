i supposed i was actually expecting a bollywood remake of "the fog", from the title, but this is actually more of a bollywood remake of "i know what you did last summer", with some elements of "scream", kind of, sort of, and not a very good one either. apart from a couple very entertaining song & dance numbers, this is pretty terrible. it's obviously got a decent budget & yet it's wasted on reheated leftovers that weren't that tasty to begin with. a young woman is threatened by a creepy guy to not enter a beauty contest, because he wants his sister to win (she, thankfully, doesn't look as creepy as her brother), but she enters anyway and wins, and of course the creepy guy comes after her, and is killed, after which comes a rousing game of "hide the body". of course, the body disappears and no one seems to know why, but someone knows, and they're waiting for the end to reveal a ridiculous plot twist. interspersed with all this tired rehash are a few nifty dance numbers, especially the celebratory dance number at the party for simran, the girl who won the beauty contest...it's highly colorful, it's well done & downright fun, and utterly wasted in this terrible film. i would much rather watch an old ramsay brothers movie than this piece of crap, although someone has deemed that these don't need to be made available, for the most part, which is a crime in itself. but not as big of a crime as this film. i took one for the team watching this one, so take my advice, don't bother. 2 out of 10.
