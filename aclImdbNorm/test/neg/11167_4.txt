this is a rip-off of already crappy hollywood movies like scream and i know what you did last summer. the story is classic, some high-school students tries a prank on the class' asthmatic misfit but something goes wrong. terribly wrong. when you watch the movie you know what'll happen before it happens all the time, not good if a movie tries to be scary. the actors are quite ok and the girls are cute (after all, they're asian) so i'll give it two out of five on the mojave'o'meter.
