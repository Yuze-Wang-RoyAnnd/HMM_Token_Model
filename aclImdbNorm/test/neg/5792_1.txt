this movie made my face hurt. i don't understand it...things just happened, inexplicably, and they usually resulted in someone bursting into a song and dance number. i don't understand how people can laud this film with praise. there are b-movies, and then there are b-musicals, and then there is rockula.<br /><br />the songs made me want to run headlong into a wall. the only saving grace is that one of the musical explosions turns out to be a musical video, which eases the pain, yet still fails to justify why it needed to exist. the most frightening section of the film is toni basil's creep-dance that accompanies her weird song. but on the bright side, she can manages to find the notes that she is looking for, unlike pop music sensations rockula (aka rapula) and mona...wow, can we say tone deaf. so if you want to question life for about 90 minutes, see this film. if you hate your life, then buy it.
