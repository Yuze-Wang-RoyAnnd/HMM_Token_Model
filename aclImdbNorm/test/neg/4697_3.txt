i just got back from seeing, "comedian". it was...alright. it kept me looking at the screen. its just not the type of thing i like to go pay $7 to see.<br /><br />now don't get me wrong, it'd make a great hbo feature. if this were something i was watching on tv, i'd be hooked right in. it gives an amazing look at what comics go through before and after getting on stage. it will interest anyone who likes watching comics.<br /><br />but when i go to the movies, i like to be entertained. i'm not there to be educated. now i know what its like for jerry seinfeld before he goes out on stage....great. but truthfully, i'd rather just laugh at his jokes than worry about any of that.<br /><br />one more thing: with the bad attitude onry adams has; i'd expect to see him taking my order from burger king before i see his hbo special. he wasn't funny. he's the kind of person that you love to hate.
