pilot mitch macafee (jeff morrow) sees a ufo while test flying a plane--but nothing shows up on radar. then planes and ships start disappearing and reports of a ufo increase. it turns out it's a giant monster bird that is attacking and killing. but what is it and why is it here? <br /><br />this has all the right elements for a classic. it has an actually pretty entertaining script--i was never really bored. the acting is good (for a 1950s monster movie). morrow doesn't overdo the macho hero act and mara corday is quite good as the requisite female love interest. she's also strong and takes care of herself--even though she is off getting food and coffee for everyone all during the movie. the problem here is the monster. dear god--it's terrible! it looks like a deranged turkey! it has a long neck, a hilariously stupid beak, some teeth, a few strands of hair on its head and claws. and--oh yes--it squawks! not roaring--squawking! the actors had no idea what it looked like--it was added after production. actors morrow and corday were horrified when they finally saw it in a theatre. morrow said his audience burst out laughing and he left the theatre quickly before the movie ended! producer sam katzman was responsible for this. he wanted to save money and gave the world the stupidest monster ever. and you can see the wires moving it too! this gets 4 stars only because morrow and corday are so good and the script is well done. it gets no stars for the pathetic monster--wait till you see it attack what is obviously a toy train! worth a look if you're a horror fan to see what has to be the stupidest monster ever.
