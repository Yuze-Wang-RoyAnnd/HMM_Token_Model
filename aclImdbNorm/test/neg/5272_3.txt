kevin spacey is my favorite actor of all time, he is without a doubt on other's lists as well when it comes to great actors. he even pulled off a good irish accent in ordinary decent criminal as well. but kevin spacey, as a mafia leader? or even a burglar? i'm not so sure he could go that far. the movie to me just didn't make any sense and the some of the story just didn't feel solved to me.<br /><br />i know once again that imdb is going to make me write ten more lines. but i'm not so sure on what i could say about this movie because i am still trying to figure it out. silly, isn't it? but i'm pretty sure that more than a few of you imdb users have been in the same predicament as i am in right now where you just want to say a line or two about a movie, but now you have to do ten lines? wow, that should do it. :d <br /><br />3/10
