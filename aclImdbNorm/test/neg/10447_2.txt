i was enticed into watching shark hunter by the comments posted on imdb. the movie was bad but the shark was cool blah blah blah. so i rented it. bad idea. this movie was bad on so many levels that i'm glad that i had the option to fast forward. the shark itself is ok. it's appearance is decent and it is the only thing saving this movie from getting a 1, (i gave it a 2). the acting is incredibly bad and the dialogue is just as deplorable. i wasn't expecting much but i was continually surprised by this suckfest. antonio sabato jr. is some kind of biologist or scientist or something, i wasn't really paying attention. he goes down with the expendable crew of this submarine to find out what happened to this underwater station that the shark took out of course. by the way, all the scenes that show someone working underwater are not underwater. first of all, if they are just going down to find out what happened to this station, what's with all the huge tranquilizer darts and the harpoons and stuff. are these things that you normally carry with you when investigating a accident. the shark theory was advanced by antonio while on the way so it not like they went in knowing what they were up against. antonio and this young college student, horrible actress by the way, just jump to the controls of the sub when the sub is in trouble. what is with that? unless everyone is getting some kind of sub training before leaving high school i find this a little silly. the director seems to think that if crew members are working in the background then it is a good idea to put someone welding in the background. metal crafting is very important when your on a sub i guess. anyway i could go on but i've said too much already. bottom line: go to your local video store, rent this video and then destroy it. then send email asking imdb to remove all record of this movie from their site. all memory and evidence of this movie must be destroyed. we can do it if we work together.
