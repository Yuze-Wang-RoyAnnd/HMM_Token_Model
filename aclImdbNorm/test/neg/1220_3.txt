the jaws rip off is the trashiest of the all the italian 'genres', and director joe d'amato is second only to the great jess franco in the trash film production stakes. put the two together and what do you get? a gigantic piece of trash, of course. unfortunately it's not trash in the good sense of the word either, as deep blood delivers more in boredom than it does in hilarity. to the film's credit, it does actually attempt something bordering on a plot; but to take said credit away from the film - the plot is rubbish. it has something to do with a group of friends taking of an oath (of friendship) and then some indian curse that manifests itself into a shark. or at least i think that's what was going on. anyway, the majority of the film is padded out with boring dialogue and 'drama', and the shark itself - which lets not forget, is the only thing we really want to see - finds itself in merely a cameo role. or not even that since most the shark is actually stock footage! despite being a trash genre, there are actually a lot of fun jaws rip-offs; but with this one, joe d'amato makes it clear that he couldn't be bothered to even try, and the result is what must be the worst italian shark movie of all time. avoid this dross.
