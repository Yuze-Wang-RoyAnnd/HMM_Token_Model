'northfork' is what is wrong with indie films. for all of their hard-edged commentary and attacking big subjects studios won't, this is the sacrifice we make. for nearly two hours i was subjected to the torture and pain of a film that starts by wandering like a blind man in a new place and ends without covering any new ground and thankfully dies.<br /><br />there are parallel stories that detail a dying town and a dying boy. two men dressed in black (one of them james woods) must coerce the remaining inhabitants of northfork to leave before a dam opens up and floods the town. the other story has a boy returned to the priest (nick nolte) that gave him to the parents. he is dying and is visited, i guess, by angels. among them anthony edwards with bizarre spectacles and daryl hannah in a bizarre costume reminding me of the pirate shirt from seinfeld.<br /><br />though this is the "plot," it is not what the film is about. the film is about nothing. it does nothing, says nothing, goes nowhere, and has nothing interesting to show. perhaps by design, more likely an after-effect of the pretentious, surreal, david lynch wannabe - we're an important artsy film can't you see - style of direction. the entire movie is filtered through a gray, bleak backdrop that, i suppose, fits a film about death. instead, it simply makes the film that much harder to watch.<br /><br />if you want to see a film about men in black, see either 'men in black' films, neither too impressive but compared to 'northfork' they are lifted to 'citizen kane' status. if you want to see a film about a boy dying watch 'lorenzo's oil.' if you want to see a film that has the destruction of a town through water watch 'o brother, where art thou?' if you want to watch a film better than 'northfork,' there are hundreds. if you want to watch a film that is worse, there are only a handful. 0* out of ****
