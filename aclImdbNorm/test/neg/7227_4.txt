if daphne du maurier had set rebecca in 1950s san francisco, it might very well resemble this uptight, highly unusual noir from robert wise. valentina cortese plays a concentration camp survivor who steals the identity of a dead woman and insinuates herself into the life of richard basehart (who happens also to be the guardian of the dead woman's son)...it's absurd and over-the-top but also topflight entertainment. cortese is terrific, slowly falling apart as she realizes the mistake she's made. basehart is fine if a bit bland...although the lighting toward the end makes him appear very menacing. fay baker makes a very good mrs. danvers-like caretaker. wise is a fine director and he keeps things moving at a pretty brisk clip. he also stages a now classic out of control car crash with cortese (or at least a stunt cortese) at the wheel.
