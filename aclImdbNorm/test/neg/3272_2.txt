this movie has one of the worst lead characters ever. i say this because he is made out to be the hero when, in my opinion, everything he does in the whole movie screws up people's lives and causes problems. he can do nothing right, yet the movie makes him seem like the cool dude everyone should be looking up to. he has temper tantrums at all the wrong times, he has all the wrong stances on things that end up making people mad at him and getting people killed, he is too nosy, too pushy, too macho, too assuming, makes all the wrong decisions and has no common sense. <br /><br />it's about a private detective hired by a successful painter to find the woman and son that he walked out on years ago. the detective finds the woman and what he thinks to be her son. however, all kinds of things happen to make this story full of crime, drama and twists. it's made for tv, what do you expect?<br /><br />anyhow, the movie is fairly entertaining. johnny depp is very young in this one and has an awful 80's haircut. he chews gum and tosses a soccer ball around for about 5 minutes and that is all we get to see of him.<br /><br />for some reason, the out of print vhs version of this sells for $40 in online auctions. it must be for johnny depp collectors only. it couldn't be because of the plot. it couldn't be.<br /><br />
