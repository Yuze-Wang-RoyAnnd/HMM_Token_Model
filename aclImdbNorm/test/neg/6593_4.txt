this is based on michael's life from 1983/4 till 2004. flex alexander did a good performance but looked nothing like michael. i feel michael was portrayed as a stupid person which i don't believe he was (even though he trusted the wrong people at times). i thought flex alexander looked chinese when they made michael look white. i think latoya should of been portrayed in this, she was always pictured with her brother in the 80's. i never thought any of the supporting cast looked like their counterparts. there were some things that were inaccurate lisa-marie presley's son looked about 4 in the wedding scene even though he was not yet 2 when lisa and michael got married. also when michael says to his mother katherine he thinks he and debbie should marry if she is carrying his child, it was katherine's idea for the two to get married.
