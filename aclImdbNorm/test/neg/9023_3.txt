while most of wayne's b efforts are entertaining in a fun way, this film is so sloppily edited and written, it is a dud. the first ten minutes alone show wayne and bandits in nighttime scenes intercut with stock footage obviously shot in the day. dwire plays a half white, half apache bandit with a heavy mexican accent and he cannot seem to pull off any nationality! i give this a 3.
