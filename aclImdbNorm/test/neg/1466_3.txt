hey, remember when hal hartley was brilliant? what a time that was. i'd say the book of life was when things really started going downhill, but i will say that at least he went uphill from this one. a movie that looks like it was filmed on someone's cell phone wouldn't have to be a bad thing if it was distinguished by an interesting story and dialog, but alas, those are missing, along with hartley's spare, quirky dialog. in their place is tedious exposition on themes of christian end of times and a trite story of a modern jesus in a quandary, packaged in a trying-to-be-hip modern world where everyone looks like someone out of a hal hartley movie. while it picks up a little in its second half, it's never enjoyable, or especially sensible. what the hell happened to you, hartley?
