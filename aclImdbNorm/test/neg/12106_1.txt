i don't even know where to start. i did not like it. it did not behave like a story and so much was injected into the movie (the pot brownies, the son was gay (?) the murder was justified, what possible reason could there be in the script for linda aka penelope to exist) that was never explained. it was all fluid spilled on a table and left dripping off the counter until it all made a big mess on the floor.<br /><br />why did vanessa redgrave make a five second cameo? why did diane wiest use her bullets over broadway character without the camp-fun? why was jane birkin in the storyline to begin with. the list is endless. the movie ended and we all looked at each other -- like -- did you understand any of this??<br /><br />i tell ya one thing, if i watched my long lost dad get murdered i certainly wouldn't be hugging the murderer. tell ya another thing, if "bob" broke up with "bob" what purpose did hiding the son in the closet have? was bob going to have sex with bob in front of the son? how did the murderer contact the son so easily? <br /><br />if this review sounds confused, it is because this was a waste of film, talent and time. what the heck did the dead shrink have to do with anything!!<br /><br />jezz, this is one of the worst films i have ever seen because it should have/could have been better, stronger and it should have made some kind of sense. any sense. instead we are given a watered down "diva" (the film from the 70s complete with a murder) and tired performances reading boring words from a script that is completely insane.<br /><br />by pass it folks. or maybe me and the rest of the people who reviewed this film are too stupid to understand it all -- i mean after all it is a french film.
