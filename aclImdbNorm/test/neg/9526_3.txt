as a person who knows the filmed ship and some other ships, too, i cannot see the movie as a movie, only. as a movie is has some great, wonderful shots of the ship, most of them done on an existing vessel - apart of the ones in the disaster scenes, of course, and a certain room under deck. but regarding the story and dialogs i only can call it big crap. nothing of that would happen like this on a real sailing vessel. no wonder, the film had bad impact on the existing ship - if i didn't know better, i wasn't tempted to do a sailing voyage for sure. definitely, for europeans i recommend to switch off once the ship ran aground. after that, the over-emotional, very american part begins which i couldn't bear. the pics are really, really great, no wonder in a ridley scott film, but if you can avoid listening to the text, it will become much better.
