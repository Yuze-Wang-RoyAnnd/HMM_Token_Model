i've watched a lot of tv through the years. so much, that when i start seeing new shows that basically seem like reruns of old shows, i get insulted. luckily, i am not too sensitive because all "hot properties" does is updates the cast (meaning make them sexier)of "designing women" and drops them in new york city instead of georgia.<br /><br />the jokes are more tv-14-ish, but it does not make the show any better. the only thing that this show has proved is that nicole sullivan is so good that she could have made a show like "my mother the car" a classic. her comic talents remind one of a modern day lucille ball--only funnier. unfortunately, the rest of the cast is flashy and sexy which might be good for some brainless soap, but they just aren't funny.<br /><br />fred
