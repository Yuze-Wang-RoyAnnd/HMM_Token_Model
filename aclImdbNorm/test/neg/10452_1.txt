sci-fi channel thinks this is sci-fi; it's a shame. big bugs, snakes, mythical beasties, on and on, they persist.<br /><br />some one at universal had the brains to include battlestar galactica (the new, good one) and firefly for a brief moment in their line up. i know they know they difference between total garbage and extremely high quality sci-fi.<br /><br />a few years back they were on about how they were going all high and mighty, making productions that were not just for us mere, lame-o trekkies. thanks so much, sci-fi! you know, you make movies so bad, even trekkies won't watch them, so you achieved your goal! fire serpent, ice spiders, manticore, larva etc.and a vast unrelenting crap-storm later, and they're still churning out just faster than the latest flu virus! how they do it is beyond my ken. why they do it, i just don't know. how they can ignore these reviews, comments, blogs and e-mails, i don't know either, but it's clear they don't think much of their audience or care about our opinions! they seem to think this is what sci-fi fans want! you would think one or two good productions with some sense would creep through when whoever green lights this junk is on vacation. at least they're employing the collection of misfit toys; many of the sci-fi movie of the week actors were in science fiction shows once and now need the cash. love you folks, and hope you get some better work!
