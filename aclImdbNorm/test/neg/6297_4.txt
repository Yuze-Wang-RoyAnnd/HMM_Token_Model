basically a road movie. the gay, transsexual, and other gender-bender themes are rather disturbing, particularly when the child is involved. you do have to hand it to the costume designers. as for the actors, the only one i was familiar with was terence stamp. i suppose it was a very good performance, out of his (or anyone's) normal range. the movie as a whole was shallow, just a vehicle for the clever, bitchy banter. all in all, i don' recommend this one.
