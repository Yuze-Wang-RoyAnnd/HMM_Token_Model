oh boy. where do i begin on this piece of slime? this is one of the few real high-budget films on my list that i've actually seen fit to give a 1 rating, and that's not for the production values, which are pretty high. this movie has absolutely no respect for the account in the bible, and treats the whole story as laughable fantasy. i could not recommend it to anyone, except to see how low as a society we have become...<br /><br />for the first thing, noah was absolutely not friends with lot. anyone who actually read genesis could tell you that abram was who they were thinking of. the writers were just trying to pad out the story with the whole sodom/gommorah subplot, and it seems out of place because it is. noah is treated as a prudish goofball ("you were kissing! you were kissing!") but at least it's a step up from voight's hilarious overacting in anaconda. <br /><br />however, these offenses pale in comparison to the heretical treatment of god in this movie. god is portrayed as a petty, incomprehesible being who changes his mind at the slightest whim. ("i'm one eternal perfect, but i can be wrong") what? where are they getting this from? this kind of god...no one should ever pay any attention to, much less worship, praise, or love. what the director's saying in this, i do not claim to know. i just know that a responsible treatment of noah's ark should not take such an easy way out. shame on these people.
