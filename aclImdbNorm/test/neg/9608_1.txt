it is really a shame that imdb doesn't let you give negative votes. this is the most hideously awful show ever foisted on the american public by our usually-likable neighbors to the north. the parents are a troglodyte and a neurotic hag. he is as charming as a well-used fire hydrant, with the same hygiene standards. she is a wax museum mannequin programmed with more neuroses than the entire cast of the view. the kids are non-entities if female and repulsive beyond belief if male, especially the title character. the boy is a serious contender for most insanely smug, self-satisfied, arrogant, and vain male character on disney, which is saying something. this show was obviously conceived as the anti-brady bunch, but it comes off as the anti-christ. and why is the photography so dark?
