sheba shayne (pam grier) receives a telegram informing her that her father may be in trouble. sheba, a private investigator and former cop, goes to her father's aid. but someone will stop at nothing to run her father out of business. an attempt to show their muscle goes awry and sheba's father is gunned down in cold blood. these guys have messed with the wrong woman.<br /><br />if i had to describe sheba baby, the best i can come up with is pam grier lite with some really bad acting. for a pam grier film, sheba baby is incredibly tame. it's nowhere near as violent as some of her earlier films. gone are the over-the-top images of pam placing a small revolver or razor blades in her afro. pilot (d'urville martin) and his crew can't hold a candle to some of the real villains pam faced in her previous movies. it's strictly by-the-numbers and almost has a made-for-tv feel. as for the bad acting, the baddies that pam faces off with are as unnatural sounding in their delivery as i've seen. as a result, characters like pilot don't come across as threatening as they should or need to for the movie to work.<br /><br />that's not to say there aren't moments or elements in sheba baby that i didn't enjoy (pam in a wetsuit and pam brandishing a spear gun), it's just that when compared with pam's other films like coffy, foxy brown, and even friday foster that the movie fails.<br /><br />one final observation - maybe i'm just more sensitive to these things post-9/11, but i don't remember a time, even in the security lax 70s, when you could take a suitcase full of guns on an airplane. when sheba flies to her father's aid, she's got an arsenal packed in her luggage!
