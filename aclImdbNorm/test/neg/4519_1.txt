this is absolutely nothing like the wwf and the 'attitude era' of the wwf. i have always been a dedicated wwf fan and i never took a glimpse of its competition. now, i rue the day that i wanted the wwf to take charge. at the least the wcw would try something new and radical all the time instead of keeping up as a mask of the actual intentions of the show and this holds true to ecw as well. the wwf has always been about hulk hogan, andre the giant, and other old wrestlers like so and the 'attitude era' only happened to catch up with the radical ideas of the competition. the wwe is the same trash as it was before the attitude era only dumbed down and demoralized. the wrestlers are terrible, the brand split is mind scrambling, and the story lines and stipulations are non-existent. the wwe is so bad that it ceases to even be a former shell of itself by pushing characters and wrestlers into the main event suddenly and by retaining barriers of creativity. sure, the show shakes the brains of sweet, innocent, and easily brain-washed children and meager, lousy, pariah, stupid people of the internet wrestling community that actually consider the company anything good. anybody that even shudders and rests on the thought that this show and product is good can go straight to hell.
