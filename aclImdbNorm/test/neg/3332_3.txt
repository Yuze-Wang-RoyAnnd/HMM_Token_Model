my boss at the time and showed it to us at a halloween party at our office. he is the chris huntley that co-wrote and acted in it. he knows it's bad, we know it's bad and we all agree that the monster looks way too much like a vagina to be coincidence. maybe it was from a gynocological experiment gone wrong.<br /><br />it was a very low budget and the actors were all friends so what you have here is a case of "hey gang, lets' put on a show".<br /><br />nobody got hurt and it was a first attempt. nothing wrong with that. it gave us all a good laugh and it's a great film to watch with friends and make fun of. :-)
