as a big fan of brian yuzna and the majority of the movies he's been involved in, i guessed i'd enjoy progeny. i didn't, although in ways it has it's moments. however, if you're expecting something of the calibre of society or beyond reanimator, you could be in for a shock. in a way this is similar to society, being a tale of a seemingly ordinary world with a horrific supernatural underbelly...but that's where it ends.<br /><br />i'm not covering for yuzna when i say that the fault doesn't really lie with him, as bad direction is bad direction, but the direction is sound. what trips the movie up is both script and acting. stuart gordon (reanimator, dagon) has written an intelligent script, but one that doesn't really work with yuzna's style of direction, leaving him paused on actors delivering lengthy dialogue when really he wants to throw that camera around and get down with his bad self. this matter makes the movie awkward enough as it is, but there's worse.<br /><br />if the movie had been made with great actors, the movie would have probably held it's own. unfortunately this is very far from the case. the acting is wooden, shockingly so even for a low-budget b feature. the inexplicably successful and renowned arnold vosloo wrecks every damn line with near pinpoint precision, handing in one of the worst performances i've seen in a long while. the man manages to turn every line of well considered dialogue into the kind of ham-line you'll be throwing drunkenly at mates next time you're in the pub. 'hey bob! good god, am i going mad! what's...come over me! noooo!' in fact i may try that one myself next weekend. the last minute addition of genre veteran (and personal favourite) brad dourif, instead of enriching the film like it should, almost seems to hand dourif the movie in a last ditch effort to stop vosloo from hamming, but quite frankly dourif looks deeply uncomfortable (possibly waiting for the next assault of bad acting) next to vosloo, and even an eccentric turn from him fails to resuscitate the film.<br /><br />if the acting was better, this movie would have been okay. hell, it might have been pretty enjoyable, but the lack of character makes the movie a soulless affair, and makes the horror element seem tacked on and tasteless instead of an organic part of the film. i found the alien torture/rape scenes a little difficult to stomach already, but the fact that the characters were so lacking made them seem gratuitous as well as unpleasant, leaving a nasty taste in the mouth.<br /><br />so, if you really like sci-fi and don't have a problem with bad acting, pedestrian pacing and a really garish, nasty rape scene, progeny will probably be your cup of tea. but since i do, i'm probably never going to watch it again. once was enough. on the plus side, this is the only sci-fi movie yuzna ever bothered to make, so he obviously wasn't really that pleased with it himself.
