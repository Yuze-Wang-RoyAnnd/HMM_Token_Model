i saw this at the toronto inter. film festival in sept. 2005. the description seemed intriguing--how wrong i was! this could easily be the worst movie i have ever seen--in 50 years! i see the director is my age (b. 1948) and lived with nico of the velvet underground, which leads us to andy warhol, which coincidently is the one i thought of while watching this--warhol's 24+ hour movies of nothing much happening. this is not art, this is boredom.<br /><br />specifically: black & white. ok, maybe...but what is the purpose here? surely they had color in 1968! and there is no contrast with the present. and yes, the subtitles were in white, naturally. i don't think i missed much, but that made about 20% of them illegible.<br /><br />next, it's pure chronological order, but with seemingly random events thrown in. what's the purpose of the conversation with the old man at the dinner table? it adds nothing to the movie. there were many similar scenes--almost like someone took a camcorder and filmed random people and spliced them together to make a movie.<br /><br />plot? none. the "riot" consists of some figures in the distance occasionally heaving a rock off screen. mostly it's an excruciating length of time watching people (in the distance!) stand around. the repetitive opium smoking is just as boring. when the main character got a cute girlfriend, i perked up, but no, she was boring too! this is perhaps the only french film i've seen where no one takes off their clothes. probably they were too bored to bother.<br /><br />romance? none. the girl seems totally indifferent to everything--maybe her sculpture holds some interest, but if it does, we're not shown that. we are completely indifferent to the fate of the characters because they are all unappealing. maybe that's the point of all this?
