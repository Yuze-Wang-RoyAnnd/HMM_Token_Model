<br /><br />this movie is s'o incredibly unfunny it makes any man want to cry, the clich'e are put on thicker than 5-year old peanut butter and in such a way that it actually sucks humour out of your heart, every single joke was badly timed and wouldn't have been funny if it were timed correctly.<br /><br />don't see this movie, there's a real chance you'll never be able to enjoy going to comedies again...ever.
