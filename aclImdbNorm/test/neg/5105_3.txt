i was prepared for a bad movie, and a bad movie it is, so i guess i shouldn't complain. twentysomething tom (gay poster boy robert stadlober) has so many issues he doesn't know if he's coming or going. i wouldn't have stayed but for the pretty girls: serious mavie (anna br"uggemann); no-nonsense angie (emma daubas); sarah baumann as the star of the movie within the movie. and then there's tom's soul mate, wild-eyed margarete (jana pallaske). she reminds me of b'eatrice dalle and gina gershon. if you've got to remember, these are fine memories. she looks good even in the most ridiculous outfits, and i mean ridiculous, even by berlin standards. i wonder whether i'd have liked this movie when i was the characters' age. my guess is i wouldn't. watch out for indie idols oli schulz and max schr"oder of "der hund marie" performing as street musicians, feeling no pain.
