i have read and enjoyed many of james lee burke's robicheaux mysteries. when i read 'in the electric mist with the confederate dead' was being filmed and tommy lee jones was playing the lead, i was thrilled. after watching it last night, i ending up turning it off with about twenty minutes left, not wanting to see any more people shot or beaten up. don't get me wrong, i don't mind blood and gore-i love 'the untouchables' and 'the godfather trilogy'. perhaps it was just that i had previously seen 'birth' and 'what just happened' before watching this. i know that burke's books are violent, lyrical, and especially in the case of 'in the electric mist', can be like the cajun swamps he writes about, full of things that are never fully explained. in a book, that's fine. in a film, that's confusing. many of the previous reviewers are also ardent admirers of dave robicheaux, which makes it more understandable that they really liked the movie. or they are admirers of bernard tavernier or both. even as a fan of all the actors (and especially vince), i felt it was such a waste of their talents overall-they gave good performances in a film that didn't hold together. now, i say this, having only seen the usa dvd and hoping that tavernier's cut will make a huge difference. on the plus side: the soundtrack was wonderful. the scenes at robicheaux's place were perfect-just as i imagined the bait shop to look like. mary steenburgen was excellent as bootsie, as was walter breaux as batist. if you read the books, you know why robicheaux is an even-tempered person in the beginning of the film, and then starts whacking people with various instruments. overall, i wish that they had filmed more of the 'electric mist and the confederate dead' and left out large portions of robicheaux's methods of interrogation, explaining elrod's gifts and his bond to dave, as well as dave's to the general. then i wouldn't be feeling today as i did last night when i turned it off, "what just happened?"
