so this is where columbia's head of their short subjects unit got his directorial start, eh? yeah,it's none other than mr. jules white who is credited (or is it rather, "exposed") as the director of this entry into mgm's dogville series. given co-credit as co-director is one zion myers; whose name is heretofore unknown to us. mr. meyers was, no doubt, the guy who controlled the four-legged thespians and was responsible for training and "acting". in short, he must have been the dog trainer on the set.<br /><br />the title of this comedy short is no doubt a play on the mgm feature of the same year, the big house; which starred chester morris, wallace beery, robert montgomery and a stellar cast in support. we must plead ignorance in regards to this title; not having seen it up to this point. (sorry,schultz!) but there are many of the doggie gags that relate to what we've read about the movie*; not to mention some particular character specific gags. for example, we observed a canine convict who st-st-stuttered and deduced,correctly, that the bow-wow actor was mimicking character comedian, roscoe ates. we later cross-checked with the cast of the big house and presto, his name is there! (brilliant deduction, one fit for holmes & watson!) <br /><br />the practice of lampooning popular features was already a tried and true practice in the realm of the comedy short. it was one that seemed to draw no objections from the producers and copyright owners of the major films; but rather quite contrarily received heaps of tassive approval. after all, imitation is said to be the sincerest form of flattery; besides, any producer would welcome even some seemingly irreverent parodying.** as for the movie, itself, we found it to be interesting in a sort of perverse manner. seeing so many of "man's best friends" being so artificially animated into one, long and boring sort of anthropomorphic gag seemed very tiring to we, who make up the audience. i mean just how many pooches were made to bark, needlessly, in order to achieve the illusion of 'talking'? <br /><br />when it comes to pets, or "animal companions" as the politically correct crowd prefers, we are quite eclectic; favoring not only dogs; but also cats, hamsters and parakeets. we don't enjoy seeing any animal exploited in such a non-funny,extended play format.<br /><br />as incredible as it may seem, the step that mr. jules white made from mgm's shorts to heading up columbia's 2 reeler production would seem to have been not only a $tep up in the area of finance$; but al$o in the arti$tic content. we never thought that being producer-director for the likes of such luminaries as the 3 stooges, andy clyde and hugh herbert, as well as some who certainly had seen better days, such as charley chase, buster keaton and harry langdon; would be a step up cinematically.<br /><br />in case we haven't made our point yet; we're officially panning this one. so, view it at your own risk. we warned you! <br /><br />note * we read excellent accounts of both the big house and the laurel & hardy send-up, pardon us (hal roach/mgm, 1931) in both mr. laurel & mr. hardy by john mccabe (1962) and the films of laurel & hardy by william k. everson (1967). both books have our most enthusiastic endorsement.<br /><br />note ** the prison picture became a genre of its own; all owing a debt to the big house. in pardon us, laurel & hardy, hal roach and its director did a first class spoof,the first of many; for a prison comedy became a required theme for so many a screen funny man to come.
