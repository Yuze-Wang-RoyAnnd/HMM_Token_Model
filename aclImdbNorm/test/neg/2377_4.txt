this film is a perfect example that a movie can not be successful with a high budget alone. it's obvious that there was a lot of time and effort dedicated into this: the animation is fluid, detailed and superb- the soundtrack isn't too memorable except for the ending song by celine dion (at least i think it was her). the musical score is powerful full orchestra material. kudos to the animators and music composers! 9/10. however, the story and characters fall flat. it feels very 'been there, done that', predictable and plain uninteresting. the characters have distinct personalities but nothing too likable. they annoyed me to no end. i tried really hard to like this, but i didn't care about the story- it was clich'e action-adventure plot. there were 'jokes' that weren't funny. it was vomit inducing predictable from start to end. the dialogue was clich'e and awful- especially the last line "it's not ... that gives you wings, it's love!" whatever it was, i remember cringing. i was wishing it would hurry up and finish. i wasn't the only one either- the people i went with thought it was boring. please watch the asterix and obelix cleopatra film if you're going to watch any. this was a waste of time.
