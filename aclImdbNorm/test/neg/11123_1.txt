chupacabra: dark waters has to rank as one of the most insipidly moronic movies ever made. i had expected at least some passable entertainment because john rhys davies was involved, and after seeing this movie, i can honestly say i lowered my opinion of mr. davies substantially.<br /><br />why? the acting is incredibly poor. an excellent actor like davies should have demanded more from the cast and the director. it was painfully obvious that mr. davies was just clock-watching and hoping the check would not bounce. to say that he just showed up would be an understatement. but at least he did show up. the rest of the cast looks like they mailed it in from their respective jobs at the various los angeles restaurants where they work as waiters. talk about a cast of unknowns! this is the kind of cast that never appears in movies again. they act as if they were auditioned while waiting at the unemployment office.<br /><br />what about the special effects? store bought firecrackers, styrofoam, a cheap rubber suit and cgi effects that look like they came from my 1980 atari game. i have seen some horrible special effects used on sci-fi channel movies, but this stuff looked like cut-and-paste done at the kindergarten by someones' child. i expected mr. crabs and sponge-bob would show up at the end to battle the chupacabra. not to mention that all the accounts of the creature describe it as a small gremlin-like critter. it would have been a good film for a leprechaun-like character. instead, we get a gigantic hulking creature that is shown walking with stop-action speeded-up effects that are laughable. the chupacabra is in one place and then it shuffles at super-speed down the hall and it is worth a few laughs just to see this.
