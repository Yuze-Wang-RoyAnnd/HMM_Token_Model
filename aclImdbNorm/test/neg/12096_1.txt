this is perhaps the worst movie i have ever seen, and i have seen well over 300 movies in my lifetime. the acting atrocious, the only bright spot seems to be judging the anatomical prowess of the female castmembers. after watching this movie, it is suggested that the viewer not operate heavy machinery or go driving for a period of at least 24 hours. also a bottle of valium would be recommended so you don't feel so bad for the 100 wasted minutes of your life. the plot is nothing original, the dialog excruciating, and even the weapons seem sub-par. do yourself a favor and go to your local blockbuster and burn whatever copies they have of this horrid film.
