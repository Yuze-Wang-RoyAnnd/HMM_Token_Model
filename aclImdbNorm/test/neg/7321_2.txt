i saw this movie on video with a couple of friends as part of a teen comedy triple header, alongside dorm daze and going greek. obviously we weren't going for quality, but for air-headed entertainment and gross-out gags. generally we got what we came for, but wild roomies really stood out: for being awful.<br /><br />first impression first, the cover: the norwegian release cover showed breasts covered up and a bunch of seemingly "crazy" roomies in the background; brings up pictures of drunken semi-naked teenagers doing bunches of funny stuff stuff doesn't it?- the "crazy" roomies on the cover were not even featured in the picture. and the funny stuff you assume they'll be doing?- absent as well.<br /><br />this movie was labeled comedy, which is a bit strange since it not even remotely funny. relationship drama would be more accurate.<br /><br />put shortly the movie is about a young couple inheriting a swanky house in la, and are forced to get some roomies to make ends meet. these roommates eventually put both the young couple's patience and relationship to the test because they're so "wild". problem is, they're not. and here lies the problem of this movie: the protagonist couple are so anal-retentive and neurotic that they manage to generate zero sympathy. you'll find yourself rooting for the antagonist roomies halfway through the movie. add mediocre acting, lame dialogue and boring direction and you got yourself a movie that is best left unseen.<br /><br />see something else.
