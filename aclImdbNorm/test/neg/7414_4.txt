bigfoot movies tend to be bad, so i'm not inclined to watch them. however, there were some good commercials on the sci-fi channel, so i decided to watch. a climbing expedition heads into the pacific northwest to find a a fallen airplane carrying the daughter of the expedition's leader (played by lance hendrickson), and have brought a revolutionary dna detector that could be used to prove the sasquatch's existence. and it actually generates some suspense at first. the sasquatch is unseen, but sees the mountain climbers' body heat (like the alien in "predator"), and i did wonder when it was going to strike. the acting is passable, as is the background music. the dense wooded location is well-used. and when the creature is finally seen, the costume is not bad, though nothing great. but as the film grinds on, it becomes increasingly annoying and absurd. most of the characters are unpleasant people, rude to each other and only in the expedition for money and publicity (except for lance hendrickson's character), so that it's impossible to care about what happens to them. and their behavior become increasingly stupid. one man shoots the creature (not fatally), then gets drunk and sits alone in the dark. one female camper puts on a slinky silk negligee before crawling into her sleeping bag, then barely escapes being dragged into the woods by the sasquatch, without getting her hair and make-up messed up. then, the survivors conclude that the sasquatch is really after the dna detecting machine and will let them live if they leave it behind ("a creature knows what threatens it"). obviously, the instinct doesn't apply to these actors, or they wouldn't have appeared in this movie. and the ending is so stupid, you'll want to kick the tv screen. if it weren't for the script, it would have been a decent horror film.
