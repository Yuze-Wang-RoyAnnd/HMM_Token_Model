carlos mencia is not funny. from his stand up specials to this train wreck of a tv series, carlos mencia is not funny. i have been trying to convince people for two years that he steals other comedians' jokes, and as far as his comedy material goes, he is a regular "johnny-come-lately" with far less than sub-par results. psycho astronaut jokes? britney spears breakdown jokes? i hope this is only a scheduling error, but come on carlos and comedy central, those topics, and many others, have run the gamut of late night tv show hosts' opening monologues, saturday night live, mad tv and many, many others. lampooning ethnic and racial stereotypes? comedy stands no chance of evolving with carlos mencia around. perhaps people, especially viewers and comedy central executives will get the point since this week's issue of "new york" magazine accurately labeled him: "carlos mencia, unrepentant joke-filcher."
