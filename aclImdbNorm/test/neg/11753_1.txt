hitchcock's original classic benefited tremendously not only from the performance of, but also the 'look' of anthony perkins. he projected a kind of clean-cut innocence: a young teen-idol type of persona. he was not an actor who had portrayed baddies before this; nor was he physically suited to the role of what the public might have imagined a psychopath to look like, especially in the 50's when this ultra-chilling aspect of mental illness (split personality psychosis) was relatively unexplored in film. which is exactly why the casting of him as norman bates was a slice of true hitchcockian genius. audiences were taken by surprise to put it mildly.<br /><br />that's why this re-make does not work, even a little bit, in spite of trying to be an exact copy. whereas anthony perkins looked like someone you would never think of as being a serial killer, vince vaughn is easily imaginable as one. he lacks the frail look of perkins and his acting chops are clearly inferior as well, at least in this role (honestly - has there ever been an actor who could convey nervousness as genuinely as anthony perkins?). while it was a pointless re-make to begin with, the miscasting of the story's most important character sucks this film down completely.<br /><br />as a side note, i feel that hollywood's propensity for re-making great movies because 'young' people refuse to watch anything that's not filmed in color not only stinks to high heaven of corporate greed but is exceptionally disrespectful to the original work. as for viewers who can't watch black and white - it's their loss. hopefully they'll mature sometime in the future and no longer require shiny colours to hold their attention. when they do they'll discover that sometimes black and white works far better. with the background muted, the story and performances are that much more front and center. and in many cases the mood or atmosphere created through black and white cinematography is just not attainable in colour.
