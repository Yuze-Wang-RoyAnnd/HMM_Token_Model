when i was driving home after work, i bought some movies for my four year old twins. i had bought this movie my kids would enjoy. i watched this with my children. my 10 and 17 year old were about to throw up. in this movie ,the dad acts like a tard. my little ones would watch it every day.one day, they threw away all our movies.i sold the omosis jones movie on ebay. my grade: f++++++++++++++++ i rather be seen on the worst dress list.<br /><br />my kids now hate this dumb movie. if gives the idea that germs can talk to each other. i wonder how the dumb movie sounds in japenese. i broke the cd in half when i got irritated of seeing it over and over again. no offence but, brandy & elena's acting was the best
