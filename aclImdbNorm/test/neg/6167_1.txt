most predicable movie i've ever seen...extremely boring, i feel like i've seen a hundred movies with the same storyline as this one. acting is ok at best, there's no action really and there is definitely no thrills. capable actors with terrible script i think it could have been written better by a 10th grader. felt like more of a chore to watch because i was hoping that there would be something in this movie that was going to set it apart from all the other garbage but this fit right in on the heap. the whole movie i was waiting for something good to happen but it never came. i never rate movies and i never review movies but this movie was so bad that i had to log in here and post a review to try and save a few poor souls from wasting their time (and/or money) with this movie. i pirated it and wish i never even wasted the hard drive space. if i spent 10 bucks to see this in theaters i would kill myself.
