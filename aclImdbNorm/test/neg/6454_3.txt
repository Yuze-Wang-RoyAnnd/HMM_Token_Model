ugly, heartless hollywood crap that expects nothing but ugliness and heartlessness from its audience. the scenes without spacey reveal how truly awful the film really is. but the scenes with spacey are just so entertaining that you hang on in there right to the end. yes, he could play this part in his sleep but he does it so well, he's such a joy to watch, so believable and marvellously monstrous. enjoy it for his performance, but don't expect anything else from this movie. if you want to see a great film about the evils of modern hollywood, check out robert altman's "the player". this sad little potboiler is not remotely in the same league.
