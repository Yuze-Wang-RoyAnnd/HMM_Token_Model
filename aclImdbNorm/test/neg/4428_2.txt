director lo wei was known to read the racing papers and take naps on the set - tells us something about his "approach to film-making, huh? the reviews i've read fall into two categories: 1) this is a film so bad it is funny, or 2) this is a film so bad it is boring.<br /><br />so let's get to the point we all agree on - this film is really bad.<br /><br />i vote for category 2). the story is almost incomprehensibly complex, and it is further shredded and twisted by the remarkably poor camera work and editing. yet lo wei was so in love with it that he slows the pacing so we can all have a long look at it, whether we want to or not.<br /><br />maybe lo wei was upset the day (or two) this film was made - he just wanted to make everybody suffer, cast, crew and audiences alike.<br /><br />spare yourself the agony.
