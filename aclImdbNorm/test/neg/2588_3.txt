i got to watch this one without commercial interruption, and let me tell you, even for a tv movie it was pretty predictable. the actors did a workmanlike job with what they had, and the cast was pretty accomplished -- barry bostwick, jane seymour, frances fisher, etc. however, the script was not only predictable (except for the last scene), but the dialogue was treacly and sounded as if it was lifted from a third-rate romance novel. jane seymour's psychotic monologues were laughable. i'm sorry, but i find it hard to believe that anyone that creepy would arouse no suspicions whatsoever. as bad as theresa russell was in "black widow" -- and she sure stunk it up -- she at least had the sense to play her pseudo-characters somewhat straight. seymour is a much better actress but didn't overcome the material here.<br /><br />lastly, the musical score is incredibly cheesy. it's almost a satire of its genre, like a kenny g meltdown. a movie with such a lackluster and derivative script really should have gone for something edgier.
