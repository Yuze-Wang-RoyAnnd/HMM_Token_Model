lisa grant (adrienne barbeau) is a real estate agent who finds herself in jeopardy of getting killed by a deranged maniac who kills people in her profession who he feels make house prices too high. as motives go, this is pretty damn retarded. lisa's boyfriend happens to be a talk show host whom the killer keeps calling on-air. at first i was positive this was supposed to be a comedy or satire of some kind, but as the endless minutes drone on and on, i realized that it wasn't and the film was just grossly incompetent in every way, shape, and form. i'm just surprised that something this horrid wasn't directed by jeff lieberman (yea, email me some hate mail again, jeff you hack) anyway, back to the film, poor, poor barbeau, you can pinpoint exactly when her film career went down in flames and it all started here.<br /><br />my grade: f <br /><br />where i saw it: the movie channel
