...left behind when the ostensible heroine's venus flytrap makes any man whose sexual advances are forced upon her--ahem!--disappear. fiona "this is my career!" horsey is an attractive enough screamqueen ingenu'e, although i found her acting chops to be suspect. with better direction, and a better vehicle, she might improve. likely as not, her leading man, paul "mine, too!" conway, never will, proving to be one of the most unlikeable, unattractive love interests i've seen in a film in recent memory. there's some nonsense involving siamese twins, a frying-pan-to-the-head-obvious hot dog joke, a reasonable amount of bare boobies, production values in the low-budget-to-laughable range, scripting that would make syd field cry, acting that by and large only an ed wood could love, and camera-work a step above pedestrian. the vagina dentata gimmick might well have made for an interesting horror movie, but "angst" botches the premise. strictly for stoned-out viewing, and even then, you could do much better. sturgeon's law (or revelation) still holds.
