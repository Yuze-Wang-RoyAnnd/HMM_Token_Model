six months after high-school sprinter laura dies during a race, a killer begins to murder the rest of the track team using a variety of sports equipment as weapons: that's the daft plot of early 80s slasher graduation day, a lacklustre addition to the genre that offers very little in the way of style, originality or decent gore.<br /><br />what it does deliver, however, are some stunningly awful musical interludes, a few familiar faces (including an early appearance from scream-queen linnea quigley), and a smattering of nudity (a prerequisite of any slasher movie!).<br /><br />so forget the death scenes
