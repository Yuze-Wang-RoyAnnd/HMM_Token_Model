based on what little i have seen of this show i don't think i will ever watch it again. its not even remotely believable and frankly the derek character just makes me angry.<br /><br />sorry but seeing such a spoiled brat get his way time and again? why would i want to watch that?!? no thanks, there are plenty of other shows that involve devious characters (phil of the future's pim for example) where the evil one doesn't win or if they do not in the way they though.<br /><br />not to mention that i think this is a terrible picture to paint about living with step-siblings. yes life isn't rosy but one could attempt to portray a character that wasn't outright evil and wins.<br /><br />my suggestion is that you watch this only if you like seeing the villain win.
