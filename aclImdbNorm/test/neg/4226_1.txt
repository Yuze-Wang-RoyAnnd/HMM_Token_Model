l'humanit'e is a murder mystery. these movies tend to be popular,<br /><br />and the 6.9 rating it currently has suggests that it has been, too.<br /><br />unfortunately, this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.<br /><br />a few non-spoilers, for instance, include a 5-minute scene<br /><br />wherein the main character eats an apple. and another 3 minutes<br /><br />where he breathes.<br /><br />in case you were wondering, this is not, in fact, art. neither is it a<br /><br />commentary on humanity, which from the title it seems it is trying<br /><br />to be. it is, in fact, boring. there are numerous attempts in this<br /><br />movie to say something about humanity. one might think to<br /><br />onesself, "how would i comment on humanity?" and the most<br /><br />obvious and boring answers will of course be sex, love, and death.<br /><br />not that these options are uninteresting when done well - just that<br /><br />they are the canonical options. for sex, this movie does its best to<br /><br />make it unattractive and disgusting. in your first five minutes -<br /><br />hence this is not a spoiler - you will see the bloodied vagina of a<br /><br />murdered 11-year-old girl; it's a murder mystery, remember? later<br /><br />on, a few people throw themselves at each other and have what<br /><br />the director would like us to believe is "raw" sex, but in reality it's<br /><br />contrived and overly symbolic - but worse yet, uninterestingly so.<br /><br />i enjoy being disturbed by movies. this movie showed me why:<br /><br />disturbing movies usually show something inside of someone,<br /><br />their humanity, which they did not know existed and are a bit<br /><br />scared of. l'humanit'e tried to do just this and failed, and i walked<br /><br />out of the theatre not disturbed, but disgusted, thinking that i had<br /><br />wasted my time in the theater, despite having seen the movie for<br /><br />free.
