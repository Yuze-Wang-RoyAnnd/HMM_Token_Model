hedy lamarr who may have been kept by more men on screen than any other actress, is again the kept mistress of kent taylor, society playboy and general all around rat. on a boat from the yucatan after taylor's given her the brush she tries suicide. but doctor spencer tracy saves her from drowning in the caribbean.<br /><br />tracy's quite the all around medical fellow. i guess he never heard the word specialist. he runs a clinic in manhattan for the poor and his trip was a sideline into medical research. lamarr and he marry and she tries to introduce him into her world and he even becomes a partner of society doctor louis calhern. of course kent taylor reenters the picture and the hollywood inevitable happens.<br /><br />watching i take this woman it seemed to me that the writers were very much influenced by tracy's oscar winning boys town. unfortunately his role as doctor karl decker ain't a patch on what he did as father flanagan. maybe they were trying to give father flanagan a little romance in his life in this film so to speak.<br /><br />tracy and lamarr did not get along too well. in fact this film was dubbed i retake this woman because the original director joseph von sternberg walked off the film, presumably because lamarr was not working out for him the way marlene dietrich did. she did lady of the tropics and then mgm went back to filming this with their contract director woody van dyke who was known for the speed of his productions. and a whole new supporting cast was brought in.<br /><br />fortunately both spence and hedy had better roles in store for both of them.
