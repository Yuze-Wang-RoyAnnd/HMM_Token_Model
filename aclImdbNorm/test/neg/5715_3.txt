it's nice to see julie andrews trying a straight dramatic role here--something she hadn't done in awhile--but her character of judith(wise they didn't try to pass her off as a 'judy')has the old refined manners and tomboyish hairstyle of yore, and andrews enacts 'grown-up' as any other actress would interpret frigid. it's a surprisingly bland drama set in barbados involving omar sharif(not the liveliest leading man around--not even in 1974!)hoping to make andrews a spy while also slowly leading her into the proverbial bedroom. unmemorable outing does have some camp value: the james bond-like credits at the beginning are a cheesy hoot. as for julie: she's quiet and contemplative, but that doesn't do much for the audience, or for the film. blake edwards paces the freakin' thing like a funeral. * from ****
