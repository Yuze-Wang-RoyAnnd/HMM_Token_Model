last night, i am sitting in my tv room, beer in hand, bowl of pretzels on the tv tray & i decide to put the movie "monster man" into my trusty vcr. expecting a fun-filled, gory, crash & bash cheesefest of a movie. what do i get instead? one of the most silly, stupid, unfrightening & predictable films i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. and what's even worse, all during the(& i use this next phrase loosely) "sex scene" the girl keeps all her clothes on! i'll make this summary short & sweet: mix "dude where's my car" (about a good 1/2 of the film) with a very watered down "hitcher", add a redneck version of the antagonist from "i madman" as the primary villain & finally some incoherent black magic mumbo jumbo & you'll kind of get a clue how rotten this movie is. it's also utterly predictable throughout. the only notable factor to this buddy movie disguised as a "horror film" is that some of the moments between the 2 guys (even though the "hero" is one major annoying geek & the other is a jack black clone) are kind of funny (just mediocre funny i.e..like most of snl skits). other than that, "monster man" is a monster mess! 3/10 (this one i'll be handing out at halloween time-just hope after the person views it i don't get my house egged or worse)
