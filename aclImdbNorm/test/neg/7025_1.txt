up until around 1970 lucille ball was one great comedienne. she was such a perfect clown i only wish more people could have seen her with bob hope in "the facts of life" because she could do dry deadpan, too. as well as slapstick..<br /><br />yep, lucille ball was wonderful . . . until "mame."<br /><br />trying to see lucille ball in "mame" is physically impossible because there is so much vaseline on the already filtered lenses that you'd need windex to see lucille ball in some scenes. so even if you see lucille ball in "mame," you can't really see lucille ball in "mame". which is a blessing.<br /><br />that's about the nicest thing i can say about "mame," the movie of the musical of the movie of the play (this could go on, but it started with a perfectly funny book called "auntie mame"). giving this a bad rap is like beating a sponge. so it does not matter that the music is croaked rather than sung. most of the songs weren't much, anyway. there isn't any difference in the first three. "it's today," "open a new window," and "we need a little christmas" are all the same song. celene dion should do an album with them, they're so big and dull. the killer ballad "if he walked into my life today" needs a confident gorgeous voice (edyie gorme won a grammy for doing it in 1967) that poor lucille ball did not possess when she made this movie. (true, elaine stritch can't carry a tune in a bucket, either, but at least stritch can put over a song.)<br /><br />if you still feel your life is not going to be complete unless you see the movie musical "mame," notice how there is dancing in it, but whenever lucy/mame starts to do anything beyond a palsied shuffle the camera cuts away, returning right when the number is over and the star poses with the dancers. again, it's just as well. jane connell got to reprise the role of pathetic agnes gooch after lucille ball had madeline kahn fired to ensure no comic originality would upstage the star. connell is a stage performer who, like carol channing and ethyl merman, can't scale down her performances for films, so she joins lucille ball in being embarrassing, though for different reasons.<br /><br />the lavish gowns are by theadora van runkle (van wrinkle?) and they provide the color missing in all but one of the cast. <br /><br />bea arthur as the actress vera charles, mame's best friend, ignores everyone and does her own fun thing. if only she was in more scenes. she's too old for her role, too, but at least she didn't maim it.
