i used to think that it couldn't get worse that "army of the dead" but this load of crap makes the afore mentioned movie look like "the godfather"!! the special effects are horrible (makes the original nintendo graphics look like hdtv). when it comes the acting, put it this way, i went to a play with my 6 year old niece in it and she gave an oscar worthy performance, when compared to these d-list (and that's being kind about it) actors and actresses. so basically, if i had a gun to my head and head to chose between watching this movie again or chopping my own arm off with a dull knife, that's a tough choice!! you know what, who needs two arms anyways??
