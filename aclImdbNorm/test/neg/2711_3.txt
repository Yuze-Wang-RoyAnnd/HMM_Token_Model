**********possible spoiler********** madonna plays an ex-con that needs to recover some valuable information that might clear her from the murder that she was put in prison for four years ago. griffin dunne is a tax attorney who's marrying his boss' daughter. together, the two of them are supposed to come together in a world where chaos keeps you from getting on the bus...<br /><br />when you get down to it, this is a stupid movie. without trying to give away the plot ****possible spoiler****, the bad guys in the movie are trying to protect their boss by retrieving the information that would incriminate them for the murder that madonna was sent up for. what kind of bad guys don't commit murder by trying to hide the original murder?!?!?!<br /><br />then there's the cops who are trailing madonna who follow the bad guys in a limo, where they have the brides-maids all tied up! and let's not forget those same brides-maids who fought from the front gate to the front door, still all tied together! and i hate to say this, but that patagonious feline sure looks like a cougar! there might be only four of them in the new york city area, so they might be endangered there, but i know there's plenty of them in the rocky mountains (see "charlie the lonesome cougar" if you really want to see a large "cat" in the movie). and let's look at the old man who falls asleep on his feet... naw!<br /><br />the plot is there, but that's all there is to this movie. i was barely out of my teens when this movie originally came out and i was some-what of a fan of madonna, but that was the only reason i liked the movie, but since then, she's fell out of popularity with me, and i've faced the fact that she is just a terrible actress (good thing she's got that singing career to fall back on). it rated maybe a "5" back then, but it's fallen to "barely making a 2" over the years.
