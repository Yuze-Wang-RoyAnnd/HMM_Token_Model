this film was pure trash. not the worse film ever. if it were to be broken down, the acting was good enough to get the job done but the script was so out there and so stupid that one was left thinking, "where did my life go?" even vanessa redgrave~ whom i love (and is the reason i watched this) was wasted. utterly wasted. she didn't even leave an impression. the directing was so distant that non of the characters left me much of anything, but to see redgrave leave nothing. her part was nothing. she was good as a mean boss but that was it. do depth and she's given depth to small roles~ see venus and atonement. i would not waste my time and was upset to have spent the $5 on this movie...i wanted it back. no returns. skip the film. it'll only bring you grief...and boredom.
