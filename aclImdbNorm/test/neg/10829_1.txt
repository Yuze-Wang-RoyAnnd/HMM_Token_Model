why can't there be better tv movies made i was at a loose end today and watched this film on a satellite channel in the uk. what a terrible waste of my time it was . poor sets, poor acting & oh my god what a terrible flood . blimey that woman can even outrun a torrent of water too!.<br /><br />i really wish that people would make tv movies using better effects, better or at least more believable plots & far better acting. killer flood is well up there with poor acting. a few bits of ham couldn't act any worse.<br /><br />1 final thing i really agree with the comment about the dog, but i believe it would of already scarpered in real life!
