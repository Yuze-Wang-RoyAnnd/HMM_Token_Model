i saw this movie yesterday and thought it was awful; it was pointless and just plain stupid. the supposed plot concerned a prospective bridegroom too caught up in the problems of the world to relate to his bride and the other people in his life. he disappears on his wedding day (in a tux no less) and hooks up with an assortment of weirdos.<br /><br />we saw it with a bus-load of people on the way down to atlantic city and everyone agreed that it was a terrible movie. it was trying to be profound but it wasn't; it was stupid and offensive. if i wasn't on a bus i would have walked out on the movie. anyone considering seeing the movie or renting or buying the video you have been forewarned.
