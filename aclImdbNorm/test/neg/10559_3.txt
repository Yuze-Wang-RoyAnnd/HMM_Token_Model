"shade" tries hard to be another "sting", substituting poker for horse racing as the means by which to bring down an enemy, but it fails miserably.<br /><br />i watched the whole thing and still never could quite understand why the young kid wanted to double-cross his partner. was it because his partner stole his girl? is there a woman in the world who is worth going to that much trouble over? if there is, it certainly wasn't this shrew. she had no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and really now, did she actually have a special room set up so that a surgeon could remove the kidney from whoever tried to pick her up in a bar? dina merrill makes a short appearance as a rich woman who hosts, of all things, pay-the-rent poker parties at her palatial home. and then the players say things like, "i'll see your thousand and raise you another five thousand." give me a break. you can't call ("see") and raise, you do one or the other. any kid playing for nickels and dimes at the kitchen table knows this; you'd think grown men playing for stakes this high -- or at least the knuckleheads who wrote the script -- would know it too.<br /><br />one of the other posters mentioned how no high-limit poker game would allow players to actually deal their own cards and i agree. you don't allow two of the best-known car cheats into a game where the buy-in is $250,000 and then let them deal to each other. that's not poker; that's just seeing which one can cheat better. and i'd like to know what person in his right mind would buy in to a game in which two of the best-known card cheats are playing and expect that he might have a chance at winning? and most of all, what mafia boss would run such a game? every time melanie griffith came on the screen i was so mesmerized by those gigantic fluorescent red lips of hers that i completely lost the storyline, and seeing her and stallone together was more like a public service announcement for plastic surgery gone wrong than a love connection. stallone mentions that she used to be a grifter before she bought the restaurant she now runs, but we don't know what kind of grifter she was and we never see her working with stallone in their younger days so we are left to wonder, if we even care that much.<br /><br />jamie foxx is the best character in the whole movie, but he gets killed off right off the bat and we're left with cardboard cut-outs who all sound like they're reading their lines off a teleprompter just off-camera.<br /><br />the ending makes no sense either. the kid gets his cut from the game and just walks down the street with a briefcase full of money and his partner is nowhere to be seen? the mafia isn't watching every move he makes? everyone else just shrugs their shoulders and quietly accepts the loss of millions of dollars without trying to recoup any of it? i don't think so.<br /><br />most of all, this movie does a great injustice to professional poker players all over the world, insinuating that the only way to win is by palming cards and playing with "juiced" decks. and why is it they're always palming kings and aces? sometimes you need a three or a nine to fill a straight or full house.<br /><br />the best parts of the whole film are the sleight-of-hand tricks during the beginning and ending credits; everything in between is ridiculous.
