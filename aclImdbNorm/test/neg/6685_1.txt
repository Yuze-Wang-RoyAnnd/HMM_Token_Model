what a nasty cynical film. apparently this sad excuse for a dramatic urban look at what 20 year olds do whilst crawling through the gutter of sydney nightlife is supposed to be somehow connecting with its target market. made by some industry nobody and pals who seemingly thought they could cobble together any sleazy behavior with a young cast and pour it into multiplexes, sample people deservedly failed miserably at the australian box office. it is so offensive in its clich'ed depictions of obvious and easy targets it was fully rejected by the very audience it was intended. shoddy and cruel and with no attempt to offer quality or resonance to the young audience who might have been attracted by the marketing or casting sample people might have been interesting or even informative if not botched by its exploitive view of 'what teens want to see in a movie'. the character played by ben mendelsohn is particularly offensive and kylie minogue is again wasted by poor material and untalented film makers. it is as if the producers thought teens would watch any ugly trash and just slung-together scenes and characters who were shallow and soul less. well the were very wrong. a mini budget film made in 1983 called going down got this topic right and is an excellent antidote to this poison.
