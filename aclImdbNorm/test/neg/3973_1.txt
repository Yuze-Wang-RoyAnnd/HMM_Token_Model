parts: the clonus horror is a horror all right. there are of course the bad fashions of the late 70's. there's the really bad acting from dick sargent to peter graves. and then there's the clones themselves. their days mostly consist of running, jumping, cycling, and wrestling with each other. when they're not doing that, they learn about america. not the band america, or the song by neil diamond, but an america where they go on to become part of a greater society. but they're given some strange drug then they have all their bodily fluids drained(general ripper was right!) and they are placed in the freezer and await thanksgiving or christmas when they will be thawed out and roasted at about 450 degrees or so. oops, that's not what happens, but it would've been a lot more interesting than what's shown. mario, of super mario brothers fame, makes a delightful cameo as a doctor who bickers with dick sargent.
