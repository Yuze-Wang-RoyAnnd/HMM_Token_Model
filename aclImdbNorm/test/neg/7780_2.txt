the problem with this movie is that it isn't funny, it isn't scary, it isn't dramatic, it isn't intriguing, it isn't stimulating, it isn't, it isn't exciting, it isn't even the slightest bit interesting. i saw this film recently on tape and i was glad i didn't spent any money to rent it. it's basically a poor attempt at film-making. i won't even bother to tell you the story. story? what story?
