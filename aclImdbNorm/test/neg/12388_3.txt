oh, yawn. not another chick flick where the men are all pigs and the women will get even for the abuse they suffered. the only difference is that, in this film, everybody's a pig or has mush for brains. i hated this film for the moral issue of why it's right to send a man to prison for life for a murder he didn't commit. is that a more immoral act than his abuse and deviousness. this movie shows all the situational ethics of bad writing. i saw it on the cbc's "best of britain" series. if this is britain's best, no wonder the british film industry is in trouble.<br /><br />the only bright spot in this film was david tennant, he plays his character as so despicable that i'm likely to spit on the next person who speaks with a scottish accent. kate ashfield tries to play the victim but comes off in the end as immorally devious as david tennant's character. they deserve each other.<br /><br />in the mush for brains category are the parents who see nothing wrong with the obviously psychotic brendan. english policemen are made out to be so incompetent that they're unfit to give out traffic tickets. the british policeman's union should sue the makers of this film for defamation.<br /><br />this film isn't worth the electricity it takes to run your dvd to watch it.
