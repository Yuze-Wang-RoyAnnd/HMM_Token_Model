not for the first time, i'm out of kilter with the majority view. oz is a dreadful, pretentious, voyeuristic series. the makers have their cake and eat it. oz, em city, etc are used as ultra- crude signals that the apparent grittiness is complete fantasy. this allows viewers the feeblest of intellectual excuses to watch soap operatic nonsense spiced with everything that is bad about human beings.<br /><br />when you watch an episode, please remember that while the foul-mouthed, violent, absurdly convoluted, unconvincing, sick, imaginary drama unfolds before your approving eyes, several hundred infants in poorer parts of the world have died from bad food or water.<br /><br />oz is exploitative drama at its worst. it appeals to the basest instincts but pretends to be serious and meaningful. it blows hot and cold and changes from fortissimo to pianissimo more often than a mahler symphony.<br /><br />dialogue is unrelentingly ugly and utilitarian. the liberties taken with realities are stupid. here's a nightclub owning dandy, arriving at oz in his foppish finery, complete with a ridiculously cloudy contact lens in one eye, brandishing a stash of drugs that nobody detected. here's a murderous wimp bleating about the heat death of the universe, begging to be killed, but of course being refused by the brute he approaches and doing a bit of improbable throat cutting himself.<br /><br />the action races on at a pace fast enough for the voyeuristic, dim-witted viewer to be thinking always about what happens next rather than the rubbish that has just been shown. don't worry, a betrayal, a murder, a sex scene will be along within a minute or two. <br /><br />finally, oz is obviously pretentious. you don't have to feel embarrassed about being carried along by its flow. you can watch it and tell yourself that the producers, writers and actors are doing everything with a huge wink (or same word but for a change of vowel) to the audience. <br /><br />yes, you can be a nasty-minded viewer and excuse yourself on the grounds of the cleverness, post-modernistic, etc skills of the oz production team. they appeal to the lowest common denominator while pretending to operate on a higher plane.<br /><br />truly, a despicable series. and every hour it shows, rewarding its makers and actors, and generating advertising revenue for the channels that show it to people who have nothing better to do than watch something so ugly and unnecessary, another few hundred children die whose lives could have been saved by the dollars spent by this horrible, successful, widely-praised series.
