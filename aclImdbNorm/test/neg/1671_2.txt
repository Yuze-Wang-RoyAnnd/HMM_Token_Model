what a truly moronic movie, all i can say is the writer must be very fond of magic mushrooms and lsd because this must be the result of one of his 'trips'.<br /><br />you follow the whole movie thinking alright this is very weird but hey i'm sure at the end there will be a perfectly good explanation for all of this... only to be disappointed to find erm no there's no explanation at all and the twist at the end makes it even more confusing. at the end of the movie you'll probably have the same facial expression as if you were standing in a que paying for you groceries and the merchant told you, that'll be 11.95 please and proceeded to elbow you in the balls for no apparent reason. there are so many factors in this movie that go unexplained and i think it leaves it to the imagination of the viewer in an entirely bizarre way. don't get me wrong i like weird movies, 'the cell' could easily be described as weird and twisted but in my eyes it's a brilliant movie (despite casting j-lo who i dislike to the maximum even that didn't manage to sway my opinion). this isn't one of those movies, and i think you should take in to consideration the characters of those who praise this movie. i can tell you they are probably the sort of people that would go to an art exhibition, see a splat of pigeon excrement on a white board and say "oooooh what a masterpiece, the artist has truly found a unique way to portray eternity" when in actual fact all it is, is bird excrement on a board.<br /><br />keep that last bit in mind when watching this movie, <br /><br />thanks for reading!
