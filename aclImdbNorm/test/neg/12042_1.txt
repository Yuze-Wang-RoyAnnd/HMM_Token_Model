i thought that this movie might be a good spoof, or at least a good independent comedy like friday. instead it was more like something someone in high school would make with their parents' camcorder. it wasn't just the low budget that makes this film bad (many great films have been made on a low budget), it is simply a bad movie and it wasn't even bad enough to be good camp. case in point: for the first ten minutes of the movie nothing happens except the 3 main characters sit in their room smoking dope, put on their makeup, and then answer a phone call. you keep waiting for something to get story moving, but it never comes. the sound was so bad i had to turn the tv up all the way just to almost make out what they were saying (which wasn't interesting anyways). if i pay to rent a movie i will usually suffer through it even when it's bad, but it was all i could do to sit through 20 minutes. it looks like the person before me felt the same way because they didn't rewind the tape and left off about the same place i did. the only reason i gave this a score of 1 is because the rating system doesn't have negative numbers.
