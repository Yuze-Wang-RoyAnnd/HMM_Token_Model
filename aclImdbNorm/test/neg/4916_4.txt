not a good one. -not at all.<br /><br />this installment revolves around a descent of the original murderer inside the amityville home who must face his past to rid himself of the nightmarish terror of amityville itself.<br /><br />it's basically nothing. my bet is that this film was made for some extra fast-cash to buy a boat or something... because this one's just ridiculous... thankfully, it doesn't kill or ruin the series, but it just has no effect on the series at all.<br /><br />i'd have to say that just the fact that it is constantly referenced to the old, infamous house is probably the only thing that makes this one slightly more bearable than "the amityville curse".
