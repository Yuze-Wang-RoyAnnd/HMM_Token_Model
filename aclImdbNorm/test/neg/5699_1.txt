i rented this movie because i love kristanna loken and i've watched her on many tv shows and since she's having her 15 minutes of fame nowadays with her new t3 movie i wanted to check out what other movies she has been in.<br /><br />she's just ok in terms of acting. not good and not bad either. she makes up for everything by being extremely gorgeous. yummmmm<br /><br />rodney rowland was quite a surprise as the hero. he provided the only solid good acting in the movie. he's a very good actor and should probably be an action star.<br /><br />besides kristanna being ok and rodney being really good everything else about this movie is garbage in its purest form.<br /><br />a computer hacker hacks into the system of a plane from the ground and using a joystick he tries to slam the plane into a nuclear power plant ..... or something. and of course there are the heroes who stand in his way and ruin his game.<br /><br />this is one of the worst scripts i have ever seen and no wonder it was a low budget flick.<br /><br />what's shocking is that this movie was made in 2001 and it has way too many similarities to the september 11th tragedies.<br /><br />why do they make movies like this in the first place?<br /><br />panic * - one star (a waste of too good actors) (also a waste of time) (also known as air panic)
