i can't get over how lazy the director is with this movie. instead of setting up scenes in a creative way he relies on boring old zombie clich'es.<br /><br />where the two unarmed leads have to get down the college steps into the van he surrounds them with zombies yet neither of the leads is bitten. he can't be bothered to direct a decent fight scene so we see the leads shove their way down the steps.<br /><br />sometimes the zombies limp about and at others they run like the wind. this is really convenient for the director because he can set up anything he likes without bothering with continuity in the behaviour of the zombies.<br /><br />with careful planning and a lot more inspiration this movie could have been so much better.
