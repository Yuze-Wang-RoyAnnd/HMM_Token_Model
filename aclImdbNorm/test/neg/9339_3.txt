...if only disney had stayed away from it. see, i think that this movie has some potential. well, the main character's situation does, at least. take out the whole jordan cahill thing, and you've got the beginnings of a decent movie! of course, you also lose more than half of the film, but, oh well. not that much of a loss.<br /><br />so, here it goes: you take a typical, preppy, suburban teenage girl (danielle panabaker, who's actually a decent actress) whose best friends screech a lot, mostly over a "pop sensation" (i'm assuming it's a direct quote from the movie; movie's like this almost always involve that particular phrase) named jordan cahill. except, of course, tpstg wants more out of life. enter brenda song's character, a sophisticated individual who is just what tpstg needs (honestly, i don't care what the character's real name is, i like the acronym better). the two new friends go to see jordan cahill (one to drool, one to make fun of the droolers), and they come out of it with his cell phone. hijinks ensue, and everything turns out alright in the end.<br /><br />if only disney, or any major film studio for that matter, didn't have such a low opinion of 8 to 14 year olds. or maybe if 8 to 14 year olds expected a little more out of the movies targeted at them. it's sugar-coated crap like this that make me more than a little unsure who to be more disgusted with (a little film called 'high school musical' comes to mind...)
