i got to know aeon back in the early 90s via television and i loved it...<br /><br />what did you like about it ? the cranky drawing style ? the flawless artistic action involved ? the absurd and deadpan communication between the characters ? the whole layout of the surrounding future world ? no matter what you loved about it...<br /><br />the aeon flux film of late 2005 has nothing of that.<br /><br />karyn kusama, the so called "director" of the film, was hopelessly over-strained with transporting the original content to a new film. if you 're not familiar with the original series, you won't understand anything during for the first 60minutes of the film.the story is inscrutable and the vapid characters do not develop during the film.<br /><br />kusama's attempt to improve the storyline by implementing some rather weak explanatory conversations between the main characters is not only a lame attempt to cover up her flaws as a storyteller , it's simply unworthy of the original aeon concept.<br /><br />charlize theron might be an attractive woman, but she can't impersonate the aeon character. although she was attached to strings doing action scenes, her lack of talent for physical motion simply ruins the action sequences in the film. the result is a tremendous amount of hectic picture cuts to cover up the sheer lameness of her physique.<br /><br />forget about all the rest, it's not worth talking about...<br /><br />i give 1point for ms.theron showing her boobs and 1point for the nice architectural photography in the film. that's it.
