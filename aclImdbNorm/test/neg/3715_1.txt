'til there was you is one of the worst films we've ever seen. it fails in every respect. jeanne tripplehorn was better (as an actress...) in waterworld. in comparison, this film is dungworld. when a character stumbles once, or even twice, in the course of a film, one can understand it. but jeanne's character falls, trips, stumbles so often that she might have a bit of jerry lewis in her. in her defence, each (prat?) fall was probably blocked, choreographed, and rehearsed. and rehearsed. although this is bad enough for a film, the actors (dylan mcdermott and jeanne tripplehorn) seem to spend most of the plot going "out for a smoke" or trying to find a place to smoke. if the film was a diatribe on having no place to smoke- ok - but, it isn't.<br /><br />however long this film runs, it is too long by 10 minutes past the running time.<br /><br />oh, jeanne tripplehorn, almost acts in a public forum meeting. you almost see her break life into the character. oh, it's almost as convincing as her scene yelling at michael douglas in basic instinct--hmm, on second thought, not really.<br /><br />this is a film to avoid at all costs unless you need a cigarette and are trapped in nicotine addicts anonymous or forced to watch outtakes of hooper (burt reynolds). and even then, toss a coin or go to sleep.
