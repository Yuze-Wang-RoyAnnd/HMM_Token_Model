this movie spends most of its time preaching that it is the script that makes the movie, but apparently there was no script when they shot this waste of time! the trailer makes this out to be a comedy, but the film can't decide if it wants to be a comedy, a drama, a romance or an action film. press releases indicated that shatner and hamlin made this movie because they loved the script (what were they thinking?). if you like william shatner (i do) see "free enterprise" instead.
