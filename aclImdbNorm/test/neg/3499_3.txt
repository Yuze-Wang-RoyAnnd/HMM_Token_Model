crash is overwrought, over-thought and over-baked. a great example of how to make a pompous and self-important film with a message. haggis tries too hard to make his point and overreaches in just about every category of the film. it feels very much in love with its own sense of social relevance and has all the subtlety of a jackhammer to the skull. sure, race relations affect everyone and there's a great deal of ambiguity to the issue, but the universe of 'crash' operates to suggest that we are all victims to our own perceptions on race. it's a tiresome thread that repeats itself ad nauseum and wears out its welcome within the first 30 minutes. i found the outcomes of the characters unsurprising and forced and the film took forever to sputter out and die. the fact that this film is in the top 50 movies on imdb is a testament to the public's willingness to get suckered by hollywood malarkey.<br /><br />indeed, if you want the real "crash," go check out the one by david cronenberg: dark, twisted and original. this film plays as preachy, tiresome, and masochistic.
