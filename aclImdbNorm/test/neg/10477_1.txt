i saw this dvd on sale and bought it without a second thought, despite not even having known it was out since this is one of my favorite books of all time. as soon as i got home i raced to watch it only to find myself utterly disappointed. while it is true that this film is somewhat based on the book, the similarities end there. the characters are changed (ie finny seems more a pompous jerk than anything else whereas gene seems to be somewhat of a hillbilly), scenes are misplaced or altogether changed (ie. lepper), many characters are missing and famous lines/thought are missing. the movie does attempt to portray some feeling that the previous one lacked but it is done in a lackluster way that makes for a flat boring movie. it is the depth of character and feeling that makes the book such a classic and this movie takes those things and utterly destroys them in its rewriting.
