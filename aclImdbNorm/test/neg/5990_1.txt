i don't believe i've seen a horror movie this bad since...hell, i don't believe i've ever seen a horror movie this bad. the acting alone was enough to make one cringe. the bad acting went way beyond horror film cheesy. it was just plain awful. and did you check out those god awful special effects? when the demon (which looked more like a cheaply constructed puppet) came out of the wall i couldn't tell if i was supposed to be frightened, or laughing my ass off. as a huge fan of the horror genre, this film was more than mildly disappointing. i couldn't help but notice the director is from portland, or, which just happens to be my own hometown. i must say i'm deeply ashamed. if i could, i'd give this film a negative 500.
