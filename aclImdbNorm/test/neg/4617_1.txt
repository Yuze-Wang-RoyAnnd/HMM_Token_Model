one of the scariest movies i have ever seen was carrie (the first one!). now, as with other movies, they have totally ruined the carrie franchise with the rage: carrie 2. from the beginnning, the movie plods along like geriatics in a beat-up van. there are hardly any scares and this movie is chock-full of all the various high-school sterotypes (i.e. the football jock, the bitchy cheer-leader, the followers and of course the black nailpolish wearing misfits). another sad thing about this show is that you know what's going to happen the moment you see the opening credits. sure, sure, girl gets humilated thourghly and then turns into crazed psychic murderer...yawn...<br /><br />been there. done that.<br /><br />even the actors look like they were forced into doing this movie. emily bergl is as frightening as a cabbage patch doll while jack london... let's just say i didn't pay to see wood act. apart from the actors, the flasbacks serve more to irritate than to link up with the first movie.<br /><br />bottom line, if you can beam objects around like carrie, then for the love of god beam yourself out of that theatre......
