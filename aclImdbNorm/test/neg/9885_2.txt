the best thing about this movie for me was that bryan dick played rafe and made me -melt-. rafe and all his gorgeousness made the movie worth sitting through, even though i itched to get up and scream. i have never seen a hotter man. <br /><br />-ahem- but that's not the point.<br /><br />the title? that is indeed what it is. they took the beautiful story written by annette curtis klause and threw it out. i will, in all my anal-retentive glory, point out what was missing, what has changed, and all else wrong with the movie.<br /><br />sit tight and here goes:<br /><br />-apparently, rafe is son of astrid and gabriel, and apparently, ulf is no longer astrid's child, like in the book. and, as i recall from the book, rafe and astrid were lovers.<br /><br />-astrid is apparently blond, as opposed to the notably red hair described in the book. i believe the book said that she looked more like a fox than a wolf. and the movie also shows that astrid is vivian's aunt.<br /><br />-where did axel go? <br /><br />-vivian is 19. in the book she was 16. <br /><br />-vivian and aiden meet in high school which they both attend in the book. vivian goes to see aiden because of his poem 'wolf change'. but, according to the movie, aiden beat up his dad, escaped, and now lives in romania, and draws graphic novels. this made me go 'what the f**k.' <br /><br />-there is no 'kelly' in the movie. where was the kelly in the movie. the kelly in the book, however, hated vivian. and she also dated aiden after they broke up. vivian even gets tipsy in the book and trashed her room.<br /><br />-gabriel bears a striking resemblance to a columbian drug lord in the movie. and he sort of sounds like one too. his acting was very good, but his appearance threw me off.<br /><br />-vivian had no parents in the movie. her father and mother and 2 other siblings died in the movie. yet in the book, when she comes home one night, her mother, esme is sitting on the couch, after fighting with astrid over gabriel. and vivian has no siblings. only her father died in the book.<br /><br />-aiden accepts vivan for what she is. this really got me. he kills rafe in the creepy church, confronts vivian, and she saves him from the others wolves, except aiden shoots her, so they saunter off to find medicine, and then they try to leave the city together. wtf?! in the book, aiden freaks out when she turns into a wolf, and cries like a chick, throws stuff at her, and so she panics, and jumps out the window. then he makes up a story that he tried to break up with her, and she threw a chair out of the window. that doesn't sound accepting to me.<br /><br />-aiden wants her to runaway with him. in the book, he wants nothing to do with vivan after she turns for him. nor does he lovingly hold her face and say she can control it. he cries like a woman because he is scared of her. <br /><br />and the final indignation...the one that nearly gave my three best friends and i heart attacks in our seats:<br /><br />-in the movie, aiden and vivian run away together, and vivan has killed gabriel. as in she shoots him. gabriel dies. in the *book* not only does vivian not kill gabriel, i do believe they end up together. as in, she doesn't end up with aiden, she ends up with gabriel. what the hell.<br /><br />small things were noticed too: ulf's red hair which he gets from astrid has been changed to brown in the movie, and vivian works at a chocolate shop. <br /><br />a horrible shock; i am ashamed. the book really wasn't hard to follow. if disney can use a random h!school, why couldn't the directer have found a random h!school? <br /><br />*sigh* i was really looking forward to this movie, i loved the book, it's sad that it didn't follow it one bit. i give it a 2, only because (as the top of this review states) rafe (played by bryan dick) was dead sexy, and agnes bruckner did a wonderful job. and, they kept the poem from steppenwolf <br /><br />with love,<br /><br />caitlin
