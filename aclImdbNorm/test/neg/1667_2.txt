tommy lee jones was the best woodroe and no one can play woodroe f. call better than he. not only was he the first and best, he was the only person that could portray his grief and confusion. it was a bad let-down and i'm surprised i even made myself watch it. i can even begin how how pitiful they made woodroe. i understand he would be old by that time, but everyone knows that he would never let that pull him down. the first movie was the best and the only one that i'll ever watch. i hope to god that no more directors plan on continuing or remaking the wonderful classic without tommy or duval. without them, the movies are pointless wastes of time and money for everyone, including the director. if you plan on making another lonesome dove movie of any kind, take mine and billions of others, don't waste time. continuing the movies is just grinding the first one into the ground. thanks.
