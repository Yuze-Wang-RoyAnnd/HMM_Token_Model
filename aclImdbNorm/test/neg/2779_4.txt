first off i am in my mid 40's. been watchin horror films since i was a kid so i have seen a lot of variety. imo,this is not as bad as the multitudes that gave this a 1 or 2. <br /><br />yes,it is a low budget horror flick. the dialog is soso and acting tolerable,sometimes. the basis of this film plotwise is actually pretty good. for those of you old enough to remember or lucky enough to have seen them on dvd. this is very much like a 1970's movie of the week. just add in blood and minor gore,minor t & a and swearing, without big names. that is it to a t. i would rather watch this than jason vs godzilla or whatever other continuois crap is out there. tho not as good, evil dead was a low budget film. at least give these guys credit for trying. with acouple mil budget this could have been a pretty good flick. my score a watchable 4.
