and i am afraid that i cannot imagine why. it really is a genuinely dire and exceptionally boring film. in some ways it is reminiscent of early science fiction when every set had been knocked up on a hollywood back lot out of whatever was lying around. from the minuscule and unconvincing set (snipers seem to be about ten meters away) apparently made of plaster, to the actors who are also apparently made of plaster with "amusing" stereotypes painted thinly on top, to the oddly warm pool in a frozen cave, to the survival of the cast uninjured when medium artillery shells burst a few meters away on open ground, and finally the awful script that reads like a training manual more than a film.... i really cannot say how dull this is. even the opportunity to see whether the young james dean survived wasn't enough to keep me watching for more than an hour. this really is one to be avoided at all costs.
