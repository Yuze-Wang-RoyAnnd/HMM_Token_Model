hard to believe - but it is! i shouldn't be surprised. commercials try to show how unique and "funny" a show can be. yet not only didn't the commercials announcing this new show have the slightest iota of humor to me, i've not spoken with anyone who found the commercials amusing, either.<br /><br />i don't recall ever seeing a pilot so devoid of cleverness, cuteness or humor. the characters were insufferable for the most part. especially selma blair's (which is astonishing she would agree to be in a fecal sample of a show like this). the few moments where the characters were slightly redeemable were considerably hackneyed and trite.<br /><br />rare is the show with no redeemable qualities at all. and this is not one of them. kath and kim has exactly one redeeming quality - and that's selma blair. despite wearing repugnant outfits and acting like a pitiful, whiny stupid excuse for a young woman who seems like a cross between britney spears, paris hilton and kim kardashian, selma is still nice to look at.<br /><br />but if you want to look at selma, go rent hellboy. you'll at least maintain a modicum of respect for her instead of searing this abominable character into your brain to associate with her.<br /><br />all in all, kath and kim is a waste and truly epitomizes the worst that tv is or ever has been. it sets a new low.
