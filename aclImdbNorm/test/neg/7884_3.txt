a movie about a french girl who gets raped by street hoodlums. the rape scene itself is shot in all it's gory detail with all the male and female organs and their interactions clearly visible to the camera. in a fit of rage, the victim grabs her friend's (or was it brother ?) gun, shoots him and runs off with the weapon. she meets this prostitute who has just seen her pimp shot down, they team up, and make off towards paris. a series of crazy, meaningless and wild killings follow, the girls seem to enjoy every murder more than the one before. one poor guy gets shot in the ****hole. there are good doses of sex thrown in between the numerous killings.<br /><br />the movie is not the most violent i have seen, i would say saving private ryan probably had more violence in it. if violence is what you are looking for, then there are lots of other movies out there. and if it's sex you are out for, then i would suggest one of those xxx ones.<br /><br />i went to see the movie because of all the hype the media was giving it. the movie itself is no big deal, just a lot of violence and sex shot with something like a hand-held camera. i was surprised this movie had a 15 year age limit in sweden, if 15 year-olds can watch this movie, they should be able to watch xxx movies too.
