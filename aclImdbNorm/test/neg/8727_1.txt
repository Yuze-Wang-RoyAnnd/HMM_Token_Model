this miniseries/movie was so terrible at times that i nearly broke down and turned it off. i am a great fan of the novel, however this movie suffers from multitudes of problems. the costuming is poor, and many of the more emotionally charged scenes are blase. the departures from the novel are poorly chosen, significant nuances are missed or rewritten.<br /><br />
