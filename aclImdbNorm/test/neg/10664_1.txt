in bollywood it isn't rare that worthless films become hits, good films flopping and good actors not making it big<br /><br />aks is such a movie<br /><br />himesh after a music director and singer tried acting hell man, just because his songs became a hit that means next he becomes an actor<br /><br />the producers were sure the film will work perhaps, the songs were a hit too and of course himesh did his cheap publicity as usual<br /><br />the film tells such a poor story, such poor direction, such poor acting it makes you cringe<br /><br />indian rickshaws in germany, stunts by himesh and lot of stupidity himesh's cap is intact even when he is in the car which somersaults<br /><br />direction is poor music is saving grace though most songs sound the same<br /><br />himesh tries hard but sadly his emotive scenes are a joke, lacks expressions, he is best suited for his music director and some singing he cuts a sorry picture hansika is awful malika is okay sachin khedekar is okay, darshan jhariwala hams
