i was pleasantly surprised with this one. it's actually quite interesting and engaging. the cast is strong, even dan cortese. brooke shields has come into her own as an actress. black and white must have really set her free, 'cause i have never seen her in this much command playing a conventional character. if marketed right, could be a medium-size hit.
