i'm not sure this review contains spoilers, but i'm playing it safe by indicating there might be. regardless, it's unlikely anyone will watch this film who isn't familiar with the book.<br /><br />there's an old wisecrack about laboring mightily and bringing forth a mouse. "comanche moon" is such a mouse.<br /><br />the novel focuses more on the indians than the americans. in adapting it for tv, mcmurtry and osanna rightly reasoned that the audience would be more interested in the whites than the reds. unfortunately, there's little in the novel that we don't already know about gus, woodrow, and their friends. so the movie gives us mostly a portentous prehash of what will occur in "lonesome dove". the indians -- who have their own story to tell -- are largely relegated to the background -- so much so that someone who hasn't read the novel will rightly wonder why it's titled "comanche moon".<br /><br />the novel has no overall story line, or much of a "point". this could have been fixed in the movie, by more strongly drawing the contrast between the indians losing their lands and way of life to the encroaching americans, who bring "civilzation". this opportunity was missed.<br /><br />unlike "lonesome dove", "comanche moon" has few extended scenes that develop character or relationships -- at least among the americans. the extended scenes with the indians have been largely removed or shortened. and for a (net) four-hour film, it is remarkably episodic and choppy. one gets the feeling the script was originally longer, and cut to reduce the production costs.<br /><br />the screenplay comprises mostly clich'ed dialog, aphorisms, and platitudes. coming from the author of "the last picture show", it's a startlingly bad script. mcmurtry and osanna had the opportunity to fix problems with the story and characterizations, but did not.<br /><br />some of the best dialog from the novel is missing or altered, for no obvious reason. for example, clara (cassie) shows her intense hatred of woodrow (jack) by condemning gus (ennis) for always running off to be with his "pard". that tart little revelation of clara's sexual jealously is gone. then there's the scene where the ur-dense woodrow warns maggie not to let jake spoon "compromise" her. the exchange in the novel is shorter and harsher; the film tones it down, and doesn't portray woodrow as quite the socially stupid, emotionally frozen stone he is. (when i read that scene in the novel, i wanted to punch woodrow in the stomach -- or worse.) there are other changes, some of them understandable. inish scull's eyelids are not cut off; to do so would like have required expensive cgi. but buffalo hump has no hump! (perhaps it was felt unreasonable to ask wes studi to schlep around such a huge prosthesis.) and buffalo hump's character is "kindler and gentler". he is nowhere nearly as grotesquely violent as he was in the novels.<br /><br />the only good thing about this near-turkey is steve zahn's remarkable performance -- not so much as gus mccrae, but as robert duvall playing gus mccrae. it is uncanny. he perfectly duplicates duvall's mannerisms and manner of speech, without ever appearing "deliberate" or self-conscious. as was duvall, he is wholly "within" the character. and he actually shows us gus becoming "more gus" in the third part.<br /><br />the best thing about "comanche moon" is that it won't spoil our affection for "lonesome dove", not just a great western, but a great american film.<br /><br />ps: for those who think rachel griffiths was over the top -- that's the way she was in the book.
