in the early 1990's "step-by-step" came as a tedious combination of the ultra-cheesy "full house" and the long-defunct loopy classic hit "the brady bunch". the differences between "step-by-step" and the two aforementioned shows was of course better writing, excellent comedic timing from almost all of it's actors, and a great deal funnier situations that weren't quite as sugar-coated as it's extremely popular predecessors. admittedly though, even with the big boosts in the show's basic dynamics and all it still wasn't exactly spectacular, nor was it really even that memorable in the long line of corny family programming! it was just a much better time-passer, you might say, in comparison to the cutesy migraine-inducing "full house", which coincidentally, ran neck-and-neck with "step-by-step" during that time period in terms of overall popularity. the show, now in syndication obviously, is certainly suitable family-fare but be sure to not expect much beyond that when watching it.
