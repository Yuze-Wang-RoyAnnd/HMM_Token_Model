being a science fiction fan from my early childhood (long time since) i always hated implausible plots. it's a pity that most authors of science fiction stories for children do not show this kind of respect for their audience. i always suspected them of thinking: "children are to dumb to realise, so we don't have to strive". the writer of "science fiction (2002)" is no exception. the story is about a boy who is instigated by his new friends to spy after his parents, because they think that the parents are aliens. as intriguing the idea sounded to me, as much was i bored by its realisation. it seemed to me that the filmmakers had exactly this one idea and tried to stretch it over the ninety minutes by dunking it into a dark, stylish and painstakingly slow atmosphere. the only thing that kept me in my seat was the question "how do they manage to get out of this implausible rubbish"? and then - bang - they did not even try. so if you are looking for good entertainment for both children and parents, go and watch "klatretosen (2002)" instead.
