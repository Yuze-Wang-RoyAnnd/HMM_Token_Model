there seems to be a spectrum of cinema. on the left, there are movies made mostly for entertainment and/or commercial purposes. in the middle, there are movies that are both entertaining and artistic. on the right are movies that are not as commercial, but are focused more on cinema as art than cinema as product.<br /><br />i'm not here to say any one part of the spectrum is better than any other, but that when a movie goes too far to either end, it's rarely good. such is the case with naqoyqatsi.<br /><br />i had no idea what to expect when i saw it advertised. a few friends were going and asked if i wanted to come along. none of us knew what to expect, and by the end, none of us were pleased.<br /><br />yes, there are breathtaking images. yes, i'm amazed at the lengths the filmmakers went to in searching through archival footage. yes, the soundtrack is enjoyable to listen to, and probably the best part of the experience. the thing is, this goes so far to the right side of the spectrum i mentioned that i can't say anything nice about the movie as a whole.<br /><br />it's preachy. it's a jumble of symbolism and obvious morality. it's not saying anything new or forcing the viewer to examine life in a new way. it's just telling us things we already know (that is, if we can even figure out what it's saying).<br /><br />this movie is simply art for art's sake. an attempt to say "look at how deep and thought-provoking we can be by using montage!" when a film becomes more about how clever or intelligent its creators are than about its subject, it ceases to be a film and simply becomes celluloid self-gratification.
