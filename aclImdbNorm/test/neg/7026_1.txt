lucille ball's version of "mame" in my opinion is one of the worst performances ever saved to film. after seeing lucy in her various sitcoms more than an astronomical number of times, i can tell you that i really love lucy, however, this movie is a fiasco of unbelievably bad casting, music and dancing. robert preston is the only saving grace with a part tiny enough to miss if you blink. i don't know what she was thinking, and i can't imagine how she was advised by the studio or director, but i actually cringed watching this embarrassing performance. i could be really cruel and suggest watching it for a laugh, but it's too pitiful even to qualify for that. don't waste your money or your time.
