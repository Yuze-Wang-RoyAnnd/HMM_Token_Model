no movie i've ever seen before has even come close to being as boring and stupid as this hunk of junk. and i have always been a big b-movie fan. after viewing this total piece of crap, though i can honestly say that this doesn't even come close to being a b-movie. <br /><br />no one in this movie could act if their life depended on it. the script is so stupid i don't think i've ever heard anyone talk like this in my life. the writer should go spend a few years studying real-life people to see just how they act and talk, even then they would not be able to make a watchable movie because it is so obvious that no one involved in this movie has any talent driving them at all. <br /><br />i could make a better movie with a digital camera and some monster toys. also, forget about any sexy scenes, the women in the leather outfits are so grotesque, you would sooner puke than get turned on!<br /><br />avoid this pointless drivel unless you want to be bored out of your mind!
