man, i went to this movie because of the great preview. it looked like it had a great story and nice special effects.<br /><br />boy was i wrong. i wanted to walk out of the theater because of those horrible special effects. a cartoon dino, of cart board would do even a better job then this. the story was fine, if it would have been taken on by a big movie producer. who would trow in some more money to make the effect more life like. the only thing i liked about this movie where the plants that pop up everywhere.<br /><br />even worse where the cars, in one scene 2 characters walk along the street. if you watch those cars you'll see the following: taxi, car, motorcycle, tri-pod, big bus. and about 4x in a row!<br /><br />and then there is the "butterfly death" that would set the whole "evolution changes" in to progress. if that guy didn't step on the butterfly, the next dino would have eaten it anyway! so that's absolute bull. then, if you change something in the past, the future will be different in the same instant. not in those "time waves" they made. but hey, if the future changed in a split second, the movie would be even worse, but more realistic though. this is just one of those movies you should see when you want to have a great laugh. i spend way to much money on this movie in the theater. and then they tell me this movie had $80 million dollar budget. where did all that money go????
