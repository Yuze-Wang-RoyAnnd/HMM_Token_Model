if you don't like bad acting, poor editing, ridiculous dialog and unbelievable characters you will hate this movie. if you like all of the above, that is to say if you are a lynch fan, then you will love mulholland drive. this is quite possibly the worst film to be rated above an 7.0 on imdb.<br /><br />outside of naomi watts work, you will be hard pressed to find any competent acting in mulholland dr. the other female lead went to the "hide your face with your hands when you don't have the chops" school of acting. given the script they had to work with it's a wonder all of the actors weren't holding their heads in their hands.<br /><br />characters wander in and out of the film that do nothing to advance the storyline. you have a hitman, a mysterious cowboy, an adulterous wife and her cliche'd poolman lover, a mafioso type figure sitting in a darkened room who speaks through an external voice box and a host of others too numerous and tedious to mention. suffice it to say that they manage to do little more than fill up screen time.<br /><br />this isn't so bad however in that it distracts the viewer from the fact that the movie has no discernable plot. you will wait and wait for for all of the loose threads to come together and in the end you will be abysmally disappointed. the hardest thing for a writer to do is to bring everything together in a believable fashion at the end of a movie in a way that leaves everyone feeling fulfilled. the easiest thing for a writer to do is to create a lot of odd characters and put them in scenes that are not connected to the movie as a whole and then to take what few coherent threads there are and jumble them up at the end for the sake of surprise. guess which way lynch goes. surprise!!<br /><br />you know you have a bad script when you have to resort to dream sequences to make any sense out of it. after all, a dream sequence covers all sins. dreams don't have to make sense. anything can happen in a dream.<br /><br />the editing is similarly disjointed. let's just say good editing does not call attention to itself. much of the way this film is edited seems to be done for the sole purpose of calling attention to the editing. "look at me... you can see my editing... aren't i a genius?" uh, well... no! this movie has all of the earmarks of the worst and most self-indulgent french films.<br /><br />so why is this movie so popular? my theory is that it is just another sign of the decay of our culture. melodies are hard to compose so let's listen to rap. plots are hard to follow so let's dispense with them. pictures are difficult to paint so let's pee in a cup and stick a crucifix in it. these are the symptoms of our times and mulholland drive is just another part of the affliction.
