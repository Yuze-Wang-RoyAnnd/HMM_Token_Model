i was wondering when someone would try turning that whole matamoros mess into a goreporn pic. anyroad, here's a few things i learned about mexico from watching this film.<br /><br />~all mexican women are super hot - remember that little desert town in unearthed? yeah, well, this must be it's mexican sister city. don't even bother with the hookers, just put a few smooth moves on the hot bartender. she'll be just as hot as the prostitutes and probably doesn't have any kids as well! <br /><br />~half of mexico is controlled by insane satan-worshiping palo mayombe cultists. !ay, caramba! the other half, as everyone here in the u.s. knows, is run by drug dealers. fortunately, this doesn't much interfere with the sex-tourisim trade and our ultra-low wage factories down there.<br /><br />~mexican cops are useless. don't go to them. go to the nearest occult bookstore and ask the hot chick behind the counter what happened to your vanished friend. she'll be way more help than the cops.<br /><br />~when you're being gruesomely tortured by the aforementioned bloodthirsty cultists, don't go reciting the psalms or any part of the bible, really. you'll just mess up the mojo.
