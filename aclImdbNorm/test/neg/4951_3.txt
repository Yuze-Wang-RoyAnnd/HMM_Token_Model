after viewing "still life", a short film directed by jon knautz, i was genuinely excited for his feature film debut, "jack brooks: monster slayer". "still life" had perfectly captured the essence and feel of an episode of "the twilight zone" and i was eager to see what knautz could do when taking on the horror-comedy genre. the campy nature of the name and promotional materials suggested something along the lines of "evil dead" or "army of darkness"; a fun, gory, 80's style horror flick with lots of monsters. while that was what knautz was going for, he utterly fails at capturing any of the fun or entertainment value these movies had.<br /><br />the problem with "jack brooks: monster slayer" is that it completely lacks an understanding of what made these horror-comedies, that it tries to evoke, so great in the first place. two-thirds of the running time is primarily devoted to the film's hero, jack brooks, a plumber and college student, as he goes to class and attempts to deal with his uncontrollable bursts of anger. there's nary a monster in sight for the greater part of the film, barely even a drop of blood or the slightest attempt at anything horror-related. even if "evil dead" or "dead alive" had subsequent amounts of the gore cut out, they'd still be entertaining. "jack brooks" isn't. it's plain boring, which is the worst thing a film of this nature can be. jack brooks himself is not all that interesting, at least not enough to warrant the amount of screen time he's given. all one needs to know about him is revealed in the films first ten minutes and from that point on, whenever he's not beating the pulp out of a monster (and he rarely does), he's not worth watching. the movie goes nowhere, following him around on psychiatric sessions and scuffles with classmates.<br /><br />eventually things do pick up. jack brooks battles a few monsters, some heads are crushed, a few humans are slaughtered, and then it's over. just like that. all within the span of about fifteen minutes. it is a good fifteen minutes. the monsters are all fairly inventive (and done entirely in camera) and there's some great gore gags (the best being a zombies head crushed in), but after sitting through seventy-five minutes of pure tedium, fifteen minutes just isn't going to cut it.<br /><br />that's really all there is to it. i could ramble on about the acting which is fairly well done (especially horror icon robert englund in a non-traditional role) and how the creature prosthetics are a nice throwback to the days when films didn't use cgi, but it really doesn't matter. "jack brooks: monster slayer" is utterly boring and while jon knautz obviously does have the talent to create a good film (once again, the last fifteen minutes are killer and "still life" was amazing
