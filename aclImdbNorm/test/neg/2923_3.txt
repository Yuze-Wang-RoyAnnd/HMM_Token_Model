a very disappointing film from oliver stone which, unlike his recent epic "j.f.k.", fails to stimulate any sort of real emotion. "talk radio" is about talk-back host 'barry champlain', a very loud, opinionated man who manages to upset a lot of people and yet still draw an audience, most of whom mind you just want to ring up and abuse him. his boss in the movie (alec baldwin) sums up his character very well by saying he's just a shoe salesman with a big mouth. and as barry (eric bogosian) gets death threat upon death threat, the final outcome is almost inevitable.<br /><br />this is the sort of movie that usually has something very powerful to say. however, "talk radio" fails to make a serious comment and remains a frustrating, pointless film.<br /><br />thursday, september 17, 1992 - video
