one of the most boring movies i've ever seen. three immature young people have sex and talk about very little except their "love" of each other. they don't seem to be interested in much but each other, and only passively so. i was left feeling shut out. most of the exterior scenes take place at night, so one can't even enjoy well-lit sights of paris! i gave up after an hour and ten minutes.
