i like to think i have seen it all. ss doomtrooper. the one about a family of sabertooth tigers. the one about a family of pteranodons. goat eater. demon child (a nonanimated child's rubber doll with horns glued on its head. several sasquatch flicks, none of them good. a couple of giant spider/insect flicks. endless hellraiser sequels. endless leprauchan sequels. endless jason sequels. a kickboxing scarecrow. ax 'em, which is actually about an urban street parade recorded on someone's $199 camcorder. and so on. i watched part of an stv the other night about folks stranded on a desert island kickboxing to the death with a group of badly animated totems. i have even sat through dreamcatcher, as recently again as last night -- well, i should say i sat through parts of it, having seen it in all of its awful glory years ago. but nothing compares to predator island, about a group of youths trapped on an island during a storm, forced to do battle with aliens that arrive in a meteorite. the meteorite looks like it came out of a superman cartoon from the 1940s. so do the aliens, for that matter. the photography and acting and directing and writing are all equally bad. i turned it off halfway through. good luck.
