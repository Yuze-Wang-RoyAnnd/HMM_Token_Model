i would not be giving away too much of the film to tell you that there are many, many, many, many scenes of lucas (the young protagonist) walking and looking at things! yep. and you'll be happy to know that the first third of the movie is pointless, meaningless, and pretty much ignored for the rest of the film!<br /><br />this movie is populated by dull people who do dull things, and the dullest person of them all is young lucas, who is going blind and needs an operation. you see, he has delusions, terrible delusions! he thinks a killer is preying on blind women! he walks around a lot and acts like an insufferable jerk!<br /><br />patience does not pay off with this film. by the end, the plot and events are just as confusing and lethargic, and it is very hard to care one way or the other about what any of the nightmarish images meant. nothing is made clear, the film moves at a snail's pace, and it left me with the same effects of a hangover.<br /><br />judging from "afraid of the dark," the british don't make stupid thrillers like the americans do; they make boring ones.
