i can't believe i actually bought this movie! it sucks! ... where i live mexican movies mexican movies are never advertised, or even available ... you can't find them in the regular rental places... so i had to buy it ... i really like mexican movies! they bring me closer to my roots, and my people, and they are way different that what your normally used to... but this one was soo predictable!!! your could guess what was going to happen... i'ts not a horrible movie! it just wasn't worth what i paid for it! jaja... but if you have time and are truly bored then yeah u should watch it.. but if you love mexican movies, and love theater itself then don't watch it it'll be painful! lol
