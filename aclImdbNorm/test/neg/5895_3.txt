am i the only one who thought the point of this film was the graphic violence? i knew nothing about leigh scott when i rented it, and would not have done so if i had known that most of his previous films were horror films. i am not into that at all, i was just expecting an informative docudrama of the 9/11 report.<br /><br />instead, i got an almost incomprehensible, violent movie. the only good thing about it for me, was that it made me want to read the report, to figure out what the heck this movie was about.<br /><br />i wrote this because i am shocked that we have become so immune to violence in films and on tv, that it was not even worth commenting on by the bloggers whose reviews that i read.
