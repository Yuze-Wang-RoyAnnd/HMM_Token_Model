i have officially vomited in my own mouth, thanks to this movie.<br /><br />i expected the absolute worst with this movie, but i expected a heartwarming and pleasurable absolute worst. this is just terrible. absolutely terrible. terrible like nazis spreading the black plague. let me explain: ewoks are speaking english. it's horrible.<br /><br />the villain girl looks like she travelled from the future set of power rangers. i really really want her to rise up from the ground and say "at last! after ten thousand years i'm free! it's time to conquer earth!" the putties... er, i mean the big bad whatever the heck they are... they growl a lot. many of them look like an even lamer version of the cryptkeeper. the cryptkeeper was pretty cool, but these guys were not.<br /><br />the only merit to this movie was paul gleason. this movie might have been better if he'd went to the bad guys and said "if i have to come in here again, i'm crackin' skulls." it would have been even better if one of the ewoks was played by judd nelson, who mouthed his words as he said this.<br /><br />also, that speedy little creature is pretty badass. word to that.<br /><br />no word to the movie, though. i want to give this movie a two. i want to, so badly. there's a passage i have memorized: the path of this movie is beset on all sides by the inequities of terribleness and the tyranny of spin-off awfulness. blessed is nothing, for this movie blows.
