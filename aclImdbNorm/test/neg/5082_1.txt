frankly i'm amazed to see that this movie is getting relatively good reviews. i'll be completely honest and say that the only reason i even got through it is because of ryan phillippe, and not for reasons particularly connected with his abilities as an actor, though i think over the last years he has proved himself to be a better actor than his first major roles in the late 1990's indicated.<br /><br />as far as action/suspense movies go, this movie fails in nearly every respect. the acting is ok, i guess, but the script is absolutely horrible and makes very little sense, a fact which the filmmakers try to cover up by adding absurd references to chaos theory, as if it would convince anyone that the film is actually 'clever' - but then again, judging from other reviews, some were. don't be fooled: the script is a boring, derivative mess and no other element of the movie makes up for it. wesley snipes has probably never had a less interesting role in a film, and statham is a thoroughly dull actor.<br /><br />not recommended.
