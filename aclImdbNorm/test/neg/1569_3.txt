george & mildred - the movie lacks the talents of its tv writer john mortimer who brings the close quarter cut and thrust of george's class war with the fourmiles alive.<br /><br />the plot is cut from standard spin-off cloth - hit-man/mistaken identity - and has as little tension as there are laughs. the producers should have taken a leaf from rising damp, (also 1980)which was also bought to the big screen after the tv series demise, and kept much of the story in familiar setting.<br /><br />yootha joyce died in 1980 but she should not be remembered for this creaking piece of work encumbered as she was by her illness. mildred lacks the sharpness of her tv incarnation; cutting asides and withering looks largely directed at georges lack of libido. george's sputtering incredulity also gets lost in the more expansive sets. this is not to say that they were much to shout about. the budget for this movies looks pathetically small; a restaurant they go to is clearly a new semi-starched house with some christmas lights adorning the front door.<br /><br />for fans of 70's british comedy or those who just want to revisit an old tv companion from their youth this film can add nothing to the experience and they should just stick to the first four tv series out now on dvd.
