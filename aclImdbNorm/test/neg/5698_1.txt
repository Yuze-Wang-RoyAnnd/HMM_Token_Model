it amazes me that someone would actually consider spending some money on a movie like this. really. let's forget for a second that the plot doesn't even give a single hint of originality... most of the movies today are based on other movies' stories, so a "simple" lack of originality is not that big a deal. <br /><br />but i can hardly believe that none of the guys involved in the movie had never even got on a plane before shooting this. because, let's be honest, that would be the only excuse to come up with something so ridiculous. to be sincere i think a 6-years-old child with a fake camera could have come up with something technically much more believable. some examples following.<br /><br />the scene that really drove me crazy is when the engines turn off when they regain control of the plane. when they have to turn them on again the guy on the radio says something like "ok, push the 1 and 2 buttons on the dashboard". now, those are not buttons. they should not be pushed, they should actually be pulled up and toward the pilot. that's something only plane-addicted would know, you say? wrong. the next scene you can see their fingers pushing the "buttons"... and of course the so called "buttons" don't move at all! not even a single millimeter! (and note that i haven't even mentioned the fact that aircraft engines are not like cars engine, that you just turn the key and the magic happens... you have to do quite a complicated procedure to turn them on...) come on guys! you could have faked the movements at least!! not to mention the hilarious final impact, where the plane crashes against every single thing along the runway (light poles along the runway? what where they thinking?!)... and the wings don't even get ripped off! it happened to me too, once... except the plane was made of lego! what about the flight attendant? she's actually so skilled that she perfectly knows where the "aux 1" and "aux 2" fuses are, in the middle of the wires behind the cockpit. should we mention, then, the guy that can drive an ambulance _and_ fly a plane behind the ambulance using his computer? and how did he turn the other airplane engines on?<br /><br />really, i could go on hours with this stuff. this is the dumbest movie i've ever come across, and i'm including garbage like alone in the dark and other stuff in the list. want to do yourself a favor? don't watch it.
