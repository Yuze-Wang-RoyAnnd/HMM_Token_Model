this is one of a rarity of movies, where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it with a bottle of vodka. to be completely honest we are a group of people who actually know the man, mo ogrodnik, and decided to drink ourselves stupid to this film.<br /><br />the cinematic aspect of wolfgang something's photography seems to have left out both close-ups and breasts. mo and wolfgang's collaborative effort revealed the passion of the two actresses, plastic peens holding passion. there's also beetle banging. as violet would have put it: "this (plastic peen) goes up your butt". the rat porn and subsequent rat smashing is awesome. <br /><br />alright. so if you are still reading, let us explain who we are. mo ogrodnik teaches at nyu and we are a group of her students, who, finishing a film class with her, decided to get poop- faced and watch here directorial debut. she also wrote uptown girls. i can't tell you how much that's been hammered into our skulls. so this movie is quite the experience. at the very bottom of this post will be a drinking game we created for this movie. <br /><br />about 13 minutes into this game, none of us could see straight. the sheer amount of dido's in the first thirty minutes created enough reasons to drink to pacify an elephant.there was something secretly pleasurable about seeing two underage girls hit on a kurt cobain lookalike with absolutely no context, save for his mysterious scene at the convenience store where he was oh-so-naturally reading a local newspaper. because that's what we all do. the heart-shaped glasses were delightfully derivative of lolita. and something about that provocative scene of the nude chin-up boy suggests the director's history of homosexual pornographic experiments. we wish we were kidding.<br /><br />enough intellectual contemplation. on to the drinking game! this will ensure that the viewing experience is a positive one. it's very simple, and very likely to send at least one member of your party to immediate care.<br /><br />the mo ogrodnik/ripe drinking game: 1. every time you see anything related to pornography, take a drink. 2. every time you see auteur mo ogrodnik's name appear, take a drink. 3. sex. 4. (plastic peen) require two drinks. 5. any time somebody points a gun at another character, take a drink. -at this point you will probably need to refill/pee pee any remaining sobriety from your body.- 6. any time there is blood (including "lady blood"), please take a sip! 7. the underused hula-hoop girl requires one drink per second. 8. gratuitous use of the "magic black man" requires one drink. 9. if you can't figure out the through-line, keep drinking, beyotch. 10. whenever you are able to predict a line, take a drink. trust us. it's easy. <br /><br />that's it, internet! keep drinking, and try not to get riped.<br /><br />-hawaiian smirnoff punch, jr.
