i wish i could have voted this movie a ten, it's that funny. if they had intended for it to be that funny i would have given it a ten. i have to give it a 1, but it's the funniest darn 1 you'll ever want to watch. see the giant blur flash across the screen! where did it come from? what is it? it flies, it terrifies, it's electrifying, it's on strings! this bird has real personality. i was about ten when i saw it for the first time, and when big bird appeared on sesame street, i was sure they were one and the same!
