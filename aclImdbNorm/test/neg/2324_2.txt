in need of work, straight man bud abbott (as jack) and comic partner lou costello (as dinkel) get the latter a job babysitting self-described "problem child" david stollery (as donald). young stollery winds up reading mr. costello's favorite novel (see if you can guess the title), which puts costello to sleep, dreaming he and mr. abbott are reliving the story of "jack and the beanstalk" (you guessed it).<br /><br />the sepia-tone switches to color for the bulk of the production. apparently, this was an attempt at something different for the duo, a colorful children's fantasy. it fails, but this is where you get to see abbott & costello in color, silent film superstar william farnum (as the king) make his last performance a bit part, boxer max baer's brother buddy, and stollery before disney's "spin and marty".<br /><br />** jack and the beanstalk (4/4/52) jean yarbrough ~ lou costello, bud abbott, buddy baer, william farnum
