i think i win the "bargain" contest for this movie, since i got it as part of a "martial arts movie classics" dvd collection with 50 movies for 20 bucks, which means i paid something like 50 cents for the chance to watch the "black fist" version of a movie that was released as "bogard." <br /><br />for a basic "revenge" flick, "black fist" isn't too bad, even though it is obviously hampered by a low budget. one of my informal "rules of thumb" for watching a movie is that if the lead actor is better than his production and screenplay, the movie automatically gets at least three stars. that is certainly the case here; lawson has some presence and some charisma, and probably deserved a better film career than he got. <br /><br />the street fight choreography (the ostensible reason for the film) really won't to impress anyone who has ever sparred in a martial arts school or even just been punched in a schoolyard fight. i only spent about two years learning basic kung fu, but even i would never fall for the front "stamp" kicks, arm drags, and roundhouse punches on display here. but the atmosphere is good - dust and blood and shouting crowds, and the actors put some feeling into the fight scenes. <br /><br />less believable is the plot. dawson's character "leroy fisk", is portrayed as a street-smart, sharp young man who goes looking for work as a pick-up fighter in illegal, unsanctioned street matches. yet he is surprised and indignant when he has to pay off the cops? excuse me, but i was raised in small town iowa and even *i* knew (from watching "hard times" with charles bronson) that the cops have to be paid off for this sort of action, and that the guys who fight needed the fixers in order to get their matches, and that the fixers were worth the money. so you have to watch this movie with a sort of willful suspension of your critical faculties in order to accept it as a "black brother being repressed" movie. (most of the other non-black fighters in the stable get punched in the face for the same deal too,yes?).<br /><br />the movie suffers from a short attention span. the director obviously didn't have the budget to film some of the scenes he needed, so he had to fill in the gaps with some fairly ludicrous exposition scenes (the "i wined him, i dined him, and then i killed him" scene just doesn't work) along with voice-overs and montages that are clumsy and unconvincing. this is especially true with the whole romance angle which seems to have been filmed as if it were an afterthought. this is a little shoddy when you consider that the death of "fisk's" wife's death is supposed to fuel his drive for revenge.<br /><br />but, once the movie switches all the way from "young fighter rising through the ranks" to the revenge theme, it picks up a little steam and plays with a little more conviction. i'm not sure that the final payoff is worth the buildup - roger ebert calls this sort of thing "a long drive for a short day at the beach"..but it does tie things off in a reasonably satisfying way. <br /><br />if sylvester stallone had made this film with a real budget and the same cast, slicker sets and costumes, and himself as the hero, people would have hailed it as the next "rocky", which goes to show you how circumstance and chance can play havoc with would-be filmmakers' dreams. <br /><br />worth seeing once for various decent shots and lines and to watch dabney coleman embarrass himself in a role that is beneath him.
