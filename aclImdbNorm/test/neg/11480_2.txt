this should be re-named "everybody loves sebastian". the 1983 rural go-nowhere town high school junior (or senior? - they seemed to flip flop on that one) with weird hair and "leo-like" good looks has a big plate full of issues. his step-dad announces definite plans to have a sex-change operation, upon which his mom calls the marriage quits; sebastian is called the "f" word by everyone and their mother, all-the-while "kissing around" with various girls, getting high on ready-whip at a supermarket, and saving a "strawberry" prostitute from the clutches of her ruthless pimp.<br /><br />sebastian's "buddies" make eddie haskal look like a choir boy; bad association doesn't get much worse. sebastian seems to go for "harold's" suicide attempts record (although he won't admit suicidal tendanccies). for no apparent reason the genius level sat scoring sebastian must graduate a year early, although he has no clue about the future, nor does he want to attend college (what gives with this nonsense?).<br /><br />this film is a look into a few weeks in the life of someone who is pretty messed up. the final scene suggests that things will be alright, although the how is left entirely up to the viewer.<br /><br />the makers of this film seem to bank solely on the undisputed appeal of the very attractive male lead. the "story" leaves a lot to be desired. looking for "what will this gorgeous kid do next...?" doesn't exactly satisfy. the lackluster production values just don't measure up to other films, independent or otherwise. a low budget and weak story need more than a pretty face to carry it through. the "results" of this project are forgettable and an insult to intelligent cinema fans.
