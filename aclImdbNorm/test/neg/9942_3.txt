this is among one of many usa attempts of remaking a old classic british tv show, that's more famous than this one. from what i see none of you haven't mentioned or even acknowledged that you knew there was a tv 50's-60's called "secret agent man" the original secret agent man starred the great patrick mcgoohan (the prisoner,braveheart,ice station zebra,the phantom, etc) a man who was tapped to be the first james bond, but he turned it down because mcgoohan was a very devout man and he considered james bond's bed hopping and violent ways to be against his values.<br /><br />this show was done in black and white, and it's a pity for those who haven't seen it,you are missing out on a lot. the character mr. mcgoohan played in "secret agent man" was named drake, and after he finished with that show he went on to the do the very popular though at times bizarre and controversial tv series called "the prisoner". the character he played in "the prisoner" was that of a agent who's identity is not revealed is kidnapped and transported to a island where he does not know where he is or who it was that is responsible for kidnapping him. what he does know is that his captors want to know the reasons behind his resignation from the british secret service, and on this island the populace don't have names but they are referred to by numbers and patricks character is assigned a number which is "6" it was argued that his prisoner character was in fact the same character he played in secret agent man but mcgoohan himself disputed this.<br /><br />ofourse there is the unmistakable famous theme song that the original secret agent man spawned. it was written by johnny rivers a famous 50's and 60's pop musician and from what i read some of you are actually think that the song comes from this version of the show. you're very wrong about that. it was johnny's and it comes from the original tv series so let me help to set the facts straight. to those of you who complained about the name of the show being stupid, well in england, it was actually called "danger man" and in the us it was retitled "secret agent man" for such a supposedly stupid name the show did well enough when it was first aired.<br /><br />granted this current show has little to do with the original, no such main character named drake in this one, and i guess they did their best to make this show their version of "secret agent man". but it does use the redone version of the original theme song so that does tell you that this show was indeed meant to be a redone albeit however inferior redone version of the original series.
