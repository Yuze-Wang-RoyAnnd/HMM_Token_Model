this has to be one of the worst movies i have seen. i tried to like this movie but they managed to mess up practically every individual aspect that pertain to this film! cheap dialogue, no character development, no tension, not enough story to pull you in, no action apart from some really cheap scenes. it seems they tried some things on the set and said to each other "hey this looks rather cool, why not put this in there" after which the director probably said "yeah....yeah this is genius!" and got back to snorting coke or something. when it comes to acting i think the only person that tried to make the movie worked is daan schuurmans but in the end it is all for nothing. cause this movie sucks!! 2/10
