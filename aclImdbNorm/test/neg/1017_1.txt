director fabio barreto got a strange academy nominea for his last movie o quatrilho. quatrilho is a bad movie, but in bella donna, barreto did one of the worst movies of all time. his adaptation of the novel riacho doce is ridiculous. think with me how poor brazilians fishermen speak a perfect english? in the film they do. there isn't a screenplay, it's only a very long videoclip with a beautiful places and many sex scenes with moscovis and henstridge.
