once again, i fell for it, in my roots i crave a fun and gory horror film, even a vampire one. even if it's stupid, as long as i get my fun gore in the mix, i'm a happy camper, it doesn't take much. so i saw the cover of "bled" over at hollywood video and was kind of curious what it was about, it looked kind of interesting, so i decided to rent it. why? why do i always fall for it? not only did this movie not fulfill the satisfaction i needed for my gore and senseless violence and nudity, but i was bored out of mind. this movie has the kahoonies to say it's a vampire movie and it's really not! i'm so close to going back to the store and begging for money back because this is one of the rare times i actually turned the movie off.<br /><br />an artist meets a vampire, i think, dunno, i'm still trying to figure out what the heck he was but his name was reinfield, so i'm assuming maybe he's a cockroach eating guy who likes to freak people out? i think, i dunno. anyways, he thinks the artist has a certain flare for darkness, so he gives her a drug to go into an alternate fantasy where a vampire exists and needs blood to become alive? i think, i dunno. so her friends get excited and decide they wanna try the drug too, i think, i dunno. so after they decide to try the drug, things get weird, the fantasies are real, i think, i dunno, and the vampire is now enjoying the will big breasted girls in scandly clad clothing. i think, i dunno. but a couple of the girls really end up being vampires? i think, i dunno.<br /><br />sorry for all the "i dunno's", this is possibly one of the worst reviews i'm going to write, but that's because this movie was just awful, boring, and confusing. i love just seeing these wanna be actors who you can tell are waiters looking for that "big break". not too smart that they fell in the clich'e of the horror genre, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, in this case, they really should have read the script. because the movie, the look, the feel, the acting, everything about this movie was just bad, i really recommend that you just pass the movie if you see it at your video store. this possibly could have been an interesting movie with it's concept of a different dimension, but why did they pick this director to display his "creativity" if he even has any? this was a bad movie, just stay away.<br /><br />1/10
