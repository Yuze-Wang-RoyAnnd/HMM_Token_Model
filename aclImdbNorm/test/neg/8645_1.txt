i went to see this film at the cinema on the strength of its potentially interesting subject matter, good cast, a director who had previously done the highly-rated "once were warriors" and my liking for noir-ish films set in l.a. in the forties and fifties. i would argue that i am reasonably easy to please in this film category; i appreciate the classics of the genre but i will sit through and enjoy a half-decent if derivative effort as well. however, i found this film completely unbearable.<br /><br />despite a good situation in which to place the story, nobody seems to do or say anything remotely interesting or entertaining in the whole two-hours plus of this sorry mess. good actors are wasted in endless scenes of dialogue ranging from banal to embarrassing. the narrative is slack and drags unbearably, and none of the events it depicts is handled well enough to do anything other than bore the audience to death. there is no drama, no atmosphere, no tension, absolutely no entertainment value and by the end i simply didn't care what happened because i did not believe in anything in the film.<br /><br />l.a. confidential came out a year later and regardless of whether one version of the story is more true-to-life, the latter film deservedly gets all the plaudits for its excellence in every department. mulholland falls by contrast fails in every department, a fact made all the more tragic by the amount of talent involved. if they ever show this on a plane i will still walk out.
