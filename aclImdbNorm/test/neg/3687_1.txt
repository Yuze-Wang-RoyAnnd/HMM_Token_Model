i never made any comment here on imdb, but as i saw this movie, i cant be quiet. i just set up my account here only because this horrible movie. in two words, this movie is pure crap. the movie has no sense at all! nothing makes sense in this movie. watching this movie was pain all the way. i don't understand why val kilmer agreed to do this movie. he plays a minor role as a gang leader, says few words, and he is there like 5 minutes total.<br /><br />i bought this dvd based only because of val kilmer name on the box and the interesting pictures on the cover.<br /><br />as was stated in other review, moscow zero stole my money and i want it back!!! the title of the movie itself brought the clue about the rating everyone should give it: zero
