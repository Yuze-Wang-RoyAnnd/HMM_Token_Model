huge, waddling, grimacing tree trunk menaces fake "natives" on a "pacific atoll" (looking suspiciously like southern ca...), reaking havok and revenge. unlike the silly stumps in "navy vs the night monsters", the tabonga is actually a full-grown man-tree. well, grown in 2 days: moost have od'ed on those miracle grow spikes...anycow, it comes not from hell, but from the grave of a fake native, kimo(greg palmer, "the zombies of mora tau"), murdered by the native elders for hanging out with those awful american scientists. the scientists include dr. william arnold (tod andrews, "hang 'em high", "beneath the planet of the apes") and professor clark(john mcnamara,"war of the colossal beast"). rounding out the cast is linda watkins("the parent trap") as the obnoxious mrs. kilgore, the obvious comic relief spurting out an obvious fake "cockney" accent. a stellar cast indeed!! anycow, because his doughy, vacant wife, korey, played amateurishly by suzanne ridgeway("love's a-poppin'"), helps set him up, kimo declares his revenge on her and all of the elders. then, the dopey american scientists uproot the tree, bring it back to life "in the name of science", & allows it to slowly amble about the island, killing off everyone who has done him wrong. of course, we all know that evil monsters carry off fair maidens, so the tabonga grabs plucky female scientist dr. terry mason(tina carver, "hell on frisco bay") & waddles off with her. vine-ally, a good shot with a remmington hits a knife lodged in the tabonga, and it falls over dead into the quicksand. this laughably foolish cowncept is one of the all-time cheesy howlers. the tabonga is arguably the slowest monster in moovie history, right up there with the clanky, over-built robot from "robot monster vs the aztec mummy" and the perversly slow carpet monster from "creeping terror". try not to laugh as you watch the tabonga toss fake natives down hills & into quicksand, dodge spears, and lumber slowly about the "island". shady writing, wooden performances, and sappy direction all point that this pulpy fertilizer has far mooore bark than bite. this tepid pile of wood chips was the last hurrah from long-time editor-turned-director dan milner, who quickly vanished into well-deserved obscurity following this film. you herd it through the grapevine from the moocow first: "from hell it came" is a compost classic!! :
