admittedly, the only reason i watched this film -- since it's been about a decade since it was released -- was because of ian holm; i was intrigued to see his portrayal of my second-favorite character in this play. at any rate, this film is as gritty as anything the old zeff has produced since "jesus of nazareth." but some of the best parts of the play have been left out. i understand the directing/editing choices, but i don't think that it really does justice to the play. perhaps i'm too much a purist. i would have to direct people (who have read this far) toward branagh's version, if it weren't that i despise his tendency toward over-dramatization. all the same, he plays a better hamlet than gibson. but then, weren't we all waiting for gibson to prove himself as an actor? now, all he's done is to prove that he wants to make films in extinct languages.<br /><br />...perhaps the only shakespearean-worthy acting here is scofield as the ghost.
