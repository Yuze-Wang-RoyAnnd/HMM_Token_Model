this is an astonishingly bad action film. i'd say its primary flaw is that it's boring. arghh! funky wardrobes, retro chic set design, and decent cinematography cannot prevent this flick from being a snoozer. mod squad's second (major) flaw is its lack of character development--underscored by the actors' lack of talent. i tend to like claire danes's work so i was quite surprised by her non-existent performance in this film. giovanni ribisi is woefully miscast: how could his cotton-mouthed, bumbling acting style possibly fit into an action flick? as for omar epps, well, he needs to take a few acting lesson to learn how to emote. the man had the same facial expression for the entire film! my suggestion is to save yourself a few bucks and wait to see this turkey on cable.
