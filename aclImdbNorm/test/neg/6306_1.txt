great balls of fire is the movie you show to someone you really, really hate. it is absolute torture of the highest rank and is probably used by minions of a foreign power to extract info from captured intelligence agents. i've enjoyed some of dennis quaid's performances in the past, but he goes totally over the top in this film. he doesn't so much cross the line, he pole vaults over it, then comes back to jump over and over again. he struts and mugs as if on some incredibly bad acid trip. it's one of those rare performances where you wish you could enter the film and beat the man within an inch of his life for doing something so truly awful. was he desperate to win a golden raspberry or some other award for bad acting? that's the only conclusion i can come up with. thank you dennis, you gave us a bad performance for the ages. where was the director to reign in this guy?<br /><br />the opposite end of the extreme is winona ryder, she of the plastic features and plastic acting. i came across a review of her acting style that compared her to a wax dummy. that was of course an insult to wax dummies all over the earth, all of whom could have brough more humanity to the role of jerry's underage cousin/wife. this brings up the film's mixed up message, that being it is 100% okay to marry your own cousin and have a child by the union. i fail to see what is so "okay" about that, but it looks as though hollywood thinks that underage incest is hunky dory. talk about "family values."<br /><br />another problem is the format. is it a stright forward re telling of lewis' life, or is it a musical? i'm not talking about the music, i'm talking about the truly weird scene where jerry drives up to the school, starts to belt out a tune and everyone starts to dance like it was broadway musical in search of a tony. fantasy and reality are thrown together in a mix that does not work. but who really cares? i don't. and neither should you. you can't get back the minutes of life you would waste on this film. so don't waste your time, it's too precious for something this misguided and poor.
