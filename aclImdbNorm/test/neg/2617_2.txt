retro puppet master is complete and utter crap.in particular,the puppets look stupid,and crappy.the acting was unforgivable and the story was rancid.this movie goes back into the the past,where the dolls where first created,thats not puppet master.retro puppet master is rated pg-13,the first puppet master to be rated pg-13.the movie contains no horror,or suspense.the fact that this movie was a puppet master film boggles the mind,because this installment doesnt have the buckets of blood,good acting,or any entertaiment like the previous movies did.dont see this movie,dont rent it,and dont even watch it f its on tv,because this film is stale,not violent,and completely crappy.2 out of 10.as a puppet master fan,i am disappointed...seriously.
