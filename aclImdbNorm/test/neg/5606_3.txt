this movie was really bad. i mean really really bad. the scenes were like from a parody and special effect sucked a lot. and it was filmed in 2003!!! i think this was a great waste of time and money and michael shanks with his 'shaggy from scooby doo' image just made me laugh. never waste your time with this picture... i really don't know what the director was thinking after seeing the final cut of this movie but the fights were so unrealistic that it hurt my eyes to look on them. the 'latex cat women' fighters were like sheep just rolling around the scenes and looking frightened around like they had no clue what to do on the scene... i think this is a beautiful example of bottom 100 picture.
