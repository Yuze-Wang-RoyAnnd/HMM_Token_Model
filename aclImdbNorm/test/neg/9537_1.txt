i like bad films, but this thing is a steaming heap. from the shaky cameramen to the horrible sound and devastating acting, don't waste a second on this pile. fifth graders could have made a better film and first graders could have written a better script. want a real synopsis? ugly chicks in neon bikinis dancing for way too long. a disjointed plot made worse by hideous acting. the on-location sets weren't even passable. the church scenes take place in a dance studio, and oh yeah - what's with the two tap-dance numbers that come up out of the blue?<br /><br />oh, and the total number of naked breasts, which couldn't have even saved this film - 0. add this one to the trash heap.
