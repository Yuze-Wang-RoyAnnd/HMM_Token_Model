i feel dumber after watching the first 20 min,luckily i walked out and saved the rest of my brain, people should watch better films and take notes on why they are rated highly,not because of the budget of the film or the special effects, just simply good acting and getting simple things right,and most importantly--not being lame--, but i guess this was produced for those sheeple without taste and not a clue of what is ''a good movie''don't be scared of rating films low,save your under-appreciated high scores for ''once in a life time movies''. keep in mind that many use imdb for trusted reviews and opinions,don't spoil the broth by sugarcoating turds peace & love
