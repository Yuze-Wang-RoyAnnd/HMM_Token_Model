i think the problem with some reactions to this film is that - with few exceptions - they don't focus on the main disconnect, hence the main split in the audience.<br /><br />on the one side, there are those who are taken by the visual design, pretty costumes, and variety of elements going into the film. some children's movie fans love the colour and animation, and all the un-scary 'magical' effects, shapeshifting animals, and so on. some culture vultures like the complicated references, the layerings of different folklore elements, and the fact that they can watch zhang ziyi singing and quasi-miming, in two different languages, in what really was intended to be a children's comedy.<br /><br />on the other side, there are those who say that a children's movie should still have a point, that a blend of folktales is not a tale at all, and that it's easier to believe in magic when enough thought and care has gone into the technical aspects to make it seem real.<br /><br />in other words, the ideas could be lovely; but when you put them onstage they have to deliver. here, they don't.<br /><br />a good folktale - from any country - has a clear story, a point, and characters who interact strongly with each other. this lacks them all. a few over-sophisticated gestures to opera, western and japanese, are no replacement for a solid theme.<br /><br />as a fantasy fan, i must say that i've sat through some turkeys and loved a few, but this one really tries to do too many things - cheaply. putting in zhang ziyi to try to add a little glitter smacks of exotic flower syndrome. the other problem isn't that there's no plot; there's half a plot, which means that you keep getting pulled in, then dropped again as another none-too-sharply-executed dance number kicks off.<br /><br />the characters all seem to know that they're starring in a movie. unless you really like watching other peoples' amateur video, this ain't good. i'd like to test this on real children; i think they'd drop it for uproar in heaven after about 20 minutes.
