an aging roger moore is back yet again as bond, this time trying to find out why agent 009 was killed, and why he had a forgery of a faberge egg with him, and where it came from. he ends up in new delhi india, then in east germany after finding out about a russian general trying to detonate a nuclear bomb at a circus, hoping nato will push for complete disarmament, so he can take control of western europe, then the rest of the world.<br /><br />despite the way it sounds, this is really more of a romance, i think, between bond and octopussy than an action movie, and longish, but still somewhat fun. but there are way too many attempts at humour in this one; at times it seems like it was intended to be a comedy. also, timothy dalton would have been better than roger moore in this, so there wouldn't have been so much of an age difference between bond and octopussy. <br /><br />useless trivia: the small plane used by bond in the pre credits sequence is now hanging up in a quaker steak and lube restaurant in clearwater/ largo area florida, usa.<br /><br />**1/2 out of ****
