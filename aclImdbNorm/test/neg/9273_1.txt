this was touted as a sequel to crash dive, which was a very good film in the low budget category. i assumed this movie would be good also, but boy was i wrong. first, this movie has nothing to do with crash dive other than they both take place on submarines. secondly, the plot can be slow, tedious, and in some cases, totally preposterous.<br /><br />this movie will not hold most people's attention. (i remember reading a book during the slow, boring scenes.) there will be scenes that are supposed to be used for dramatic effect that will make the viewer laugh out loud. the corkscrew scene is definitely one. after i got over my initial shock that anyone would slip this in and not know people would not only disbelieve it but laugh at the sheer silliness of it, i was able to find humor in it.<br /><br />if you want to see md in a good sub flick, watch crash dive and leave this lame film on the shelf.
