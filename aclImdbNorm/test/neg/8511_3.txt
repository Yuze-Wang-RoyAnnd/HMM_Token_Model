i was a still photographer working in europe the summer that jim salter shot the movie three.<br /><br />i did some swell pictures for him, one of which i was told became the poster for the movie. i didn't see the film until years later. i thought it was bad. a pity, because the elements that went into it were compelling. robie porter's girlfriend was almast as beautiful as rampling herself. salter asked if i would stick around and be an extra cameraman so they wouldn't have to shoot everything twice. i said sure, but i had to return to ny, promising i'd be back. alas, i never did get back. one of life's unsung melodies.<br /><br />i wish i could post the pictures i made somewhere.<br /><br />rowland scherman
