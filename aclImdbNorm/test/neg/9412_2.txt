i went into this movie determined to like it. i usually enjoy dramas like wall street, glen gary glen ross, boiler room, etc...i went into this movie thinking i would be on the edge of my seat. plus, i am a big pacino fan.<br /><br />what a piece of garbage. quite possibly the worst movie i have seen in five years. this makes pacino's debacle in any given sunday actually look good. first, half the movie is watching matthew mcconaughey lift weights. ok, we get it. you are in shape matt. we don't need to see every other scene with you pumping iron, shirtless.<br /><br />secondly, how many plot holes are in this movie? why introduce the phone call from brandon's long lost dad and never address it again? what was the point of his mom hanging up on him - why even have her call to say he is sending her too much money - what was the point of that? the guy from puerto rico who lost 30 million? also, since sports betting is illegal in ny, and its acknowledged its illegal, how can they possibly guarantee everyone's bet at the end? <br /><br />this was simply a very poorly written script. it had potential, but it was devoid of a coherent plot. i thought pacino learned his lesson about script selection after any given sunday, but apparently not. my gosh, this is the same actor that starred in the godfather! <br /><br />don't waste your money.
