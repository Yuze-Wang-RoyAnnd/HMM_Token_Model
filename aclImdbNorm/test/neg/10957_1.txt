unreal !!!!!!!!. after reading the initial reviews posted by alleged reviewers ,i was shocked to find that almost all of the initial reviews, 38 , all rated this film a 10. upon comparison with other great films, these reviewers felt that the quick and the undead is a better film than,the 6th sense(8.2), saving private ryan(8.4), lord of the rings( 8.7),godfather(9.5), gladiator(8.1) and dawn of the dead ( 7.8) to name a few. hopefully these shills utilize their next discounted lasik procedure, that they hear of, because it is completely obvious that these reviews have been falsified.<br /><br />i was led to believe that this film featured a unique concept in the genre of zombie film making. sadly upon watching the quick and the undead , it is obvious that these reviews were generated by people who either were involved in the production, or have a vested interest in the films marketability / financial success. nothing cements this in my mind more than hearing that a portion of this film was shot in texas, were, coincidentally allot of the early posting praising the film are from. the zombie film / horror b movie culture on a whole is a forgiving group, but this film is sadly beyond any redemption. the characters are recycled,and the plot poor.the film quality was not bad enough to be labeled camcorder,and at least they used a film quality camera . the acting is horrible, the star trying unsuccessfully to come off as a clint eastwood wanna be clone. christ on a bike !!!!!! even the lead actor's name is clint. he was just terrible. the only resemblance to clint eastwood, is that the lead is using the "wood" from eastwood's name in his style of acting. the zombie makeup was above halloween party quality , but not applied completely to the full undead cast members. allot of zombies were not made up on their hands. the plot was so hokey that it had me hoping for a power outage, a blemish on the dvd disk, or that the zombies would turn their attention on the director. maybe the film has worth to some viewers, but not for my hard earned dollar. luckily i used my free rental coupon to check out this dvd. maybe this film will be rescued by nott entertainment ( aptly named) releasing a special collectors dvd, which will tie up loose flaws, and deliver the promised goods??? some how , i think nott !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! lets just hope that their next release , the flesh keeper is truly a "keeper" of a film ..and not a 5th generation recycled version of the texas chainsaw massacre. fingers crossed here folks...but only if you care.
