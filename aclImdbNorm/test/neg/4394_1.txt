when i went to the video rental shop to get a movie i saw this one and i immediately thought it would be funny. the picture made it seem like a classic comedy type involving teenagers (such as road trip)which i thought would be worth watching. when i turned the move on i was disappointed as the jokes were awful and cheesy. the only bit which the director may have thought would be funny was somebody slipping over on a wet floor. this is not a joke and would not make people laugh. i actually considered turning this movie off coming to half way through. i was annoyed with this movie as it was just a waste of time and money renting it out. not enough care was taken making this film and not enough time and work put into it. i found the acting to be quite bad as well. the only time i laughed was at the extremely bad 'jokes'or actions done which were really not funny!!!. i rate this film a 1/10. i hope you found this comment useful.
