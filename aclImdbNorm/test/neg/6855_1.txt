this rubber monsters failed trying to be cool,scary or even comedians,looks like a wannabe movie of porkys or animals house but the sequences and history is not always clear also can't catch your attention all the movie looks cheap and with an amazing bad taste,the only thing that's makes you laugh is the awful rubber monsters who must have a cost of one dollar each,because the work or them never looks realistic,the movements and expressions make looks the muppets as a pixar 3d movie when you compare with this. hope marie carlton is the only thing that makes supportable this awful movie,and when she dies in the movie,this turns even worst than before.a movie who only must be seen in fast forward.
