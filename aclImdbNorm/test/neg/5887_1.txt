at the least some of the sitcoms that churn endlessly out of the us are honestly bad. this junk, however, portrays a "heart warming" parenty side to a clothes horse. acting laughably "learnt" with glances and phrases delivered in the "i'm so important and thin and beautiful" fashion. in the episode i just sat agog through, someone's "job" was at risk simply because a colleague had "placed" a phone call, slagging her capabilities off ... !! really, this is the lowest of the low. what kind of damage does this foist on the watching masses, seeing only glitzy glam-puss people parading around "working". utterly sick making. when the titles rolled, i thought, oh well, it provided jobs for the boys. you know who you are.
