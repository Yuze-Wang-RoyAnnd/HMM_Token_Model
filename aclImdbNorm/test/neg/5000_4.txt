zombie movies are hot, i love 'em. can't get enough. why i would purchase a film of this caliber goes without explanation, i just really love zombies. surprise, this really isn't much of a zombie movie; low-budget i can handle, being duped just irritates me.<br /><br />a group of horror-film clich'es hold up in a warehouse/lab/who-knows-what to escape a fire storm outside. panic, yelling, low-light, and (eventually) zombies ensue.<br /><br />i kind of feel bad for the film makers, as it is obvious that they really thought they were putting together something good; a serious, scary horror film. it isn't, far from it, it's a boring mess of wooden acting, cheesy fx, poor lighting, excessive dialogue, and over editing.<br /><br />things first go awry when it takes a good 10+ minutes for the characters to ever sit down and start to figure out what is going on. it gets worse when another 20 minutes go by and they are still sitting around trying to figure out what is going on. all of this is littered with non-acting and bad dialogue.<br /><br />finally some one gets attached (not by a zombie though) and hope flickers just a touch before the characters are again lounging around whining (the only emotion any one every generates) about how much this sucks. me too guys, me too.<br /><br />finally zombies are in the mix, but no one watching cares any more. i think there was some blood and gore tossed in, but i was too busy praying for the credits to roll to notice. and when the screen finally did fade to black i felt even more cheated by the pointlessly 'cube' inspired ending.<br /><br />i will give credit for trying very hard, even if it failed miserably. that and the punk chick was very hot if totally under used.<br /><br />can't really recommend this to anyone, save for film students looking for 'no-no' pointers.<br /><br />4/10
