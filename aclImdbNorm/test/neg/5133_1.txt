i loved heavenly creatures and make it a point to catch it whenever it is on.<br /><br />so, imagine my delight when i discovered love & suicide while browsing netflix. echoing heavenly creatures, an easy choice, to the top of my queue it went.<br /><br />i watched it last, made myself comfy, and waited. what i thought was some crappy preview of a stoned high school student's prank film project (i laughed out loud once or twice, thinking "that just lowered the bar of straight to video") turned out to be the movie. horrible acting, amateur direction, weak dialog. i usually enjoy low budget films, there is something tangible and real about them because they cannot afford the superficial stuff to distract from the "meat"
