is it just me or are most of the actors in this adaptation miscast age-wise? <br /><br />jemma redgrave, although a superior actress, seems as if she should be joining her children instead of nodding off on the couch. (i would have loved to see brenda blethlyn in the part, her connection to the latest pride and prejudice notwithstanding.)<br /><br />blake ritson and rory kinnear were the only two whom i felt lived up to their characters in spirit and performance. every else looked confused or out of place. <br /><br />luckily, i'm not very familiar with dr. who (i've only seen a few episodes so far) or it would have definitely soured this further. <br /><br />too bad mansfield park has not yet seen its due on screen (either large or small). this novel requires the talent of a robert altman to balance all the complexities of the characters successfully.
