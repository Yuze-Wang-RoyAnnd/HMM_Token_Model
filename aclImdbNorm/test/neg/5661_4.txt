the first time i watched this show it was ok. there were some funny moments and i laughed a couple of times but this show is getting worse and worse. carly and sam's web show is not the least bit funny. they play a stupid video from the internet, scream at the camera and make some very bad jokes. and then the laugh track goes off?! one problem with the show is that none of the main characters are funny. carly is not funny. miranda cosgrove's acting is lackluster at best. her acting in this show is nothing like her acting from drake and josh. her friend sam is very rude and crude and the show is written in a way that makes her look like some kind of hillbilly. i mean they make jokes about her mom driving a rusty old truck, her mom smashing an old tv with a bat, and then there's the jokes about sam failing in school, getting detention all the time and running from cops. none of that is funny at all. then there's freddy who is a computer geek. he isn't too funny unless his mom is treating him like a baby. the show's only somewhat funny full time character is carly's brother spencer. he makes some funny jokes and does some pretty funny things like pretending to drive a space ship while making spaceship noises, knocking over a girl scouts' cookie table for revenge as they did the same thing to him. his material is the only thing worth laughing at. aside from the characters other things make the show bad too. like the fact that a couple of kids doing a local web show from a seattle apartment is a worldwide hit and got them a free trip to tokyo? another thing is that how can a 26 year old single guy with no real job can pay for a 2 level apartment in downtown seattle and raise his 13 year old sister and pay for a room full of camera and sound equipment including a remote controlled projector and a green screen and an hd camera? this sounds like it was written by a 10 year old. the worst thing is that the show contains some pretty questionable content. there are a couple of times when carly(remember a 13 year old girl) appears on her internet web show in a bikini top. wtf? then i saw an episode where freddy tells carly and sam that he "slept in just his socks the night before." i mean wtf? then there's an episode where carly's rival nevel blackmails her by taking her website rights and agrees to give her the website back in exchange for a kiss. creepy! and i just saw an episode where carly meets a boy who just moved into their apartment building and he has some kind of back injury and he takes off his shirt and carly stands there drooling over him. i can't believe nick even lets them show that kind off stuff and i can't believe that this was created by the same guy responsible for drake and josh. this show is not appropriate for kids under the age of 12 and that's even questionable. icarly is just another addition to the long list of awful nick programming.
