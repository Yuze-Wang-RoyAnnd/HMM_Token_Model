i bought this dvd as part of a set of 50 "historic classics." it's hardly a classic, and as the plot was updated to the time of its release, is not historic either. the actual title on the dvd is "indecent," and additionally subtitled "the private life of becky sharp." myrna loy is not very convincing, although in her defense she is saddled with an awful script and trite dialogue. as with many early talkies, and especially ones made by smaller studios, there is little skill demonstrated by the cast and crew. loy does wear a few gowns that are quite stylish, but her costumes and make-up in the later scenes are overdone. the one saving grace is a tolerable performance by billy bevan, who plays one of her many suitors
