before hitting international acclaim with the silence of the lambs, director jonathan demme cut his teeth making quirky comedies. this was one of them and like quite a few oscar winning american comedies i could mention, it has a fine concept, is well paced, has great performances, a complicated romance. but it just simply isn't very funny. pfeiffer is mob widow who moves to the city backwaters after her husband (baldwin) is murdered. the crime boss who killed him (stockwell) takes a fancy to pfeiffer, his wife (reuhl) is furious and to complicate matters pfeiffer also falls for the cop who is trailing her. all of this should have been a laugh a minute. pfeiffer, sporting a hefty wig is excellent as the widow, as is the hyperactive ruehl and modine is good too as the nice cop. but the script is simply devoid of one-liners, wit, humour or punch lines of the verbal or physical kind that this kind of film demands. the result is it raises smiles at best rather than guffaws. it oozes charm, but is tediously short on humour.
