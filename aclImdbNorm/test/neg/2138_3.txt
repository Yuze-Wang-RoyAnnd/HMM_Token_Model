sometimes it's hard to judge how bad a film made in italy or spain really is, because they all seem to use the same stable of 9-10 esl trained voice actors to supply the english voices for release in the us. and things are always lost in translation anyway -dialog, character shtick and plot elements written for the expectations of european audiences may not go too well with our american ideas of what is funny, hip, or dramatic. i imagine that the team responsible for making the translation for the sound track of this movie to english had about 3 days to do it from start to finish, and they probably each earned the equivalent of an installment payment on their used fiat to do it. in other words, pure hackwork, tossed off in one or two takes and never reviewed or redone by someone with a real ear for the american language.<br /><br />watching "devil fish", i can imagine that if you were an italian watching this presented in your native language, you might find it a mildly amusing little piece of fluff. you'd laugh at the 'in jokes' and the amusing drunk, you'd gasp at the monster and the villainy of the bad guys, and you'd ogle at the attractive pair of peter and not-quite-daryll hannah as they couple on the beach for no apparent reason in the middle of a search for clues about a man-eating monster who has already killed one of their friends.<br /><br />but since the jarring voice acting and tin-eared dialog keep yanking we americans out of the film experience, we can't help but notice that the editors had serious attention deficit disorder, that no one on screen can really act so much as project an attitude, that the stated reason for the creation of the monster makes absolutely no sense, that the action sequences have all the impact of a cereal bowl full of cooked oatmeal and that the director, screenwriters and producers really hate women.<br /><br />don't even think about buying or renting this movie - watch only on cable tv on saturday afternoon with one of several beers in your fist, or with the help and protection of mike and the bots on mst3k.
