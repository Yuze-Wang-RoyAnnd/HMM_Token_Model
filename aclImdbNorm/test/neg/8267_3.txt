i found this an awfully disappointing experience! but i have appended a better option of similar style at the foot of this entry.<br /><br />this "felicia's journey" is intriguing. it has drama. but it is full of stereo-types! <br /><br />so it only serves judgemental temperaments without concern for truer justice & fairness & truth, beyond black 'n' white judgements that fit 30-second ads of "news" that dot our multimedia experiences everyday, especially news bulletins, true or misleading in such depictions! <br /><br />it is so exaggerated, it reminds me of the fairytale of "little red ridinghood"! consider the innocent young girl with no identification crossing borders questioned by a guard but freed without any evidence to venture on in search of her 'romeo' who didn't give her an address versus the pathetically inept lack of substance in the raspy voice of the 'helping hand' befriending her with his unlikely story fabricated by the layer! <br /><br />it seems to suit the directors & management team that no-one has faith or prays to god, even in their times of desperation! <br /><br />so in these early settings, it orchestrates & tells much of what is to come! a nightmare journey that betrays the essence of substance without fairytale resolution, without truth or integrity or credibility! ...then one twist & it's all over. what a disappointment! if you want to see a much superior movie that investigates similar themes with much more credibility, with much more powerful insight, watch the 1983 paul cox/norman kaye "man of flowers" movie!!! <br /><br />unlike here, you will not be disappointed!
