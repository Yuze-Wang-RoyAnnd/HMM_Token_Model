i love das boot. i hoped for something along similar lines -- a realistic war movie, portraying soliders and civilians on both sides as real people, with both the joy and pain of combat.<br /><br />unfortunately, stalingrad appears to have been written by a third grader and directed by a fifth-grade student. major pieces of the movie simply appear missing, leaving it completely disjointed. the dialogue in translation is ridiculous, but appears no better in the native tongue; you only have to watch the actors' faces during the bad moments of dialogue to realize just how bad this movie is.
