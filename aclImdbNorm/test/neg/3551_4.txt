not even original in the plot. ho hum. there were a couple of angles that could have been quite interesting, but the film follows the path of 90% of hollywood movies. i don't really "get" samuel jackson's acting most of the time in his other films, but he was rather good in this film. he rarely yelled and went much further in his character rather than reverting to an "in your face anger." i liked eva mendes - as usual - and even though she is great eye candy, she proves herself to be much more than that as an actress. luis guzman was actually really good also, except that i disliked the change of his character towards samuel jackson at the end of the film. how can one's character center around a dislike for a former cop and then turn into lollipop land within a split second? is there no original thought left in hollywood?
