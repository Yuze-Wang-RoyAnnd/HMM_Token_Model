today you die starts as honourable criminal harlan banks (producer steven seagal) is hired by sinister businessman max stevens (kevin tighe) to drive a security vehicle with $20,000,000 of cash in the back from point 'a' a las vegas casino to point 'b' him, sounds simple right? well what max forgot to tell harlan that the money is stolen & that he has just become the getaway driver in an armed robbery. bummer. things get even worse for harlan when the local cops catch him & chuck him in prison for a long time, however harlan managed to hide the money before he was caught & with a nice $20,000,000 at stake & unaccounted for harlan has to watch his back as the crooks want it as do government agents. harlan teams up with ice kool (!)(anthony 'teach' criss) in prison & they both manage to escape at which point harlan goes looking for some revenge...<br /><br />photographed & directed by don e. fauntleroy one has to say that the shot in eastern europe straight-to-video action films that steven seagal specialises in these days aren't getting any better & today you die is a good case in point. this is a terrible film, simple as that really. the script by producer danny lerner, kevin moore & les weldon gives seagal a new sort of character to get his none existent acting skills around, that of a criminal rather than some government agent/cop/soldier/one man army clich'e he usually plays. in fact if you were being charitable you could say today you die is a rip-off of mel gibson's excellent thriller payback (1998) where he too played a really nasty piece of work to such good effect. while payback was a superb uncompromising hard edged film noir type action thriller today you die isn't & pales into insignificance by comparison. unfortunately here seagal is terrible, he has no on screen presence or menace either & the audience is never quite sure whether he is meant to be a bad guy that we hate or not. for instance initially his character's is set up like a modern day robin hood as he steals from the rich drug dealers & scumbags to give to the poor (as well as keeping a tidy profit for himself) which is just ludicrous in itself but then it has seagal turn around & murder a lot of people which contradicts the likable criminal with morals that the film went to such lengths to set up in the first place. the story is full of holes, for instance agent knowles is contacted by the on the run harlan & is then reprimanded by her bent superior for meeting him & it turns out that he found out by tapped her phone. in that case why didn't her boss use the information he had to catch harlan? the story is the usual dull predictable bland fight over lots of money with surprise surprise the investigating government agent is actually a bad guy! wow, i didn't see that coming i must say...<br /><br />director fauntleroy slows everything down to a snails pace & today you die feels like it goes on forever, the action scenes & set-pieces are also severely lacking in entertainment value. the infrequent fight scenes aren't great, most are either shot in shadow, very quickly cut & edited or with the camera played behind seagal's character to try & disguise the fact that most of the stunt work done here is by a double. again seagal looks fat & out of shape & uses long baggy overcoats to try & hide it, it doesn't. there's a pretty cool car chase through the streets of las vegas in this at the start & i thought that today you die might be alright but it seems the whole sequence was stolen from another action film called top of the world (1997) which is about a las vegas casino robbery, as well as using footage from that film today you die also edits scenes from the charlie sheen action film no code of conduct (1998), the jean-claude van damme action film the order (2001) & the wesley snipes prison based action film undisputed (2002) so quite how much of today you die is original footage is anyone's guess.<br /><br />technically the film is alright, considering it's edited together from four separate films as well as it's own footage it's just about competent & consistent enough. all the footage of the us locations are obviously lifted from the films already mentioned with all the original footage shot on the cheap in bulgaria. the rap style music that litter today you die is awful by the way. the acting is poor & seagal just mumbles his way through his lines as usual.<br /><br />today you die is a really bad film made up from other bad action films, seagal looks old & fat, the action scenes are average at best & most of the story is fairly random & it doesn't come together at the end that well at all. one to avoid unless your a die hard seagal fan, if such an animal even exists...
