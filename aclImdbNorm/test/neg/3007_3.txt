this is one of the best looking films of the past few years. the fact that it was done on a virtual shoestring ($1.8 million or so they say on the dvd:they infer that they ended up with even less financing) makes it all the more impressive. not simply the photography, but the design and particularly the locations (eastern montana) which are at once authentically american and otherworldly.<br /><br />too bad there isn't a coherent movie to go with it. an extremely promising setup of the last 48 hours of clearing out a rural town in 1955 before it will be flooded for a dam is washed away with pretentious mumbo jumbo alluding to angels and a dying child. and what is presented as the "real world" is hopelessly arch. note to the polish brothers:the coen brothers are funny-you are not.<br /><br />no doubt many cineastes will find "northfork"'s abundant symbolism and inscrutability as marks of some sort of profundity, the sort that sophisticated types wrestle the night away with in coffeehouses while the braindead masses watch "charlie's angels" or something. (sigh) if you insist....<br /><br />in the meantime, recommended only as a case study for filmmakers for its' impeccable technical credits and photographic beauty.
