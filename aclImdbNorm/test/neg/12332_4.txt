"love life" explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a gay man. i found the subject matter compelling, even if the conflict was a bit forced and too easily resolved. for example, thomas falls for joe a little too quickly and conveniently for the plot. there are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene. in the end, i found myself more turned-on by this movie than moved. stephan d. gill has a pretty nice body and shows it all quite a few times with pornstar skill and exuberance, and all-too-often acting chops to match. many times, the movie seems like it is going to go full-on porn. stephanie kirchen does a fine job, but her moment of enlightenment at the end was sullied a bit for me, since i was in the mood for a good romp in the shower by the end of this movie.
