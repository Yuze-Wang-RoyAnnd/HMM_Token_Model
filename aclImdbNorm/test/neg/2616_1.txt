very disappointing 7th chapter of this slowly dying series. very evident that the budget was extremely low. this movie was made for one reason and one reason alone. to sell puppet master toys! fans, such as myself of the series have decided, from what i have read and heard that the only one in the series worse than this is curse of the puppetmaster. in turn, turning us away from the series. <br /><br />opting to make this a pg-13 film, for whatever reason, did not work in the films favor. the plot seemed almost to be there, but was easily lost in the steady stream of nonsense. <br /><br />the only film in the series worth watching, also directed by decoteau is part 3 - toulon's revenge.<br /><br />granted, i do favor the scenery in the film. <br /><br />yuck!
