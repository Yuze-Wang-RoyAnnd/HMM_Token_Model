please, why on earth did bava had to add insult to injury making this pathetic piece of follow up crap?<br /><br />to begin with we, "the viewers" at home are treated to a narration from some unknown ding-bat informing us of the aftermath events of the previous episode indicating mankind's triumph over the demons, (yeah right).<br /><br />i can tell you "right now" that this doesn't in anyway what-so-ever have anything to do with demons as this is a completely new story with a different backdrop altogether. bava as usual, makes a casual appearance that doesn't even seem to fit into the main context of the story at all. acting in this one beyond appalling and the whole concept about the demons appearing through a tv set, oh god i'm not going to go on. go see for yourself.<br /><br />as usual you'll be treated to laughable dubbing, crap scenarios that don't make any sense and above all un-answered questions. how typical of a sequel that dished out the first batch of crap.<br /><br />overall if you're one of those dvd argentophile collector's, then maybe you'll wanna give this a go otherwise avoid like the plague, it's no way near the first, so you may wanna avoid like the plague.
