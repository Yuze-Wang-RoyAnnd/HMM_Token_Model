first off, this movie leaves you in a limbo mood wise. you don't know what to feel. so much so that you don't feel bad for caines character when his son gets murdered (which was actually mostly due to bad editing). the script was too bland. none of the situations matter as you watch them. the soundtrack, or lack there of (if there was it wasn't good enough to even remember) does not help it one bit. only good surprise to this movie was andy serkis' performance. it was on par if not better than caine's. the story would have probably gone better off if serkis would have killed him. because quite frankly you don't feel any kind of redemption in the climax. just a feeling of lack of feeling, if ya feel me. basically this movie massively lacks draw. leaving the audience alienated throughout the entire thing.
