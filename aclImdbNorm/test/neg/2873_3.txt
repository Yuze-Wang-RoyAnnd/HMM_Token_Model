wow...i just watched this movie...american people have this stereotypical view towards hindi films such as, all indian films have dances, songs and a love story....its pathetic how far away from the truth that is. this film simply exposes the stereotypical western view of hindi films. horrible acting, horrible direction, horrible cinematography. and all this by a hollywood director. most indian films today are much more content driven, realistic, touching and meaningful than this piece of crap. indian cinema (not just hindi) also cover a variety of different subjects. just like most other hollywood films these days, this shows a very stereotypical view of of another country, where truth is thrown out the window. this is a highly not recommended movie. instead watch good hindi films like black friday, eklavya, omkara, khakee, awarapan, gangster, don, zakhm, dor, sholay, mother india, lagaan...those films are what real indian cinema are all about.
