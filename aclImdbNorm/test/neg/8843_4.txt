although this starts out promisingly, a woman in a car is weaving around dark roads in the middle of the night in the middle of the forest until she almost hits a man holding a lizard! this gave me the impression that we were going to see something special, something almost david lynchian (if there is such a term), but unfortunately, the film starts to go everyplace, not having a core center, just sort of meandering story about a woman trying to solve a mystery of a small town. the character study goes all over the place, and i couldn't really care for any of the characters it seems, especially when some of the story all of a sudden goes into flashback mode. i had some hopes for this movie, but all in all, it was a bit of a letdown.
