the film is nothing else than an exposition of nudity. has anyone noticed that all three main female characters appear naked? it looks like the only winning bet for portuguese filmmakers is to include some (if not a lot) of nudity of the local stars, together with slang which otherwise, in the nowadays portuguese society, is repulsed with horror. if you watch advertising for portuguese films at portuguese tvs, they all have included a "hot" scene from the movie. i'm not saying, by any means, that portuguese society is alienated; just that the movie industry does not seem capable of finding others ways of success. going back to the movie... there is nothing left from the spirit of the book, which is a masterpiece. the film could have been a good one, had there been emphasized the real idea of the book (of actuality at any time) and not the strictly erotic part. it had almost all the ingredients... but the "chef" was awful...
