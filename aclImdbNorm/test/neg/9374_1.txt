after some quite ok dutch action flicks, like lek and van god los, gerrard verhage wants to make a movie about the life of a dutch mobster. well, mobster is a big word for klaas bruinsma. he isn't a real international big guy like george jung (blow) or pablo escobar. he is just an amsterdam lowlife who made some money by selling soft-drugs. things are often blown up in the netherlands, and this movie is just an other example. but even then, the movie could be very nice if the story was okay told. now there are major jumps in time: one day klaas is just an ordinary drug-boy, the next shot he seems to be a big player in the drug-scene. nobody knows how's that possible (except for those who read the book). the acting is really bad, the non-dutch movie-watchers get to see one of the worst actresses in the netherlands: chantal janzen. when you think she finally gets naked, then you are watching a stand in model. so: bad acting + bad montage + crap story = de dominee.<br /><br />please don't watch it, even if other people say it's good, because it isn't. i've warned you.
