this is one of the worst anime series i have ever seen. when i watched the manga review in a magazine, i thought it was maybe interesting, but when i got the chapters i realized it was a complete stupidity.<br /><br />ok, the first 2 or 3 chapters are ok, and the series have an standard. but as the plot advances, it becomes totally incoherent. the series tries to show some mystical based upon the christian mythologies, but it's a total stupidity. it features some demons and stigmata scenes... totally nonsense. it seems the series tries to seem deeply-thought, complex or mythologically reviewed, but a watcher with a bit of brain and cultural references, will realize soon all those elements used don't have a real sense: they are put there only to impress the ignorant watchers!!<br /><br />the final chapters are full of totally nonsense elements: battles with cat-eared demons, references to a supposed fight between demons, and demons who controls time (with no apparent reason). the final is totally nonsense; an ignorant watcher will see on it a floating final that gives them a place to meditate; but the truth is this: the final and the complete series is a total incoherent and incongruent nonsense.
