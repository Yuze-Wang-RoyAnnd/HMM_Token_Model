don't be fooled by the other reviewers. although this film contains an impressive array of talent, the material they present leaves a great deal to be desired. nat king cole's 3 numbers are pretty lame and not even close to his later efforts, though he does impress with his piano playing. 'moms' mabley is not a bit funny, though i remember her as a very entertaining talk show guest from my youth. actually, the best performances are from a couple of fat guys who impress with a lively tap dance and a four tops takeoff, and the jazz band itself, especially in the number featuring the bass player. the print itself is pretty poor quality, and the wonderful butterfly mcqueen is totally wasted in the wraparound plot.
