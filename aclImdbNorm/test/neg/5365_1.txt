i was very excited when paranormal state first came on a&e. i thought that it may bring some more interesting ghostly evidence. the production value looked good and i really love the logo. then, after about few episodes in, i started to feel that this show may not be looking for evidence but had a strong religious agenda.<br /><br />it seems like every case they investigate has some big powerful evil demon that can't even make a teacup move on camera, yet everyone is terrified. then comes some power of christ ritual that saves everyone.<br /><br />also, there is very little focus on other members of the team. the entire show focuses on ryan and he feels like one of those people that hands you pamphlets about his church on the street.<br /><br />has paranormal phenomenon and demons become the new missionaries of christianity, scaring people to convert? really, this should be on a christian network. i was very disappointed.
