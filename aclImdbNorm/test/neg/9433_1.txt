meet cosmo (jason priestley), a nerdy young bookie content with his boring life crunching numbers for the mob and living in a stark basement apartment at a senior citizens center. his only recreation is watching tv and the occasional tryst with his quirky prostitute pal, honey (janeane garofalo). but one day all this changes, when the mob boss is killed and the well-regarded cosmo is selected by the smooth and persuasive new chief, gordon (robert loggia), to become a full-fledged hit man. it's an offer the reluctant cosmo cannot-repeat, cannot-refuse, and he quickly trades in his mundane, solitary existence for a crash course in revenge under the tutelage of veteran mobster steve (peter riegert), a relaxed, suburban bon vivant who relishes the job's maximum pay and minimum hours. in no time, cosmo surprises both himself and mentor steve by displaying an absolutely uncanny aptitude for the work. though he's never touched a gun before, cosmo proves to be both a crack marksman and, after an initial wave of moral hesitancy, a cool, detached killer. soon, cosmo is dispatching deadbeat clients with speed and style and his natural flair with a gun quickly establishes him as an invaluable addition to gordon's mob.<br /><br />reality gets in the way though, when one night, while being massaged by honey, cosmo admits feeling a bit uptight and she recommends he try yoga to relax. cosmo takes her advice and joins a nearby yoga class taught by a beautiful young woman named jasmine (kimberly williams). cosmo is instantly taken with the kind and gentle jasmine, who soon becomes drawn to cosmo. now if she can just get rid of her pesky, abusive boyfriend, randy (josh charles), maybe she and cosmo can actually start something. cosmo, using some of the "skills" of his new trade, eventually persuades randy to disappear and his relationship with jasmine takes off.<br /><br />writer/director m. wallace wolodarksy, a two-time emmy award-winner for his work on "the tracy ullman show" and "the simpsons", has fashioned a script fusing his three genre loves: "i like comedies, gangster movies and romances," explained wolodarsky, "so i essentially smashed together all three to create this film." but what he's come up with is a film so disjointed and improbable that it looks just like a very long sketch on saturday night live. it's monotonous tone doesn't so much match it's droll sense of humor, as underline the fact that a lot of money was spent on a vehicle for jason priestly to blithely shatter his nice guy image, which doesn't even fully succeed because he plays his character not as a nerd, but as a laconic zombie. a nerd may be naive, but a nerd has passion. passion for inwardly directed things. but priestly plays his character as mentally deficient, almost the anti-forrest gump. unfortunately, "coldblooded" doesn't have the sense of scope to actually be the anti-forrest gump.<br /><br />peter riegert (local hero, animal house) turns in a fine performance as usual, and kimberly williams does her best with what she has to work with, but janeane garofalo (hbo's larry sanders show) is practically wasted in her role as cosmo's friend. probably not for long, though. garofalo has all the enthusiasm and charm of an apple waiting to be picked and it's just a matter of time before she'll be given a meaty role, hopefully doing a tag team thing with marisa tomei.<br /><br />
