i've enjoyed watching lost from the beginning and endured a few bad actors in poorly written episodes because when lost is good, it's really good! but this episode that features mr echos demise had so many drawn out scenes with lingering closeups of bad acting that i found myself tapping the fast forward button. this episode stood out so far as by far the worst. in fact, the variation in quality of lost has been so inconsistent, i find myself often wondering how many writers they are using.<br /><br />i will continue to watch but hope things get better and hope i stop secretly wishing for the sub-par actors in the series to die off.
