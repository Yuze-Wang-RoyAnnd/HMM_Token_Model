david dhawan copied hitch and such an unofficial copy the film isn't even 1/2 as funny or amusing as the original it's boring with forced stories like the lara track of having a child and no hubby plus there is an unwanted stupid chota don and david tries to choke drama too but the film looks disjointed, boring<br /><br />songs just pop in, so does romance and everything barring some funny govinda scenes, the dance before interval nothing else is worth mentioning the last few scenes are quite funny but there tend to get too long<br /><br />david's direction is as bad as maine pyaar kyun kiyaa, he needs to change his style or attempt something good music is saving grace, some songs are good but the situations seem forced<br /><br />govinda looks overweight and seems too loud and screams his lines in initial reels but he gets into the groove and gives his best in the office and the scene with salman in his cabin and towards the end<br /><br />salman just plays himself and his nasal tone plus his fake style of acting is a headache<br /><br />lara is avoidable, katrina is fake as usual<br /><br />the kid overacts
