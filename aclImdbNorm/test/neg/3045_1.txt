what should have been a routine babysitting gig at a secluded lake house turns into a night of terror, as high school student jill johnson (camilla belle) receives threatening phone calls from a sadistic stalker, while trying to stay one step ahead of him.<br /><br />the first 20 minutes of the original film were pretty good but it was all downhill from there. the remake takes those first 20 minutes and stretches them into an 80 minute feature film. that's a good idea because its eliminating everything that made the original bad. however, if they wanted this film to work more effectively then they should have hired a better lead actress, better director, writer etc. there's no suspense, everything can be figured out long before it happens and it's a very dull film since not much happens. at least there isn't much to sit through since its less than 90 minutes.<br /><br />if this premise were to work, then the lead actress has to give a realistic performance. camilla belle gives one of the worst performances i have ever seen and throughout the whole movie, she seemed to be reading her lines. you get a lead role in a hollywood film that will be viewed by millions of people and you give no effort at all! why did they hire this girl? sure, she's pretty but she can't act at all yet i suppose this won't matter to the target audience who will most likely eat this film up. the rest of the cast is bland and forgettable especially the woman who plays the maid, rosa. even the stranger was lame and his lines on the phone were not effective at all.<br /><br />this movie reminds me of last years disappointing horror film boogeyman. that movie was a bunch of cheap scares and false alarms and when a stranger calls is pretty much the same. jill enters a room because she hears a noise but its just a false alarm like a cat or the maid. this type of scene happens over and over again until finally after about 50 minutes, the stranger appears. he has to be one of the lamest killers ever. he carried no weapons and didn't seem to pose much of a threat. the ending is bad but it matches the rest of the film so it doesn't really matter. the film is directed by simon west and he is really bad at building up suspense. he was using every clich'e he could think of and the results weren't very good. the house was amazing and i'll give the film credit for that. it was an isolated house so it was pretty creepy but that's about the only good thing this film has to offer. in the end, if you're not a teenage girl then you should skip the movie. rating 2/10
