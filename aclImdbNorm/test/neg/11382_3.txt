alas, it seems that the golden times of stylish italian cinema have sunk into oblivion. and the recent brainchild of celebrated filmmaker lamberto bava is yet another obvious proof to that assumption.<br /><br />i felt lucky to watch many films from this prolific director (like body puzzle, delerium, macabre and both demons). albeit not entirely satisfying they have never been that dull.<br /><br />a suspicion that this new entry to my dvd collection was money thrown to the winds arose shortly in the aftermath of the car crash scene exhibiting an awkward and unlikely position of the body under the flip-over car.<br /><br />and the sense of shallowness grew up in the course of the ponderously narrated chain of events that followed.<br /><br />dumb dialogs, suspenseless script and a total waste of talents from the international cast. the only character that provided more or less passable performance was the mischievous mark's son juicing up the entire boredom.<br /><br />unfortunately, mario's son job on all accounts could hardly be hailed.<br /><br />i look forward to seeing his murder house hopefully expected to be an improvement.
