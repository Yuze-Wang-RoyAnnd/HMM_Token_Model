this show demonstrates the depths to which uk tv pre-watershed drama has sunk. with these dull scripts, mediocre acting, poor plots, awful dialog, one is forced to watch a dvd of any old er episode to see excellent hospital drama.<br /><br />none of the actors employed on this show seem to be able to actually act!<br /><br />if you want low quality but easy to absorb soap opera style tv, this is the show for you. personally i like something with more meat on the bone. sadly as with all other uk licence payers, i'm funding this dross.
