when george sluizer was told he could direct an american version of the book "het gouden ei"/the movie "spoorloos"(outside holland, this movie has the name "the vanishing" too), he was told that this would only go through if the ending was changed - he was told that 'the american audience' wouldn't approve the original ending. of course, the original ending is much better, and without it, the movie loses its impact. because i have already put this in the trivia section, i won't give the original ending and keep my comment spoiler-free. if you want to know the original ending, watch "spoorloos" or read the book. this movie is absolute rubbish, and the first kiefer sutherland movie i don't like. watch the original dutch movie, which is one of the best thrillers in the world.
