dreadful, stupidly inane film dealing with corruption at the louisiana purchase lumber company.<br /><br />everyone in the state of louisiana seems to be corrupt and inept. a member of the college's english department can only sign his name with an x.<br /><br />when it appears that a straight laced senator (victor moore) is coming to the state to investigate, everyone there tries to blame the innocent but foolish bob hope character.<br /><br />is it any wonder that vera zorina did not get the part of maria in 1943's "for whom the bell tolls?"<br /><br />naturally, the corrupt officials along with hope try to show pictures of zorina with moore so as to ruin him politically. moore marries the head of the restaurant who he had insulted when he asked for a ham sandwich. he thought the reason that she was upset was because it was a kosher restaurant. this is the extent of humor is this absolute mess of a film.<br /><br />when hope tries to defend himself in congress, he does a take-off of james stewart in "mr. smith goes to washington." by then the film is too far gone for any good response.<br /><br />the music and lyrics are both absolutely terrible. that song praising louisiana, sung in various ways, is absolutely terrible. irving berlin had something to do with the music of this utterly terrible film?
