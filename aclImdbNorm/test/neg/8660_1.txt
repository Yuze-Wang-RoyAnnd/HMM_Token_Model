what a crappy movie! the main character in this movie was supposed to be born and brought up in canada, yet he had a thicker indian accent than his parents! is it just me or does uday look gay in this movie? also, do all the chicks in canada dress like sluts? at least that's how it is in this movie. all the females are dressed like strippers. don't waste your time with this one! the only good thing about this movie is the setting in beautiful vancouver. wonder why bollywood is going through a slump? it's because of movies like this. i miss the good old' days when hindi movies were actually entertaining!i couldn't even finish this movie because it was so bad. i think bollywood needs to stop trying to replicate the style of hollywood because it's just not working out. they need to stick to their roots because that's what makes indian movies entertaining.
