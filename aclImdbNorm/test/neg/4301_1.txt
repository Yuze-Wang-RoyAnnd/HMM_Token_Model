i cannot see why anyone would make such a movie. from start to finish this film is really, really bad.<br /><br />the characters are all very shallow, terribly acted and downright annoying. there is absolutely nothing going on below the surface at all with either characters or plot.<br /><br />the 'humour' if you can call it that is aimed at an adult audience ( i presume from the language and nudity) although it comes across as mainly toilet humour and would have problems even drawing a smile from a half-witted 16 year old.<br /><br />i would recommend avoiding this excuse for a comedy. it has nothing whatsoever that would appeal to a film fan. non-existent laughs and a plot that barely exists lead me to ask "why has this film been made, why, why, why?"<br /><br />i expect in the fullness of time to see this film topping the top 100 worst films.
