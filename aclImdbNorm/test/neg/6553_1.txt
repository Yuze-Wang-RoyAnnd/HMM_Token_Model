sherman hemsley was great in the jeffersons and especially all in the family. he was also very good in amen, why on earth would he do this movie? this movie has a terrible script and is a waste of a very funny man. luis avalos does the best he can but this is awful. this movie was the beginning of bankruptcy for sherman hemsley. i think he is very funny but this is an awful awful pointless ghost story. stick with ghostbusters.
