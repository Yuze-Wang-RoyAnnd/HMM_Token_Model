this is one of the most unoriginal, cliche-ridden movies i have ever seen. even if you didn't like this film's antecedents, 'the bad news bears' and 'the mighty ducks,' they are bound to have done a better job than this one. from the moment the new teacher greets her class and they tell her, "don't bother with us, we're all losers," you can see everything that's coming twenty miles away for the rest of the film. <br /><br />all the usual suspects are here. besides the spunky teacher, we have a group of what are supposed to be endearingly bratty kids (they're brats, yes, but no so endearing), a slow-witted small town sheriff that they love to torment, an arrogant head coach of the winning rival team, etc., ad nauseum. only olivia d'abo as the new teacher displays any likabilty. i never cared much for steve guttenberg before and his performance as the sheriff doesn't change things. jay o. sanders is a capable actor but his character, the rival coach, leaves him nothing to work with. let's hope that writer/director holly goldberg sloan comes up with something better next time out.
