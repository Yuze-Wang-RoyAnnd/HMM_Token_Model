i've seen worse films. this is bad but at least doesn't try to be good so it deserves a brief round of applause. it rest firmly in the realms of the low-budget b-movie sci-fi genre.<br /><br />it is a rubbish film but in a nice way and is certainly worth buying if it's in the bargain bin at your local supermarket. awfully charming rather than just plain awful.<br /><br />the highlight for me is when galaxina's lover goes to rescue her. upon turning up she exclaims "bunnyfluff!" which draws sniggers from his co-pilot.<br /><br />sit back, get drunk, enjoy!
