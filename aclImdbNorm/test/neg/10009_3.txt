cage plays a drunk and gets high critically praise. elizabeth shue actually has to do a love seen with the most unattractive and overrated piece of dung flesh in hollywood. i literally vomited while watching this film. of course i had the flu, but that does not mean this film did not contribute to the vomit in the kamode. <br /><br />why can't nick cage play something he can really pull off like a bad actor. nick cage who be brilliant in a role as a bad actor. heck nobody could do it better.<br /><br />the search begins for nick's contract with lucifer or was it lou cipher from "night train to terror".
