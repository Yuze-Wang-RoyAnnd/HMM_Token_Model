the second woman is about the story of a mysterious man who lost his wife in an accident and now believes that someone wants to do him harm. a girl who likes him wants to help him but she is led to believe that his fears are caused by a mental illness...<br /><br />interesting plot, very good acting, but the result as a whole is poor in many ways. the story is too simplistic, or rather, presented in a simplistic way (even though there is a couple of interesting plot twists). for example, people say they love each other after only two meetings. i don't want to reveal anything else, but you 'll see what i mean if you watch the movie. "come on, it was the fifties!", you may think. yet i 've seen quite a few films from that era and i know that some don't seem so dated nowadays.<br /><br />something that disturbed me was that some scenes were shot pitch dark, making it almost impossible to watch what was going on. ok, it's a film-noir but this one is too noir at some points... :o)<br /><br />overall, the second woman is not a masterpiece of that era, but no trash either. watch it if you have nothing else to do...
