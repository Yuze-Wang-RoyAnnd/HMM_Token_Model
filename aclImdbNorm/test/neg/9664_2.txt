i don't think it really matters too much what the plot of this movie is about, the main thing you'll notice is the extreme amateurishness of the entire production. the acting is what you'd get if you chose people at random off the street. the sound is really annoying - a medicine cabinet closes with all the gusto of a gunshot going off in your ear, while at the same time the dialog is perhaps one-fifth as loud. miscellaneous on-set noises dominate the soundtrack to a huge degree, with dialog taking a distant back seat. the theme music sounds as if it was about a quarter done when the movie was released, as large portions of the film don't have any music at all. camera-work can best be described as a gnarled mess, with close-up shots where a medium angle would be much better, cameramen walking around and jostling the camera every which way, absolutely no attention paid to framing any scene, they just shot everything from whatever position it was most convenient for the cameraman to stand. if the cameraman was a foot taller than the actors and you end up looking at the tops of everyone's heads, well, so be it. editing is just a butcher job; everything is tossed together in the most abrupt manner possible, nothing flows or transitions in any sense of the word. i don't know if this was shot on video or perhaps a rented camcorder, i tend to think it was the latter. <br /><br />i only made it about three-quarters of the way through this thing before i turned it off, i just got so annoyed at the low quality of the production i couldn't take it anymore. it's like a ninth grade audio-visual class project.
