mild spoilers below.<br /><br />the prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when tfw was filmed. from the opening scene of european refugees to the final prediction that naziism will be the death of millions of germans, this movie is as much a propaganda film as the films made after pearl harbor. there isn't a lot of entertainment value here though the footage of the dust bowl is interesting to those of us who aren't old enough to remember it. the rest of the plot is pretty forgettable with the herr docktor coburn - with a pretty bad accent - and daughter assimilating into america with wayne's help. other than the dust bowl scenes, the only memorable aspect of the movie is one best viewed with hindsight. coburn's speech comparing naziism to a malignancy worse than cancer and describing the (then current) successes as a momentary outburst of energy from a patient right before death were eerily accurate and varno's dr. scherer played accurately to post war newsreel footage of unrepentant nazis justifying their actions.<br /><br />when viewed from a historical perspective, some aspects of tfw are interesting. if you look at it for entertainment outside of the wwii perspective, you'd have to say this is one of wayne's less successful efforts.
