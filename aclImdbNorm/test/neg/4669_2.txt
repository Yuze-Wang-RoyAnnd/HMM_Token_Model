like many people in my general age range, i remember going to see this movie as a kid in '98 and coming out of the theatre practically in tears. it seemed, at the time, to be one of the most important, awe-inspiring cinematic experiences of our generation. at once riveting, action-packed, funny, heartbreaking, and truly inspirational, armegeddeon really did have everything going on, right down to the catchy aerosmith theme song and sappy tear-jerker of an ending.<br /><br />sweet jebus. what were we smoking? i watched it for the first time in years last night on one of the movie channels, and... i cannot even describe it. this is, truly, one of the worst movies ever made. where to even begin? leaving aside the plethora of laughable scientific errors ('personnel trackers' on astronauts? yeah, sure, thanks for that, billy bob), i'd have to say the worst thing about it was the remarkable - dare i even say unmatched - way in which it combined crappy writing with crappy acting. there are too many examples of this to even begin listing here, but one in particular springs to mind - the scene where bruce willis is telling the feds exactly where to go to track down each of the oh-so-charmingly-roguish members of his oil drilling team ('check every bar in new orleans', 'the craps tables in vegas', 'the only black guy on a motorcycle in sturgis'... all to the tune of 'come together'... it reminded me a bit of the "news team! assemble!" scene from anchorman, except serious). ben affleck proves, once again, that he is by far the most overpaid actor in hollywood, having less depth, range, and overall talent than anyone else in the business. not that bruce willis, liv tyler, or anyone else in this godforsaken piece of garbage was much better.<br /><br />(i have to say, though, i got a kick out of seeing a pre-stardom owen wilson get killed off half-way through... is this the only movie where his character dies?) <br /><br />peter stormare is perfect as the most stereotypical unshaven russian cosmonaut you have ever scene. (then again, peter stormare does seem to have a talent for playing over-the-top eurotypes.) it really was quite amusing how, almost immediately after the americans dock with the russian space station (which is actually called that in the movie), ben affleck succeeds in singlehandedly causing the whole joint to explode in spectacular hollywood fashion. i also love the fact that, in the end, paris is the only place on earth to get destroyed, and that absolutely no one seems to care. and on top of all that, it at points literally turns into simultaneous ads for lockheed martin and kerr mcgee. oh how proud i am to be an american.<br /><br />there's plenty of other stuff to rant about, but i won't... suffice it to say that this is a really, really, really terrible movie, that i feel ashamed to have ever genuinely liked.<br /><br />i give it two stars just for the mockability factor.
