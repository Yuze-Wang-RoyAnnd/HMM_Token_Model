the plot in this movie is very thin, and there is not much acting. val kilmer--i don't know why he agreed to do this movie--plays a minor role as a gang leader. in short, the movie is tedious to watch.<br /><br />one guy, who sort of resembles an archeology/religion professor, is exploring a subterranean area of moscow, that has some history connected to railway construction and the bolshevik revolution. a church tragedy in that history makes the exploration "spiritual" and spirits of a malevolent intent haunt the underground ruins. a friend of the professor decides to find his friend in the underground and hires a couple of russian guides. the entire movie is based on this plot and contains much repeated footage of the underground, and some camera effects; much like those seen in "day watch", "night watch", etc.
