<br /><br />won't be long on this movie. the first half an hour was one of the most boring i have had to face since i've started watching movies. the story didn't advanced, nothing was explained about any of the characters. it felt like a non-movie. (a lot of people had already left the audience at this point).<br /><br />a lot of the scene were totally unjustified and unexplained.<br /><br />the director should have studied film a bit more to know that each sequence, each scene, has to make the story go forward. he never did that.<br /><br />the supposedly funny moments were contrived, and only a few people laughed (people with a weird sense of humor, i guess).<br /><br />prize of the jury in cannes 2002.....don't know what the jury was thinking about....probably the "politicly correct effect".<br /><br />i would have loved to love it, the disappointment was therefore even bigger.<br /><br />you have to see it to believe it. but wait for the video.
