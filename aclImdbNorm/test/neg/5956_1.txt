where do i start? the box should have been enough to keep me away from this attempt, but i'd been taught early on not to judge a book (or movie) by its cover, so i ignored the disgusting graphic quality of the box and rented it anyway. but common sense should tell you that if they can't do a single still image properly, then how dismal will the moving ones be, later? yeah. they were pretty awful.<br /><br />the actors in this flick appeared totally unaware they were being filmed, as just any expression seemed to do fine, regardless of the situation the characters were in or what they were reacting to.<br /><br />however, a good story can offset the downfalls of low budget productions. good dialog can carry a poorly-funded attempt at times. unfortunately, this was not one of those times, as the story was as weak and nonexistent as the other required elements of good cinema.<br /><br />there simply aren't words for how bad this was. <br /><br />perhaps you can get the idea from my rating of -2.3/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
