what should have been a dramatic tale of life on the river murray turns out to be a silly, soppy romance about an english refugee (sigrid thornton with aussie accent) who falls for the larrikin first mate (john waters) of a paddle-steamer.<br /><br />the first half of this four and a half hour mini-series shows some promise, but it soon falls flat as it becomes predictable and thin. some real verve and spark was needed in the plot to give the movie some life. gus mercurio's early exit didn't help as his character seemed to me to be the only interesting one.<br /><br />perhaps the longer t.v. version has more depth, because this video translation certainly lacked it.<br /><br />sunday, june 27, 1993 - video
