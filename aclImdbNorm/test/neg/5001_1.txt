i'm not sure what the appeal of this movie is, but i couldn't find it. it's a really long, barely credible, hardly lucid conversation between three guys on one set. <br /><br />it doesn't move anywhere, the characters are just totally bizarre, the underlying plot equally so. it's lost on me, definitely a walk out movie.<br /><br />the one thing that keeps you from walking out is the ever unrealized possibility that it might have some kind of point or meaningful climax, and the fact that, all irritation aside at the banal personalities, they're acted quite reasonably. but you have to brace yourself for endless dialog, wishing on many an occasion that teach would just shut the %*&* up for a moment.
