first - nick-623, pearl harbor was bombed in 1941, not 1942. they didn't have to predict the bombing.<br /><br />second - did nobody notice these six industrialist/lawyers/whatever were missing for a rather long amount of time? they were killed *before* the surgery took place! third - how the heck did lugosi get out of cabs without being seen? fourth - why did the japanese not just kill him, instead of putting him in jail with a convenient look-alike companion and his surgical kit? fifth - oh, what's the use? this movie has a few interesting moments in it, but by the time they explain what's going on, you'll probably have stopped watching. if not, you won't care.
