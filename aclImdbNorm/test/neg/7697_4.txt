i saw this short film on the dvd for ridley scott's film, the duellists. there was no introduction by scott before the film, it just started right up.<br /><br /> boy and a bicycle is hardly an example of ridley scott's other work, it bears no resemblance. the film shows a boy, played by tony scott, riding around on a bicycle. guess what? that's pretty all that happens. the boy rides around, rambling on and on with pointless, confusing dialogue. the film was shot in black and white, and since it was directed by ridley scott, i expected some cool cinematography or visually-striking sets. instead, i was treated with nothing. this film isn't even good for a first effort. however, i recommend that any fan of ridley scott should check it out at least once.
