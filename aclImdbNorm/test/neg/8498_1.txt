this movie is a gay love story disguised as a tale of graffiti and friendship. not one review described this movie as a gay romance film, and that's the weight of the plot. i don't know if this was to trick people that would otherwise be uninterested to sit through it, expecting the film to be as it was marketed... the film is out of touch with graffiti culture, abuses and defames graffiti culture, and the acting is abysmal. oh yeah, the graffiti sucks too. this movie was a clever way to hide the agenda of portraying young boys getting gay. just look at the rest of the movies the director's been involved with, all contain the same subject matter. boring as hell, not what i expected.
