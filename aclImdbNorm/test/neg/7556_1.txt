i can't really remember any details of this movie except that the setting looked awfully familiar. then i realized it was filmed at the lazy lizard hostel in moab, utah. that was one of my favorite places to visit when i was younger and wandered around the country. the guy who owns/manages the hostel managed to get himself in the movie. all i remember about the plot of the movie is that it involves jeeps and naked women. it is great to watch just for the scenery (i mean the rock formations)... if you are just looking for soft-core porn, you will probably be better served elsewhere. i don't even know if this movie is available on tape or dvd.
