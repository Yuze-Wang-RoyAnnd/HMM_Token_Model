to preface my remarks on the film, i know the topic is horrendous and words can't adequately express the compassion any decent person would have for people dealing with the post-horrors of an atomic bomb dropped near them. <br /><br />however, this film doesn't really deal with in a horrific way except for the first 10 minutes. some of the images there are horrifying, and should be as a reminder what devastation nuclear weapons can produce. seeing burned people walking around aimlessly or man combing his hair and clumps of hair coming out, etc., is not a pretty sight. <br /><br />but after the first dozen minutes, this japanese film concerns people dealing with the aftermath of hiroshima in the mid-to-late '40s. i actually found the story developing quickly into a boring soap opera. <br /><br />almost all the story occurs five years after the bomb and deals mainly with one family's problems at that point. this is why it became more of a melodrama than some shocking story of nuclear disaster. it's simply a story about how these people got on with their lives from about 1950 on, whether one of the women was permanently damaged and if so, should she marry? <br /><br />this could have been a real impact film but it didn't go in that direction
