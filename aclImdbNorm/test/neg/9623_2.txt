having enjoyed neil gaiman's writing (especially his collaboration with yoshitaka amano in "the dream hunters") in the past, i figured mirrormask to be a sure thing and was very disappointed. the beginning, live-action section of the movie was intriguing enough. the relationships between the characters was believable and easy to empathize with, and i loved the sets, the costuming, and helena's artwork. the subsequent computer-generated scenes, however, were excruciating. the dialogue was awkward and pretentious, the interaction between the live actors and the cgi horrifying. events occurred for the flimsiest reasons, and most events seemed superfluous to whatever plot may have existed. i only watched the first twenty or thirty minutes of the movie, so i'm not exactly an authority, but i strongly recommend that you don't watch any of it at all and stick with gaiman's strong written work.
