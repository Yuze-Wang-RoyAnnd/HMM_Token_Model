the problem with this- and with all vietnam war films- is that they're all too biased. antiwar films overlook the fact that the vast majority of u.s. soldiers were heroes, while prowar films overlook the fact that a lot of the soldiers did indeed commit atrocities like the one in this movie. this film sucks. it's time for a movie that is neither prowar nor antiwar, nor liberal nor conservative, but completely unbiased.
