this is a spin off of pulp fiction. i thought that it would be good for a few decent laughs. well it turns out that this movie really was terrible. the whole plot doesn't follow on the pulp fiction plot. it turns to other movie like forrest gump and more. some laughs came out of this movie, but all and all it totally took 90 minutes of my life away from me. if you are thinking of renting this movie, please don't it will waste 90 minutes of your life. reconsider renting this and go on and find a movie that actually makes sense. please if there is a plump fiction 2, i will definitely not go on and rent the sequel. just giving a heads up for those out there.
