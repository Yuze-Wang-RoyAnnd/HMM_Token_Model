i find it difficult to comprehend what makes viewer's feel this is a powerful movie. i would guess that the main intention of this film would be a character study and the effects of racism in a british community. it is therefore all the more disappointing that all the characters are two dimensional and the acting is at the level of a college performing arts course. i'm always sceptical of "improvisation", another word for being too lazy to write a decent script. i was embarrassed by the performances and sat in an audience who laughed when they surely were supposed to be moved by the story. racism is a serious issue but i think a subtle approach in cinema works far better than laying it on with trowel.
