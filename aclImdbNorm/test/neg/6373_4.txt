this was something i had been looking forward to seeing. the ultimate avengers movies had both exceeded my expectations and since iron man has been one of my favorite marvel characters i thought that this same production team would be able to do some really great stuff with an iron man solo title. but the final film was unsatisfying. i wasn't expecting them to spend most of the movie paying tribute to iron man gray armor. the red and gold armor is seen for maybe ten or so minutes all together. not a major complaint but not what i expected from the ads and box. the worse thing however was the story, the acting and the cell-shaded cgi animation for the monsters and iron man armor that was not convincing. it didn't blend in well with the cell animation at all. even on it's own it seem stick-like and lifeless. tony stark's character arc, as incredibly slow as it takes, is so forced and unconvincing. i wanted to see this movie because i love iron man but after forcing myself through the film i wondered if they couldn't have come up with something that had been as good as the ultimate avengers movies.
