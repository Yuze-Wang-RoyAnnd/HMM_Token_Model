how does this movie suck? as a fan of michael imperioli's work on the sopranos i picked this up at blockbuster based on his name and a story that sounded like it had promise. it still does, but this movie doesn't fulfill it.<br /><br />every turn of the story is entirely predictable; i kept looking for the lifetime bug on the bottom right corner of the screen. it's all there: the noble woman coming out of hard times, the guy failing to live up to his potential despite her best efforts, the kid who gets stuck in the middle, etc., etc., etc. the mysterious stranger's identity is what really made me want to throw stuff at the tv -- i would have been more satisfied with little stuey waking up and realizing it was all a dream.<br /><br />the filmmakers may as well have had a "the moral of the story is..." bit before the credits, since as another reviewer pointed out this thing really does roll like an afterschool special. don't gamble, don't drink, don't do drugs, stay with your wife, spend time with your kids...come on, how about a little nuance? how about some interesting bad guys? writer/director a.w. vidmer should be singled out for special notice: not only is the dialogue leaden, the pacing (within dialogue and at either end of many scenes) makes this movie at least 45 minutes longer than it needs to be (and believe me, it feels like longer). the talents of imperioli, renee faia and some of the supporting cast (steve schirripa, natch) are the only things that keep this from a "1" rating. all of their good work is nearly offset, though, by the atrocious job of portraying the boy stuey. not sure if it was a casting mistake (hey -- it's a mob movie, so let's cast someone from blue's clues who can't do anything but over-overact with a big fake grin...next let's cast the sullen, brooding kid in the disney flick) or just awful directing but those scenes are really painful to watch.<br /><br />i'd be interested in another filmmaker's take on this character and his story; it's a shame imperioli has already been used up by this flick. awful, awful, awful.
