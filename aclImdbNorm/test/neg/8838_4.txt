i watched the beginning twice, could not make sense of it, and it bothered me for the whole movie.<br /><br />so, work this out with me: wayne (the good guy) jumps on the stagecoach, disarms the drivers (!), steals the money (?!), and takes off.<br /><br />disarmed, one driver is then killed and the other wounded by the bad guys. thanks to wayne, who disarmed them, and then watched it happen.<br /><br />then wayne drops the money in the dirt, rescues the girl, rides into town, chuckles it up with yak (too bad about the dead guy, i guess)...and then later says he "found" the money back at the scene. and everyone's okay with that.<br /><br />and he's the good guy? and i'm pretty sure there weren't small, hand-held flashlights at the time. and bell did his first phone demo in 1876... were they in houses then? am i thinking too hard about this one? normally, i'm happy to suspend judgment to enjoy a movie, but this one bothered me. and that's a sign the move didn't really work for me.
