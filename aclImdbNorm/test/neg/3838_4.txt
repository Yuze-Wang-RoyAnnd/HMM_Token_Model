i thought choke had potential, but i thought it could have been a much better film. it had some interesting twists and turns, but some of them seemed kind of pointless. when showing background on the two main characters, some of that really seemed to go awry. most of it was sort of useless and didn't help the movie at all. this was also not dennis hopper's finest hour. however, the main saving grace of this movie for me was michael madsen. his performance was excellent. in this movie, he almost makes mr. blonde look like a nice guy. all in all, it was watchable. still, i was left thinking some things could have been done differently. these things would have made the movie much better, in my opinion.
