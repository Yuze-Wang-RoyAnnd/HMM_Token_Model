i'm sorry but i don't understand how the studio get's away with this. the movie is just not worth it. maybe as a theater-play but certainly not as a movie! and why do they call it a thriller??? offcource the acting is good but i did'n't expect anything less from these perfect actors. robert redford plays very well and willem dafoe is convincing enough as the softy "bad guy". helen mirren can play almost any role and always (still) looks beautiful to me ;). i'm also a fan of her british detectives. still they just can't save this ow so boring movie, i'm sorry. i hope we don't get to many movies anymore from this director "pieter jan brugge" cause he obviously doesn't now the meaning of the words "suspence and thriller".
