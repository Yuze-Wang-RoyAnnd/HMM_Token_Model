i hate to admit it, but they were right to sack schrader. the opportunity is here to build an atmosphere, to draw an audience into a movie. it wasn't done. the characters are weak. the story was weak. the directing was very poor. schrader was out of his depth and it shows. i've watched it several times now in the hope that there will be at least one redeeming feature. but no, nothing. the next stage will probably be a remake of the original or hopefully it will be left well alone. anyone wanting to know what the best sequel to the exorcist was should read 'legion', penned by blatty it has to be the best follow up to an original piece to be committed to print. sadly, it did not translate to to screen very well and i doubt if it ever could be. as for dominion, beginning. avoid at all costs.
