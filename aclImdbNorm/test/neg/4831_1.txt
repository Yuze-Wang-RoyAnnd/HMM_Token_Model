wait till you watch this one.... i mean even after reading this review. no other movie till date has sucked more than this one.... one thing i wont understand is that, when you are ripping off some english flick why to add your own creativity? with the amount spent for making this movie the producers should have considered buying rights for "cellular" to be dubbed into hindi and released the movie. they might have gotten some profits that way i guess. if there was a chance to rate this movie with a 0 i would have done it and the most pathetic performances come from tanushree datta and the girl who played the sidekick to aftab. i don't know if my problem is that i have seen cellular much earlier than this movie..... but that cant be a reason to support this movie... i could go on for hours but neither i have the time to discuss about this useless crap of a movie not i want to remember those awful scenes from the movie.....<br /><br />please stay away from this flick.
