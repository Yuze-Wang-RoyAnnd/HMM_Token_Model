i don't know which was worse, the viewer's made dopes of, or the stars in this movie who look like dopes. am i to believe that this woman raised this child for seven years, and never noticed the child was a bit dark ? am i to believe her mother, her father, and her husband never once said, hmmm this child looks a bit dark ? am i to believe when the courts ordered the mother to view the adopted parents records, that lisa hartman had this wow look on her face, when she told her mother, christopher is half black ! what ! was that for real,gee do you think so. so not only did the grandmother, and grandfather look dopey and stupid never once mentioning this, but i guess we were supposed to look surprised and say...hmmmmm omg he is half black ! totally stupid movie, almost an embarrassment even to watch this !
