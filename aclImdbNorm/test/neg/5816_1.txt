if you are looking for a movie with beautiful shots of mount everest, then you may enjoy this movie. just skip ahead to the views of the mountain.<br /><br />(spoiler alert) however, if you, like me, believe that lives are precious and not to be wasted then this movie will leave a bad taste in your mouth. 6 people died, 5 sherpas and a member of the japanese party just so that one man could attempt to ski down mount everest.<br /><br />the question is raised in the movie about whether the continuation of the expedition to meet his personal goal was still worth the cost in lives, and he answers an emphatic "yes".<br /><br />the part about skiing is in the last 15 minutes. he skis for a short time, then falls the rest of the way until he comes to a stop in the snow.
