diane keaton is a pathetic actress. she is so boring and phony. she is the same on and off screen. i saw her in an interview with ellen degeneres and she behaves exactly the same as she does in movies. her foolish facial expressions make me want to change channels. she has been in a couple of good movies, but they would have been better had someone else been picked for the part. steve martin doesn't add much to the movie either. he over acts as well and also ruins an old favorite. the ridiculous part martin short plays only adds more idiocies to the movie. i've tried to watch the movie twice but both times had to turn it off.
