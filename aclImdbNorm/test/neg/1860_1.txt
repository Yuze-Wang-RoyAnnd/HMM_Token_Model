wow! this movie is almost too bad for words. obviously the writers wanted to somehow link this to the ghoulies franchise, so they got pete liapis from the first one to reprise his role as jonathan...only now, he's a cop and has no similar character traits as he did in the first one. the ghoulies in this one aren't the ghoulies from the last ones. the cheap looking puppets have been replaced with even cheaper looking costumed little people. instead of being any main antagonist or being evil, they are more like the comic relief characters that appeared out of nowhere for no reason.<br /><br />when watching this film for the first time, it felt like i'd seen it before. why was this? because everything in this was stolen from another movie. all the cheesy cop lines and action scenes were from lethal weapon. the ghoulies were pretty much like bugs bunny and daffy duck, except they weren't amusing at all. even scenes from the original ghoulies film were sprinkled throughout this flick.<br /><br />i think the target audience was supposed to be adults, but the mixture of black magic, cartoon slapstick, cop drama and bad acting doesn't work at all. i hope they don't make a ghoulies v, because i don't want a movie studio to lose their money.<br /><br />my rating: bomb/****. 78 mins. r for violence.
