an old high school teacher of mine used to brag that he'd seen every movie ever made, so one day a friend of mine and i decided to make up a movie called "pacific inferno". later, we got into an argument whether the lead role was played by carl weathers or billy dee williams. our teacher found the argument interesting, so he came up to us and informed us that the lead role in "pacific inferno" was played by jim brown. we thought he was trapped in a lie, that was until we went to the library and discovered that "pacific inferno" was in fact a real movie. this incident forced me to rent the movie... it's horrible. our made up movie had a better plot than this piece. weathers and billy dee would have been much better in the picture.
