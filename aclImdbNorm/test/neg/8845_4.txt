while the design and locations and photography are strong assets in this film; it is a turgid and melodramatic affair which demonstrates the limits of cinema to convey truth.<br /><br />the case is the use of the soundtrack music: a mix of gustav mahler and andrew lloyd-webber that plays constantly and loudly, and would have made max steiner grimace at its over use as it instructs the audience how difficult; how ecstatic; how tortured it is to be an artist. and then it really counts the story elides the details at the end.<br /><br />this heightened and kitsch exploitation of emotions was once well ridiculed by peter ackroyd about a yukio mishima book: this is not writing, this is barbara cartland. precisely the same critique can be made of this film: a deceptive, mawkish vanity project.
