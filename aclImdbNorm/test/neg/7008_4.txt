the female cast of this movie is terrific: you've got linda blair (maturing nicely), julie strain (who doesn't get too many speaking lines - that's a good thing), rochelle swanson (equally convincing as a sweet innocent girl or as an evil possessed girl), toni naples, and the most beautiful of them all imo, the simply stunning kristina ducati (how the goofy male lead, larry poindexter, deserved to get sexually involved with any of these women remains a mystery). however, beyond the chance to watch these beautiful and in some cases talented women, the movie has little to offer. the plot is disjointed and doesn't really get going until the last 15 minutes or so; and when wynorski finally manages to create some suspense, a ludicrous "twist" ending comes and ruins everything.
