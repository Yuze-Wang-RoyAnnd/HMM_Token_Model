i haven't seen many movies worse than this one. the story line, the dialogues, the acting: it's horror! the story just jumps from a to b to c without any logical steps in between. every time you think you've missed something, but no: that was the way it was intended to be. and why on earth is the character that jenny garth portrays so in love with that no-no loser guy (who actually now plays in the movie cinderella man with russel crow!)? o well, it's no spielberg, of course... i have to write ten lines to get posted. this movie really isn't inspiring enough to write 10 lines! it's a romantic feel good movie with a lousy story, so if you're up for that: you'll have a ball.
