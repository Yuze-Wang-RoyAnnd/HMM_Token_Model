this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. thank god i saw it for free. i would have hated to waste my money on it.<br /><br />first off, there isn't a character in the movie that is in any way likable. michael caine comes close, but even he is pretty flawed. the rest of the "commandos" are made up of disgusting ex-cons. there are the two gay arabs, and three guys who try to rape a red cross nurse, and the "leader" who has no trouble sending his men off to get killed so he can escape.<br /><br />the "mission" is anything from suspenseful. they are to blow up a fuel dump. sounds exciting, right? well, the footage follows them through endless sandstorms and fixing flat tires. yes, you read that right. the "suspense" is whether they will run out of spare tires. we actually watch them change something like 12 flats on the way. that's how incredibly exciting this movie is.<br /><br />they get to the fuel dump to find that it is a decoy. so, nothing to blow up. and at this time, for some very convoluted reason, the british army decides that they don't need these guys anymore, and radios their whereabouts to the germans to kill them.<br /><br />so, now at least we'll have an exciting race to freedom? nope, instead, they decide to blow up a different fuel dump, to create a diversion. but, when they get into the place, they set off a trip wire, and the germans come to get them -- calling out their names over a loudspeaker.<br /><br />really weird. if the germans knew where they were and where they were going, why did they let them get all the way into the dump before springing the "trap?" instead, they wait until they get into the fuel depot, and set all of their charges. yeah. right. that would happen.<br /><br />so, they blow the dump, the leader sells out all of his men -- except for michael caine, since he's been offered $2000 to bring him back alive.<br /><br />ok... so, the men are all betrayed and killed, and michael caine and nigel davenport survive. the british troops come in with tanks, and they decide to go get rescued. since they are wearing german uniforms (they wore them to blow up the dump) they tie a white flag around a stick and walk out into the road.<br /><br />some british guy walks up behinds them and machine guns them to death. credits roll.<br /><br />yep. the two "heroes" of the movie die due to a random act of violence.<br /><br />it's almost like the movie suddenly ran out of budget and decided: "that's a wrap. kill them off and we'll go home." i wasted 2 hours of my life watching this tired, unimaginative and totally unrealistic movie that ended with a gracefulness of a bomb.
