this latter-day fulci schlocker is a totally abysmal concoction dealing with an incurable gambler (brett halsey) who decides bluebeard-style to pay off his ever-rising debts by seducing some of the ugliest bitches you will ever lay your eyes on and who just happen to be wealthy widows! the fulci-penned script also contrives to incorporate a few blackly comedic elements - which only result in some unfunny business involving a corpse which won't stay put, an opera singer victim who won't stop singing, etc. - not to mention a doppelganger theme straight out of the student of prague - although, in this case, the two personas communicate via pre-recorded radio messages!! in the end, i can't say i'm surprised that this film shows no sign of the sophistication of mario bava's hatchet for the honeymoon (1970) which it resembles in several ways and that it is content to merely pile up the disgustingly gory (but none-too-convincing) effects of dismembered limbs and squashed or melting faces with which, alas, fulci had by then become completely associated.
