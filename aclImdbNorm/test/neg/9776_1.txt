***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** some bunch of afrikkaner-hillbilly types are out in the desert looking for diamonds when they find a hard mound in the middle of a sandy desert area. spoilers: the dumbest one starts hitting the mound with a pick, and cracks it open. then he looks into the hole and sticks his head in and surprise! something eats him. the other two dimwits are not seen alive again. scott bairstow looks like a pizza delivery boy but he plays some kind of expert scientist with a medical degree (which means he should be about 35 years old, minimum). bairstow is supposed to join camp c and help them find diamonds. the truck that picks up bairstow to take him to camp c has a handful of the kind of weirdoes that usually populate movies like "pitch black" "the thing" etc. the truck happens to drive across the first truck and they decide to investigate (how come that truck did not see the other truck when they were driving to pick up bairstow, since they were travelling the same road??). so they find the eaten bodies, and there are some decent special effects relating to bones with little bits of flesh on them. the main lunatic in the group, karl, decides that they must find the killer. so the truck drives around in the desert following some tracks, and eventually it has an electrical short and the crew is stuck in the desert. the dumbest guy in this group had picked up a bunch of bones using his jacket to carry them around. when he takes a nap (wearing the same jacket) the creatures eat him alive, and another guy runs over and sticks his arm into the goo and that dummy loses his arm too. sounds exciting so far, except that a few minutes later, dr. bairstow realizes that the creature is really hundreds of thousands of ants who are using the bones to hold each other together so they can travel to a new hive (because the miners cracked open the old hive). now, last time i checked, ants could move around on their own, without having to kill people in order to use the bones for structure. if all they need was something hard, they could have put a bunch of sticks together and used those to create a form. the whole story is really, really dumb, and the ant explanation is the only one given. the rest of the movie is just about the group getting killed off until they find the new ant-nest, and kill the ant-brain (sort-of), and the hundreds of thousands of ants then walk away on their own itty-bitty feet. there is a spare ant-brain found (off-camera) and sent back for analysis thus creating a reason for a sequel.
