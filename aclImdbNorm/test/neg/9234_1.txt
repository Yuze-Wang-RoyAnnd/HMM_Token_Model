altioklar: master of the thieves. <br /><br />watch some movie, steal some parts of them, write a script... it must be very easy to be a director in turkey. i think altioklar watched "identity (2003)", "saw (2004)", a few series which is about crime, murder etc. then he said "eureka, eureka"(i have found it!) after that he wrote the script of the movie.<br /><br />you can guess the murderer at the beginning of the movie. it took only 10 minutes for me. he shouted "i'm the murderer, i'm the murderer.". there is no mystery. <br /><br />tamer karadagli is same(sux). exaggerated mimics, funny macho man. <br /><br />there is only one good thing in the movie. the performance of demet evgar is very good. you may see the movie just for that.
