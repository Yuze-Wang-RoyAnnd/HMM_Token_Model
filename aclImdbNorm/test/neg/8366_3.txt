i suppose that to say this is an all-out terrible movie would be unfair, but it's pretty bad. the sub-disney storyline involves dogs playing soccer and falling in love (aw, how cute!) the acting isn't bad, but definitely could be better, especially that of young canadian actor kevin zegers, who, during the whole movie, looks embarrassed, like he doesn't even want to be there. anyway, kids will love it, but parents beware!
