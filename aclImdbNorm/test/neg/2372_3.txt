this is a comedy version of "strangers on a train". it works pretty well. i am a harsh grader, so the 3 rating reflects mostly on the characters and plot. the performances are extremely good, all of them. of course, the two stars, devito and crystal, shine most. each performer acts well enough to play off of. the comedy works in a level just short of slapstick. devito characters work best when depraved. his character, portrayed as a writing hack, would probably be more real if he was published and lauded as much as most hacks are. his character would, in real life, have a great agent and multiple solicitations. the characters are one dimensional, which is okay in comedy. but crystals's character is not written very well. his desire to kill the "moma" all of a sudden makes no sense at all. it looks like a pitiful attempt at humor. the pitiful attempts are not too often, and the movie flows fairly well.
