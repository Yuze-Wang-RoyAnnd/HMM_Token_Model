seriously, folks...i was getting ready to actually write the razzie council and recommend this movie as razzie champ for 2007...until i got on imdb.com and realized its copyright date was 2006 and not 2007. seriously, though, this movie could have easily been a razzie champ. this movie sucked! how in the world this piece of crap was overlooked even for a razzie nomination in 2006 is beyond me, because it easily could have competed with basically, it stinks, too for the 2006 razzie championship.<br /><br />i rented this movie on the recommendation of a female neighbor of mine who told me, "oh my god, after seeing this movie, it's going to be a long, long time before i ever stop at a rest stop ever again!" i couldn't believe how not scary and awful this movie was! possible spoilers below, not that you'll be missing out on anything.<br /><br />ok, first of all...the problem...the rest stop itself. obviously the director of this piece of crap doesn't know the first thing about women. the toilets in that rest stop were on the same level as the one in the movie trainspotting. i don't claim to know everything there is to know about women, but one thing i do know is that women, for the most part, are total and complete hygiene/neat freaks. given the choice between taking a crap on either of those toilets and possibly catching something or squatting in the woods, a woman is going to opt for squatting in the woods. i know, because i've gone camping with them before, and they have no problem squatting in the woods. so right there...major plot hole and untruth.<br /><br />second of all...she comes out of the rest stop, and her boyfriend who drove the car is nowhere to be found, not him nor his car. he just left. she starts screaming his name, wondering where he is. ummm...hello? you're standing on wet mud...did it ever occur to you to look down for some tire tracks? i mean, his car is gone...it didn't just get up and fly away. and actually, that makes me think...i actually was looking down at her feet, and there weren't any tread marks in the mud. how...exactly...did that happen?<br /><br />third...the bible thumping mobile home family with the freak midget in the back taking polaroid pictures...wtf!?!?!?? they made absolutely no sense at all, and it's as if the director just threw them in to be weird for the sake of being weird. they made no sense at all and had no place even being in the movie.<br /><br />fourth...oh my god, this...i mean, finally...near the end of the movie...she finally sees the escape hatch on the ceiling inside the rest stop. i'm like, "you...dumb...bi**h. you've been locked up in this rest stop for all this time...and you just..now...see...the escape hatch on the ceiling?" i mean...it's like they threw that in just because the killer tossed gasoline on the floor through the window and was getting ready to light a match. so she needs to get to higher ground to avoid being burned, and...oh, look! a perfect reason for her to get to higher ground! an escape hatch on the ceiling! it's like...why didn't she go through that before? most people in that situation would have seen that from the moment they were locked in that rest stop and gotten the f**k out of dodge. when they showed that escape hatch at the end of the movie, i was like, "you have got to be kidding me."<br /><br />fifth...what was the deal with all the of people she encountered continuing to just disappear? the girl in the broom closet in the rest stop? the dumb cop? her at the end of the movie when she ended up in the broom closet herself? it was never explained. personally, when they did this, i thought to myself, "oh, christ on a cracker, it's her. she's the killer. wonderful. she killed all of those people, doesn't remember doing it, and the writers of this movie just ripped off a certain french horror flick that i can't mention on imdb.com or i'll be blacklisted for giving away the ending (that movie sucked, by the way, too, people)." but it wasn't. she wasn't the killer, and the whole deal with the dead people disappearing was never, ever explained. oh, for the love of god, people, stay away from this movie! this movie sucked balls, and i have now got a serious bone to pick with my neighbor. it's on the 2 for $1 rack at family video, don't even rent it if someone gives it to you for free!
