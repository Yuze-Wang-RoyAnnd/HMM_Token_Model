when i saw this movie three years ago, i thought it exemplified a lot of the traits found in singapore art-house movies: slow-moving, with a minimal of plot and dialogue, depending on film composition to make it work.<br /><br />during then, amongst local cineastes, the inability to appreciate "be with me" is tantamount to panning "citizen kane" or any of ozu's late films. i've no idea how "be with me" reached such hallowed heights in singapore's cinematic consciousness, but i always felt that khoo's "12 storeys" is a better film, even though the latter film does not boast as good a cinematographer as adrian tan, khoo's dp for "be with me". "12 storeys" has a story that better relates to most singaporeans and has bite too, something that "be with me"'s threadbare wistfulness doesn't have.<br /><br />"be with me" is basically a barely interlinked trio of narratives strung together into a film by khoo and his screenwriter wong kim hoh. it deals with a security guard who falls in love with a girl whom he only sees in the distance; two girls in a horoerotic relationship; and the story of deaf-and-blind teresa chan.<br /><br />"be with me" is very well filmed by tan, using a varicam camera. the film compositions are masterful. the film, almost entirely silent, has next to no dialogue. characters move around, not in a realistic manner, but almost as if they are models under the instruction of a director, almost always looking into the screen and emoting: either loneliness or sadness. unfortunately the characters don't act against each other. this kind of film has been seen before many times: in tsai ming-liang's films, in khoo's prot'eg'e royston tan's "4:30" and elsewhere. sadly, its ultra-slowness (essentially plot less) and use of a lento piano soundtrack simply doesn't appeal to me.<br /><br />to criticize "be with me" seems almost to negate the inspirational story behind it, that of teresa chan, who is blind and deaf and yet lives a fulfilling life despite all this, yet i'm afraid this film doesn't do anything much to me. i'm willing to applaud chan's steadfast and courageous march in life and tan's striking cinematography, but for a better take on the same subject-matter with more meat (without the two other tedious and distracting subplots), try werner herzog's "land of silence and darkness" (1971).
