maybe, like most others who have seen this film long after it's premiere on television, i wanted to see many of my favorite actors in old and obscure form, which is exactly what 'slow burn' is. except, aside from the nostalgic value, the movie itself is not very good.<br /><br />eric roberts plays former reporter jacob ash, hired by a gerald mcmurty (raymond j. barry), a rich artist, to investigate the whereabouts of his estranged son, brian, who had been living with his mother, laine (beverly d'angelo) for the past few years. in a phillip marlowe-esquire fashion jacob ash narrates what would become more than just an investigation into the whereabouts of brian. but, once jacob tracks down laine, his discoveries break open wide a whole lot of trouble. perhaps because events in the film move too slowly, there is never much suspense to this little thriller, not even by the end with the finale routine of revealing the culprits and their motives.<br /><br />however, as said before, this movie is probably one that will draw attention for it's then-relatively unknown cast of actors, which include both a very young eric roberts as well as the adorable johnny depp, who plays laine's stepson, donnie. that may be reason enough to give it a try...if you can find it.
