icarly is all that's wrong with the world. all the main characters but carly's brother and freddy are morally bankrupt.<br /><br />sam damages other people on whim. she breaks a kids locker and he is forced to pay a 100 dollars to fix it, and all she says is "tough luck" and moves on to smash freddy's cellphone. she just caused at least 300 dollars worth of damage and she is more focused on getting some food. what the hell?. the only time she's every felt guilt is when she made fun of freddy on the show. and that's only cause carly nagged the crap out of her.<br /><br />carly is the "i'm perfect, everything i do is nice." type of girl. everything she does is for her own benefit and she is often shown only having remorse for herself. what's worse, she encourages sam's crap. sam ruins some of freddy's clothes? she laughs. sam ruins a kids grades? she shrugs it off.<br /><br />don't even get me started on the humour. the laugh track is played at every moment.<br /><br />sam: he's not that hot carly: yes he is sam: yeah you're right *insane amount of laughter*<br /><br />the shows humour consists around degrading others and saying obscure words and occasionally bantering on about trivial matters using similar sentences.<br /><br />not to mention all the 'super cool special techno effects' they do can be done in windows movie maker.
