i still remember when frog baseball first aired on mtv. in some sort of odd, surreal manner, the cartoon captured the stupid actions that i think every boy growing up in america engages in. i cringe now thinking about how i burned a crippled grasshopper using a magnifying glass, but it was interesting at the time for some reason. growing up in the 1980s we all knew "stoners." these were the kids who wore iron maiden t-shirts to school, grew their hair long, had immature moustaches and were at least two inches taller than everyone else because they had flunked a grade or two. we laughed at them because they were so stupid even when not stoned. so it was easy to understand beavis & co because we already knew them, some of us were even them. to the extent that genxers like myself would spurn the excess of the 1980s and embrace the grunge movement of the 1990s, beavis & co were sort of a strange post-modern anthem for us. strange because like beavis & co we didn't care if we had an anthem. it was just an inside joke that we all immediately got even if it was awful.
