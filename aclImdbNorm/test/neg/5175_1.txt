i am a big fan of british films in general but especially gangster movies. unfortunately this film was shockingly bad. i think its pretty depressing that this film is getting any good customer reviews. the idea that this film is gritty and realistic is laughable. i have read and heard fist hand quite a lot about the real life events shown in this movie and they have nearly all been glorified with over the top violence etc. the only gritty true to life event in the whole film was the range rover murders where some overblown bouncers got rubbed out for messing with people they could not handle. this film is a disgrace to british cinema! it has no plot and no decent acting and just relies on being violent( gritty and realistic as some people like to put it) the sort of people who made this film should not be allowed near a budget or film camera just as the sort of people this film is about should not be given the opportunity to tell this pathetic violent little tale of no consequence.
