seems to me that joe estevez spends most of his time hidden under the shadow of his rather successful brother and appearing in really bad movies. joe spends most his time walking around dressed in black and looking quite moody. he takes orders from a puffy faced angel of death, who you might recognize as the puffy faced villain from tango & cash and as the puffy faced cyborg from future war. well, joe and puffy have a job to do and it involves taking some souls of some kids in a big car being driven by a dumb galloot who questions led zeppelin. well, the car crashes and the chase is on. the lucky kids to escape joe look like tonya harding and rick springfield. they're chased around town, break things and tonya gets leered at by her mom while she's undressing for a bath. the action winds up at a hospital where we learn that heaven is an elevator ride away. in the end, some green lights flash, joe shouts and puffy vanishes without a trace. wish i could say the same for this movie. watch it from the relative safety of mst.
