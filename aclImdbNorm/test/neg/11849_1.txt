<br /><br />**********spoiler alert***************<br /><br />if you happen to like jurassic park 1, 2, or 3:<br /><br />if you happen to appreciate really bad movies for their sheer entertainment value if not for their quality (case in point-john carpenter's dark star-highly recommended)<br /><br />if you happen to like movies about dinosaurs in general-<br /><br />then stay away from this cinematic crapsterpiece!<br /><br />the shameless use of stock footage from carnosaur 1 & 2 make up most of this miserable attempt at a dino/slasher flick- take the scene, for instance, where the security guard meets his doom at the jaws of the alpha t-rex. for some reason, he drops about 50 pounds and appears 10 years younger. why is that? simply because this scene was lifted directly from carnosaur, which was a crummy flick to begin with.<br /><br />the ending was a carbon copy of carnosaur 2, for those unfortunate enough to have sat through that straight-to-video loser. again, we see mr. rex do battle against a bulldozer-which alternates as a forklift truck-through the miracle of -ta-daa!- stock footage from the aforementioned carnosaur 1 & 2. of course, the ending is exactly the same-the beast falls to his death just as the complex goes up in flames.<br /><br />a real insult to anyone's intelligence.<br /><br />but it's still better than watching the rosie o' donnel show.<br /><br />rating: 1/2* out of *****<br /><br />
