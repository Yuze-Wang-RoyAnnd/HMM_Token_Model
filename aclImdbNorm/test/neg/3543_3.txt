nightscream is a tv movie so it's bound to be pretty dire especially as it's a supposed horror film. this young girl is haunted by dreams as she arrives in a small town where there was a murder of a woman one year before. she is amazed when everyone in the town thinks she looks exactly like the murdered girl. the townsfolk are amazed when she keeps entering dream like trances where she reveals accurate details about the murder and murderer because the police got it all wrong apparently. thinking that they are in danger of being found out, the murderers (there are two of them) start to hatch a plan to get rid of her before she gets to the real truth. by this time you will have probably fallen asleep and why do the makers of the film have the 'mist-making' machine on full throttle in the dream sequences.
