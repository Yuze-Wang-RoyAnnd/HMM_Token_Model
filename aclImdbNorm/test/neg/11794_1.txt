i just watched this movie with a few friends they said i had to see it but from the beginning i knew it was going to go from bad to worse. so i can only give this movie a 1 because the effects that were used were so poorly used and thought out that anyone can see that there were no "real" ghosts. i feel the worst part was this so called "old haunted house" contained a whole bunch of new items and a few "convieniently placed items" i could have thought up effects that would have looked much better than a chair being flipped over by an unseen ghost (or should i say wire). then later when they review the tape of the chair flipping it flips in a different way. uh oh thats a big continuity error. if this was a truly good movie then they would have caught that and all of the other "old house" items. this movie is like a rip off of house on haunted hill and the blair witch project all rolled into one poorly thought out and assembled movie. i would be ashamed to put out something with that bad of acting, effects and cheap video shots of the girls chests and how convenient the camera falls when something "paranormal" happens. this movie is an insult to people who are out there actually looking for ghosts and getting real ghost footage on tape.
