my grandad gave me this dvd. with friends like these. the front cover looked quite scary thought i'd watch it. what a bloody mistake.<br /><br />basically the film follows three people on a bus and what happens to them involving friends.<br /><br />the first one is about a guy who buys a car that talks to him. the second is a about a guy who wakes up to find a cassarole clone in his fridge. and the third is about a woman who does online dating but it turns out he has a robotic arm.<br /><br />the dvd case rated this film 18 but even a 5 year old can watch this and not be scard or entertained. the film should be rated 12 for slight scares and the swear word bloody.<br /><br />all in all this film is utter shite don't go near it.
