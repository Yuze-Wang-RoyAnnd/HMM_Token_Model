okay, some other people have commented that this isn't an action flick, so i don't need to rehash that (even though i just did). this isn't exactly a let down, in fact, it's nice on occasion to see an actor try something different. but, unfortunately, this isn't one of those occasions.<br /><br />now, the story: non-existent. this film lacks in storyline almost as much as 'showgirls' did. sure, they throw in a couple environmentalist, no, not even environmentalist, something else, tidbits here and there to please seagal (being that that's what he's into). this doesn't make a story, not even close. now, the ending... even those amongst us who actually liked this film... the ending, you have to admit it was a bit much, or a lot stupid.<br /><br />now, from what i understand this was a direct-to-video film (at least in the states), but this is even too good for this one. this piece of garbage should have been cable only, on tbs or starz (late night).
