now, let me see if i have this correct, a lunatic serial killer is going around murdering estate agents....okay...what's wrong with that scenario, i can live with that.<br /><br />what next, a slasher with tax inspectors butchered? traffic wardens sliced to death? are we supposed to feel any sympathy for empty headed and shallow, money obsessed property people? er...no.<br /><br />sadly, joking aside, it's just not a very well made film with poor acting and crude effects, the climatic scene is particularly silly. you can almost see the director shouting, 'action' to the stuntman as he falls through the glass of the window.<br /><br />as another reviewer quite rightly said, after starring in 'the fog,' this was the nadir of adrienne barbeau's career. therefore i was happy to see that she had rekindled it by becoming the voice of catwoman in the batman animated series, while watching the extras on the live action catwoman film. nb: not quite the awful film it's made out to be, by the way.<br /><br />this however is a bad film, think a poor episode of 'kojak' or 'streets of san francisco,' and you will get an idea of what is on offer here.
