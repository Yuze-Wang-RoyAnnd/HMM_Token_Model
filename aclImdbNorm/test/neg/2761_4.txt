i have read a lot of books in my short lifetime but this is by far the worst!!! i just got done reading this worthless piece of trash and when i finished it i threw it across the room! i hated it and let me state the reasons! 1.the soldier dies. why would the author make the soldier die?! why couldn't she have kept him alive like a good love story author would do?! i deeply applaud patty for trying to claw that fbi agent's eyes out.<br /><br />2.ruth get's fired. ruth (the black housekeeper) get's fired and for no apparent reason too! she tried to comfort patty and then patty's sob dad fires her for no good reason! ruth and anton and patty were the only bright spots in the book. oh and the grandparents too! 3. the perm. yes. the perm. now you people might think why would the perm upset you? well here's why. patty's mom asks the girl if she wants her hair done. patty says no but the mom calls mrs. reeves (the horrible hairdresser) and tells her to give patty a perm. why on god's green earth would she do that?! why would a mother ask her daughter if she wants a perm only to have her get a perm anyway! the mom always pretends that patty has a say when she dosen't have a say at all!!! she should be given the "worst mother of the year award" for the stuff she dose to patty. thank god ruth cut her perm off! 4. discrimination, racisem, and prejudious. i hate the discrimination in this book. they use the word *beep* too much. yes.i know that in those days blacks were free but had basically no rights but come on! why teach todays children that word! it just teaches them how to discriminate people. not only were blacks discriminated but the chinese too. in the book people refer to mr.lee (a chinese man) as "the *beep* that is really despicable and last but not least... jews and nazies. i hate the town for spitting on a little girl. what was so wrong for her liking anton. she is a 12 year old girl!!! it was just a crush. like a 12 year old can really love a 22 year old. come on! this isn't "lolita". and "lolita" is a good book not a piece of filth! i'm surprised that this movie isn't considered "dirty" like "lolita" is.<br /><br />5. patty going to a reformatory. patty should not have gone to that reformatory. refirmitories are for thieves and murders, not innocent 12 year olds! the teacher or whatever she was called patty an ungrateful, spoiled brat. ungrateful spoiled brat my butt! patty was not a spoiled brat because her father and mother never gave a rip about her! patty should of got community service or something. she did nothing wrong. she just helped a friend.<br /><br />6. favortisem. the parents played favoritism with their children. patty, their firstborn daughter is clearly the least favored while sharon, the five year old brat is their favorite daughter. the dad says that he wanted to take sharon to hollywood but clearly forgets his other daughter.<br /><br />7. the dad. i hated him! he was so mean patty might as well had hitler himself as her father. her dad beats her for no apparent reason and the way he talks to her in the end will make you so mad you'll be caught thinking "patty would get better treatment in a concentration camp".<br /><br />well there you have it folks. 7 reasons i hate this book. instead of reading this book read "the diaries of anne frank" or anything else because i warn you, it is very depressing and it will leave you really mad! the only reason it gets 4 stars is because of anton, patty, ruth, and the grandparents!
