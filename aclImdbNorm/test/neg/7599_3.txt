it has been a tradition since my first vhs recorder for me to collect several of the incarnations of the old chestnut by charles dickens, and i taped this one and "karroll's christmas" this year. fortunately, when this one was run on the hallmark channel at the ungodly hour of 3 am, i was spared having to edit commercials from it. this was, however, it's only saving grace. <br /><br />the writing was excruciatingly dull with almost no clever scenes to save it from being anything more than a teeny-bopper soaper like beverly hills 90210. in this one, a good man who was cast aside for her celebrity seems the only logical explanation for her transformation into a scrooge-like tv talk show hostess. it wasted dinah manoff who just plays bitch goddess to the other bitch goddess tori spelling (who, by the way, had more coats of paint on her face than some colonial houses) and bill shatner is perhaps one of the few fun things in this otherwise dreary adaptation. <br /><br />some of the best opportunities are wasted like the entrances of the ghosts. aunt marla's entrance could have been spectacularly funny in the hands of a decent writer, but this christmas turkey didn't have one, evidently.<br /><br />tori spelling may be a lovely person, but she has all the acting skill of a mannequin, and that makes for a bad show all by itself. <br /><br />yes, it was good to see gary coleman work again, but the script gives him nothing to do really except roll his eyes and spout truly lame dialogue.<br /><br />and what is most infuriating was that the transformation from scroogedom to tori "sweet and light" is as convincing as a passionate conservative. now, if anyone wants to write the ultimate scrooge tale of a george bush and karl rove, we might have a refreshing change from the usual bad christmas carol clones.<br /><br />i suppose if you're a fan of ms. spelling and/or 90210, this might be your cup of christmas cheer. i'd prefer a stiff shot of scotch and a cold beer to wash it down myself. this one i just may cast away before it is with me here for a long long time.<br /><br />god save us everyone!
