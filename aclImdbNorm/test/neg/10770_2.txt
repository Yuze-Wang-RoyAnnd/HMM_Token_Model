i don't know why they even kept the name. how they could call the series 'the scarlet pimpernel' after they deviated from the novels so much, i wouldn't have a clue. the character names are the only things they kept, and even then they changed a few of those, and mixed them up, and changed percy's relationships with them. admittedly, i only watched about two hours at the most of it, but that was enough for me to realize that the series was nothing like baroness orzcy had portrayed her characters, and probably would have been rolling around in her grave when it was filming and airing. poor lady. i hope that when the next person wants to make a movie/series of the book they don't ruin it as completely as this series did.
