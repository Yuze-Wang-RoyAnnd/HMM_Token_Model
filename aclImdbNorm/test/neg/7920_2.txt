first, they ruin it with the uniquely bad animation quality, then, they get voices that sound nothing like the original. they make sooo many movie mistakes. when sasha is singing in count me out, the drummer disappears and then reappears, itchy's shirt keeps changing color, his hat keeps changing position, one of the bridge is white, everyone in the background appears fat, halos keep changing colors and appearing and disappearing. even heaven appears different. i don't give a damn if this is a low budget film, they shouldn't cut corners on animation. they completely ruined the first adgth. the only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack.
