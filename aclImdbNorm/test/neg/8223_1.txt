garden state was a mediocre film at best. the film seems more like a compilation of thoughts that the writer (zach braff) had, rather than a cohesive story. the disjointed plot may have been more engaging if it weren't interspersed with pointless scenes that were nothing more than "quirky." coincidentally these scenes are often the ones that are relayed in conversation (zack walking past faucets that turn on as he passes, crazy under-cranked party scene, shouting over a gorge, the list goes on).<br /><br />the main character is flat, disengaging, and ultimately unlikable, which is exhibited most in the scene where he talks to his father, selfishly ignoring his fathers problems, including a recently deceased wife, and droning on about his own "what am i to do with my life?" problem.<br /><br />the film ends when andrew (zach braff) decides not to go back to la because he cannot tear himself from the love of his life, sam (natalie portman) whom he has known for 2 days. which can only lead me to the conclusion that the message of the film is that love at first sight cures occupational dilemmas... sure you could interpret it as a misappropriation of priorities, but if that is the case it could have been done better. much better.<br /><br />this film does not know what it wants to be. a drama, a comedy, a teenage-wasteland film, or a gamut of other things. i say this not as a single-genre oriented person, but as a person who loves multi-genre pieces such as those mastered by stanley kubrick. the reason i feel it does not work for garden state is because rather than blending the genres together, it jumps around; one scene is one genre, the next another, and back again, so on.<br /><br />i have heard many people tell me to cut zach braff some slack, after all it was his first feature film and he debuted as director, writer, and lead actor. impressive as it was a first film, i should think that with as much money as he has, he could do better. there have been much better first-time feature film directors (michel gondry "human nature", david gordon green "george washington"). maybe if he stuck to writing or directing or acting it would have been better. zach braff is a talented performer, maybe his second attempt won't be so tedious and disjointed.
