"menace" is not funny. it tries hard - too hard. but rarely brings a smile. there is no acting, just mugging. one of the main characters wears a stupid grimace on his face the entire movie. no doubt as the less talented wayans brothers starred, wrote and produced the film they were entirely blind to their lack of talent.<br /><br />menace consists of a series of unfunny, one joke skits. the punchline can be seen a mile off, but you have to wait until it all unfolds. no zippy one-liners or snappy dialogue here. just one scene after another building up to the joke. the jokes themselves are juvenile. loc dog (the one with the perma-grimace) talks to a beautiful woman - but then she has ... bad breath and then she picks her nose and then, wait for it (remember you must always w-a-i-t) she farts! how funny is that? ten-year old boys may find it funny as they won't have heard the jokes as many times before. alternatively, if you like watching movies completely drunk or stoned then you will be able to follow along and may even find it amusing. the challenge will be getting drunk enough to reduce your mental state to the level of the movie without passing out.
