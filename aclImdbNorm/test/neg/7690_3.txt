the amount of hype and the huge success this film has encountered is evidence how desperate our people are towards a good independent saudi film. in fact the huge success of "tash ma tash" is also an evidence.<br /><br />i'm not going to start of how important film making is, as it is obvious to those with half a brain how films have changed the world.<br /><br />and i'm not going to say how much our society needs a bunch of films to clear out a lot of issues we have in our country. religion, politics, women's rights, education, general health, terrorism, law and many many more.<br /><br />along came news about the fist saudi movie which should've been a remedy to some of the issues we have, especially towards the youth. instead we experienced a bald movie for that matter.<br /><br />the ignorance and naivety of the script was obvious. it was as if a 13 year old had written it.<br /><br />now i've heard that the budget for this film was huge. i would like to know where the money went, huh? the effects were really ugly, the editing was poor. the script was "kharabeet". you really don't know what the story is and what the director aims at from this film.<br /><br />a note on the actor who played the religious brother, his performance was good but with bad direction. another thing with the role of the religious friends he had, that is not how religious guys act here in saudi arabia! they are not "evil" as this film intends. in fact they are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet with some really uncommon way of living, and that is what should've appeared in the film.<br /><br />the youth are following the religious here because of a reason, and that is the youngsters are the most passionate and sentimental. and with the well formed principles the religious live on, the youngsters follow them. again, this is what should've appeared.<br /><br />we need another "first film" with a saudi writer, actor, director, composer, even cameraman. so that they all work with passion towards their experiment, not just for the money!<br /><br />and we should do what shakespeare did hundreds of years ago, we should include phrases from the qur'an in the script of the movie. as the people in our society still see art as a form of sin, the challenge a saudi movie maker is facing is changing the mentality in that angle.
