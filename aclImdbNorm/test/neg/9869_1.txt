i have always loved bad creations, rhetorical criticism and my film professor validated that for me in college. this is not as bad as the star wars holiday special, there is nothing bottom of the lunchbox than that mistake. this the fantastic four film, complete with the i-have-no-idea-why-hes-excessively-tweaking-his-fingers doctor doom, is high on the list of colossal mistakes. doom's dialogue "kill him!...let him go!" is classic as it is staggering in its hilarity. the editing is good, and the director of photography isn't half-bad...those are the up-sides. i cannot, however, subject all my friends to watch in its entirety, but if i can get the chance i show them the "can jonny and sue come to outer space with us!" scene i do. i also include the final scene scene, where redd richards in his ff outfit for some reason, alongside his bride sue in her wedding dress, get into the limo...the payoff is the extendo arm in farewell as they drive away. most people are in complete disbelief that something like this exists.
