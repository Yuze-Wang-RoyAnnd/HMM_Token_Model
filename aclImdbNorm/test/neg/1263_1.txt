i wanted to like this movie, but there is very little to like about it. it starts out with jean stapleton and a randy newman song in iowa (northwest iowa, i guess), reminiscent of norman lear's cold turkey, which was one of the best movies ever made, according to people on imdb. so far, so good. and the idea of the archangel michael living at pansy milbank's motel on earth? well, give it a chance, it's supposed to be a comedy. okay, so far, so good. but michael does things that an angel not fallen would never do, and that completely blows any credibility the movie might have had. the other characters in the movie don't have much appeal, either. michael brings a dog back to life, and we're supposed to be in awe of that. the people make up corny country songs. in the end, stapleton dances with travolta. big deal. if she was smart, she wouldn't even be in this movie. when it was over, i thought, "gee, what a stupid, tasteless, boring, corny, sacrilegious movie!" it's not fit to be seen by children or anyone else.
