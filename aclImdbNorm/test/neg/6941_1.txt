this movie basically uses spousal rape as one of its main comedic devices. now i turned it off at the point when he literally ties her to the bed and rapes her, but i cannot really imagine how that was eventually turned around into something endearing and funny. this movie not only squandered a wonderful cast and was consistently unfunny, it actually managed to be rather brutally disturbing and misogynistic. how so many people seem to find it a sweet family flick is beyond me. "i sure enjoyed canning those apricots last night" is not a funny joke when you know it refers to forcing an unwilling virgin to have sex with you in the hopes she will eventually learn to like it. watching a peeping tom jerk off is not family fun. i honestly feel worse off for having watched half of this creepy "comedy" and am totally baffled by these positive reviews.
