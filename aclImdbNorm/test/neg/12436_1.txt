look, don't get me wrong i love independent films but come on! i could barely sit through it without wanting to kill myself. the director had absolutely no talent and he turned something that could have been ok to a f***ing nightmare. i am a punk enthusiast myself and even the music sucked. the acting was crap.<br /><br />i am usually a bleeding heart for these low budget films but this one, this one didn't even try. please don't waste your precious time and money. i am sorry to be so harsh but come on! it dragged on and and on and on. remember when the kids got into that party with the weird cupcakes and the watermelon martinis? how did they just blend in? it made me frustrated how they could just go anywhere they wanted and get into trouble and have sex and a "meaningful conversation" with whoever they wanted. i know im blathering but my mind is just buzzing with everything i hated about this film.
