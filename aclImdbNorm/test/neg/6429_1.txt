what can be said about such a pathetic movie ? <br /><br />- very bad acting ! the main actress seems to know only one facial expression : fear mixed with weakness. like a poor beaten dog... the other actress (the one who plays the evil) looks like the female double of ozzy osbourne, with an awful red wig. the other actors are so pitiful that they don't even worth being described. <br /><br />- there's absolutely no plot. the story begins with possibilities but goes nowhere : we don't know anything about the meaning of "11:11", nor who rayden really is, excepted the simple "she's evil" or "she's a child of apocalypse"... which is not an explanation. we don't know why the parents have been killed, what kind of danger is growing and why sara was chosen. as the film goes on, we just watch pseudo-scary scenes, with a bad music. moreover, the end doesn't tell anything : we just see two possibilities as if one of them was a bonus scene or the director's cut... there's no plot, so no possible interpretation. <br /><br />- "11:11" is just full of clich'es ! it is so obvious that i couldn't help laughing. for example : the deserted library or the bathroom scenes, ghost silhouettes walking with a blast of wind, ... there's even the fashionable "little scary girl" as in "dark water" or "the ring". of course, the main character is bullied at school and looks like a stereotyped gothic girl (dark hair, red lips, skinny, black clothes). is it an obligation to make her credible ? i don't think so. the psychology of sara is so few developed and so typical that it doesn't make her credible, nor endearing.<br /><br />- terrible direction : as i said, nothing original, everything has already been seen a thousand times and is used here without any real purpose. <br /><br />- there are some funny incoherences. for example, i don't know if "ghost science", "paranormal course" or whatever is taught in american universities... in europe it is really not the case : teachers talking about negative energies or using "unmaterial" creatures sensors... ridiculous. also : how can you watch a movie shot in the sixties with a super-8 camera on a computer screen without spending hours of your time for a digitalization (in the movie they watch it immediately on the computer screen) and how can you, on this old film, isolate a tiny detail then zoom in and see a perfectly identifiable face ? i wonder if the director has ever tried to digitize an old analogical film...<br /><br />eventually, "11:11" just worths being watched if you like to laugh at silly movies, or maybe if you want to fall asleep on your couch... but it's an expensive way to fall asleep !
