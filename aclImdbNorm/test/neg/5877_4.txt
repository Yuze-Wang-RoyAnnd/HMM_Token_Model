you can see that if the flick ain't directed by his brother, this is the best he can do. and sad to say, his best just doesn't cut it. "ice cream man" is a very bizarre horror film, that's a real blast to watch if you're in the right mood. in the wrong mood, it has been known to cause people to lash out violently at loved ones, so please, watch with caution.<br /><br />clint howard stars (does anything really star clint howard though?) as the "evil" "psychotic" "bizarre" (yes all in quotes, he's not quite any of these, but he's getting close) ice cream man, who tortures the local children with bomb pops that are really melty and ice cream that has chopped up humans and dogs in them. ick.<br /><br />anyway, the plot's really just an excuse to show of the...well, the...um, well it's a plot. oh wait, i know! it's an excuse to show off all the loser actor cameos! there's jan michael vincent and lee majors ii (the sequel?) as cops tracking the elusive man o' ice cream. and even doug lleyweln appears as a supermarket clerk.<br /><br />even better than that, are some of the bizarre goofs in the film. i really like the fact that for some reason, instead of hiring a fat actor to play the unhappy "fat" kid of the group, they just make this one kid wearing padding under his clothes. and the entire premise that anyone would by scoops of ice cream from a ice cream man. who buys ice cream scoops from the ice cream man? then there's the entire psychiatric ward scene, in which jan michael vincent's acting ranges from mildly interested, to bored beyond the state of consciousness. these are the cops who also scour the ice cream man's place for clues but manage to complete gloss over the ice cream truck (where, of course, the various bodies and such are kept). oh well, better luck next time troops.<br /><br />howard himself overacts like he's making sure people two towns over can see and hear him. it's all just plain dumb. and fairly fun to laugh at in the fine tradition of the pumaman or gymkata. you'll have a good laugh with the right sense of humor. i love that one.<br /><br />
