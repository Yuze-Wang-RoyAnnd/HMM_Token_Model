i usually don't categorize a moving as boring. i am not big on action flicks and my senses do not need to be stimulated during a movie. in fact i enjoy a good rational logical dialogue and story line. unfortunately, this movie has none of those characteristics. diane lane is the only saving grace in this movie and even her beauty cannot save it. terrible overbearing music equals the moronic dialogue and acting. none of the actors actually connect with each other and as a result the movie does not connect with the audience. i guess the scenes where the townspeople are marching somewhere were suppose to add to the story but it seems that they were inserted just to fill space. the scenes appeared choppy and incoherent. there were some nice shots of the ocean and the beach which were beautiful.
