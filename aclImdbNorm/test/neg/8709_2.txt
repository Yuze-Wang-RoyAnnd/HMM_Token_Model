i had high hopes for this movie i even gave up a night of watching stargate for this movie. i found it had a rushed feel about it and a lot of the key biblical moments and facts were missing. i might be a bit jaded and spoiled for the 1956 version, as i have watched that one every year for the last 20 or so years. i doubt this one will make it to the realm of yearly classic, as the other one has. if you have not seen the 19546 version, you might like this one but, i seriously doubt it and urge you to skip this one and go rent or buy the classic one. this has some nifty special effects but that is not what i look for when telling a movie like the ten commandments. i was kind of looking to see how they told the story, and the writers did not do a good job with this one.
