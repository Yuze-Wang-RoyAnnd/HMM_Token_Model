how many disaster movies can there be before we get tired of them. come on, we can see them on the discovery channel all day long.<br /><br />i agree with the comment that the first part of this movie is just a soap opera. the great predictor's grandson makes a prediction and everybody starts moaning about how he is ruining the family name. the evil mother-in-law convinces the wife to throw him out into the arms of his mistress, whom she wants to meet. can you believe that? the wife wants to approve the new wife! at the same time the mistress' has someone in love with her that doesn't have a wife, but she sends him packing.<br /><br />now, that the soap opera is over, the earthquake appears.<br /><br />the special effects are really good, but the dubbing is bad. that is why i like subtitled films. the actors are all very experienced and have won many awards, so you will get to see some of japan's best in an oft-repeated story.<br /><br />but, the soap-opera story returns with a kitchy ending.
