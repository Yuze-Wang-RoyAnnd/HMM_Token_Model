in london, the venetian carla borin (yuliya mayarchuk) is searching an apartment to share with her beloved boyfriend matteo (jarno berardi). she meets the lesbian real estate agent moira (francesca nunzi) and rents a large apartment. when the jealous matteo finds some pictures and letters from her former lover bernard (mauro lorenz) in venice, he hangs up the phone and the upset and amoral carla has a brief affair with moira and intercourse with an acquaintance in a party. when matteo comes to london, he concludes that his lust for carla is more important than his jealousy and her behavior.<br /><br />"transgredire" is another "soft porn" of the sick director tinto brass with a shallow and ridiculous story where every situation is a motive to expose the intimate parts of the women in the cast. the amateurish camera exposes the body of the beautiful yuliya mayarchuk in every possible angle and her character is abused, touched and licked in every part of her nice body, but without showing explicit penetration. this flick is only recommended to fans of this director and as a voyeur experience seeing yuliya mayarchuk naked in erotic situations. my vote is four.<br /><br />title (brazil): "a pervertida" ("the pervert")
