the actors & actresses on this series are ok, but the scripts have been absolutely horrible. this family is so dysfunctional that they are not even funny. in fact, the scripts illustrate very often how not to be a parent. the scripts are so bad, they make homer simpson look like a better father than this one.<br /><br />anyone who is becoming a parent, if you want to see what not to do with your kids, this show is the perfect guide. i think the garbage this show feeds us, is beyond words. <br /><br />michael rapaport has seen much better material in his career (including his role in hitch). they need a strong lead in & better, much better scripts than what i have seen to this point.<br /><br />if you think this is generational, my teenager even turned off one show of this because they thought it was horrible.
