i'd picked this one up time and time again in the rental store, wondering if i should give it a shot. today i broke down and gave it a whirl, and i probably shouldn't have.<br /><br />while the writer/director did give the film a respectable effort, it fell far short of engaging. the characters, while you wanted to feel for them, just didn't have enough development or depth for you to get truly involved with them. sara's sexual outbursts got tiring-- fast. i don't mind sex in films, and i don't mind bitchy characters, but being a "bad" girl doesn't mean you're prone to excitedly ask people at random if they'd like sexual favors. by the time what happened to the characters was revealed, i was bored, and ready to fast-forward to the climax, the end, anything exciting... and nothing delivered. the things the folks in the story eventually inform you of seems forced and unrealistic, and just wasn't played quite right. if they'd have thrown a bit more anguish in there, i might have been interested. this should have been a more of a suspense/drama film, and should have stuck to the title "jon good's wife" rather than the whole "red right hand" and horror film-like cover. hell... this should have had suspense, period.<br /><br />either way... watch this on a rainy day or a late night when there's nothing on the television. though this isn't as great as i'd hoped, i would go for this over some infomercials.
