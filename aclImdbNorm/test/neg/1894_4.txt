yes, this bizarre feature was written by john sayles. shot in toronto, it's yet another '80s era feature about the dangers of the urban jungle, where the police fear to go and the homeless and the criminal classes are the only inhabitants. into this mix comes the myth of wild thing, a feral young man raised by a bag lady after his parents were murdered by a dirty cop on the take (maury chaykin) and chopper, the local crime lord (robert davi). stir in the local do-gooders (priest sean hewitt and clueless social worker kathleen quinlan), and you have a recipe for some rather unexciting action sequences. davi is the standout amongst the cast, and cinematographer rene verzier does a pretty good job. otherwise this is a rather lumpen action pic that won't satisfy action fans and will leaves sayles' admirers slack-jawed.
