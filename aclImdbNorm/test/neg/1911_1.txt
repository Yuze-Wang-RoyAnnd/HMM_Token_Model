well, if you set aside the fact that this movie features abysmal acting; and, if you set aside the fact that the story is muddled and wanders off in about five different directions without ever deciding which way it really wants to go; and, if you set aside the fact that i didn't find a single scene in this movie that was remotely interesting; well, if you set all that aside, this is still a really terrible movie!<br /><br />i take it that this is supposed to be a love story about rich guy/poor girl. i never really understood for a moment how this romance between kelley (chris klein) and samantha (leelee sobieski) ever got started. the inexplicable romance is made worse by a complete lack of chemistry between klein and sobieski. the screenplay (by michael seitzman) is dull to the point of stupefying. how seitzman managed to write the thing without falling asleep is a miracle; that he would think anyone would want to pay to see this is unbelievable.<br /><br />did i mention that this is a really, really terrible movie?<br /><br />i'd give it a zero, but the imdb doesn't provide for votes of zero. so i give it a one while holding my nose.
