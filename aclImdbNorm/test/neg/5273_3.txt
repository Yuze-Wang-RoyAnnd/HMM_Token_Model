kevin spacey is without a doubt one of the best actors of the 90s. after his performances in the usual suspect, se7en and american beauty, you expect more and more from him. that is why ordinary decent criminal is a huge disappointment.<br /><br />michael lynch is the most artful criminal in dublin who is never in a bad mood. his next heist becomes an obsession when his partners start questioning michael's ability to plan everything perfectly, although this is the only thing he does when he isn't playing good father at home.<br /><br />i guess, it's partly my fault for not paying enough attention to the thousand plot details which sadly turn out to be the "essence" of the film. i gave the movie a chance by calling it a parody and.... well, parodies are always funny, no matter what they spoof or how they do it. so, it wasn't after all a complete parody on purpose. it's just a different con movie that desperately tries to be funny and fails.<br /><br />unlike some of his "colleagues", ordinary decent criminal depends too much on story development and logical continuity, forgetting what's the main reason, the viewer has picked this kind of movie - to be entertained. this is definitely not entertainment. it includes one of the most ridiculous scenes ever - the introduction of michael's two wives. i don't know whether it's some kind of a mindless metaphor or strange, dark humor, but the chicks are sisters. remember, spacey's character has kids.<br /><br />ordinary decent criminal is complex and confusing. you are not waiting for a funny scene. instead, you carefully follow the dialog, because there is a big possibility of losing yourself into the boring, pale universe, the film has inhabited.<br /><br />let's go back to spacey. i wonder in what condition he has been, signing for that movie. it's not miscasting, but something much worse. an insult to his work in american beauty, released an year before ordinary decent criminal. the character michael is eccentric and talkative. spacey is almost pathetic at times. the only cure for this, is thinking of lester burnham and roger kint.<br /><br />writer, gerrard stembridge should definitely re-consider his screen writing abilities and be more objective this time. because, the dialog is very weak and the scenes are often pointless. and we are still talking about a comedy.<br /><br />ordinary decent criminal is a really bad crime comedy which does not deserve your attention.
