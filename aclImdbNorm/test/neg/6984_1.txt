at the opposite end of the spectrum from raiders of the lost ark is david hemmings' utterly inferior adventure regarding the salvage of a world war ii-era plane with a valuable cargo. assets include beautiful new zealand settings, brian may's energetic music score and some dandy helicopter flying and jet boat chases. the bad, however, far outweighs the good. donald pleasence hams as perhaps never before; half of his dialog is almost unintelligible. george peppard attempts an australian (i think) accent, then gives it up halfway through. lesley ann warren is at her most irritating. ken wahl is, well, ken wahl. the dialog is painful to hear and hemmings' direction is largely inept. the script is not only obvious but terrible. jokes fall flat, scenes carry no punch and continuity is virtually non-existent. according to the end credits, two men were killed piloting jet boats during the making of the film. what a waste.
