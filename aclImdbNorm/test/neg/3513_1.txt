dumb, meaningless movie should appeal to southern rednecks, teenagers with iq's bordering on retarded and the average bush supporter. noble willingham plays the lead in this simpleminded script for what it is and uses a generous dose of mfers, eff this and eff that and sobs. the ending which i anticipated to "save" this hollow story was the biggest letdown, leaving me hanging and wondering, "why"?<br /><br />it's a story of cat & mouse or more like bully vs. victim.<br /><br />don't waste your time unless you like hearing the phone ringing every 2 minutes and constant cursing and screaming throughout this 123 minute piece of dumpster droppings.
