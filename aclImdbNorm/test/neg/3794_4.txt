i went to see this 3 nights ago here in cork, ireland. it was the world premiere of it, in the tiny cinema in the triskel arts centre as part of the cork film festival.<br /><br />i found "strange fruit" to be an excellent movie. it is a bit rough around the edges, but for a low-budget movie that is to be expected! in general the acting (particularly from the main lead kent faulcon) is wonderful, the cinematography and direction excellent, and the script hugely entertaining and thought-provoking, with some nice set-ups and witty dialogue.<br /><br />the ending was a bit sudden, with no conclusion given to characters and events once the finale came to its gripping end ... but perhaps that's what the filmmakers were going for? it certainly did make the movie more unsettling. i did like the fact that the main character never came to terms with his mother on screen: it leaves you wondering whether or not he ever will, as in real-life sometimes these things are never settled. this was a good choice, to leave it unresolved rather than sentimentally wrapping it up!<br /><br />taut and suspenseful throughout, "strange fruit" is a hugely ambitious debut and i have high hopes for what the writer/director kyle schickner will unleash next. he - and his colleagues - are a talent worth watching.<br /><br />i hope "strange fruit" gets a wider release soon, as more people deserve to see this movie, an above-average thriller with some original and insightful twists on homophobia and racism in america's deep south.<br /><br />highly recommended: 7/10
