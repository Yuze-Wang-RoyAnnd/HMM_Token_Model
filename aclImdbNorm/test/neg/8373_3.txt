maybe we aussies just have a totally different sense of humour and therein my lie the only problem here. i have a database of all the dvds i own (including those received as gifts - which this was) and so, when entering a new one, i always refer to imdb for such info as genre, runtime, director, leads etc. when entering this, i noted that it was a comedy and so i decided to watch it at a time when i wanted something light and a good laugh. well, it was neither! there were absolutely no laughs at all and an inordinate amount of gratuitous profanity (are there really radio announcers allowed to broadcast the sort of filth that steve jones dishes out? what if a decent child happened to tune to his station?).<br /><br />rather than enjoy a good laugh (or even a little giggle) i found the whole thing thoroughly depressing. i have given it 3 out of 10 but, to be honest, i don't know what those 3 are for! i suppose the basics of lighting and sound weren't too bad! <br /><br />we have an ostensibly stone-broke loser (giovanni ribisi) who still seems to be able to drive a reasonable car (who pays for the fuel?) and live in what could be a nice apartment (who pays his rent?) given the opportunity of forming what might have been some sort of meaningful relationship with what turned out to be a nice girl, he even blew that! perhaps it was she (lynn collins) who earned this movie the 3 points! the fact that she works as a stripper rather than a hairdresser is one of the few aspects of this movie that makes sense ("i make as much in one night doing this as i do in two weeks' hairdressing").<br /><br />unless you want to get depressed and bored to the teeth, forget it!
