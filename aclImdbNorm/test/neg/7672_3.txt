some slack might be cut this movie due to the fact that it was made in 1979. that much said, it really is pretty dire.<br /><br />never mind the laughable back-projection or the awful, awful camera-tracking of supposed "in-flight" objects, it's the stunts that the concorde pulls off that will have you blinking in disbelief at the absurdity. barrel-rolls, loop-the-loops and violent "evasive" maneuvers left me wondering why the air-forces of the world didn't just fly concordes as their main fighters.<br /><br />so, here are the important lessons i learned from this celluloid cheese-fest: <br /><br />1. the concorde is at least as agile as a phantom 4 jet-fighter.<br /><br />2. you can fire a flare gun at mach 2 simply by opening the cockpit window and sticking your arm out.<br /><br />3. if the flare gun fails to discharge, do not drop it, as it may then go off.<br /><br />4. the concorde can dodge up to two sidewinder missiles fired at it at once.<br /><br />5. a flare will distract a heat-seeking missile every time.<br /><br />6. switching off your jet-engines is a sure-fire way of throwing heat-seeking missiles off track if 5 (above) fails.<br /><br />7. when performing a crash-landing in the concorde, it is apparently impossible to jettison your fuel beforehand.<br /><br />8. concorde pilots are all combat-trained veterans.<br /><br />as you might imagine, this film is not very realistic. the effects are primitive by today's standards and that, coupled with the nonsense acrobatics the concorde performs, makes this a movie deserving of little but scorn.<br /><br />not recommended. not recommended at all!
