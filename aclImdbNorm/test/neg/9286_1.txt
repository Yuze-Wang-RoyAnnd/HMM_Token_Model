it's the single unfunniest thing i ever watched. it's sad how he tries so hard to come up with a good joke and all he does is curse and thinks his disgusting vulgarity is funny. he is the most bitter person i ever saw. his whole act he is trying to show how much he doesn't care, and by that only showing how much he's angry at the critics and the people with any taste and sense of humor who'd rather go through immense torture than go watch his "show". there are good comedians, there are bad ones and there are horrible ones. but this guy is in a league of his own. i feel sorry for him and even more for the people who find him funny.
