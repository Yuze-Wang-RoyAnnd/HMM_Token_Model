another example that we should stay away from trying to do spectacular action movies in sweden, it doesn't work, except for widerbergs still unsurpassed mannen pa taket. stormare does the best he can, i suppose, and some scenes are mildly effective, but the plot is full of holes. why does hamilton continue the attack on the base, knowing that his wife is held hostage? it was fun to see mark hamill, but his bad guy-part was very underwritten. i'm constantly amazed that relatively big swedish movies like this get made without a sensible, functioning script. 1 out of 5.
