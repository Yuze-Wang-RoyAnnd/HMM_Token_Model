possible minor spoiler<br /><br />it's not a terribly objective review but i just found this movie horribly depressing. like a lot of russell t. davies'<br /><br />work, it asks more questions than it can answer. his best work (bob & rose, doctor who) revels in hope against the odds and perseverance even after apparent defeat. these uplifting themes seemed strangely absent here. i suppose the fact that i'm still thinking about it days after viewing is a testament to the quality of the program but the resolution was just too bleak for my tastes. <br /><br />i would, however, disagree with the reviews i've read complaining that the end feels "tacked on." i think each conclusion follows logically from its premise and the ending represented a sound personal belief that neatly resolved the primary theme of the show. while i never really questioned the progression of events, i felt like there was much that could have been expanded upon. i've also read that it was originally conceived as a four part series instead of two, and it's possible that the truncation has done some harm to the completed piece. however, these flaws appear throughout, in sequences and themes that sometimes feel rough or sketched in.<br /><br />to his credit davies is totally unafraid to write big, and you have to admire the sheer audacity and scope of this project. the premise he tackles here is the stuff of movies or novels
