there are so many holes in the plot, it makes you wonder if they knew they had an audience for this and just threw it together. i don't know much about george zucco, but i've seen him in two movies. obviously, he has been cast as the loving father, mad scientist, vampire guy. he looks so ordinary. i'm surprised that he ended up in the genre. this is the typical, "i will create monsters that can be used to fight as an army." by transferring wolf blood (or is it coyote) to his hired hand, he turns him into a werewolf. glen strange, who was one of karloff's successor's as the frankenstein monster, plays the kindly, lovable hired man who is victimized because he trusts the mad doctor. at first the scientist is able to control when petro (his name) can be transformed. but, like the invisible man, suddenly he starts morphing on his own and becomes a liability. there is a little love story of the daughter and a reporter with kind of a high pitched voice (golly miss brooks). she wants to leave but her father, the doctor, won't allow that. he is also driven by a group of his peers who mocked his research before and now he is going to have satisfaction. the way he plot to embarrass or kill them is pretty far fetched and depends a lot on petro and the guys sitting around waiting to be attacked. it's not a very good movie. the strong point is atmosphere of the woods as people and monsters lurk around the spanish moss. once again, the townsfolk are a bunch of morons, who look like they escaped from a bad western. one thing that stayed with me was that a little girl is the first victim and that seems unusual for a film of this era. there's also a pipe smoking old lady who knows about werewolves but nobody listens to her.
