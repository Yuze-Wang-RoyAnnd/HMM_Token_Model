normally i don't bother wasting my time writing comments for junk like this that i forget almost as soon as i see it, but since i saw this movie just yesterday on one of the comcast showtime channels (346, i think) i decided to make an exception.<br /><br />besides the fact that i enjoyed watching carol alt, i can't give any rational reason why i watched this movie through to the end. i'm always amazed that good-looking women are willing to appear in awful movies like this, but i suppose she thought this movie would lead to something better. i hope she was right, for her sake.<br /><br />otherwise, this is an all-too-typical straight-to-video laugh riot, or just a piece of garbage, depending on your point of view. while there are a few decent moments of action in this movie, they don't really connect well with the story, such as it is.<br /><br />the setup, as i recall, involved carol alt as a depressed housewife who believes her husband, a cop, is cheating on her. there was also something about their child dying in an accident, and she blaming him for it, but before that storyline went anywhere she shot and killed him.<br /><br />on the same fateful night, a wounded stranger comes to her door and she tends to him, and almost immediately her house is under siege by government stooges and mercenaries intent on capturing the stranger, who appears to have almost superhuman fighting skills.<br /><br />this same kind of material has yielded decent entertainment plenty of times before, most notably in matt damon's the bourne identity, and could have done so this time as well but this particular movie was let down by poor production values and a lousy script.<br /><br />this movie really falls apart at the end, when the mysterious stranger turns out to be a cyborg (!) who was programmed to be a policeman, and after discovering that carol alt killed her husband he tries to kill her! the movie wasn't particularly good up until this point, but the ending really ruins it by trying to turn a modest action-thriller into a lumpy terminator/robocop wannabe.<br /><br />i also thought that the violence in the movie was a bit excessive at the end, with the demented cyborg gouging out poor carol alt's eye before it finally bit the dust. what was the point of that? for that matter, what was the point of anything in this movie? it held my attention and entertained me for about an hour, until the end, when it reminded me that i wasn't watching a first-rate movie. it wasn't even really a second-rate movie, for that matter.<br /><br />the final scenes seem to hint at a sequel, which i don't think ever happened, although i haven't carefully checked the web for it. needless to say that i'm not in any hurry to see any sequel to this movie.
