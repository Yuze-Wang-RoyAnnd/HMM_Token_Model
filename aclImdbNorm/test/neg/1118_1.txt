i am speechless. matty simmons has managed to do something i thought impossible. he has made "the harlem globetrotters on gilligan's island" look like "citizen kane." painful cannot even begin to describe this piece of... i don't know. mind you, the premise sounded funny, but now that i've seen it, it's funny in the way that dropping an anvil on your scrotum is funny.<br /><br />i won't bother to describe the premise, as the title says it all, if only to say i don't think there was literally one funny thing in this film, not one, not even the monkey bite. how could one of the funniest characters in the "vacation" franchise, the sleazy white trash eddie (randy quaid), be made so horrifically unfunny ? i never felt so much sympathy for an actor in my life. i equally pitied the other actors participating in this "comedic" atrocity, miriam flynn (catherine, eddie's long suffering, but sunny-dispositioned wife), dana barron (the original audrey griswold), fred willard, and the stunning sung hi lee (perhaps the only reason to watch the film, if only with the sound off), save for that old commie, ed asner (uncle nick), he had it coming. alas, the audience didn't. i only say "thank heavens" that chevy chase, who has been in a slump for years, steered clear of this diarrhea splatter, it's the smartest career move he ever made.<br /><br />i don't know if you folks are religious like i am, but i know i'll be praying to the lord tonight to add 2 hours (if not 2 years) to my life to make up for the time i spent in front of the television that i'll never get back otherwise.<br /><br />hot water burn baby says zero out of 10 stars (if you take a few hits off the bong and drink the water, maybe 1/10th of a star out of 10)
