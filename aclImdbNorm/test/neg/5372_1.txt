when this show first aired i will admit to being intrigued by the premise and the setting. with an open mind i watched the first two episodes and naturally dismissed it as being destined to run for a half-season at most. i happened to be watching a/e recently and witnessed an ad for this garbage and i could barely contain my surprise. i truly hope people are watching this for a laugh and not taking it seriously. the characters are truly some of the most ridiculous and outright laughable on television, scripted or otherwise. it's obviously generating ratings so i must give the creators credit for establishing and maintaining a fanbase, but i seriously hope no one is watching this under any pretense of seriousness.
