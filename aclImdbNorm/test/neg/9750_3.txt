i just saw this movie. i liked the soundtrack.i saw first the trailer and was magnificent, like all hollywood movies, they know how to sell.but the movie is almost awful, first 30 minutes are interesting, but then.... like almost all new movies they blow it up. i don't get the idea, why that kid died??is a clich'e, every nigga' movie must have a kid to be killed, and everybody must become good after his death.lol.i don't understand what is the connection with the movie... and is so predictable, you know the end from the very first minutes.nothing new in this movie. i saw 'you got served' same idea but also... something new... this is something like 'honey', but is not a little bit difference between them.if you have no other option watch this movie, but be sure is the last option you take. and the choreography is worst than everything before. this is not a must see for sure...
