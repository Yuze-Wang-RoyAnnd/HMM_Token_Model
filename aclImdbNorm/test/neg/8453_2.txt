this movie was outright painful for me to watch. i understand that indie films do not have the same resources as other mainstream films. but there are basic elements of film making that typically you want to adhere to. first off, jump cuts. there are numerous in the film's opening 15 minutes. there are shots in which it appears that two separate takes of the same shot were edited together. what i mean by this is a character will say half a line from one take, and the rest of the line is from a different take. secondly, the dialog. i understand that many writers strive for a very realistic and true dialog for their films. since this film is very specific to its location, the dialog must be spoken in a specific tone also (example: set a movie in boston, yet people use west coast slang with a chicago accent). even with understanding this, it is still hard to sit through some of the lines these actors present. these are only the two most vivid problems i encountered with this film. there were a few others. i do not mean to sound like a harsh critic who doesn't know a thing. i have years of experience in the film (more importantly the low budget indie film) industry. i also understand that with many directors there is often a method to their madness. i have been unable to discover this method used in this film. this makes it difficult when trying to decide whether i view this film as an example of unique style in film making, or just another low budget, poorly put together film. i honestly hope that it is not the latter. if anyone has any insight into why things were done a certain way, or has any thoughts/views of their own concerning this film, i would love to hear them. hopefully i can understand this film more and my current opinion can be changed.
