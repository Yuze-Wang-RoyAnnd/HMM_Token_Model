i wasn't really interested in seeing step up, but my friend just kept bugging and bugging me to see this film, especially since she is so in love with channing tatum, i tease her constantly about it saying how that's the only reason why she loved the movie. but she somehow convinced me that it was a movie worth seeing, that if i loved movies like dirty dancing, take the lead, and save the last dance, that i should love step up, eh, what the heck? i guess every movie in some way has it's right to a view.<br /><br />well, you know those movies i just mentioned up top? dirty dancing, take the lead, and save the last dance? well, put them in a blender with some gangsta love in it and that's what you have. not to mention if you've seen those movies, well, frankly, you have seen step up. because channing is lower class with street smarts who just naturally feels the music while that snobby up class girl must follow step by step, how will they ever fall in love if they are so different? after all, this is their chance to "step up" to the passion, the mystery, and the lust of the dance! <br /><br />ok, that was a silly plot explanation, but like i said, as long as you've seen those movies i mentioned, or even if you just saw the plot, you get the movie. i don't understand how it actually has a 5.5 rating, i bet it's those channing lovers! lol! i'm kidding with you guys, but it's all good, i guess i just didn't get what others did with the passion, the mystery that is the dance! oh, antonio bandares, where are you when we need you?! <br /><br />4/10
