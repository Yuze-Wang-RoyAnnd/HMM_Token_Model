i saw this film at the edinburgh film festival, and would not recommend it. it is two and a half hours long, during which nothing much happens at a wading-through-porridge pace.<br /><br />the main characters are gormless and totally lacking in charisma or personality. no-one smiles at all during the film (neither would i if i had their lives), and although domino seems to have a healthy sexual appetite she doesn't seem to enjoy sex at all.<br /><br />the whole experience is depressing and ponderous, the director lingering over each scene in a way that drove me crazy rather than striking me with the beauty of his technique.<br /><br />too many questions were left in my mind: why does he sniff the algerian man's head? why does he levitate? what is he looking at over the allotment fence? why does he kiss joseph? why did we go and see this rubbish rather than ordering another bottle of wine in bouzy rouge?
