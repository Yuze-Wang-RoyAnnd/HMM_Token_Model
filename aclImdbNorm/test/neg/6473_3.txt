but i still enjoyed watching her, so i gave it a 3 instead of a 1. her expressions are priceless. some of the other cast members (e.g., michael mckean) are really slumming, too. the cat himself is somewhat amusing. aside from that, the movie is all cliche, culminating in a much-too-long car chase. (it's also at this point that the movie becomes unnecessarily crude, having been very "family" until then.)
