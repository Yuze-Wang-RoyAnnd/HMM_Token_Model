...and in this series, i've been reduced to an annoying jock with a gay hairstyle. remember my friend marco, who got all the good lines in the books? well, in this series his one-liners put mr. freeze to shame. remember our uber-evil nemesis visser three? he's a bald guy with inane catchphrases. remember rachel, "xena, the warrior princess", and cassie, my sensitive and caring love interest? they've been turned into mindless bimbos by the 10 (!) writers who decided the original characters weren't cool enough for tv. remember the awesome extra-terrestial ax, who was cool, intelligent, and really, really liked cinnamon buns? in this series he's the token alien with an extremely annoying voice. remember the witty banter our team had in the books? in this series our dialogue is so dreary and stupid it's obvious the writers were pandering to the lowest common denominator.<br /><br />so forget everything you thought you knew about the animorphs! it was cassie who became allergic to morphing, not rachel, thought-speak is *supposed* to echo, and visser three and ax, rarely, if ever, appeared as andalites (no, it has nothing to do with the budget!). <br /><br />i'm not crazy. and i'm not lying. the jerks are all around us. and if you're unlucky, one of them might adapt one of your favourite books, or series, or graphic novels, into a really awful tv show. you've been warned.<br /><br />"finally... television worth watching." ~ (the very bald) visser three<br /><br />(r#91)
