i thought there might be some level of worth to this movie, and sat through the whole thing. i can summarize by saying it left a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />the movie started out ok, i think the initial characterization of herc was true to the myths. both as a child and a young adult he started out pretty strong but not the brightest bulb. but later on he somehow transforms into a charismatic speaker beloved by all. huh? <br /><br />other problem: terrible cgi. the satyr looked ok, but the rest of the critters just looked terrible, especially the hart, the phoniest looking beast in the movie. and how come leelee sobieski's skin was sometimes golden, sometimes normal? the worst part for me--and everyone should cringe at this--was the twelve labors of hercules. because the producers obviously didn't want to cover all of them; maybe they thought us primitive screw-heads watching this garbage couldn't count that high. instead of the twelve labors of hercules, we got the five labors of hercules. yes, the five labors! wtf?!? he did't even finish the last one, so it was really the 4 1/2 labors! just terrible. i'll take hercules: the legendary journeys over this piece of crap any day of the week.
