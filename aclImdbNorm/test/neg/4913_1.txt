aksar is an awful movie. the script, the story, the acting are all simply laughable. dino morea plays a man who pays emraan hashmi to seduce his wife. yes, this is as ridiculous as it sounds. both morea and hashmi offer incredibly and unsurprisingly bad acting. udita goswami plays the aggressive, capricious and angry wife. she is good-looking but has zero acting talent. the film has one hit song called "jhalak diklaja" which is composed and sung by himesh reshammiya. i never could understand the hype around this song as i never found it particularly good though it is catchy. the film is supposed to be a thriller but instead it just looks like a comic strip thanks to the terrible direction and writing. avoid this cheapo at any cost.
