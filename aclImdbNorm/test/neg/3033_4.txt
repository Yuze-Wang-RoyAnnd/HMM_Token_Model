the film moves along quite well but the acting, direction and editing leave a lot to be desired. the characters are mostly lifted from other films and the vinnie jones lookalike is straight out of gone in 50 seconds. the comedy gangster movie is a genre that should have lots of contrast, the stupid dealers in lock stock and the shoot out that leaves everyone dead. you should never really know whether to laugh or just sit there in shock. this movie had the right elements but it is too easy to sit there like a person knitting and tut at the small details that should have been fixed somewhere along the line and once belief has been unsuspended one just become increasingly critical. a pity cos it was a brave attempt and although clint eastwood is famous for saying that'll be ok for a scene, he puts the work in before he shoots and he is clint eastwood. here a bit more imagination with the camera and and a bit more coaching and rehearsal for the delivery of the lines would have made a big difference.
