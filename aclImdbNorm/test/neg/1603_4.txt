yeah, there's a "sleeper" watching sleeper cell and it was me. after reading comparisons to "24" (like on the cover of the dvd), i expected a fast-paced action romp. but nope... this series just putts along. in my groggy half-awake state i would think, "he's gonna... " and, poof, it would happen... "guess that van is gonna roll off the... " and there she goes.<br /><br />and so on.<br /><br />and why would darwyn, in extra-deep cover, pursue a babe? could it be, perhaps, to provide a little t&a? hey, that works for me, hence four stars rather than three.<br /><br />this show is no "24". i've watched "24". sleeper cell, you're no "24".
