have you ever read a book, then seen the movie, and wonder-how did they screw it up so bad? this is one of those. the book by huffaker, "nobody likes a drunken indian" was great, riotously funny...this movie is not. it seems as though nobody cared enough to move the direction along so we cared about the characters. this movie, which touches on some real concerns about indians, makes you wonder why we haven't seen more comedies about the holocaust, or slavery. not well done.
