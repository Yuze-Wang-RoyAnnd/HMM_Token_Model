what could've been a great film about the late poker pro (pre-poker craze) stu "the kid" unger turned into a disappointment.<br /><br />you can tell the filmmakers were working on a short-string budget. everything look filmed on the cheap. timelines seemed a bit off to me.<br /><br />casting michael imperoli from the sopranos was also a bad casting choice. he looked too old to play the baby-faced stu, he looked way too healthy for a coke addict (if you look at footage from the 1997 wsop main event, the real stu was so skinny and he practically had no nose from too much cocaine so he wore those sunglasses to hide them), and i kept expecting adriana to pop up and yell "chris-tu-phur!!!" <br /><br />also they skipped over the fact that he had a son from angie's previous relationship that committed suicide in the late '80s.<br /><br />every time i saw vincent van patten appear, i kept thinking he was going to announce "show tunes going off in stu's head." like he does on the wpt.<br /><br />if you're looking for real stuey footage, check espn classic because they rerun the 1997 wsop main event every so often. or try youtube. avoid this move like a bad beat.
