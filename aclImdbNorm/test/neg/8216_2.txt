okay, make no mistake - this is a pretty awful film, but i actually thought it had a couple of creepy scenes and overcame its pathetic budget every now and then. at the very least it's unintentionally funny in spots and has a definite air of creepiness and discomfort (a face burning scene, the part with the disfigured bride). <br /><br />this baby falls into the "so bad it's entertaining" category to me, and for that alone i would give it a star. the effects are terrible, the acting is abysmal, and the whole thing looks like it was shot in a day. you gotta love that toy ship at the beginning, too! it brought back childhood memories of seeing this on late night tv many years ago. while the alpha dvd print looks weak and as though it was recorded directly off an old television broadcast or something, i actually liked that in this case!
