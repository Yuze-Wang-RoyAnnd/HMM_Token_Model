not being a particular fan of westerns, i watched this primarily because i wanted to see lucille ball in something other than an "i love lucy" or "lucy show" type of role. here she plays christine larson, owner of a saloon in the arizona territory in 1868 who's about to be married to the unscrupulous local indian agent (dean jagger.) ball's performance was ok - nothing really more than that; she didn't blow me away. it succeeded for me in that the role was very different from what i'm accustomed to seeing her in - there was very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for, although the movie tried to maintain a gently amusing feel throughout. (a typical funny line - "there's two ways to deal with women - and no one knows either one of them!") i didn't find the story all that compelling, although i appreciated that the indians were shown as the victims of the indian agent. there's typical shootout action and a lot of horses - your typical western in other words. as to christine - we pretty much can guess from the beginning how her planned marriage is going to end up; it's just a question of how she's going to get there. if you like westerns, this would be a pretty typical one with a bit of humour thrown in. if you're not big on the genre, this will be lacking. i'm not big on the genre. 3/10
