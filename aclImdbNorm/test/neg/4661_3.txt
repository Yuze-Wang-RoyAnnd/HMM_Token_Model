dear readers,<br /><br />i've found in my studies of movies that whenever michael bay makes a movie, people pan it and hate it, yet they still go to see it and it makes somewhere around 100 million dollars. why? because michael bay is one of the top five directors of all time. standing alongside ridley scott, spielberg, kubrick, and miyazaki, michael bay has cemented himself as hollywood's best action/adventure director. that point is proved with his most panned film, armageddon.<br /><br />an asteroid the size of texas is hurtling towards the planet and the only way nasa can think to take it down is to land a team of men on the asteroid, drill to its core, and drop a nuclear warhead inside then blow up the asteroid. only one person is qualified enough to do it: bruce willis. willis portrays harry stamper, a grizzled hardened oil driller trying to keep what's left of his family together. not helping that fact is his daughter, grace (liv tyler), having an affair with his best driller, aj (ben affleck). hired by dan truman (billy bob thornton), the head of nasa, stamper and his team of roughneck drillers train to become astronauts and save the world.<br /><br />armageddon is a two part movie. first there's the funny parts where we meet the gang and wackiness abounds. then they get into space and all the comedy gets sucked out the window and is replaced by mind-blowing special effects, cool music, and great serious acting. murphy's law goes insane in the second part, meaning that everything that can go wrong, does in fact go wrong, increasing the tension of the film to outstanding levels.<br /><br />with a cool cast and crew (michael bay as director, jerry bruckheimer and gale anne hurd as producers, and j.j. abrams as one of the scriptwriters.), tons of special effects, great humor, awesome music, plus an intro done by mr. ben-hur himself, charlton heston, armageddon rocks big time.<br /><br />signed, the constant dvd collector, matt macleod<br /><br />parental warnings: this is not a film for kids. the f-bomb is used a few times and lots of other swear words are used as well, plus there's a strip bar scene and the extremely intense second part might be too hard for a kid to handle.
