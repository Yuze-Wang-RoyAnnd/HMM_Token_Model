this is a slick little movie well worth your time to find and see.<br /><br />it really speaks to all those mundane choices we all make every day and (like an h.g. welles story i can't quite recall) may live to want back.<br /><br />keep in mind that this is a short (very short). it starts out slowly but just as you begin to think it has become boring =bang= it's over. and, believe me, the 'punch line' is one you will remember.<br /><br />i'm not sure if the producers are going to make it available for purchase - or available on the web but either way you'd be happy you took the time to get hold of a copy - of that i am sure.
