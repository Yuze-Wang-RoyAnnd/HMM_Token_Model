i saw this film 2 weeks prior to going on a snowboarding holiday, so for me it was really just to get my mind in mode for my holiday. the film boasts some sweet snowboarding skills, throughout the films in the action scenes. these moments were great, a bit like watching extreme sports channel. sadly the story was quite honestly awful, the acting was generally alright, with a fairly small cast. this film is apparently comedy, at least it tries to be comical, but it seems like the comedy and the storyline was written by a teenager. the story lacks any depth or purpose and the comedy struggles to be anything more than a small snigger a few times during the movie. it might be worth renting just to see the snowboarding action, but then again there are plenty of movies out there that are totally devoted to snowboarding stunts and don't feature a un-funny badly written story.
