will there be please coming an end to hyping movies that are dealing about social conflicts or other human disasters? okay "care" is about childabuse, "care" is about perverts misusing boys in a school and how disgusting it might be, if it's a movie with a poor script and made with bad playing actors then it stays a bad movie. "care" is a movie that could have been, but is it because it was a tvmovie i don't know but everything seemed so limited that it comes over as some cheap movie that will be seen by some housewifes and fathers who decide not to go to bed. there are so many unanswered things in this movie...the relation with his mother for instance or the death of some abused boy from which we know nothing more. "care" should have been much much better.
