this movie is an incredibly self-indulgent character piece that assumes that the mere impression of a story is as good as an actual story. it was utterly painful to watch and had i not been suckered in to buy the dvd because of john travolta and the positive buzz, i would not have finished watching it.<br /><br />this film lacks anything resembling an interesting premise and seems to rely on weighty (and frankly, heavy-handed) characterization. there is one altercation scene between purslane and bobby long in which a tv is destroyed that, when played out, is incredibly flaccid and ill-timed.<br /><br />i found myself caring less and less about the characters as i watched it. it was probably very fun, film-school-wise, to make it. but it is just awfully boring to watch. a indulgent and pretentious film school project you should not waste money on.
