i found this film completely and utterly incomprehensible. i knew some of he facts about caravagggio, but here they were twisted and puzzling. the images were weirdly interesting but i was looking more for a biographical and/or critical accounting of caravaggio's life and works, not an lsd type drug trip. the dialogue was very confusing and jumping back and forth in time via the use of trains, calculators, typewriters and cigarettes was extremely distracting. had it been labelled an "artsy film" i wouldn't have purchased the dvd; now i have a dvd that i'll never watch again and who would buy it? i prefer mainstream films not those that require translation or elucidation. thumbs down on this one for me!
