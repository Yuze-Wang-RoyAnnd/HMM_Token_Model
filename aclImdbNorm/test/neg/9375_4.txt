to begin with, i have to admit i've never been a big fan of the dutch movie-genre. unfortunately watching de dominee hasn't made me change my mind. it shares some common flaws, like having a plot that's too predictable and linear for my taste. <br /><br />worse however is that the cast has their dialogues as if they were stage-actors in a play. unfortunately this is common too in many dutch movies and, at least to me, makes it impossible to feel any kind of involvement with the main characters.<br /><br />the actor that plays adri (i'm sorry, i forgot his name at the moment) is at least delivering a decent performance, and is one of the reasons i don't rate this movie even worse.another reason is the fact that at least it seems to have had some budget, and the production seems professional. <br /><br />ironically the fact that the acting is often too articulated might not be so much of a problem if you don't speak dutch,although i already warned you that the plot isn't spectacular either, but at least it might make it an acceptable movie to watch.
