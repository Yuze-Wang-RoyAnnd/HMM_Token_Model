there is nothing mean spirited or evil about this movie. it's just terribly dull. dull is the photography--- the film stock appears old and faded and washed-out. maybe it was even 16mm blown up to 35mm, dunno. dull is the script, which is tedious and 'jules pfeiffer'-ish. that is, kind of 1960s bossa-nova cocktail party cool. like our beatnik grandparents might have spoken if they were trying to appear really straight. the 'slice-of-life' characters were mostly annoying. true, they were real to life, but hey, if i wanted to see truly ordinary people doing really mundane and ordinary things, i'd just watch myself. i wouldn't trapse all the way down to a cinema and blow five quid, and an evening, watching someone else do it.<br /><br />i expected a funny, bright rom-com. what i got was more like what two intelligent and moderately talented 19 or 20 year-olds might have produced on their first day with a new video camera.<br /><br />i gave this a 4 out 10, because it appears that someone tried, at least.
