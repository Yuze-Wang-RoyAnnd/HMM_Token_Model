this movie started out as a quite decent-looking film but it never really kicked off, instead it became predictable and even a bit silly. some scenes were quite well made, the photography and the cuts used in combination with sounds and such made it a bit more interesting to watch, but since the story was quite slow it didn't manage to keep the interest alive. and more importantly, its not scary at all! it's supposed to be a horror movie but there wasn't a single scene that was close to frightening or even exciting..<br /><br />to be frank, the actors weren't all that great either, no colorful characters you ll remember for the rest of your days..<br /><br />overall a watchable movie but it doesn't add anything and once you've finished watching it, it wont last long until its already forgotten.<br /><br />the reason i watched it was because i had read some review giving it top scores, but i disagree and instead i would grade it 4 out of 10. if you still want some japanese horror, i would suggest you watch ju-on instead!<br /><br />
