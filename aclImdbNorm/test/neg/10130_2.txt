this is what disney channel shows to kids who are dumber than posts. it suits them well. it's not funny, the acting is the worst i've seen in many years, there are more stereotypes than there are actors, and everything about this show makes you groan and roll your eyes. wanna know why? not only is this show a waste of airtime, the lead "actress" selena gomez looks like a pig. jake t. austin's character needs some ritalin. david henrie's character needs to visit a strip club and get wasted. also, the writer of the show is inconsistent. in one episode, the security guard is called "sir" by one character and referred to as a woman by all else. <br /><br />hello? it's called proofreading and editing. do it sometime, disney. <br /><br />has anyone seen the promo for the new "four part bloodsucking saga"? disney wanted their own version of the twilight vs. harry potter thing. except a million times lamer. the wizards of waverly place movie?? think about it for a minute. family goes away on vacation and 16 year old daughter wants independence from parents. same plot from the proud family movie etc...<br /><br />what's worse is all the emmies and alma's it got. and most of the audience are some-what age's 4-13 (and no life teenagers). how many more years? before selena gomez is showing her tits?<br /><br />and disney shows are all crap..hack writers..hack shows..destroying the minds and wallets of today's youth..
