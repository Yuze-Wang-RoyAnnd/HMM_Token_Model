this was by far one of the worst movies sandra bullock has starred in. ben affleck should stay behind the camera and continue writing scripts. this is definitely his forte and acting is not. i actually lasted 54 minutes into this movie before i was so bored with it i felt compelled to leave the theater. it's a bore from beginning to, well 54 minutes into the film anyway. the premise of "guess what happened to me on the way to the ...." has been done over and over to death. somehow there just doesn't seem to be anything funny, or romantic about people cheating on each other. parents should be aware that this may not be a suitable film for your teenage children especially impressionable ones that may view sandra as a hero. there is a scene where the writers/producers/directors thought it would be nice to show how "acceptable" it is to smoke a joint .... while driving .... and then have no consequences at all when caught. i'm no prude, and i smoked my share when i was younger but i guarantee you i won't take my teenagers to see it and they're solid a & b students. if you want to see a good sandra bullock movie, rent "the net" or "hope floats" which i believe are two of her best works.
