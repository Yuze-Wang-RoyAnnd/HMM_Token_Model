as jennifer denuccio used to say on square pegs, "gag me out the door." i would definitely vote this movie on imdb's worst movie list.<br /><br />dennis christopher plays t.t., a guy from chicago who goes to california peddling his brother's jazz records. he is supposed to be a barney placed in the locals-only surfing community. but he acts more like he is new to civilization (just try to get through his sex scene without squirming). there are also the on-going adventures of the rest of the local population that the viewer must endure. that of duke (seymour cassell), the volleyball expert who tries to get t.t. to act like a normal human being, the obnoxious drunk surfers who cheat on their girlfriends, and the guy who makes a bet with another that he can live in car for sixth months.<br /><br />california dreaming is just a big old mess. it starts out like a typical seventies romp, complete with bad 70s music (even though this movie came out one year shy of the 80s). and dennis christopher comes off as the most irritable loser, it makes the movie hard to watch (keep your finger on the fast forward button). even if this movie was supposed to be about the surfer culture, the surf scenes are almost total garbage. the people at the surf contest look as though they can't keep from falling asleep.<br /><br />i guess the only cool thing is seeing tanya roberts outside of her role as midge on the sitcom "that's 70s show." and cassell wasn't bad, he was just in a bad movie.
