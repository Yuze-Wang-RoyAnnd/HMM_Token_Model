i remember flipping through channels on hbo and saw this. this, my friends, is one of the worst tv movies i've ever seen. there is no excitement in this film.<br /><br />the story starts out with drew summers(candice cameron bure) driving to a small town while in a trance. she stays with a couple who coincidentally, had a daughter named laura fairgate who looked exactly like her and is played by the same actress. even the townsfolk agree that they looked alike. thing is, laura was killed over a year ago. her boyfriend went missing around the same time she was murdered, making it look like he had killed her.<br /><br />while settling in this town for a while, drew starts to have visions and nightmares. these visions and nightmares might prove that the boyfriend of laura isn't the killer after all. throughout the film, you find out that ray ordwell sr.(denis arndt) is the one that raped her frequently over a period of time and killed her.<br /><br />the movie is too long and very boring. the film just drags on and on and on and on. amazingly, i saw another tv movie after this called (cloned) 1997 which was good but i'll review that one later.<br /><br />i give this movie 1 star out of 10. avoid this tv movie. it is not worth your time. this is the worst tv movie of 1997!
