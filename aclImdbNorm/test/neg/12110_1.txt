the director of this movie is a famous french tv presenter, patrick sebastien. he likes music and humor for rednecks, and his incredible movie is absolutely in his image. it's the story of a young retarded person, called "zep" (sic). a night, he sees his sister's sm sexual relation, and decide to do the same thing: he rape the girl who he loves! zep is placed in a asylum, and his unlucky girlfriend in a clinic. one man will find them. one man will reunite them. this man is a psychologist. this man looks like a hell's angel. this man is... patrick sebastien! with an excessive use of clich'es, we'll see how the absolute love can break all misunderstandings, and how a humanist doctor can force a victim to fall in love with her rapist. we'll also learn how using sandwiches in order to seduce a girl. not only patrick sebastien thinks that he can do better than one century of psychiatry, but he also impose us a silly left ideology; with the character of the father's girlfriend, a boss, who want to take away the feeble of his girl. distressing. but it's very pleasant to laugh at zep (mentally retarded persons are not funny, except in this movie.)
