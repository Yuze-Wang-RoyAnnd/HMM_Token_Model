this show makes absolutely no sense. every week, two ladies go to an estate to do some gardening, and every week without fail, they somehow stumble upon a murder. because everyone who owns a big house with a large garden is involved in a murder, right? but even if they did somehow happen to stumble upon murder after murder, wouldn't the smart thing to do be to tell the police? you know, the people who can actually do something about it... but every week, these two fools go around, polluting evidence, committing crimes of their own, and, in some cases, causing more murders. once they do miraculously solve the murders, there is no way the murderer could ever be convicted. all the evidence has been sabotaged. and you'd think people who are covering up murders would think not to hire these two, wouldn't you? yay! we've solved the murder! now like every other week, let's go and confront the murderer ourselves and, with no back-up, tell them that we know about it. there is no way we could get ourselves into any danger, is there? rosemary and thyme is one of the worst shows on television, and certainly the most ridiculous.
