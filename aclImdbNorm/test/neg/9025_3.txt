even die hard john wayne fans will have to concede that this film is a mess. wayne's character, john tobin is after the gang that killed his parents, led by half apache, half white renegade pandro zanti (earl dwire), posing as a mexican. <br /><br />there are almost too many silly plot points to count, but those that stand out include sheriff williams (jack rockwell) cuffing a captured zanti around his boot, so all zanti has to do to get free is remove his boot! tobin's friend dusty (george pre-gabby hayes) takes a thrown knife in the back, and comes back good as new for the rest of the story. in a chase scene, tobin rides a makeshift log flume through a drainage trough surrounded by log walls in the middle of a desert, and missing his mark, chases (actually walks after) zanti on foot through the desert. zanti seeks relief and drinks from a pool of water, but oops!, he didn't see the sign above the waterhole that states "don't drink poison". as zanti collapses dead, tobin resumes his chase after the remainder of the gang, and captures the whole lot by blowing up a rock wall that seals a secret passage into dusty's cabin - how convenient.<br /><br />in the closing scene, the new sheriff tobin is seen on the phone talking to the new mrs. tobin (sheila terry), dusty's daughter ruby, who earlier in the film was a kidnap target of zanti's gang. apparently, the studio was intent on wayne's getting the girl in virtually every film they made with him, as this type of ending is completely predictable for almost all of lone star's films.
