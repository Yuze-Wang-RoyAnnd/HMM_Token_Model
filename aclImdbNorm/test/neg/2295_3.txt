this swedish splatter movie tries to parody/imitate american horror films such as "the evil dead", "gremlins" and others. writer/director/actor/cinematographer anders jacobsson and writer/producer/actor/makeup effects supervisor g"oran lundstr"om (did i miss something?) were obviously inspired by sam raimi. but the camera work is a bad copy of what can be seen in "the evil dead" and elsewhere. some other users have written that they enjoyed the humor of this film but i didn't.<br /><br />the film rather disturbed than entertained me. it tries to combine suspense and comedy and the final product just left me with a feeling of oppressiveness although it wasn't scary or shocking at all. the combination of different genre elements made this film very strange. i was never sure if it was meant to be scary or funny.<br /><br />the story is quite inventive except for the showdown at the hospital but i didn't like the way it was staged for the reasons mentioned above. the gore & make up effects are considerably good and at least the "loose limbs" sequences were quite entertaining because in these scenes the film-makers didn't try to mix scares and jokes.<br /><br />all in all a strange film that you will either hate or love. rest in pieces, evil ed.<br /><br />my rating: 3/10 (made me stick to american productions)
