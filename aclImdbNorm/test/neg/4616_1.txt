i'd never walked out of a movie before this one. i'd entertained the idea a couple of times, but this time i did it, snuck in to see the end of another movie, but had to come back and see the end of the rage while i waited for my friends. they told me i didn't miss much while i was gone, either. i was generally offended by the entire movie, in such a grand way that i can't even describe it. my gut instinct told me to get myself out of the theatre. it was a visceral reaction to a horrible movie. the plot centered around the cruel actions of some reprehensible teenagers against vulnerable and troubled others. there was no ray of light, no resonsible or likeable person to provide contrast. i found that even the "good guys" of the movie did nothing for me, were silly, stupid, whiney, or just plain ineffectual.<br /><br />the repetitious, graphic suicide imagery was way overdone, unnecessary, and disgusting. (not in a "i'm easily grossed out" way, but more in the portrayal of disregard for humanity way). and besides the repetition of that scene, in slow motion, from so many angles, the other visual aspects, (interesting camera work, etc) had potential, but just became annoying sometimes. i am a person who loves movies and tries to find good things about them. usually i can find some good things to counterbalance the not-so-good of any movie. i'm not saying that this movie had nothing good, but i am saying that, whatever that may have been, i can't remember it with all the other crap that drove me mad. i'm really sorry about that, too. maybe the best parts were the clips from the classic original.
