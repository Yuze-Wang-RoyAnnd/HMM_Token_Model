obviously raw feed video is smarter than all of us who wasted our money renting this flick! they will make millions from video rentals and their low budget investment is going to pay off big, which will finance "rest stop ii" (unfortunately). i figure they spent a maximum of a few hundred thousand dollars american to hire the actors, rent the rest stop locale and burn a truck and drag a motorcycle along behind the truck for a bit plus pay for the technical stuff. that's it. we should all be as smart as these guys, i won't knock them for having the genius to promote a stinker into good monetary returns. premise of the movie was good, and it could have been a really adequate horror movie, but it failed by not delivering a clear story line. i am always looking for a gem from the upstart film companies, but i didn't find it here and neither will you. i'm only sorry i wasted $3.99 plus tax to find out.
