this movie is a shame especially considering andrzej wajda is not an amateur, but professional director. however this movie fails to deliver anything you could expect.<br /><br />first of all -- i am polish, so i can tell all the background story, because i read books. but how can you tell there is even a war from this movie -- bunch of people are going back and forth, some soldiers are shouting... this is really the second world war or soldiers are on vacations?<br /><br />acting and dialogs -- poor, miserably poor. a.zmijewski, d.stenka, m.komorowska, w.kowalski, a.chyra fit in their roles, the rest of (polish) cast is out of the place (most notably m.ostaszewska, one of the leading characters, what an unfortunate choice). 99% of the dialogs are not spoken, they are just put there, actors had difficulties to perform and it is no surprise considering what odd things they had to say.<br /><br />and this leads us to the most disappointing issue -- you can't feel it. everything is so theatrical, artificial. there is no real life, there is no feeling in it. there are a lot of original footage from the wwii and, guess what, the material is much more powerful, dramatic, than what a.wajda did.<br /><br />i can see only one positive -- despite historical mistakes (like acronym zsrr; it was made for post-1945 propaganda purposes, to please polish that zsrs was gone, and now there was zsrr, but in 1940 there was no zsrr!), luckily it is undoubtedly shown killing in katyn was done by soviets (yes, it is a fact, not some controversial gossip). great, two hours for 5-10 minutes scene.<br /><br />anyway -- time and potential wasted. this is tragedy of epic proportions, will to fight in 1939 (barely shown), not declaring war against soviet union by polish authorities (sic! not shown here), imprisonment of soldiers shortly after, living in the outrageous conditions (not shown here), hope and fear what will come next (barely shown) , and then... extermination. hand to hand with germans -- soviets were exterminating polish nation, aimed at people who constituted the backbone of poland. unfortunately they succeed, and the results are still visible to this very day.
