i have seen three other movies that are worse than this one, "plan 9 from outerspace", "side hackers" and the dreaded "blair witch project" there are so many technical errors in this movie that regardless of a decent plot the movie just isn't believable.<br /><br />let's start with an amtrak train with no skirts or handrails between cars. the killer walks up behind his victim as she moves from car to car and just pushes her off the train.<br /><br />in one scene a killer sneaks into a woman's apartment. he wants to sneak up on the woman to kill her, so what does he do? he turns up her stereo! if i heard my stereo suddenly get louder i'd be concerned. he kills the women by throwing an electric hair curler into the tub. i was amazed to see that an electric hair curler with a five foot cord could be tossed ten feet and remain plugged in. plus the apartment looked modern enough to have ground fault outlets in the bathroom and the victim was still electrocuted.<br /><br />the boeing 747 is one of the most well known commercial airliners on the planet so this part really amazed me. first the cockpit was not even close to a real 747 and second it wasn't on the top deck of the plane. i watched in utter amazement as the pilot and co-pilot (where was the flight engineer?) walked right past the spiral staircase and headed forward toward's the nose of the airplane.<br /><br />i was also amazed that bullets wouldn't penetrate an aluminum serving cart (good thing for our hero), or bathroom doors, but would penetrate the ceiling causing a fuel leak that exited through a small hole in the fuselage. huh? watching three guys lengthen a runway by 100 yards in less than a week was pretty amazing as well.<br /><br />i didn't check, was this a movie of the week or something? it was terrible.
