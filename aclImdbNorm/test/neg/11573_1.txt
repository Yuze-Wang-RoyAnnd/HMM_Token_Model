within the first 5 minutes of this movie i knew i was in for one of those "pick at the faults" kinda movie. the acting was terrible, the script was even worse. who ever let these people write write such crap for a movie need to be feed the komodo's themselves. with russian mig jets posing as u.s. air force jets, and pistols that can miraculously shoot 50 - 60 rounds rapid fire without reloading is poor detail to any story. in one scene komodo are killing special forces troops at night, while in another they are explaining how the komodos and cobras are cold blooded and don't come out night!!!! also with fantastic special effects available in today's movie industry, they were only average even for this low budget movie.<br /><br />all that being said, i did watch it to the end curious as to what other wonders bad film making could produce. shame shame shame, for producing such rot!!!<br /><br />this movie should have been left on the cutting room floor!!!
