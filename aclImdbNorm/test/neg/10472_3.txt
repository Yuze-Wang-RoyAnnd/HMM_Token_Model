in sweet water, the ambitious entrepreneur dick krantz (jim storm) is constructing a resort in the middle of the desert under the protest of the katonahs. when three workers find some indian relics and bones in a ditch in the site, they accidentally release the giant skeleton like creature known as bone eater and their bones are devoured by the monster. the half-breed sheriff steve evans (bruce boxleitner) a.k.a. running wolf is in charge of the investigation of the disappearance of the workers, being pressed by krantz to arrest the protesters. but the bone eater attacks and kills other locals, while chief storm cloud (michael horse) seeks an ancient tomahawk capable of destroying the evil creature.<br /><br />"bone eater" is a lame and silly movie, with one of the most ridiculous screenplay i have ever seen. the characters and situation are not well-developed and things happen without any further consequences. the conclusion is probably the worse part in this flick, with the typical white north american bruce boxleitner dressed like an indian (in the story, his grandfather was an indian), cutting his own wrist (why? and where is the blood later?) and clumsily throwing the axe in the chest of the bone eater, destroying the monster and my last hope of any improvement in the story. my last question: if the bone eater eats bones, what happens to the flesh and clothes of his victims? my vote is three.<br /><br />title (brazil): "o devorador de ossos" ("the bone eater")
