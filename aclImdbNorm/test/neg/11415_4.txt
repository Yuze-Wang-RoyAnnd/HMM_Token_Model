the key scene in rodrigo garcia's "nine lives" comes when sissy spacek, hidden away in a hotel room where she is carrying on an affair with aiden quinn, find a nature documentary on television, at which point quinn notes the contrivance of such things--disparate footage is edited into one scene, predators and preys are thrown together in order to capture the moment--all to force connections where none actually exist. characters in the nine shorts that make up this film occasionally spill over into each others stories, but none of them ever seem to really connect. a woman preparing for a violent confrontation with her abusive father is later seen working in a hospital room where another woman is preparing for a mastectomy. a man who runs into an old girlfriend in a supermarket and sees how his life should have been later hosts, with his current wife, a dinner party for an unhappy couple. garcia arranges some of his characters in front of each other, but none of the subsequent stories ever really build on what came before.<br /><br />garcia's first film, the wonderful, overlooked "things you can tell just by looking at her," also had a short-story structure and overlapping characters, but there were fewer of them and they had a lot more room to breathe and grow. the gimmicky premise of "nine lives," that each of its nine stories is told in a single, unbroken take in real time, never allows the film to build up any real dramatic tension or momentum. it's also a fairly visually ugly movie. interior shots are often murky and hard to watch, while other scenes--particularly one where a girl walks back and forth between rooms to talk to her uncommunicative parents--are rendered annoying by the camera-work. given that this is garcia's third film and that he has a respectable history of directing for television, the direction in this film is rather surprisingly amateurish. like fellow filmmaker-child-of-a-great-writer rebecca miller, garcia (son of gabriel garcia marquez) is focused on the writing and character aspects of his films often to the detriment of the film-making ones.<br /><br />individual scenes are touching and even affecting. i did like jason issacs kissing robin wright penn's pregnant belly. and joe mantegna whispering lovingly to his wife as she slips into pre-surgery sedation. and sissy spacek stealing a few happy moments away from her life with aiden quinn before brought back to it with a phone call from her daughter. but the film (unlike "things you can tell just by looking at her") feels more like an exercise than actual drama. we are just watching people act.
