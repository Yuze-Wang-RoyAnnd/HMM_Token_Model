unlike most reviewers here, i hated this movie, simply because the writer/director's bloated ego was in the way of an otherwise potentially interesting topic. too many film fans equate 'extreme self-indulgence' to 'film genius!', but i don't buy into that cult of personality. a film should be about its subject, not its director (unless it's a woody allen film, of course). *spoiler* (which is just as well, save your time...) there is nothing brilliant about of showing you the foot-long porn-star's you-know-what in the last frame- that's actually called a tacky maneuver that screams film-school hackism. <br /><br />the poseur flick has achieved 'great film' status based on its indulgence and pandering to the audience
