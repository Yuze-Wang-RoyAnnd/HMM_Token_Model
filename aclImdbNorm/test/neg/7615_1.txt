i am and have been a serious collector of christmas related movies, tv shows, holidays specials, etc., for over twenty-five years. please heed my warning and do not be mislead by sterling reviews & media hype about this movie. this is not a muppett movie as we have come to know them, and is certainly not for children. the fact that this was produced for a major tv network is/was no surprise considering their level of operation at this time. what is hard for me to believe, is that the jim henson organization stooped so low to become involved in this travesty of christmas.i wish there had been reviews for me to read that would warned me before i wasted my hard earned money on this piece of trash.
