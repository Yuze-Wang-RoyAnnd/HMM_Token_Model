having been born and raised in odessa, and having graduated from the "other" high school in the late 70's, odessa high school, i had mixed emotions about this movie. i no longer live in odessa, but will always be a texan at heart. i didn't like the way that this town of 80,000 plus was portrayed as a dirt poor small town. if i'm wrong about this, please feel free to correct me, but i believe ohs also plays in the town stadium, and the "home of the permian panthers" sign that was shown at the stadium used to be at the practice field at permian. i would have liked to have seen a little acknowledgment about the cross town rivalry of the big game in town every year, ohs vs permian. i am curious why the outcome of the game was altered though, i think it would have been just as dramatic if the real outcome was portrayed. overall, the movie was okay, made me a little homesick, remembering the "good old days" of mojo.
