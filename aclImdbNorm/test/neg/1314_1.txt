you would have thought, given how much this overblown pile of rubbish must have cost, that the budget could have stretched to a decent scriptwriter. instead, they seemed to have opted for a bog standard hollywood 'paint by numbers' disaster movie plot and dialog. the only clich'e they seem to have missed was the cute kid. but every other one is there. there's the sullen hero, flung together by fate with both his ex wife and estranged father. there's the doting dad and the rebellious teenager.there's the 'professor that everyone thought was wrong until it turned out he wasn't'(played appallingly by the normally excellent tom courtney seemingly in the grip of some powerful drugs), plus the comic duo wandering about in the deserted underground railway.<br /><br />i sat down to watch this full of anticipation. the cast is, as noted, amazing. yet within minutes it became clear how bad this was going to be. stuff this useless should come with a warning. something along the lines of;<br /><br />'this film may have been made in britain but was aimed at the american market. it therefore contains tired clich'es, stock characters, stilted dialogue and a plot so lame brained and simplistic that even george w bush could understand it.'<br /><br />avoid.
