i was pretty enthusiastic about seeing this movie when it came out. commercials for it made it look quirky and i generally like morgan freeman and chris rock, and the combination of the two seemed like an interesting idea. sadly, i was terribly disappointed with nurse betty.<br /><br />personally, i've usually found that graphic violence and comedy don't go all that well together, and the only directors that have ever combined the two successfully, in my opinion, are tarantino and the coens. there isn't that much violence in nurse betty, but what violence is in it made me feel kind of weird when i was supposed to laugh. of course, for me, part of the problem was also that there didn't seem to be many places where i was being asked to.<br /><br />the film doesn't much work as a drama, either. renee zellweger's betty, the story's protagonist, is clinically insane and impossible to relate to in any real way. i will say zellweger acts the role quite well, and freeman, rock, and greg kinnear all do good jobs too. the problem is in the writing; freeman is the only person that gets to play an interesting character. it's really too bad. 3/10
