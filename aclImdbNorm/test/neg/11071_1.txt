i consented to watching this movie with a group of friends despite my extreme dislike for horror movies. however, it was not the shock of a monster that turned me off this movie, it was the horrendous acting and absolutely disgusting ending. within, or the cavern, has no redeeming qualities- it is poorly made, laughably scripted, sickeningly bloody and the inclusion of the gratuitous final scene repulses me. no, it is not my dislike for horror movies that makes me hate this film-i've seen such wonderful teen horrors as "house of wax", its the fact that the film leaves you with the awful understanding that by renting the video, you are supporting the creators of within
