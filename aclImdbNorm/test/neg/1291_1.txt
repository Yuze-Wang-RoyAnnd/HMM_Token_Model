i registered at imdb solely for the purpose of warning others about this movie. hwo does anyone ever get funding for projects like this? that's the mystery. farewell to harry might be the worst movie ever, except that i tried to erase the others that rival this blathering idiocy. bad plot, not-credible logic runs throughout. i can't spoil this movie for you by revealing anything that would make your experience less enjoyable. there is nothing enjoyable about this movie. i have the cd and will send it to you for free, it is that bad. first come, only served. if i know you, this offer is void, because i wouldn't inflict this movie on anyone, not on purpose. you have been warned.
