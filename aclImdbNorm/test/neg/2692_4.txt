last week i watched a royal shakespeare company production of macbeth. it was 25 years old, filmed w/no props except swords, no furniture except chairs. it was riveting. the acting was super - all the actors trained brits. contrast that performance to this...yawn yawn yawn. al pacino, as shylock, was tragic, heavy, and couldn't quite lose the new yorker accent, despite the long....pauses....between.....lines.... the whole thing was soporific, even the "comic" scenes were barely even worth a smile, let a lone a belly laugh. this is supposed to be funny. they tried to make it tragic. it was neither, just boring. i give it four points for costumes, scenery, and jeremy irons, who is good at playing a dull, depressed, deep-voiced guy (can he be anything else???)
