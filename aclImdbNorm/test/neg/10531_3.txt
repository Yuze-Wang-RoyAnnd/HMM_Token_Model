steven segal has done some awful films, but this is probably one of the best since his career took a dive about ten years ago. the cast is better than usual, and while the story and the plot are a total joke, at least most of the action scenes look pretty good.<br /><br />the plot is probably one of the worst in film history. someone is being executed because he stole some money? some mercenary types kidnap a supreme court justice? their goal is to exchange the judge for the prisoner so they can find out where he has the money? meanwhile the execution chamber is full of trap doors and false floors and looks like a set from one of the cirque du soleil circus shows.<br /><br />then there is the issue of the prison. here, the warden is a homie, played by tony plana. the prisoners all have their gang colors and signs, and the guards are there to serve the meals and keep the prison clean. nothing like a bunch of prisoners fighting and beating up some guards while the warden is watching. what happens? the warden gives them a stern talking to. he might punish them next time.<br /><br />there are a lot of moments in this movie that are good for laughs. however, nia peeples looks pretty good, and ja rule tries to be an action hero. lots of fun watching the prisoners all "do the right thing" and get armed so that they can free the supreme court justice from her captors. regardless of how bad half past dead may be, when you watch it keep in mind that it is easily the best movie that steven segal has starred in since under siege in 1992.
