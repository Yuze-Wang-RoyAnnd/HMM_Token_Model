this film had some funny moments. louie, the main character was well cast along with some other decent supporting characters. the opening shot of the movie set the tone but the direction and story went downhill from there. aside from a twist at the end (interesting and funny also), i wish this film had better direction and a more developed story. without giving any of the plot away, the whole idea is better good! i just wish it was executed better in this short film. the potential was there but it just didn't deliver the goods.
