what starts out as a passable movie degenerates into one of the most incoherent, unscary, incompetently made, stupid attempted horror films of recent years.<br /><br />absolutely terrible. it's such a derivative mess ripping off every decent fright flick you can think of without successfully producing a single scare. whether it's copying the recent trend with creepy kids or ghosts walking past the camera or the old school horror of fulci's gates of hell.<br /><br />the worst thing is there's not even a cat jumping out of a cupboard to make you jump. to be avoided.
