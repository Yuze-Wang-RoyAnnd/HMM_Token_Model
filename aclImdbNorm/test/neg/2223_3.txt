compared to director kevin connor's later arabian adventure, this is a masterpiece. however, that's not saying much. in fact, at the earth's core is a silly fantasy adventure in which peter cushing - who appears to be on something strong - and some other actor (whom i don't know) use a giant digging machine called the "iron mole" dig their way down to the earth's core - only to find that the inside of the earth is pink and populated by ape-like creatures who have enslaved the humans. there's also a giant bird that controls the apes by means of telepathy, and we get to see it blink its eyes in closeup throughout the film. most importantly, cushing and what's-his-name also encounter the lovely caroline munro in the subterranean caves. and here's what i've really got against this little flick: why oh why is it that whenever munro's in a movie, she only gets approx. 5 minutes of screen time? in the spy who loved me, maniac, dracula ad 1972, golden voyage of sinbad - always she's in the background! how can kevin connor possibly think that we'd rather listen to peter cushing's fake accent and look at some ridiculous ape-man whose voice sounds like a scratched cd than gaze at the beautiful munro? i don't get it. please, somebody direct a movie where this english brunette is on-screen all the time!
