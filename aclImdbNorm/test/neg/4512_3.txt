i saw and have the original 1959 black and white that stars shelley winters and millie perkins and no matter how many times i watch it, i can't help but not to cry.<br /><br />this version was (obviously) a set, like the 1959 was, but there were so many mistakes in layout. spiral staircase? items that did not exist in that time period existed in the film. doris roberts, sad to say cannot play drama, she a comedic actress and that will not change. james coco was a horrible mr. van daan and mr. dussel resembled a college professor of mine rather then the dentist he was supposed to play. in the original film, anne walked the "gauntlet" to go to peter's room, that seemed to take her more then a minute. in this crappy remake, it took her under 10 seconds. the first reviewer was correct... this remake is just that, a remake. what was the director thinking casting comedic actors in a drama role like that. i'm sorry but james coco cannot play drama. max.. schell was better in deep impact then this movie. the cranky mrs. frank was just that cranky, i couldn't stand her. referencing and comparing to the 1959 version, i like her better, she did a better job of being the overwhelming mother. out of 10 stars, i give this remake 3. don't waste your time, get the 1959 version and a box of kleenex.
