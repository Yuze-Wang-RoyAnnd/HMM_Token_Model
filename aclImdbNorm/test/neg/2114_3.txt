just after watching the first one and it is very dumb. i happened to watch an episode of bones first and then the eleventh hour. the 11th hour should be embarrassed.<br /><br />it is so weak. stewart introduces himself as a government scientist. no mention of what kind of scientist just general sciency stuff. in a program about cloning they bring a caretaker, who was paid to dispose unsuccessful embryos, to a church and made him kneel before the statue of jesus on the cross and ask forgiveness... and as well tell them where the bad guy is so as they can move the plot on. now thats science at work :(<br /><br />there is a dumb, not good dumb, bit where picard rages at a tv that advertises skin scream that makes you look younger, shouting "it's a lie", as his randy female assistant gets groped by the local hot bobbie next door.<br /><br />the end of the first episode is like a bad cartoon where the bad old lady, named after pinnochios daddy in order to move the clunky plot along, waves at picard from the street as she gets in a taxi. picard is one floor up and he looks out a window wistfully going... she got away. he could like try to run down.. or maybe ring the cops... or maybe get the number of the taxi and ring it in or maybe had anything other than... i am waving and getting into a taxi now and there is nothing you can do about it until next week ending... mahhahahahah.<br /><br />pity it's so stupid. at one point a grieving father is convinced by picard that even if a replica clone son was born it would never be his son as his son had a soul. yes that's right folks. the general scientist argues against cloning on the basis that every soul is unique and sure why else would you want to clone. <br /><br />although the general scientist picard finds cloning a bit gooey he's all up for stem cell research and goes as far as to say that calamity will befall humanity if it isn't allowed. he has a pretty strident rant about how important it is. of course he doesn't mention a single example. that kind of sums up the show. buzz words and tawdriness.
