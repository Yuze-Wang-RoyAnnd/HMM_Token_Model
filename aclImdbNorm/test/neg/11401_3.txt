this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a while. the acting was just soooo bad. anthonie kamerling is usually a fairly good actor, but in this film, he sounded like he was reading his text from a piece of paper. especially his voice over was extremely wooden. beau van erven dorens was completely over the top as frat boy fraser, although this probably had more to do with the crappy dialogue. 'ik ook van jou' is an adaptation of a book, and it seem like the makers of the film forgot that film dialogue follows different rules than literary dialogue. it all sounded way to bookish.<br /><br />some of the situations were very badly visualized. example: somewhere at the beginning of the film there is a scene where a canoe goes over in a rapid. this bit is just too incredible to be true. you see an obviously rather shallow bit of river, with a lot of rocks right beneath the surface (hence the rapid). we hear some suspenseful music to warn us that there's danger ahead. a canoe with to girls goes over in that rather shallow rapid. our hero then dives several meters below the surface to rescue one of the girl. girl swoons in his arms and utters the words 'you saved me...' vomit!<br /><br />it actually was so bad, that it became funny. this is sad, because it really wasn't intended. at the intermission i overheard some guy behind me say 'o god, there's another part!' my feelings exactly. what scares me is that the end credits of 'ik ook van jou' were in english. does this mean that it will be released abroad? just when the netherlands were starting to get a good reputation after films like 'antonia' (antonia's line) and 'karakter' (character)...
