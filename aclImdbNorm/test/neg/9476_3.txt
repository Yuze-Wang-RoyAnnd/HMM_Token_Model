now, i watched this when i was hungover one sunday and my auntie and uncle were visiting one day with my 2 cousins (one was 11, the other 9). we stuck on the tv and passport to paris had just started. my cousins both had said that they watch two of a kind sometimes and i said they could watch the film if they liked. since i was in no fit state to get up, i just stayed in the living room with them and ended up watching the film! i have to say, as a person who has no interest in those kinds of tv shows or films, i actually enjoyed it... it must have been the alcohol lol but i do admit, it would probably only appeal more to girls aged between 6 and 13, but it was a movie to pass the time. there's always a movie or a show that you don't think you'll like, but for a laugh, you enjoyed it.
