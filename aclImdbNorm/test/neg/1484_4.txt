perhaps it's about time we declare 2007 to be "the international year of the cinematic crocodile"! the ridiculous "primeval" came first, about a croc named gustave (!) ruling the swamps in burundi. then there was "lake placid 2", a low-profiled and made-for-tv sequel to a forgettable original. thirdly, there's this incredibly derivative and soporific piece of aussie horror and, finally, i have yet to see the promising "rogue". the last one is likely to be the best, considering the involvement of the upcoming aussie horror talent greg mclean ("wolf creek"). "black water" certainly isn't a complete waste of time and film, but it's another pretty pointless survival flick that confuses real-life agony with horror. pardon my bluntness, especially since i honestly feel sorry for the people who went through this ordeal, but depicting three characters sitting in a tree and whining for more than a full hour is not my idea of sheer suspense! three young people travel through northern australia and decide to spend a day of fishing in the remote swamp areas. it doesn't take too long before a gigantic and ferocious crocodile capsizes their little boat and devours the guide. grace, lee and adam barely manage to escape the reptile's hungry teeth by climbing up a tree. even though he remains unseen most of the time, the croc patiently lies in waiting and makes it impossible for them to leave the swamp alive. yes, it does sound an awful lot like the plot of "open water" indeed. replace the numerous unseen sharks with one giant unseen crocodile and the open sea with an equally inescapable aussie swamp, and there you have it. oh well, "black water" at least features some rare moments of excitement and one impressively designed water monster. it has to be said, the croc looks fabulously groovy and you anxiously count down towards every next time he wildly emerges from the water. the three-headed cast does whatever they can to keep their characters interesting, but how do you achieve this by sitting in a tree the whole time? the based-on-true-events concept obviously causes a number of restrictions, like limited images of the fantastic filming locations, dialogs and amiable character drawings.
