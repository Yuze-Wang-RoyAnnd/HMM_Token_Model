there is an inherent problem with commenting or reviewing a film such as this. i remember feeling the same way after disliking dogma. if you do not like a film that is odd and controversial like mulholland dr., you are seen as "not getting it." of course for those who have already seen this film you know that the entire point is not getting it anyway.<br /><br />i have heard from several different sources that the unique and likable aspect of this film is a dream-like quality it has. in other words, the plot isn't structured like other films. with the case of mulholland dr., it seems more like an unfocused collage made by a third grade boy who procrastinated until the last second to do his art project. it doesn't make sense, it isn't supposed to, but i know it was to be a tv series at first. it appears lynch had a stack of unused film and decided to mash it in with a bunch of new stuff. you will notice that toward the end the nudity, sex and foul language increase. all things he would not have filmed for television.<br /><br />for a better film not told in a traditional, linear fashion, rent the thin red line from 1998. that was a great film, this is not.<br /><br />rating: 2 out of ten
