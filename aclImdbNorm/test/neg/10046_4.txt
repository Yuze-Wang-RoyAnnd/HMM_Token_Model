this is one of those strange, self-important, self-indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound. it isn't. instead, it spouts cliches that try to pass for profundity. typical is the scene where peter (kelsey grammer) explains to protagonist and best friend adam (dwier brown) how man starts life breast feeding, then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend, and finally his wife, thus concluding ultimately that life sucks. so deep. we are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life, the universe, etc. during adam's travels through the mojave desert on foot. (he abruptly leaves l.a. the day of his wedding and his family, friends, and fiance assume he's dead when his car was found in a military test range smashed by a rocket.) some characters are more entertaining than others. the best by far is an escapee from a mental hospital who only speaks through the voices of others. the actor, james kevin ward, does some great impressions, including nicholson, popeye, and several characters from the original star trek. but once the interesting characters leave the screen, we're stuck with adam again and his pursuit of the profound. it's a long trip, which drags in many places. in fact, it's the longest hour and a half movie i've ever seen. and the finale hardly makes it seem worth while, at all.<br /><br />i discovered this movie playing on hbo one day by waking up too early and clicking on the tv. that'll learn me. next time i'll try harder to sleep in.
