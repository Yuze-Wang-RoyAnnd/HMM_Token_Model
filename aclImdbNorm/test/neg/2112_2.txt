how on earth can you have such fantastic actors in such a miserable creation? this is one of the most stylized pieces of rubbish i have seen in a long time. not only is it poorly written, it is a product of shoddy direction and editing. the cinematography is so horribly manipulative and unoriginal and the montage jumbled beyond belief. the actual ideas behind the plots (cloning, toxic waste, climate change) are all fine to begin with but where the production/direction team takes them is a big cesspool of filth, the likes of which are seen in one episode. and this is a scientific series? i am a physician and all i can say is that the science in this film is utter crap, almost embarrassing to watch. i really felt bad for the actors involved since they were all extraordinary.
