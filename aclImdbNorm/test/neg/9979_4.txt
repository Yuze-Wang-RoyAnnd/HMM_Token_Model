"caligula" shares many of the same attributes as the 1970 "fellini satyricon" with bizarre sights, freakishness, and depictions of sexual excesses all set in the "glory" of ancient rome. but fellini it ain't... first of all it is not as entertaining. far too much screen time is devoted to bug-eyed, rubber-faced mcdowell in the titular role. his performance is far too fey and campy to be convincing. the portrayals by jay robinson in "the robe" (1953) and david cain-haughton in "emperor caligula" (1983) are far more persuasive and believable, with the latter being the most nuanced. relief could have been judiciously provided by developing the surrounding characters more fully. as it is, they are little more than cyphers. one example is the role of macro, played by guido mannari who has tremendous screen presence in an important role, but is mostly left in the background. the only positive features to credit are the adroit use of some prokofiev and stravinsky themes in the music score and the inclusion of some of the distasteful but nevertheless accurate actions of the despot. these two factors are far less than what is needed to relieve the prevailing tedium, however.
