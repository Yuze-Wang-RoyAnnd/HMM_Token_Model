the only way i can feel good about having handed over these precious minutes of my life is everyday telling someone how awful it was. and even if i say it once a day, every day for the rest of my life i will not fully get my point across. just dumb.<br /><br />there's a difference in movies like this and movies like elephant or fat guy goes nutzoid, two of my other least favorite movies. the latter two were terrible, yes, but that was that. evan almighty takes a strong cast and attempts to kill them all. wanda sykes, jonah hill, john goodman and steve carrell...why god why!? all these people have much better talent, now every time i see any of them i will think of this terrible movie.<br /><br />the only reason i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 was when i saw the movie, there was a mentally challenged elderly woman who thought the barrage of bird poop and getting-hurt-by-tools-while-building jokes were so funny that she didn't stop laughing the entire time, nearly stroking out at several times.
