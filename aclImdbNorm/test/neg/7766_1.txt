the very first time i saw this i recoiled in horror at what was being presented as modern, liberated women.<br /><br />sorry, but i cannot relate to whining idiots whose lives revolve around loveless sex and the acquisition of gucci, prada and louis vuitton labels. the troubling thing is that some may actually think this is how career women live in nyc. it's definitely not. these women are incredibly shallow and materialistic and as another reviewer said, they act like gold-digging hooches.<br /><br />this is not liberated womanhood and i'm glad it's gone. 0 stars and just plain awful
