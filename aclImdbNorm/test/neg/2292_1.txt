this flick is terrible! it sets out to disgust and make you laugh, but it fails horribly. the director obviously has no sense of slap stick gore comedy, and the actors are like nothing i've ever seen - lacking both acting talent and flair of comedy. even their attempt at the english languish is really sad, and actually the down right peculiar swedish accent, in which the incoherent dialog is spoken, is probably the most comical and enjoyable thing about this film. even the gore i awful and unconvincing. if you crave gore comedy, i'd suggest you turn to classic fare such as the evil dead series or even brain dead if you must. we all enjoy a bloody good laugh, but this is ridiculous!
