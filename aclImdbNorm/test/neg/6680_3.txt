i got interested in this movie because somebody had made a beautiful video for bj"orks "bachelorette" with clips from it. so i watched the movie. and it is indeed stuningly beautiful. a masterpiece of animation.<br /><br />unfortunately, the story doesn't keep up. it starts out well, with interesting plotlines about people fencing for the possession of the rose bride, but suddenly elevators fill up with water and looses their walls, people float away, and finally for no reason whatsoever, utena is tranformed into a car, and a highspeed chase ensues.<br /><br />i like much anime for it's ability to make alternative universes, but this universe is just stupid. if you are gonna watch this movie, turn of the sound, it's better that way.
