this is probably the worst film i have ever seen; it makes plan 9 from outer space look wonderful. the acting is wooden, the plot silly and the sfx non-existent. the only good thing about it is the fact that it is not a long film. the scenery is sometimes quite pretty, assuming you like trees, if that helps any!
