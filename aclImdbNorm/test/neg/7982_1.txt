depressing black black comedy about a woman (mia farrow) who flees her house on christmas eve when she discovers her husband (tony goldwyn) has hired a hit man to kill her. she ends up with a husband and wife (scott glenn and mary-louise parker) and then things go wrong. basically farrow keeps running and is continuously meeting very strange people and getting into morbidly unfunny situations.<br /><br />this was advertised as a feel good movie when i saw it around christmas time at its very short run in an art cinema. i found it sick, unfunny and just depressing. i like black humor but this was way too dark for me. what happens to parker's character especially was horrifying. to make matters worse eileen brennan is thrown in as a nun (!!!) later on and proceeds to chew the scenery with gusto.<br /><br />the only saving grace was farrow's acting--it's much better than this picture deserves. also it was a relief to see the very talented stephen dorff pop up at the end. the ending itself was kind of nice but it couldn't erase what had gone on before.<br /><br />sick, morbid, pitch black "comedy". a 1
