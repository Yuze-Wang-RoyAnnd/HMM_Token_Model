barney is just awful. as many of the other reviews on this show say. i'm not one to disagree with them (i won't). because i hate this show just as much as they do. they use kids that look like they're in sixth grade, cheesy plots, horrid dialog and really crappy special effects. not to mention that big purple dinosaur himself. he makes every other kid show look like award winners (sesame street has won awards, that i know about).<br /><br />please, just watch sesame street, thomas the tank engine or even the teletubbies. avoid both, this and its movie (which i also reviewed). they are both extremely crappy and are inappropriate to anyone (even little babies).
