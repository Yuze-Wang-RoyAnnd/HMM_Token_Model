ouch!! what a mess we have here. not so much of a mess as a painfully dull, half-assed excuse for exploitation. brought to you by the one and only, j. g. "pat" patterson, yeah, the same one from moonshine mountain. doctor gore, formerly known as the body shop, is, i guess, somewhat inspired by frankenstein, and god knows what else. the late mr. patterson also stars in this joke, as a heartbroken scientist/plastic surgeon, who has recently lost his wife in a car accident, and is driven insane from grief, to the point that it becomes clear that the next step is to slaughter countless females, then maybe rob a few graves for body parts, in order to "put together" the perfect mate. it won't be easy, but thank goodness his pal gregg the hunchback is available to lend a hand, and to offer moral support.<br /><br />if proof was ever needed that some peoples goals are not meant to be accomplished, here it is, gang. this patterson hayseed obviously never had any business directing anything, much less, following in the footsteps of good ol' h. g. as a master of gore. i've never seen a gore movie that just flat-out refuses to give the viewer a single reason to keep watching. even the gore is boring. almost remotely humorous at times, but impossible to tell whether it's intentional or not. i pick "not".<br /><br />shot in charolotte, north carolina (home of the california axe massacre), on, most likely, a 3-digit budget, by a guy, as untalented as he may have been, who probably had an appreciation for drive-in trash, so, maybe we should give good ol' j. g. a break, i mean, he tried (i assume) which is more that can be said for most, and this movie is better than any of the big-budget super-hero garbage the theaters put out these days, although, i realize that isn't saying much. besides, doctor gore is quite the improvement over patterson's previous failure, the electic chair, so it's slightly possible he would have improved his craft in time, had he not died, so maybe it's not all that terrible, especially compared to the other movie on the dvd, how to make a doll, so what the hell, check it out. 4/10
