i see this movie as a poor tribute to the old slasher movies. because it really doesn't hold a candle to the 70's and 80's gold-era of horror, this is of course where personal taste comes in.<br /><br />this movie just falls into the category of "new generation of slashers" in my book, the cast is the typical ones 18-24 years and potential models. i'm personally quite tired of that image in horror movies, the old movies at least had some variation in people. one or more fat people, and dorks in general. just plain looking persons, of course having a couple of good lookers is fine they always been there. but when the entire cast is just a bunch of nice racks and butts it's getting silly. i mean, ok yeah i like to watch hot chicks. but not in a horror that is supposed to reflect some ordinary people getting hunted down by for example a knife-wielding maniac... you expect the people being hunted to look something like any random person you see on the street. i think. there are of course a few movies with just good lookers that is perfectly alright, but they aren't many. "wrong turn" is one example of the better ones.<br /><br />next point is the killing scenes that slashers should be all about. in this poor movie, all you get to see is 2-3 frames of sudden high pitched sound/scream and music in crescendo. and that's it. the little you do get to see isn't very graphical at all, not for people who have seen some horrors during the years. the old-school slashers compared to this had much more and better death, blood and gore. not to mention the killers in those movies, who surpassed the one you'll get to see here.<br /><br />as for true horror fans it is more fun and exciting to watch horrors with new approaches because of the originalities that pops up, the killer in this one doesn't add anything new and fresh to the genre in my opinion. i have to agree with what someone previously stated as well, the cgi is something i hate to watch. personally i preffere the makeups in that sense i'm conservative, (unless the cgi is really well done). but most importantly is to set a good setting of mood which allows you to "get into the movie", a good background story is one very good thing. also revealing and explaining too much of everything in a movie to the viewers takes away all sense of mystic that adds very much of the mood, and doesn't give you much to think about. just as an example: keeping the killers background a complete mystery for the viewer is a good move in many cases. i mean if everything about the story or the people in it has to be explained or shown in detail, then it's not much content left over for the viewer at all to ponder about... that's like watching a porno movie and hope for a great story in the meantime.<br /><br />why the old-school slashers still works, at least for some people. is because they are established cult movies from the era when they were a new thing, making new ones of that sort today is admittedly hard. the exception might be for people who are newer to that sort of horrors of course. i have noticed that many people does like this sort of horror movies, so there are of course not "a right taste" for horror movies.<br /><br />but for people out there that might share my opinion; here you have a frame of reference what to expect of this flick.
