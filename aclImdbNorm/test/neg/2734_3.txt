the script seems to have been wholesale (ahem ahem, cough cough) "borrowed" from a certain other movie involving using a self-propelled manned drilling machine. scene by scene, the two movies were almost identical. just enough of the serial numbers filed off in this one to prevent a copyright infringement lawsuit.<br /><br />but other than that, i have to say i found this somewhat entertaining as i enjoy deep-underground-in-the-earth genre of movies. it's a little bit on the stupid side as far as the science goes, but if one is willing to squint one's eyes real hard and pretend one didn't notice that scientific gaffe here and there and all over, this movie is almost bearable. far better than "supernova" which was another flick that luke perry had a leading role in that was so dumb, dumb, dumb that nothing could save it. a note to movie makers: employ someone who knows something about the subject the movie deals with. it would be a very small part of the movie budget, but it would have a big effect overall in helping prevent your audience from guffawing at you for doing dumb science.<br /><br />production values: almost passable. i've seen far worse in my time.<br /><br />a new thought for disaster movies: instead of them always having a happy ending where the world gets saved yet once again, how about some where things are a tad bit more realistic, where sometimes even the very best efforts still end up in failure. particularly when the problem that needs to be resolved was caused in the first place by sheer stupidity. stupidity-caused disaster movies with glowing, heartwarming endings sort of backhandedly justify stupidity by stating, "no matter how awful a problem is caused by braindead stupidity, it can be fixed." which is definitely not the case. a self-caused disaster movie with an unhappy ending would serve better as cautionary tale of "don't be so damn stupid in the first place." should you watch this movie? if you're bored and you've seen everything else in the scifi section at your local video rental store, sure, why not. but do avoid "supernova" as i can assure you that you're not that bored. that definitely was not one of luke perry's better movies. this one is better. that's not saying much, but it is better.<br /><br />one dead hoof up for being a deep-underground genre movie. one dead hoof down for naughtily ripping off from the screenplay of another certain movie of the same genre.
