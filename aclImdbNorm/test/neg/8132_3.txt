i really wanted to like this film but it barely eked out a 3. it's surprising that equal amounts of the votes were 10, the other half 1. all the characters were entertaining and even talented but as a whole the film didn't pay off. sebastian hernandez is appealing; charismatic and likable (he even physically resembles marc anthony in a more approachable yet ultimately conscious sort of way...) but even he couldn't save this mess of a movie. scenes dragged on far too long and points were ultimately beaten to death. the banana scene fringed on self-absorption, seemingly showing how much movement was in his boxers. but in his defense it was his first movie as director (that i'm aware of) and i appreciate his labor of love. it just left me empty despite what was trying to be said. ultimately i think the story would have been better handled by a more experienced director. from what i've seen of the 'extras', there is a real story behind this and, perhaps when i finish watching them, i'll appreciate this attempt more.
