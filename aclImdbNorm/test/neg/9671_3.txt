disney-like entertainment with some un-disney-like moments of graphic violence and sexual references. lousy comedy alongside clich'e-ridden moralizing. noah as abraham, lot as his wicked buddy. laughable special effects. overdone acting with bad timing. sodom and gommorah were destroyed before the flood? strange twists and too many sub-plots the bible doesn't mention. god as a doubting father who just needs to be entertained by whistling before deciding the world has to be saved from disaster.<br /><br />b-movie wannabee director john irvin adds another failure to his worthless list of poorly-directed movies that seriously lack plot and direction.
