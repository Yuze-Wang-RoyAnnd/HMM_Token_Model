i saw this at my local supermarket and i knew that debra was in it so i decided to buy it (out of support for that sexy woman!) the plot and acting in this movie was terrible (with the exception of debra wilson; and i'm not just saying that because i love her, she seriously was the only actor or actress who had any emotion in their acting and voice!) what i didn't get at the beginning is why the wife didn't just get back in her car instead of running at random like that. it was so stupid. and it's la (nobody saw her being abducted on a public, residential street--nobody...yeah, that's realistic!) also in the park, when charlie stole the woman's cell phone (for some stupid reason) they were hell bent on finding him (and at one point) when they did they had him at gunpoint--over a cell phone! in reality i doubt the lapd would go out of their way like that for a stupid cell phone! the lady could've walked up to one of many of those cell phone booths and have it replaced! the kids acting skills sucked too (i think they were reading from a cue card or had somebody off camera whisper their lines) because they'd be asked questions and would look around and then answer in a questionable voice (i.e.-"yes i do miss daddy?") also how could there be all of those snipers be in the trees and on building rooftops in la without being seen?! i see this being played at 3 am on usa.<br /><br />debra wilson fanatics will enjoy her parts. she's the only actor with any real acting skills (debra, sweetheart--stop doing these cheap d-grade, direct to video films...maybe that'll change with the upcoming film whitepaddy.) she puts some jokes in there (like when one of her superiors comes up and asks her who's she talking to, she screams at her computer and goes "damnit, charlie!") i gave it a 4/10...a 4 only because of debra's good acting skills.
