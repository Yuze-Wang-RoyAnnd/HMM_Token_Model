there's a thin line between being theatrical and being just plain forced. forced acting. forced takes. forced plot. even forced photography. there's people who say "the movie develops that way because it's from asia" but i don't see any kind of forced elements on seven samurai or sonatine. there's a thin line between being fiction (and every work of art it is, in it's way, fiction) and being just unlikely.in a more personal way, i just don't feel anything with the movie, it doesn't take me anywhere, and i just can't believe in the fictional world it is proposed. it just doesn't feel right, there's something in it or through that just doesn't click.
