i don't normally write reviews, but for this film i had to. i'm shocked at the acting talent in this move going to waste... the script was appalling... the editing awful... and the plot very thin. you spend the first half of the movie wondering who is talking to who and what on earth they are doing. the latter half of the movie slows down slightly, but has no depth or feeling. the only saving grace is the nice, but still limited cgi, and the location being london. i gave 3 stars for that, and the fact the actors still tried to do a good job with the drivel they were given. if you fancy losing a couple of hours of your life with mediocre popcorn disaster movie entertainment, by all means, this is the movie for you. but i would recommend doing something else with your time instead, like watching the real archive footage online! :) http://www.weatherpaparazzi.com/flooding.asp
