supposedly, a movie about a magazine sending journalists to investigate reports of ufos with one being more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole affair and the other an aussie, a hardened skeptic who laughs at the ufo nonsense. it's all a crock, some kind of money making racket.<br /><br />turns out this movie is actually a deceit, and a trap to actually promulgate christian teachings and the christian explanation of ufos, one i've heard before. this is an ad hoc explanation that is itself not at all biblical but invented by certain modern theologians who can fit anything and everything into their mythology. the paranormal? it's real, just demonic, unless it takes place in a christian context, then of course, it is of god. simple, if it isn't of god, it's the of the devil, stupid! so i suppose since beethoven's 9th symphony wasn't inspired by god, it must have been written under demonic influence. or so would the logic lead ad absurdum.<br /><br />we are informed that since the bible does not tell of life on other planets in the universe, therefore there is none (a version of the ad ignorantium fallacy) and that god created the universe so huge, so grand to show us his almighty power. i think of carl sagan's remark that if god created such a huge universe and stuck life only on earth it'd have been a tremendous waste of space.<br /><br />so what are ufos? they are demonic activity and concern the soon to be earthshaking christian event, the rupture...i mean rapture. before the tribulation, the true christians will disappear from the face of the earth en masse causing mass panic, confusion, car and plane crashes...whatever. therefore satan knowing this is sending his demons to basically create an illusion of alien spacecraft and alien abduction which can then be used to explain away this otherwise inexplicable event. all part of satan's plan which will of course keep people from looking to god or jesus and fall for the lies of the antichrist.<br /><br />this ad hoc explanation also typifies theological mishmash by explaining away one mystery with another, in opposition to the scientific method of explaining the unknown, the strange, and the mysterious in as much as possible, first by the known, if not solely by the known.<br /><br />it's like jumping straight to an alien abduction whenever a child is missing and unaccounted for. i think i'd look first at more mundane explanations like the child has run away, gotten lost, or been kidnapped for ransom or abducted by a predatory pedophile before invoking aliens, or the supernatural or satan or some such.<br /><br />this kind of deceit or trap on the part of fundamentalists is nothing new, as young people are often lured to free rock concerts, that may start out with something innocuous then suddenly switch to overt christian music, followed by a sermon and an altar call. this kind of blatant deception one might think would be more satan's ballgame. but maybe because the christian faith is soon to be in its death throes, these guys feel that anything goes, any deception or trickery or scare tactics are acceptable to try to keep the faith alive, which is facing serious opposition from both secularists as well as competing faiths like islam, the world's fastest growing religion which may well replace christianity, as islam is far more cohesive and unified, and logically more tenable than christian fundamentalism. although this should offer little advantage to mankind, as it would be replacing one intolerant thought system with another.<br /><br />and of course the movie ends more or less with a variant of pascal's wager. the atheistic aussie who is skeptical about just about everything is told. well, if you are right about there being no afterlife and death is nothing but rotting in the grave, no worry...but what if you're wrong?<br /><br />basically, statements implying that reality is going to conform to nothing but an atheistic viewpoint or christian fantasy, is a false dilemma or black and white fallacy. even if the atheists are wrong would not necessarily make christianity correct by default, nor if christianity turns out to be full of holes in its theology, that the materialistic atheists are therefore correct by default.<br /><br />for all we know, native american spirituality might turn out to be the best description of ultimate reality and we might all of use have wished we treated the earth and its creatures a wee bit better.<br /><br />this movie should be stamped right on the box: caution: contains religious propaganda and not meant for informative or entertainment purposes.
