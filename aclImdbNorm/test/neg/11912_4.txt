the shanghai cobra starts out like gangbusters, with a rain soaked diner scene straight out of shack out on 101 or gun crazy (the first one). unfortunately the film then proceeds to plod its weary way through a standard chan formula that is only barely enlivened by the always wonderful mantan moreland. it's as if director karlson blew half his budget in the first five minutes, just getting the set up the way he wanted it. watch the beginning and think about the phenix city story.
