zeoy101?? really, this has to be one of the most stupidest attempts to get people in my age group's attention. it's about some preppy girl named zeoy and her friends that attends boarding school. boring!!! all she ever does is whine and complain and acts like a spoiled idiot. i remember this show came out in 2005, i was 13 going on 14, and even then i thought it was pointless. the only episode i ever liked was when the boys hid a camera in the girls dorm. that's it. anyway, i just don't understand why nickel-oh my bad-nick feels the need to syndicate this sorry poor excuse for "entertainment". serious this decade is becoming a joke every year and it gets worst and worst. what's with this generation??<br /><br />anyway, r.i.p. nickelodeon 1979-1998?/2005?
