the most enjoyable parts of this film were the clips from the original movie. the acting was poor and the premise of sexual scorecards was revolting. the effects were marginal at best. there were no stand out performances, amy irving was put in this film to try and get a part of the halloween h20 audience. the original was much more enjoyable and gratifying. i am sorry to say that this is not going to be one of the years 10 best...so far it is at the bottom of my list. don't bother with this one folks!!
