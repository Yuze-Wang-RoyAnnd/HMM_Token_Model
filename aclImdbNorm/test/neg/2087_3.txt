just desserts was, i must say, one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the acting was terrible and even the plot line was laughable. i gave it a 3 out of 10 instead of a 1 because i enjoy laughing at excruciatingly corny movies. my expectations weren't high to begin with, but it turned out to be cornier than i expected. i thought it might not be all that bad when it started, but as soon as the name of the competition--the golden whisk--came up i began changing my mind. it all went downhill from there. the only thing i did like about this movie, other than snickering at it's absurd plot and dialogue, was watching them cook. however, being a movie about pastry chefs, there were minimal scenes in which they actually baked anything. i would recommend watching the cooking channel instead of this movie. you get to see more food being prepared, and you dodge the pathetic one-liners. however, if you enjoy corny love stories, which is sometimes fun, go ahead and watch.
