like many others, i counted on the appearance of dennis hopper to make this not a complete waste of time. i was sadly mistaken. everything negative said about this flic is more than true. what takes the cake however, is the horrible, horrible storyline for the main character.<br /><br />here's why: the planet might be destroyed, the only way to recover from it, for the entire human race to be saved trough it, is to get as many smart, capable, nice, competent people into an underground hide-out. and dennis hopper is the lone seer/scientist with vision who was prepared for the worst, and who has realized this. but what's the main motivation of stevens (sonny d'angelo)?? he's angry because dennis has decided who is to be saved or to be doomed! while it clearly explained to stevens that dennis' character has done everything to warn people of the danger but that he was laughed at. the hopper-character was the boy with the finger in the dike, and now stevens is blaming him for 'picking and choosing'??? and if that isn't enough, he wants to stop everybody from entering this hideout, because "it isn't fair!?" and.... he's responsible for the death of the one guy who is humanity's saviour! oh my god, how stupid can you get?<br /><br />what's also maddening that imdb forces one to write minimal ten lines about this piece of crap. i mean, two million in budget, what could have been done with that? think clerks, blair witch, and lotsa other movies who have been made for under 100.000 dollars and were still better. aaaaargh! i count myself lucky that i didn't pay one penny to see this crap, and to sit through the end of this utter, 'uber-crap, is one the most heroic things i've done this year. it's no wonder that the writers of this pile of dung had jobs as camera operator and title designer before ...
