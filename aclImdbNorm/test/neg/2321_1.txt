absolutely inane film starring abbott and costello. even our young children would become increasingly annoyed with this complete mess of a film.<br /><br />abbott as dinklepuss. what a look he had on his face. sure, he had to be part of this dreadful film.<br /><br />did anyone notice that costello's mother in the film sounded and looked like fay bainter? luckily, for ms. bainter, that she wasn't in the film.<br /><br />there is really no excitement hear for children. the jokes, if any, are quite stale. some of the singing is nicely done but the lyrics are ridiculous.
