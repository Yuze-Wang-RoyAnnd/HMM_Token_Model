spoof films have come so far since mel brooks in 'the producers' (1968) said "don't be stupid, be a smartie. come and join the nazi party". it brought us delightful films, such as 'young frankenstein', 'airplane!', and even 'naked gun'. but the good die young. luckily, the genre managed to make it all the way up to the end of the 90's. and then... the wayan's brothers unleashed the apocalypse: 'scary movie'. suddenly the word spoof was an innuendo for crude sex jokes. most movies claiming to be spoofs since then have followed suit, including 'scary movie 2', 'date movie' and the film to kill the genre 'epic movie'. sure, there have been some reliefs. there was 'shaun of the dead' and 'hot fuzz'. will ferell has become a vehicle spoofing close to every sport imaginable. also, the wayans brothers quit the 'scary movies' and they have been made by the dependable zucker brothers. while these films have held some value in the rescue, the genre is tragically doomed to be films only loved by prepubescent males who just discovered what an erection is. people who haven't explored the term 'spoof' and cut and paste movies together for a quick laugh. no heart, no brain, just cheap glue. sadly, 'the comebacks' has been added to the list. dave koechner (who starred in 'anchorman' alongside ferrell) leads a teams of underdogs to win against a coach (carl weathers of 'happy gilmore' fame) who got him back into coaching. koechner has shown promise as a supporting actor, but as a lead in this film, he just sounds scripted. he sounds too much like he's doing a cold read passionately. also, the jokes about being a washed up coach, who through the course of the movie encourages the team to fail in school and later runs from the police in his underwear, have been done before. yes, this is a spoof film. but let us remember that even spoofs can have quality. give the characters dignity and a sort of sophisticated view on modern society. also, the reliance on stereotypes is not going to get us any more laughs (who knew one movie with jive-talking people could lead to gangster stereotypes (not really, but you see)). while i will admit to laugh at least a few times... it wasn't on par. the football team within itself had a lot of stereotypes, including a mexican, a cocky jock, a fat guy, the scrawny nerd, and the mentally handicapped aid. even the only female on the team got reduced to stereotypical female humor, being mostly scantily clad and giving off innuendos. in fact, her character, as well as most of the others, never developed. it's a sad state of affairs for this movie. if only it wasn't so reliant on stupid sex jokes, it could've made something for itself. in fact, this movie will probably be the butt of jokes alongside 'epic movie' for time to come. koechner really deserved better. the script in general was poorly conceived, even naming the championship 'the toilet bowl'. so yes. spoof movies are dying. there is a movie called 'meet the spartans' (be ahead of the trend, boycott now!) coming out that includes a spoof on britney spears' breakdown. so let those kids keep getting erections... but people grow up and lose them. we need sustenance. one day, they will learn to stop spoofing spoofs and restore them. hopefully, one of the heroes will be 'get smart', made by the master mel brooks, coming out next year. <br /><br />rating: 2 out of 5 (stars)
