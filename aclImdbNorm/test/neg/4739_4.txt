i loved the blood and gore. the kind of violence is what alien and predator movies are about which is no one is spared. this truly answers the question of how it would be like if aliens were on earth. the answer to that is simple. we are screwed. the effects were beautiful. how ever there are some real problems with it.<br /><br />1) the acting was horrible on the part of the human characters side witch almost put me to sleep because of how dry and boring it was which really interrupted the flow of the movie and was very annoying. the writers could have done sooooooo much better. the good part was the alien and predator acting which i thought was done very well for the most part.<br /><br />2) the size of the predator ship was much smaller then how it was in the first avp movie. this i scratched my head on <br /><br />3) predators having their mask on while still in the ship. this upset people and i cant understand why. its not a plot hole like most people make it to be. so i say to you people calm the hell down. its no big deal. if it will make you feel better, remember, they did have face-hugger's on bored in storage so that could be a good reason why.<br /><br />4) predator firing its plasma caster inside the ship. i thought that was rather stupid on the predators part. but then i began to think if it was a younger predator that panicked.<br /><br />5)the hunter and his son almost instantly arriving at the crash site after it fell several miles away. at least they didn't bore us by showing them run through the woods for 30 min. so be happy about that.<br /><br />6) why did only one predator go? i thought this was odd. but then i thought that it was because he thought it was only one predalien that he was dealing with and not an outbreak.<br /><br />7) why didn't the predators in the ship self destruct? well if people were paying attention one did, but he was killed before he could completely activate it.<br /><br />8) the unlimited blue melting goo. i thought that was rather dumb.<br /><br />9) predator hiding evidence with the goo but skins a cop. that was also dumb.<br /><br />10) the black out. well come on people, an alien and pred did fight it out at a power station.<br /><br />11) predalien being half face-hugger/queen. this really ticked me off. i am an alien and pred fanatic. i know for a fact that aliens do not do that!! just like they don't give birth like a human does like they showed in alien4!! out of all the comics, games, books, and the movies 1,2, and 3, clearly shows their behavior. they need a queen to lay eggs, the eggs hatch into face-hugger's, face-hugger's infect host, the parasite pops out and kills host and grows into a drone if it infects a human, a predalien with a predator, and runner with any kind of four legged animal. and then after living for years upon years then they molt into a preatorian (a mini me queen that does not lay eggs) i can go on and on but i wont. but that scene alone nearly ruined the movie for me. if the directors are smart they would go back and edit that by making a face hugger infecting the pregnant women.<br /><br />any way if you are going to see this movie, just go see it for the aliens and predators. and when the scene comes up where the predalin infects that pregnant women... close your eyes so you don't have to see that insult to the alien and pred universe.
