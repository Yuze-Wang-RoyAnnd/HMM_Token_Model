river queen's sound recordist should have been fired, in this day and age there is no excuse for poor recording on the set. mumbling voices was the end result, and the cinematography was average to fair at best. the story had potential and i feel sorry for the overseas actors who must have known they were on a turkey shoot while they were filming. its obvious that the movie was suffering from el cheapo budget syndrome, and the scene where temuera is procreating inside the house while a battle rages outside is just too stupid for words. <br /><br />i noticed a few shortcuts taken on the maori protocol side of things, but this was probably due to movie length time restraints etc. all in all i wasn't impressed with this movie, the whanganui river has many beautiful spots but this movie gives us a cold, drab and claustrophobic image, with none of the beauty. the movie needed more sunshine and better camera angles, less on screen confusion, better sound recording, and more thought needed to be put into what the movie goers would be seeing on the big screen. <br /><br />hats off to all involved though for completing what must have been a very difficult shoo. i have the utmost appreciation for anyone who can make a feature film, sadly i did not enjoy this one.
