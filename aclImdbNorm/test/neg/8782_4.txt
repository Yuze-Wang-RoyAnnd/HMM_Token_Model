the untold origin of the lone ranger. it shows who he was and how and why he became the ranger.<br /><br />legendary bomb. the idea was not a bad one--reinvent and introduce the lone ranger for 1980s audiences. right off the bat though there were problems. the studio ordered clayton moore (the original ranger) to stop appearing anywhere as the lone ranger. it led to a nasty little battle that made headlines. i know of people who refused to see the film because of how moore was treated. also they hired the awesomely untalented klinton spilsbury to play the ranger. spilsbury was very handsome and muscular but had absolutely no charisma and just couldn't act. in fact his whole vocal performance was redubbed by another actor! also his off screen antics (public drunkenness and beating people up) didn't help matters. acting aside, the script is dull and slow. also the ranger himself doesn't show up until an hour in! there were some complaints at the time that the movie was too violent for a pg. however i don't think it was that bad.<br /><br />there are a few (very few) things done right here--the photography was truly beautiful; michael horse was excellent as tonto; christopher lloyd is lots of fun as the villain and when the lone ranger finally shows up (with the william tell overture booming from the soundtrack) it's really rousing. but, all in all, this is a boring and terrible attempt to bring back the lone ranger. it's easy to see why this bombed. a 4--mostly for the photography.
