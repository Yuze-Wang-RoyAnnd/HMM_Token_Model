watch this movie .....only to truly appreciate how good the original is. i'm not real hard to please, but this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. <br /><br />it hurt me deeply, because i like chevy chase, jackie mason, and dyan cannon. the writing was just terrible! i thought chevy would have at least ad libbed some better stuff than he did. there was hardly anything to laugh at in this movie. i went into it wanting to enjoy it. i wanted to laugh but nearly cried. <br /><br />in the beginning credits it read special appearance by chevy chase. this worried me from the start. chevy is actually in more than i thought he would be. it's more than a "special appearance". too bad the appearance wasn't special. mason's character would have been a good secondary character but got old as a main. i would rather have seen more (much more)of dyan cannon. at least her character was fun, if not well written. i also missed the gratuatis teen sex scene. mr. gopher went from being cute and innocent to a pesky rodent that deserved to be blown up. jonathan silverman is the only character that interested me and we didn't see enough of him.<br /><br />i take it back. try..to watch half of this movie, then...remember the alamo, the maine, and caddyshack i.
