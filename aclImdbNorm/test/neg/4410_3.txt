**may contain spoilers**<br /><br />a luckless south sea islander is executed by other (caucasian-looking) natives after he befriends visiting scientists tod andrews and tina carver. the meddlesome scientists dig him up and find that he has taken the form of a humanoid tree. he comes to life and goes on a rampage and sure enough, that fifties boogeyman, the a-bomb, is blamed for this aberration. to state that this particular monster walks like it has a stick up its a** would be redundant. suffice it to say that the critter lumbers along, like the film itself, throwing his enemies into some handy quicksand and giving the main characters one more thing to make stupid comments about. paul blaisdell created the tree-man suit and it's hardly his best work. over the years this flick has been sujected to many comments like "to hell it can go!" personally i think it's the best walking-tree movie i've ever seen.
