well, it wasn't a complete waste. armand was as usual very good in the movie,,,the whole turks vs german thing was kind of strange because i remember seeing bulgaria at the beginning of the movie...dint' bother to go back and check...the central theme is about the serial killings with the whole gang warfare loosely woven in. never saw a movie where the characters looked italian, supposed to be turk, taking english(american accent and euphemisms) with german words. the climax was the most intriguing part and there are parts of it that still did not make sense to me. in any case, if you have nothing else better to do, you can watch this movie..
