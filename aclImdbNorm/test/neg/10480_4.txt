lame rip-off of the quatermass xperiment (1955): the first half is deadly dull, even dreary - but the latter stages improve considerably with the scenes involving the rampaging 'monster'. in the accompanying featurette (a rather dry affair at a mere 9 minutes, when compared to the ones created for the other titles in criterion's "monsters & madmen" set), director day - who admits to not being a fan of the sci-fi genre - tries to justify the film's shortcomings by saying that he had a zero-budget to work with (where all the outer space scenes were composed of stock footage!)...and i'd have been inclined to be more lenient with the film had i not recently watched caltiki, the immortal monster (1959) - a similar (and similarly threadbare) but far more stylish venture from italy! <br /><br />bill edwards as the cocky but unlucky astronaut - obsessed with achieving the titular feat - is positively boring at first, but he eventually manages to garner audience sympathy when his physical features are deformed and the character develops a taste for blood! marshall thompson as his commanding officer and elder brother is o.k. as a leaner glenn ford type; he had previously starred in fiend without a face (1958), another (and more successful) richard gordon-produced sci-fi which, incidentally, is also available on dvd through criterion. italian starlet marla landi, struggling with the english language, makes for an inadequate female lead; even her input in the featurette proves to be of little lasting value! <br /><br />the audio commentary is yet another enjoyable tom weaver/richard gordon track where, among many things, the fact that first man into space was intended as a double-feature with corridors of blood (1958) is brought up - but it was eventually put out as a standalone release, so as to exploit the topical news value of the current space race; it's also mentioned that the monster dialogue was actually dubbed by bonar colleano (who, tragically, died in a traffic accident prior to the film's release!). weaver even recalls a couple of anecdotes from the time when he was involved in the production of the dvd featurette shot by, of all people, ex-cult-ish film-maker norman j. warren: landi, who by then had become a lady of title, was still ready to help out in carrying the equipment necessary to film the interview down several flights of stairs!; edwards was supposed to have contributed to the featurette but, once in london, he proved reluctant to co-operate with weaver - eventually, the latter learned that the actor had been recently diagnosed with cancer and, in fact, he died in 2002!
