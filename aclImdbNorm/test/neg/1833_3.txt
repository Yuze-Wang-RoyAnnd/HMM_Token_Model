okay, i had reasonably high expectations for this. the controversial subject matter was a good concept. as a horror fan i admit i was fascinated and very excited about this.<br /><br />it turns out they had a great idea, but it was terribly executed. let's see. this movie seems to run in 3 modes: happy, sex and dark. the problem is that the movie never decides what it wants to be. the "happy" parts i believe were meant to contrast with the "dark" parts, but it doesn't work. the soundtrack is one of the reasons.<br /><br />the movie transitions between these 3 modes very badly, i can't even begin to say how much the directing and editing suck. there's sex in the most unappealing and unerotic way. i'm not complaining but even for horror standards they were unnecessary and filler.<br /><br />the characters are all unlikeable with the exception of paula (potente). her friend from munich is a slut and possibly one of the most annoying characters in movies i've come across recently.<br /><br />there's a bit of plot which i won't go into detail... it's not stupid and in more talented hands would make a good movie. there's even a nice twist and a cool conspiracy going on. don't try to understand everything because there are giant plot holes here.<br /><br />it's all so shoddily done that you don't care for the victims, the perpetrators, anyone. and to think this could have been great. i can say one good thing about it which is, the movie shed some light on today's unethical medical procedures. with genetics and controversial sciences advancing, this could have been a great philosophical film that raises and discusses these questions. but you won't find that here, just a series of scenes loosely pasted together with people and things that you don't care about.<br /><br />skip this and go watch flatliners instead, you're welcome.<br /><br />3/10
