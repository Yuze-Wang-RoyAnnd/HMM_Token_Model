can there be a worst film? even ed wood at his horrific worst couldn't come up with something this bad. cheesy, stupid, long-winded, preposterous...and those are the good points. i saw this trash back in the early 80's when i was incredibly bored to begin with, and actually sat through the entire thing without blowing my brains out, although that probably would have been a more pleasant experience. i actually remembered it because it was so bad. it makes me sad in a way because some of the best directors got their start by making tv movies (ie spielberg) and it was a wonderful way for them to get their initial material before the public, but crap like this just totally killed the entire process.
