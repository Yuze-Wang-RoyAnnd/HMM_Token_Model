i'm normally a fan of mel gibson, but in this case he did a movie with a poor script. the acting for the most part really wasn't that bad, but the story was just pointless with flaws and boring. i thought i would like the movie a little but i didn't like it at all actually. i give it a 1 1/2 out of 5!
