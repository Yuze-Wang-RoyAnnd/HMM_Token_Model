i saw this one at sundance, and i can't figure out why it won the directing award. it was painfully slow and literally colorless. it's the type of movie that is only appreciated by film fest snobs who think any movie that a lot of people like must be beneath them.<br /><br />the jury at sundance this year seemed to be making a conscious effort to reward the underdog, ultra-low-budget films. that's all well and good, but this wandering, dragging mess looks like a home movie. mini-dv shot in a snow-covered gray winter results in a drab look for a drab movie.<br /><br />certain motifs (snakes) are beaten to death in spite of the fact that they add nothing to the story and make no sense as symbols.<br /><br />now, it wasn't all bad. vera farmiga is phenomenal in her role as a mother with a drug problem. she will be going places, and she deserves it. her co-star hugh dillon also does a fine job. frankly, there are many fine moments in this movie, but they just don't fit together very well.
