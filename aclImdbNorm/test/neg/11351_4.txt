incident on and off a mountain road is don coscarelli's entry in mick garris' masters of horror series. coscarelli is famous for being the man behind such cult gems as the phantasm series and the irresistibly weird bubba ho-tep; but he brings none of the qualities that made those films great to this tv episode. the plot is a run of the mill one that follows the routine idea of an innocent being chased by a madman. this time, it's a young woman driving down a mountain road. after a head on crash, she finds herself being stalked by a white faced maniac. the whole chase sequence is really ridiculous, with the young lady stopping every so often to set traps; only for the maniac to show up seconds later, and this is cut with scenes showing her with her husband - who just happens to have a wealth of information on how escape insane killers; with lines such as "expect the unexpected". the only real highlight for me was the presence of phantasm's tall man, angus scrimm. coscarelli tries his best to implement as much horror imagery as possible; with things such as a rotted corpse of a dead baby - but because it's all so silly on the whole, it's difficult to take this piece seriously. this is the first episode in the series, and the first that i've seen; i really hope they get better.
