i guess they reward idiocy today because whoever came up with the concept for this movie was not shot on sight.<br /><br />this is a morons delight. the worst stereo-types of every ghetto and high school movie is dragged out twisted around and made even more unbearable. every character in this movie has a sob story beyond sympathy. lets pray for a remake where the whole school gets nuked.<br /><br />***spoiler*** how does a school so run down have the internet in the first place?
