the movie started off o.k. a couple of tourists on vacation in mexico having a good time decide they should go on a hike. they uncover some hidden trails and end up and this huge temple like fortress. angry villagers show up and try to deter them from climbing it, but because of the language barrier people get shot and the tourists end up climbing the stupid thing. turns out the plants are evil blood-thirsty things that the villagers won't go near so they guard the temple so the tourists can't get off. there are a couple of scares in this movie, but nothing really makes sense. i mean they're plants! don't bother buying or renting the d.v.d. wait till it comes out on cable.
