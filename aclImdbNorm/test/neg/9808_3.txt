during filming, was vanessa redgrave taking mogadon? it was like she was reading from an autocue. i've seen more life in a wooden spoon. or perhaps that was all part of the character? whatever, it was very very annoying, i kept wanting to shake the screen to hurry her up. i read the book a long time ago & didn't like much about it except that septimus's descent into madness was very well done - but i don't think rupert graves showed this very well, his acting was all on the surface. the connection between his life and clarissa's is not very well done either but i suspect the attempt is to show the sacrifice soldiers made to enable people like clarissa to continue their vapid lives. the film is very bitty and has no real unity to it. hated it.
