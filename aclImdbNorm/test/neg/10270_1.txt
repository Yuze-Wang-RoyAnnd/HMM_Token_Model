despite the all-star cast, this attempt at epic fails. it comes across as a set of flat cartoon stereotypes strung together by an all too, too clever social commentary. <br /><br />it's as if with every bit of dialogue and introduction to a new character the writer peeks out and says "isn't that clever? am i not smart? isn't that biting social commentary?" and,sadly, the answer is always "ummmm...no." wearying self-absorbing stuff that is more like soap opera (in the worst sense of the term) than a movie...and an obvious attempt at television immortality. thankfully, it died young. empire falls falls flat.
