having broken into a secret database file for matching dna serums,federal agent frank poo (andy garcia)discovers the only person who can save his son's life is a psychopath,played by michael keaton . however,when a serum transfer at the local hospital goes terribly wrong,a certain mr.poo has to do everything in his power to ensure the madman stays alive in order to make the inevitable transfer possible. by the way,his name is'nt really poo,i just feel like calling it him. despite the original concept at hand,this is an implausible and turgidly unexciting action thriller.i've never been a big fan of andy garcia,and granted his charecter here is'nt that attachable,this movie winds up all the worse.the action sequences are handled pretty disappointingly,and the ending sucks pretty bad. having done a great villain in pacific heights,keaton's psychopathic bad guy here is a let down,providing a madman too funny and charismatic to be deplored.brian cox is also wasted as garcia's firm and frank superior.
