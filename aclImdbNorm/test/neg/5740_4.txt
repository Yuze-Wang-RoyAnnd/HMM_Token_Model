i suggest that in the future, any movie made by the sci fi channel and subsequently released on dvd must say that it was indeed made by such channel as i would not buy this stuff if i had known this fact. not that this was all bad, but when you have fade out for commercials in the middle of your movie it just ruins the flow of said film. this in turn makes the movie rather more boring. this one had an interesting story however the light hearted and extremely generic soundtrack distracted one from the film as did most of the bad actors with the exception of dien and linda carter. the story, vampires are on the attack in south america, of course the rules of vampire movies are not in effect, which the usually aren't in any of the movies about vampires i have seen lately with the exception of the blade trilogy. group of soldiers are sent down to battle said squad another team is sent to meet up with the team and to track down the ex wife of one of the soldiers...why she is not just his wife, who knows as this part of the plot really goes no where. still we get an interesting boat ride some nice jungle scenery and a lot of blood. this fact, however, does not save the film from being way to jerky in its presentation and really dull seeming at times. i don't know maybe it was the cgi blood, and smoke and whatever they have to make cgi now even though old effects look better and don't cost that much more. i mean cheap italian zombie movies could do a bullet hole without cgi why can't we now?
