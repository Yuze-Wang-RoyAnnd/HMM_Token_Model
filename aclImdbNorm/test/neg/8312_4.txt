there is a point in the film where the female boss of the "death machines" (a multi-ethnic trio to please everyone, being inclusive i think it's called these days) talks about using leverage on a business man. except such is her delivery that it sounds like "leatherage." at which point this viewer perked up thinking this dull film was turning a corner into new world of kinkiness. but it didn't. the boss lady had to do the talking as the "death machines" did not say a single word during the whole film and talk she does. interminably. there is action in the film but it is not that exciting and the plot staggers from one clich'e to another. the three mute "death machines" live to survive another day at the end of the film. hopefully there wasn't a sequel.
