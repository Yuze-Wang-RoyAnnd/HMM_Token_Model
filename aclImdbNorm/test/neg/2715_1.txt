yes, it was an awful movie, but there was a song near the beginning of the movie, i think, called "i got a woody" or something to that effect. i would love to find a sound track of that if there is one available. i saw this song on mst 3k, and as awful as it was, it had it's moments, and that song was one of them.<br /><br />if you like babes in bikinis, this is the movie for you, but if you don't, then don't bother. it was great material for mst 3k, i have to admit though. i would really love to know where to get a copy of the soundtrack though. not just that song, but a couple more were really funny, and are classics as far as i'm concerned.
