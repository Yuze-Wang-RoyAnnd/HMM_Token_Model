i'm sorry, but for a movie that has been so stamped as a semi classic and a scary movie, but seriously, i think when the director has me laughing unintentionally, that's not a good thing. the characters in this film were just so over the top and unbelievable. i just couldn't stop laughing at issac's voice, it was just like a high pitched whiny girl's british voice. not to mention malicai's over dramatic stick up his butt character.<br /><br />children of the corn is about a town where all the children have killed off the adults and worship a god that commands them to sacrifice any 20+ aged people. when a couple has a bad car accident they come to the town for help, but of course they get caught in the kid's trap and are getting sacrificed! but malicai has other intentions when he is sick of following issac's orders.<br /><br />children of the corn could've been something great, but turned into a bad over the top movie that you could easily make fun of. as much as i love stephen king, i'm sure this is not what he intended and it was a pretty lame story, or at least the actors destroyed it. like i said, for a good laugh, watch it, but i'm warning you, it's pretty pathetic.<br /><br />3/10
