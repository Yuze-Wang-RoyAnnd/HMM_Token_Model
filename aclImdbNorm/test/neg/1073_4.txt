i couldn't relate to this film. i'm surprised that people are lauding it for being so 'realistic'. how many people at your school were victim to incest? how many closet homosexual jocks were there? how many quiet people that you never noticed committed suicide? hmmm. ok you wouldn't know even if their were. but really these are explosive problems which many us never deal with. and yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems which could have been explored. but hey, where's the 'entertainment' in that?<br /><br />with regards to the girl who committed suicide - i found this to be exploitative. i actually think many people in high school at some stage feel invisible, ignored and unwanted. but what possesses someone to violently commit suicide on just another day of being ignored and unnoticed? the filmmaker decided this girl would suicide to make the film more provocative. and the graphic nature of the suicide to make it even more provocative. i didn't buy it as a real life scenario.<br /><br />and the problems of the other students i didn't fully relate to. bullying is explored but that's been done to death, we all know it goes on and it truly is a matter of resolve within that person. closet homosexuality? pfft, another clich'e gets rolled out. thats the thing really, too many clich'es. i guessed the ending at the start. there was a predictable unpredictability if that makes sense. you've got all these characters with explosive problems, and one with apparently none. and i thought, what is the point of this character unless she's the unsuspecting suicide victim? and surely enough..<br /><br />one thing i will say, and it is the saving grace of the film, is that it does not glamourise suicide. the suicide is very graphic and heart-breaking to watch. it is a powerful scene (regardless of how contrived it is)and one that dismisses suicide as the easy option. but the film is really not very imaginative and used stereotypes.<br /><br />not bad but certainly not groundbreaking or worthy of a 17-minute standing ovation at cannes???
