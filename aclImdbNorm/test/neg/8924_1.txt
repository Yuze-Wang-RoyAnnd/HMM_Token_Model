i ran across this movie on a local tv channel last night. frankly, i have never heard about this movie before. simply, i lost track of seagual's recent movies, for each one is worst than the previous one. here, again we have a dull seagal as if he was insisted by his girlfriend to make this movie and he accepted forcefully. the plot is ridiculous, acting is below zero, and there is no single aspect the movie is not falling apart. i simply don't have any idea why seagal did this movie. man, it is even worst than "out for a kill"! if you watch this movie you will start feeling sorry for seagal. he seems to be running out of ideas, enthusiasm and money. avoid this movie and do something worthwhile.
