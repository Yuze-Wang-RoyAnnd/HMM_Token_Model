i've never been a huge fan of almodovar, but, generally, i've always found something to enjoy in his films. unfortunately, i had more trouble finding something to enjoy in broken embraces then i would normally think i would.<br /><br />i find the biggest failure in broken embraces to be the characters and the lack of depth they display. the film is essentially a love story, one that is tragic, and one that wants to involve the viewer in their stories. i found this problematic from the beginning.<br /><br />in the opening scene, our 'hero' the director/screenwriter, mateo, is having sex with a very attractive young woman whom he just met. his agent comes in as the woman bashfully leaves.<br /><br />in the opening scene, our 'hero' the director/screenwriter, mateo, is having sex with a very attractive young woman whom he just met. his agent comes in, and rolls her eyes, as the woman bashfully leaves. mateo babbles something about needing to enjoy life as the only thing he has left. having been blinded in a tragic car accident that also killed his 'true' love lena, played by penelope cruz, the viewer might buy into to this notion except the rest of the film really never illustrates why lena was the love of his life or any depth to his character or any other.<br /><br />cruz plays lena the mistress to an industrialist named ernesto martel. from the outset, their union is rather a pathetic one, as martel clutches jealousy to lena, and lena avoids uncertainty of being on her own by staying with the much older martel. to skip ahead, martel finances a film for mateo so he can keep tabs on the star of the film, lena. naturally, without any back story, lena and mateo fall in love. and, in almodovar's world it really is that simple. mateo, in the opening scene, has sex with a sexy young woman, now mateo falls in love with lena, later it's revealed he had a son with his agent after their love affair. her son responds to this information with a laugh and an, "oh, well." again, no depth, no understanding for any of these characters, it all just happens. from the beginning of the film to the end, i got no depth of emotion from mateo. he is flat, and doesn't act much different from one scene to the next.<br /><br />the one scene i did enjoy was when film producer, martel, is watching video footage his son recorded under the guise of doing a documentary of mateo. there are nice a moment of martel watching obsessively as a lip reading confirms his worst fears. later, lena confronts martel as he's watching the footage and speaks her part out loud matching the video footage of her lips as she talks. some quite brilliant moments. rather contrived, but still really fascinating.<br /><br />unfortunately, for me, the rest of the film left me rather bored. i couldn't care about these characters or their situations, so no amount of cleverness on almodovar's part can make up for this lack of depth. i think if you're a fan of his work you'll enjoy this movie, but if you're like me, in between, then you'll find it lacking.
