specks of white and various shapes, a beautiful nude, random images. that is what this little experimental short film is.<br /><br />it's kind of interesting to think how in the early days of film such images could be transferred onto film, but despite my love of a lot of surreal images and films, and a fascination with the bizarre, this film just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />i'm not sorry i watched it, but if there is any underlying meaning in it, i don't get it. visually, it is not that outstanding, in my humble opinion. as an example of dadaism, i suppose it would fit in quite well, since it seems to reject any semblance of logic or reason, though i would have preferred that it do it in a more visually interesting way.<br /><br />but to each his own.
