i believe the production value is ok..probably deserves a 4/10 or 5/10.it's traditionally filmed,featuring good looking people with model quality and a little class..<br /><br />but the premise let me annoyed..a decent woman would do such dirt? i mean she is gonna marry a man who would have sex with another woman? <br /><br />and what's more serious she is also active in the behavior...... only in de laclos's mind....the film also have many aspects that makes eastern europeans seem immoral<br /><br />after all, it's just movie, if it doesn't intend to degrade women in general, i will give one more point..but obviously, it does<br /><br />conclusion: a nasty piece of crap with a little taste
