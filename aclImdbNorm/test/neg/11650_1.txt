i'm sorry, but this really does feel like a modern day apollo 13 knock-off. totally implausible (at least armageddon felt like a comic book! this felt like a bad high school film project), acting was about as clich'e as one can get, and....landing a space shuttle on an la freeway? come on. seriously. jerry, what were you thinking? and all the clich'es: the pregnant astronaut's wife, the nosy reporter who gets in everyone's way, the stalwart manager with "go fever". and it's one thing to twist the laws of physics or politics or whatever to make an entertaining story, but at least make it good! fact and science were totally butchered for this. the space shuttle doesn't have fuel tanks in it's wings, and even if it did, it couldn't steer by shifting fuel between them (and neither could a dc-10).<br /><br />if you like bad acting, bad storytelling, low realism, and cheesy clich'es, this one can't be beat!
