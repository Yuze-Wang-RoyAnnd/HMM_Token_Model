as a big fan of most modern fantasy movies, i was really looking forward to this. i was not familiar with the character, although after hearing some general stories about the style of the comic and good reviews of the movie, i thought i was in for a real treat...<br /><br />from the moment that the lead character started to talk in his forced husky voice, i could tell straight away that i was not going to enjoy this movie. i found the story weak and predictable, the acting poor, the effects were very good for a small budget film, but did nothing for the overall plot.<br /><br />maybe as a fan of the comics you may get something more from this, otherwise i would suggest that you skip it and not waste you cinema fare on this boring adventure.
