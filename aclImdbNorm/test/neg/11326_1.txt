years ago, i used to watch bad movies deliberately. somehow i missed this one. no gesture rings true. no facial expression fits the scene or the action. i've never heard such inappropriate music for a film. at the final scene, i was rooting for the car to run over that ridiculous kid - one of the worst child actors ever.<br /><br />only one name in it i ever heard of - wilford brimley. he must've been very hungry to take this part.<br /><br />do not under any circumstances, watch this movie!!! you've been warned!!!
