if this is film noir, then noir must be french for glacially slow. take a cast of completely unlikeable characters, give them nothing to say, punctuate the whole thing with gratuitous ultra-violence, and you've got the formula for an aggravated dash. could be subtitled "sleazy hollywood types attempt to make money from chinatown rip-off". bruce dern's one minute part is orders of magnitude better than anything else in this flick. by the way, i didn't like the film.
