one should have the right to expect from people who make a film about the second coming and the third testament, that they had read the other two, or at least knew a little more about them than miracles and judgement day. this film contains absolutely nothing of relevance for viewers who are interested in jesus, religion or philosophy -- there is only the standard british social realism with guttural dialects and plump characters in pubs.<br /><br />actually, good candidates for a real third testament have been published several times - like "a course in miracles" or "conversations with god". they all have thought-provoking new twists and angles for christian faith and theology.<br /><br />the most interesting information in imdb's rating is not the number of stars, but how many people who have bothered to vote. in four years, only 387 people have bothered to vote for this film. as usual, the enthusiasts are the most eager. for comparison, have a look at "jesus christ, superstar" - original version from 1973.
