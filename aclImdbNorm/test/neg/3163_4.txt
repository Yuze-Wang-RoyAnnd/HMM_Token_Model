frankly i met real han su ying before and seeing her portrayed by an american actress which has no resemblance of anything chinese makes my head spin while i am watching this movie why can't hollywood get nancy kwan instead .... at least its more true to the story...cos for goodness sake...dr han su ying is chinese i know cos i have meet her in person<br /><br />and looking at the whole cast....so few asian faces in a movie about a asian love story makes me wonder too <br /><br />i think the acting is good but without real asian faces in a asian love story makes the plot so corny and a whole load of baloney<br /><br />its just like another movie i know of ' the conqueror' imagine my eyes pop out when i see john wayne as genghis khan!!!!!<br /><br />and to make matter worst ....how on earth can a man born an bred in mongolian steppes come up with a alabama southern accent??? !! and a cheap imitation of anything asian<br /><br />good grief<br /><br />i am not surprise that one day i will see dr martin luther king jr being played by one of the boys from the black and white minstrel show<br /><br />would love to see that<br /><br />and laugh the whole roof off !!!<br /><br />cheers
