this film was such a mess i actually reimbursed my friends who i dragged to see it. the only reason i went to see it was that my friend was an apprentice editor on the shoot.<br /><br />i'm sure that this film was meant to be campy, but the approach was so heavy-handed and self-reflexive it turned out really flat. judd nelson stars as an obsequious garbage man who is a hack comedian on the side. his life is hell and made worse by his obnoxious and overbearing companion bill paxton (who i feel embarrassed for - this was a really tasteless role for a talented actor). a freak accident alters nelson's career course and mayhem ensues.<br /><br />the attempts at humor were corny, predictable and often base and tasteless. wayne newton in the cast as a talent agent is a novelty but he adds nothing - comedically or otherwise.<br /><br />overall, it's a very weak and uncreative attempt at camp humor that goes over like a lead balloon. at least you could laugh at plan 9 from outer space. this one just makes you wonder who thought this was a good enough idea to finance and film. one of the all time worst bombs you'll ever witness.
