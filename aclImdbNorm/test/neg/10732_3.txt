a killer (john karlen) with a penchant for really bad disguises (afro wig on a white dude?) cruises around in his van looking for victims. detective decarlo (james luisi) is on the case and finds the killer rather easily by just hanging out by the local pool and looking for anyone looking weird (again, the afro wig comes into play). tracking the killer to his home, decarlo decides to set up a risky sting involving a female police psychologist.<br /><br />inspired by the crimes of ted bundy before he was caught, killer's delight is a pretty predictable and cheap serial killer flick. director jeremy hoenack has no idea how to pace a film or even make it suspenseful. he does know how to show lots of close ups of the killer wringing his hands though! the only thing this really has going for it is the captured 70s atmosphere (look out for the bathroom wallpaper). well, that and a downbeat ending. the media blasters/shriek show dvd has lots of nice stuff though including an audio commentary by hoenack and karlen, plus video interviews, trailers and an alternate opening.
