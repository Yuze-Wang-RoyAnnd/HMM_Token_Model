this "movie" will give me nightmares, i will wake up drenched in sweat, screaming "i didn't make this film please don't blame me!" i honestly think it would have been more entertaining to watch a fat guy eating lard in his moms basement for a hour or two, than to watch this crap. i understand money was tight but goddamn what the hell were they thinking there was no thought, plot or effort put into this. this movie needs a warning "please for the love of god don't fund the drama department a the local jc." on an other note these are the least likable characters i have ever seen, and i have seen movies with hitler in them. so lastly take my advice the next time you even think about renting this just pop a few hundred adivl and let the sleep come.
