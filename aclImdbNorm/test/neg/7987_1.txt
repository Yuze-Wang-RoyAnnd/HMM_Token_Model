we see thomas edison, with a glowing smile on his face, trying to electrocute a 5 ton living being. eventually he was successful, and so the first animal snuff film is born, cleverly disguised as an amazing achievement in technology. this is scientific arrogance at it's worst, folks. it ranks up there with the doctor who decapitated a monkey just to prove that he could keep its severed head alive for 22 minutes.<br /><br />oh yes, there's the absurd excuse that the elephant had been convicted of "murder" and sentenced to death, and that this was a fair and humane "execution". to all the people who are satisfied with this sophistry, please form a line on my right. i'm going to give you all a big collective three stooges slap across the head.<br /><br />go watch "the advocate" (1993), a movie based on the true story murder trial of a pig in mideval france. 500 years later, humans are still a bunch of morons i see.<br /><br />what's next? we arrest birds for stealing our blueberries? arrest pricker bushes for assault and battery? thomas edison, i hope you have a big fat worm crawling through your eye socket right now. oh wait, that would be trespassing, wouldn't it? lol
