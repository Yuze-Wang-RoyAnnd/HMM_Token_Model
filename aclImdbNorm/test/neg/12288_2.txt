okay,i had watched this movie when i was very little and the day that we were cleaning out the closet i see this!i thought,"i have no idea of what this movie was like,"so i went ahead and put it in.oh my god!!!!!this film is so darn bad!i never thought that this film could ever get as close to my least favorite film as it did,but i did laugh,because all the jokes were so corny and ridiculous,not funny!!!!so much stuff in this movie was funny,because it was so stupid!!!!this film is not anywhere near good.i would have to say if you want to watch this movie you definitely better not expect anything big and if you've already seen it,trust me,i feel your pain as well!!!!
