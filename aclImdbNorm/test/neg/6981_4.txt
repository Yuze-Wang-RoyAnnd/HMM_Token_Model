this movie wasted 2 hours of my time and just make me wanna scream: "lame". nicholas stoller write the movie "yes man", but direct "this" maybe he should stick with writing.<br /><br />i am so disappointed because i heard all the great review. i was expecting something like knocked up. they say this is from the maker of "knocked up"? why can't i see the resemblance? but this just felt like a shallow, overdone-theme kind of movie for me. i am so disappointed. actually it's not bad if you consider it as your-average-chick-movie, but that character of the "band guy" just get on my nerves<br /><br />maybe i was just not paying enough attention to the movie, but yeah they have some funny lines and scene, but i don't felt the originality. and the ending make the movie a little bit better. at least the ending is not some boring clich'e one.
