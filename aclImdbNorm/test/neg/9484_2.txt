a stupid movie, with a stupid plot. feels like they threw every imaginable clich'e in a blender. i especially "liked" the part, where two teenage girls gets the french president to clean the water. because we all know how dedicated america is to conservation of the environment. kyoto, anyone?? and the french chef, who has apparently never seen or tasted a hamburger... this is why people think americans have no culture. that, and the fact that we meet your kids when they come to europe to "see the world" (i.e. eat at mcdonalds in foreign capitals) they are not as dumb as the two ditsy preteens in this movie, but they have just about the same amount of cultural enlightenment and good manners.
