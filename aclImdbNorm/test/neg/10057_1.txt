nightkill stars robert mitchum as a world-weary private eye probing the case of a missing industrialist (mike connors). he is hired by jaclyn smith, the anxious wife of the missing man. what jaclyn fails to inform mitchum is that she knows full well her husband's whereabouts. after all, she was the one who helped her lover james franciscus dispose of her wealthy hubby.<br /><br />what more would expect from a rotten slasher film with robert mitchum? mannix goes western, monkeys are abused, models lean against classic cars, and smith is constantly upstaged by sybil danning until a giallo style wrap-up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end. this is bad cinema. and this movie is sooooo poor. it makes it look like halloween mixed up with trick or treats. avoid this.<br /><br />rated r for graphic violence, nudity and sexual situations.
