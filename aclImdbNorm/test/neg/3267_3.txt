when i first viewed this movie, i didn't know the title of it. i realized it had chevy chase in it with the same name he had in caddyshack so i had an idea this was caddyshack 2. at the end of the movie when i did find out it was caddyshack 2 i was disappointed. they could have done better. dan akroyd i thought was bad. the whole story was bad. call this movie by another title, but don't call it caddyshack 2. you give that great movie a bad name. jackie mason's daughter when i first saw her looked like his wife. how old is this girl? geez. how about making this movie a little believable. i thought chevy chase was good.
