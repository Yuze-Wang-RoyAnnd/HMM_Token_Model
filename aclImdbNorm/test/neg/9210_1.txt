there needs to be a 0/10 option for bilge like this. <br /><br />it was painful to watch, but strangely compelling all the same. compelling because it seemed unbelievable that a movie could actually suck this much. i kept thinking "it must get better." it got worse. and worse. <br /><br />how on earth were people conned into producing such a categorical piece of junk i'll never know. the most surprising thing of all though, is all these reviews i see of people actually loving the movie. yes, the acting was good, but the movie was very very very bad. worst movie ever!
