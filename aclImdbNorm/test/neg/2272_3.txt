oh, my. poor jane must have done the old rolling-over-in-the-grave thing. even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad. whatever else you do with austen, the dialog should sparkle (even in this, perhaps her most serious work), and melodrama should be strictly out of bounds. alas, not the case with this production. by the time you get to anne's "frederick, frederick, frederick," you'll either be laughing or crying. unless you're just out to visually "collect" all extant films of austen's work, you can skip this one. if you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: the actresses playing anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.
