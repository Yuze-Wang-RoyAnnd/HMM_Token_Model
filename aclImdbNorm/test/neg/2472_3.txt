well, it is standard hollywood schmaltz that you can see coming a mile off. it's enjoyable in parts but just oh so predictable. i must confess i did not really enjoy it, but i am pretty tough to please and a lot of my friends loved it.<br /><br />it is quite sweet, and the actors give good performances. it's a nice backdrop and the eye candy is pretty good. but the irritatingly predictable, unoriginal and really quite dull storyline holds the film back. personally, i can think of better ways to spend a couple of hours of my life.<br /><br />the chick flick genre gets some bad press but there are some genuinely good chick flicks out there; this isn't one of them.
