after completing the lackluster novel, heart of darkness, i moved on to watch the movie, which was a complete and absolute disappointment. at the onset, i expected that the movie would help put together the jigsaw puzzle of a book. however, even though i had read the novel, the movie still made no sense at all, so i can't imagine how lost i would be if i had skipped the book altogether. it seemed as though the writers picked out their favorite parts and put them in the movie, and left out anything that may assist the viewers in comprehending the meaningless plot. this dreadful movie made no sense at all, and i would strongly recommend against watching it, as it will do nothing more than leave you completely baffled and bewildered.
