the first two hours of the televised version are full of character and plot exposition -- after an early brief sequence of las vegas being hit by tornadoes, the action doesn't really start until the second two hours. still, some character relationships don't become clear until the second part. the actors turn in competent performances, but nothing special (however, better than those in "aftershock: earthquake in new york"). an exception is randy quaid, whose character is superfluous and incredibly annoying. the plot is a pretty standard mix of parts of "independence day", "speed", "the day after tomorrow", "earthquake", "the towering inferno" and several other films. you can predict what will happen next, and come close to predicting the dialog, word for word. the special effects are unbelievably bad. despite the effects in "twister", the tornadoes in this film seem less realistic than the one in "the wizard of oz" and other effects were obviously done for less money than such series as "csi" and "cold case" spend on the totality of a single episode. if you have to see a made-for-tv disaster film, see "the day after", "asteroid", or "special bulletin" instead -- you'll get better plots, acting, and effects.
