this takes place in 1920s harlem. a black owned nightclub has to deal with gangsters and corrupt policemen.<br /><br />terrible vanity project for eddie murphy. it tries to mix comedy and drama and fails at both. the comedy simply isn't funny and the drama is boring and badly acted. you think a film with three comedy legends--eddie murphy, redd foxx and richard pryor--would be great but it isn't. there's nonstop swearing and the opening scene has a young boy shooting a man to death (this is shown as being ok). also we have the beautiful della reese degraded into playing a madam. one of the "comedic" highlights has a long, unfunny and terribly vicious fight between her and murphy. a boring, offensive and stupid mess. not the worst murphy movie but pretty close. a 1 all the way.
