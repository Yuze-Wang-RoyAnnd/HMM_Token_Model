i am a fan of a few of the vacation films, but when a movie franchise goes from the big screen to the tv screen, you know it's out of steam. made for tv national lampoon films do not do well on tv. this movie is another reason.<br /><br />i think a lot of us were excited when this was coming out, but we also had to face the reality...it's a tv movie. randy quaid is fine as cousin eddie, but is better in a supporting role than the lead. dana barron sets history as the first actor to reprise her role as one of the griswold kids. she is just as pretty, but it doesn't help a thin script. <br /><br />why was this movie even made? it was probably because nbc recently picked up another few years of presenting x-mas vacation. there is nothing wrong with the acting. it's all in the script. it's just not that funny. people need to think before they write stuff like this. it is one christmas movie i do not recommend.
