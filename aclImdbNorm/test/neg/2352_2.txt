this movie was one of a handful that actually caused me pain. it might be enjoyed by anybody who thinks that it would be funny to see his/her mother in a crowded discotheque full of people half her age "inventing" some totally ridiculous dance in a completely misguided effort to be "hip" (in the parlance of that age). to see ingrid bergman stoop to such a pitiful performance on the disco dance floor was hard to watch. i was embarrassed.<br /><br />to make matters worse, the music in the disco was not realistic at all - it is the bogus idea of some hollywood director about what pop music was like at the time. that is always a total embarrassment in most films of that era - the ersatz music is canned and bears only a painful, passing resemblance to the music that was actually popular in the 60's.<br /><br />mathau is hopelessly miscast as some kind of ladies' man; he just looks lecherously grotesque. hawn's wide-eyed innocence is just too silly. the handsome neighbor in her apartment is portrayed way too earnestly and seriously. he seems like a brady kid who got lost in this farce. painful, pitiful mess.
