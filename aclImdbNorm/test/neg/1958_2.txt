why did i have to go out and buy (yes buy!) jack frost 2: revenge of the mutant killer snowman??? maybe it was a burst of temporary mental derangement? but i'm guessing it's because i kind of enjoyed the first jack frost. it was a silly but funny horror-comedy which had some okay effects by screaming mad george. that and the fact that on the back-cover of the sequel there was this nice picture of this guy impaled by this giant icicle (coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and all). so i thought: if it's as idiotic as the first and has some nice splatter/gore in it, it should be fun, right? well, i was so dead wrong! <br /><br />let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plot. i mean, a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that spawns mutant killer baby snowballs which can only be killed or harmed by bananas??? as much as i love the premise, i really hated the movie. first of all: while the first jack frost looked like an actual movie (seemingly being shot on real film and all), this sequel has the look and feel of a third-rate soap-opera. it has this way too slick shot-on-video look. the lighting is just plain awful (bright white spots for the day look, and stupid colors like blue and green at night). the acting... well don't even go there. the dialogues range from stiff to extremely senile (that jamaican man was just moronic, saying "man" after every sentence). and when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman, all i could think of was a seventh-rate chucky from child's play spewing dumb and supposedly witty one-liners before he kills someone.<br /><br />the best joke was were one guy asks "why are you talking to your watch?". and the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked (thank god for that!). oh, yeah, and that little scene over the end-credits with those two japanese dudes on a miniature ship being badly dubbed had me laughing too. but the worst thing about this movie was: where was the gore and splatter action everyone is talking about? there were plenty of occasions to show some decent gory killings. a lot of people were killed off in original ways here, but all off-screen. like i've read in many other comments, there were indeed nice set-ups to a head explosion, a crushed body, eyes being poked out, tongue ripped out,... but on the crucial moments the editor cuts away to some blood splatters on the floor or nothing at all. that frontal shot of that british guy being impaled (from the back-cover of the dvd) wasn't even in the movie. i only saw that particular killing filmed from the back (meaning i didn't see sh!t!). i was waiting throughout the whole movie for that to happen, and then i get to see nothing?!?! what a let-down! could it be that i saw a cut version of the movie? that would be a shame, 'cause only a decent amount of splatter-fun could have saved this movie if you ask me. seeing a lot of killer snowballs reduced to bloody pulp just didn't cut it for me. speaking of those snowballs: they were done very poorly. they made munchies look like state-of-the-art 'animatronics'. but i guess that was the whole point of it. at some point, the special effects crew even turned to some laughably bad cgi. boy, you really have to see it to believe it. best is to not see it, actually, 'cause this flick is just too bad (okay, i did laugh with it, for it kept getting worse and worse). just stick with the first jack frost (1996) and you'll be okay (just bare in mind that it's a pretty silly horror-comedy but fun in it's own right).<br /><br />it's funny, but writer/director michael cooney somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after jack frost 2, and then focused on writing. turns out he then wrote two pretty good thriller screenplays for the i inside (starring ryan phillippe) and identity (starring john cusack). so the man seems to have some talent after all.<br /><br />now it would be far too easy to give jack frost 2 the lowest rating possible. so i say one point for that naked asian babe doing the skinny dipping and one point for those completely retarded snowball babies. way to go mr. cooney!
