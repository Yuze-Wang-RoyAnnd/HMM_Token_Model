i don't normally write reviews, but this "film" was special. i couldn't turn it off. i don't believe i've ever seen a worse movie, but there i sat, watching. it was like a horrible car wreck with blood flowing all over the highway. it was disgusting, but i couldn't turn away. where do i start? the movie seems to think it's a sports thriller, but it's so utterly ridiculous, it can only be a comedy, but it's not funny, not even in a dumb/silly way. it's like watching your cousins try to act out a skit on family get-togethers. it's painful to watch, but at least it's only for a minute or two. second string went on for over an hour. <br /><br />whoever was involved with making this movie should not work again. the writing, directing, acting, and everything was just terrible. the problem is i can't describe how bad it was; you just had to see it. and i'm sure this will never be shown again, so unless you saw it, you're out of luck. i mean it was almost worth seeing just for the fact that it gave me some appreciation for every other "bad" film i've seen over my lifetime. and for every film i see in the future that i can't stand, i will think to myself, well, at least it wasn't bad as the second string.
