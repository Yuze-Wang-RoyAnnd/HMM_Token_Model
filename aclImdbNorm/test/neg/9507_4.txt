(this is a review of the later english release by disney, featuring alison lohman, patrick stewart, and co.) <br /><br />i really wanted this film to be good. really, really. i'm a huge fan of princess mononoke and spirited away, and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier miyazaki film, i was eager to see it. but i was shocked, shocked i say, at the quality of this film. those later films boast well-crafted plots, 3-dimensional characters, and the best film music since...well...ever. this film just doesn't come close.<br /><br />might as well start w/ the positive aspects, though. like all miyazaki films, this one is still very imaginative, with a bizarre fantasy/sci-fi setting, in a post-apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species. nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time. (though not as beautiful and fluid as miyazaki's later films) and the english voice acting is quite well done.<br /><br />but this film...just...isn't...good... the characters are all cardboard - from saccharine sweet little nausicaa, to the ruthlessly evil tolmekians, to everyone in between. once you've seen each of them for 30 seconds, you've seen all there is. and the fact that the plot just ambles along doesn't help.<br /><br />then there's the music... now, hisaichi is hands down my favorite film composer, but nausicaa doesn't do him justice. half the music is 80's keyboards on overdrive, and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them. i highly suspect that hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picture.<br /><br />but wait! there's a great message with this film, right?! let's all save the environment! too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a sledgehammer. there is a scene in which nausicaa hugs a tree. no, really. i ain't kidding.<br /><br />it makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is. but for some reason all the other reviews on imdb seem to adore it. and when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you what's going on, that's lame.<br /><br />if you're the kind of person who worships anime, enjoys 80's music, and plants a tree every arbor day, you will probably like this film. otherwise, save your money for his later films, because they rock big time.
