a few buddies and myself have the strange hobby of seeking out really horrendous and utterly obscure (for a good reason) horror flicks and then subsequently watching them under the influence of mind-broadening consumer goods like alcohol and/or soft drugs. surely a lot of people do this, but they watch movies like the "godzilla" remake, whereas we torment our eyes and brains with stuff like "the loch ness horror". and, eureka, this is a prototypic bad movie! we open traditionally, with bag pipes music during the opening credits. this is, of course, to emphasize extra to us dumb viewers that the story is supposed to take place in the scottish highlights and not in director larry buchanan's birthplace texas. for that exact same reason, the cast members are seemingly also instructed to overact tremendously and talk with talk with atrocious accents. the american marine biologist prof. george sanderson arrives in loch ness with some brand new and highly sophisticated sonar equipment to track down the whereabouts of the legendary monster in the lake. meanwhile, there are many other parties hanging around the lake, like a group of kids on a science camp (what a boring way to spend your vacation), retired army generals looking for a luftwaffe plane that crashed in the lake during wwii and a bunch of thieves and failed scientists that are steeling the monster's egg. you would think that these numerous sub plots bring some diversity and excitement in the plot, but unfortunately that's not the case. "loch ness horror" is an overall boring flick with only a couple of noteworthy elements. the monster itself, for example, is a delightfully cheesy creation with cute eyes and a smoky breath. his teeth also glow in the dark, which is quite useful when you're dumb enough to go out on a boat ride in the middle of the night. near the end of the film, the remaining cast members were more interested in the lost luftwaffe plane than in the monster, so it was about time to wrap it up. "loch ness horror" is carefully recommended in case you're a fan of bad b-movies from the 80's, but be advised that it contains an overload of senseless dialogs and a bizarrely rushed ending that makes it look as if the film suddenly ran out of budget.
