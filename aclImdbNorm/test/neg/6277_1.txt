i wish i could have given this a zero. sure i'll admit that i also mistakenly picked this up thinking it was the spielberg version. a clever marketing ploy releasing it at this time and being prominently displayed at the video store. however, i was willing to give it a go anyhow - i wish i wouldn't have.<br /><br />where do i start? i have read some of the other reviews here and have to say i disagree with anyone who thinks any of the acting was good - sorry even c. thomas howell stunk. none of the performances were any good. not a one.<br /><br />even if the acting was decent the dialog is terrible! "ginormus" and "dick skinners" just doesn't really cut it.<br /><br />now as for the story well - it was terribly adapted and must have been edited by a 5 year old. the main character is constantly running into situations that are way convenient - or at least appear that way due to how the film was edited together. for example he is trying to get to a place called new hope to find his brother. during a brief break someone just randomly hands him the directions to new hope. what the hell is that? when he gets to new hope he just happens to stumble onto his dying brother. then there is the part where he has been traveling away from his destination for days and just happens to come across the car his wife and son were traveling in. he was going in a different direction then they were how did that car end up where he was? he has a black back pack that randomly appears and disappears throughout the film. there are parts of the film where the characters are just waking up in the morning and then two seconds later it is night - or worse yet dusk of the next day. i also can't forget the main character and the preacher falling through the floor of a house for no reason - we don't find out until later that an alien has landed on the house. which reminds me of the moment when they are walking and suddenly find themselves standing under an alien they didn't notice. what the hell, the aliens are like two stories tall with huge bodies and multiple legs - how could they miss it? there is one point where an alien kills a random citizen, supposedly by spitting some kind of junk at him - but you never see the stuff fly it just appears on the guys face. the special effects in general are terrible. the entire movie is like a bad "train wreck". when we finally get to the end, after this guy trying to get to dc to find his family, they just appear. no searching no asking questions nothing. just oh there you are i am so happy - the end.<br /><br />i am sorry if my review rambles a bit but this movie was so bad i had a hard organizing my contempt. please save yourself the time and don't watch this sneakily displayed pile of cinematic stench. it is quite possibly the worst film i have ever witnessed. i would rather have been getting a root canal - it would have been less painful.
