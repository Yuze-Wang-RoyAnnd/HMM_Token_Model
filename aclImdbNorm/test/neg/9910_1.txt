this movie has to be the worst film i have seen. there is a reason it was made to be a mow (movie of the week). the continuity was all wrong (palm trees in a chicago setting even though it was filmed in toronto, canada), the effects were left to be desired for the year of 2004. hello. "lord of the rings" had better cgi than that. but i guess they also had the money for it. the budget will for sure affect the outcome but anyone that calls this mow more than a 2 needs to go back to film and tv school. next time remember that care and time make a classic not rushing for a tornado box office or tv smash hit.<br /><br />also, i know networks can reuse footage from old networks or affiliates but using 80's footage for 2004? i have a hard time buying that.
