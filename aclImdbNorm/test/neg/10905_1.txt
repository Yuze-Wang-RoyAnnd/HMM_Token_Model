i do not write reviews here often but i can not stand by and let other people suffer through this movie without a least trying to warn them. this movie is horrible and it is not because "i do not know what the director was trying to convey" or "i am too stupid to understand the plot"; this movie is horrible because of poor direction, screen writing and acting. this is the "trifecta" of bad move making and the reason the film was direct to video. it tries to be something like "high tension", "hostel" and "tcsm" with the lifting of some of those ideas but it just does not work. i did not have high expectations or even medium ones going into the film but was still very disappointed. it had potential to be very good with a nice setting and good idea for a film but it was wasted.
