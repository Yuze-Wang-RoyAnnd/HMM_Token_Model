doll master is an example of a lousy horror film, fallen somewhere in the space with it's two not so well established genres, a horror film and an emotional drama film. seems like the doll master tries very hard to be a very scary horror film, but it fails. the noise of the dolls while moving is like taken from the croak of kayako in ju-on, and the crawls are like sadako esquire. the killing dolls will remember you a cute version of "chucky". but compared to child's play, this film is more superb. but the story seems a nothing, the brilliant camera shots and the brilliance of acting was taken away cause of the plot.<br /><br />don' watch this if you are expecting great shocks.
