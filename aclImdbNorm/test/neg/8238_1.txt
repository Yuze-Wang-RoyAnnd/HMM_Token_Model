i picked up this movie and was horrified to find out that the movie is based on a rape of a little girl that the parents knowingly take their daughter to. my first thoughts were that i have never been more ashamed to be an indian as well as a hindu. i found this movie to be down right appalling. please don't waste your time. as for the music, there are at most 2 horrible songs and the film used is cheap. the beautiful scenes are not what india is known for. i just hope that i have shed some light on how disgusting this movie really is. yes it may highlight how evil people in power especially when it comes to religion may be, but to sit down and watch almost 2 hours of this movie can make almost anyone gag. if your up for a good indian movie watch something by director mira nair.
