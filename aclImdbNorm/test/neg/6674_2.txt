okay, so maybe the acting wasn't bad, but i am typing this review as a public service to prevent anyone else who happens upon the intriguing beginning of this telefilm from throwing away two hours of their life waiting for some plot development that will never come. the chief investigator has a gut feeling who did away with the missing marine officer (guy), and few people other than uninvolved bystanders and the accusee seem to dispute her. so what is the point of staying with this drama? beats the heck out of me. i kept thinking (or hoping) there would be some sort of plot twist or new revelation, but none was forthcoming. in summary, i cannot think of a single reason to sit and watch this pointless tv movie, based on a true story or not.
