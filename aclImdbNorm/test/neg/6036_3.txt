the white warrior is definitely one of,if not steve reeves weakest films. set in 18th or 19th century russia (??) steve plays a cossack warrior who tries to over run a mad man russian czar by running up a mountain side with his rebel band in a goofy looking russian white tunic..... for the most part the great reeves physique is hidden in a goofy, knee length tunic, with an even more sillier looking russian hat.<br /><br />the action is rather minimal, with only a good wrestling scene from the mid waist up that shows off the great reeves physique. this is an apparent attempt by the producers to move reeves out of the sword and sandal genre into another historic era, with poor results. the dialogue from the script is hard to understand at various points, and only commentary from the narrator allows the viewer to understand what is really happening from scene to scene. i would image reeves regretted making this film, but in an attempt to try and get out of his toga and sandals and tribune armor it helped launch him to other historic characters such as morgan the pirate and the thief of baghdad.
