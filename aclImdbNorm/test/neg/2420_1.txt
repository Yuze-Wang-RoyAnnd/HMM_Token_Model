awful film. terrible acting, cheesy, totally unrealistic, embarrassing to anyone who has played the game. for a start that guy is not a hooker, he would be snapped in two. as for ''i score, that's my job'' well no it's not. for the the uneducated american audience it might come across as a good film. for me, well, that's a few hours of my life i'll never get back. i read through the reviews and came across one where the guy sounded like he knew what he was talking about. then i read - <br /><br />''and while american rugby may never reach the level of talent that new zealand or south africa has, third in the world is also nothing to hang your head about''<br /><br />all i can say is, lmfao! <br /><br />keep playing your american football and baseball, leave the real sports to the big boys.
