i'm sorry, perhaps this is part of the wave of praise for fireman since 911, perhaps it's an old fashioned story, perhaps it's not meant to knock your socks off but i'm sorry, this film is awful. as in the title, clich'e 49, i think it has at least that many clich'es. it's a dreary story (impressive managing to be dreary when there's dangerous fires and lives being saved) about a fireman. and his dreary life, told in a pointless, 'scene from now' flashback to the past style. we begin the film with the hero in peril in a collapsing burning building. the entire film is about trying to get us to love this guy so we squeeze a few tears out when he meets his end in the finale of the scene from the start of the film. i found it hard to care and wished he'd gone up in smoke earlier. clich'es abound such as - death of best friend, love at first site, hazing in a new job, firstborn, a worried wife with a husband with a perilous job, a father figure boss/superior, 2.4 kids (well 2 but close enough), sacrificing your life to save others, awards for bravery....on and on. it's every fireman's life, every police officer, nurse, doctor in some way. it was lazy, if it was meant as a 'life flashing before his eyes' as he died, then god help the poor chap, i'm surprised he didn't suck in more smoke to go quicker. the flashbacks are mostly mundane and predictable, dully acted and with a soundtrack that could put the laughing cow out of business it was so cheesy, it actually sounded like muzak or copyright free elevator stuff!!! to be avoided at all costs unless you need something to watch with granny of a sunday evening. or maybe if your related to a firefighter - warning - your life will end horribly or you will be scarred for life if you are a brave fireman according to this movie. unless your john travolta (strange velcro style hair in this one!!)
