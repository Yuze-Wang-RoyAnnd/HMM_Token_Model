awful, waste of time. there is no camp or trash value in this one. seen better amateur movies done by 10 to 12 years old kids in movie clubs.<br /><br />how on earth someone can spoil movie about vampires and lesbians? <br /><br />it's not a movie to put together a few vampire / sadomasochism enthusiast in a same room and just shoot it.<br /><br />could not find anything good about the film. there was no plot, no real actors, no real special effects, no humor. a few overweight goths touching each other cannot be called a sex scene. nothing at all.<br /><br />well, cemetery was nice but one should shot a vampire movie during dark. <br /><br />purpose was probably good: make a trash movie in a spirit of ed wood. problem is that one cannot make a bad movie intentionally. it takes talent and an effort to make a "real" movie. ed wood might have lacked money but he sure had effort. these guys lacked everything. ed wood was a genius compared to these guys.
