i won't spoil it for you. although you probably could care less if it was spoiled (you'll know what i mean after you watch it) poor story. b-rated movie quality. typical horror -stupid situations- rare timing. i should of known, when they try to push a lot of hype in their advertising or even add "quotes". just tells me that the movie bombed big time. and they are trying to pull in everyone just so they can break even with to cost of making this bomb. i wish i could take back the time i spent watching this. i was stupid and thought that there just had to be something great around the corner. but i kept getting let down. i don't usually waste my time adding comments to any movie. in fact, this is my second post. i just felt maybe i could spare a few of you from wasting money on something that had a bunch of hype on it.
