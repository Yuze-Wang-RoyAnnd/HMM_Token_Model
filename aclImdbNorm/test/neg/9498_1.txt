except for the glossy look, this show had little to recommend it. the writing was patronizing and convoluted. without exception the characters were shallow and unsympathetic. the female characters came off the worst... reduced to spoiled, selfish airheads whose soul ambition was to run around in slip dresses and stilettos, and try to bag a man. this aspect of the show is all the more curious as the series was produced by two women! the acting for the most part was dull and humourless with the cast playing one dimensional characters attacking every scene on the same note. this is not entirely the actors fault. had they spent more time developing the characters and the storyline, adding a little injection of style and humour, mvp might have been a hit. what we're left with is something flat and vaguely unpleasant.
