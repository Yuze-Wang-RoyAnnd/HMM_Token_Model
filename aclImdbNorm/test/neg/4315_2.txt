this is total swill. if you take the devil's rejects and suck all the good out of it, and add a lot of twisted, kinky bondage parts, a few rape scenes, and like one or two sincerely horrifying scenes, and you'd get this movie. people are calling this a ripoff of '86's the hitcher, but i don't see that at all. even the worst hitcher ripoffs are still better than this. the main problem on display here is that there's really nothing here besides a few of the director's fetishes being showcased like circus exhibits. is all you need out of a movie shots of girls being abused and tied up, cowering in fear? well, then rent this movie!<br /><br />however, i'd rather just watch a good movie, which this is clearly not. the sad thing is, there are some really good thrills waiting to be uncovered here, but only a few. for instance, the suspense at the beginning before the bondage nonsense started...pretty damn good if you ask me. and the scene where the hitchhiker kills the nympho girl (can't remember names) is chilling, very brutal in a way, challenging even the devil's rejects for unbridled fury. how come the rest of the movie can't be that good? huh? i really need to stop renting stupid crap like this. closing message: just let this gutter trash die and forget it forever. not recommended.
