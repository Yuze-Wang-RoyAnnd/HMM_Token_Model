sometimes i wonder if today's horror movies rely on human torturing to make people scared. if so, then there's a sad future for horror movies. dee snyder tries to make you feel scared and terrified, this movie does exactly this but not in a good way. now there are some moments in the film where that there is a chance that snyder is saving this film from falling into a hole but let's be frank, this movie didn't fall into a hole, it was already in a hole and synder makes no attempt whatsoever to bring itself out of it. when you finish watching this movie, you are left sick, depressed, dirty, and insane. i have a feeling that was the intention of this movie. what is lower than dirt?
