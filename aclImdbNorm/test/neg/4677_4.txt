file this one in the `how do movies like this get made?' column. a seventies-drag indie version of `macbeth,' adapted fairly faithfully (but pointlessly) in a conventionally unconventional black-comic style. the cast gives it a shot, with christopher walken phoning in the eccentricity as mcduff, and with maura tierney rising above the dull script as pat mcbeth. the other actors are wasted, as is the audience's time. knee-jerk fans of this brand of quirk may like it, though. 4 out of 10.
