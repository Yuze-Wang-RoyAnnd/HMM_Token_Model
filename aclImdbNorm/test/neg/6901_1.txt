i went to see this by myself first to make sure it was suitable for my little boy to see.<br /><br />thank goodness i did because i certainly would not allow any young child to see this. why? the violence, death, the funeral. if you are not ready to explain these concepts to your kids then keep them away.<br /><br />why on earth are these topics covered in a kids movie - especially one that has a tag line of "the original party animals". might as well put a gangland execution in a hello kitty cartoon.<br /><br />as for laughs there were very few and far between. speaking for myself there were none. the cows looked remarkably similar to the cows in the the far side comics. i guess there isn't anything original about this movie apart from the addition of ridiculous violence and antisocial activities for all the young kids to enjoy.
