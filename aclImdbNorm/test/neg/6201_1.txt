i didn't know what to expect when i started watching this movie, by the end of it i was pulling my hairs out. this was one of the most pathetic movies of this year...in fact, in the last ten years. david dhawan should just give up his career as a director. i am yet to come across one original script that david dhawan has worked on. this one was a complete bit y bit rip off hitch. i have nothing against remakes as such, but this one is just so lousy that it makes you even hate the original one (which was pretty decent). i fail to understand what actors like salman and govinda saw in this script. i read somewhere, that this was supposed to be govinda's comeback vehicle. if thats true, then only god can save his career. salman just overacted to the hilt. govinda who i think is an actor of very high caliber was completely wasted. katrina kaif and lara dutta had nothing to do apart form wearing designer clothes and smiling for no rhyme or reason. please stay away form this one!
