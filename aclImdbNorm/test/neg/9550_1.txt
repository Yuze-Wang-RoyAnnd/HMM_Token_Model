spoiler alert<br /><br />a clich'e-riddled film that somehow makes an anti-death with dignity statement, though it attempts to do the opposite. washington is a paralyzed forensics officer who has been suffering and wanting to die for the past four years (apparently he wrote his huge selling book only a year ago though, so it hasn't all be despair). he arranges for an assisted suicide with his doctor who will return in a week.<br /><br />in the meantime, he helps out on a serial killer case. he recruits the gutsy, i don't wanna do it, but i'm just so good at it, cop jolie, and they track down impossible clue jumping to highly unlikely conclusions in matters of moments. hey, that old bolt means that the killer has the millionaire's wife in a steam tunnel by the old woolworth building. shyeah, right. it's laughable. yet no is smart enough to figure out that doctor who's going to assist him is the killer.<br /><br />when he comes to washington to murder him (ahead of schedule), he has a change of heart and struggles unbelievably for his life. cut to the obligatory bad guy about to shoot the good guy scene when bang the gun goes off--- but the bad guy didn't fire! no the woman steps out of the corner, she has just shot him in the back.
