george zucco was like boris karloff in the fact no matter how poor the film he appeared in was, he would always maintain a sense of dignity and turn in a fine performance. "the mad monster" is no exception to that rule. it is by all standards a poor (if entertaining) film. the filmmakers obviously didn't know how to make the most of their low budget and the script seems as if it was turned out in one or two days. still, zucco is fine and believable as the mad scientist.<br /><br />the film itself is enjoyable on a camp level. normal horror movie fans for the most part won't take a liking to prc films. however, these "poverty row" productions have a small but loyal cult following. occasionally they would rise above their limitations with "detour" being the best example of this. usually they looked like this. for all its technically poor qualities, "the mad monster" is an amusing enough way to kill a rainy afternoon. the dvd from retromedia is recommended, as it pairs this with another prc production "the black raven", the original theatrical trailer, and best of all an interview with glenn strange talking about his role in this movie. (4/10)
