i'm a huge fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic attempt at one. i find the best features of zombie flicks to be the sense of solidarity and a need to survive. this movie focused more on a "let's just make it gory" view.<br /><br />the movie was full of bad acting and even worse special effects. when the zombies emerge from the floor and take the guy down, there is blood just spraying out of the hole. i wasn't aware that holes in airplane floors bleed so extensively. and the original zombie lady, kelly or something, displayed the worst acting i have ever seen when she woke up and began feeling sick. i laughed quite hard when she died. deserved it in every way.<br /><br />i was a little confused as to why dr. kelly could talk after becoming a zombie, but then there wasn't anything uttered by another zombie because annoying screams and shrieks. and they seemed to be killing the zombies pretty efficiently by shooting them in the abdomen, yet when dr. bennett is expelled from the airplane and into the engine, removing most of his lower half, he is still able to live at the end.<br /><br />i kinda felt that they altered things to make a "good" scene. when one of the bitchy girlfriends (i didn't take the time to learn their names. they played a pointless role) was in the bathroom, she was attacked by a zombie behind the mirror. was it a two-way mirror to watch mile-high clubbers? i've never broken a mirror on an airplane (bad luck and all that) but i doubt there is that much room behind there, with the insanely confined space of the actually bathroom and all.<br /><br />the few redeeming qualities were too little too late, sadly. one thing the movie had going for it was the smoking hot flight attendants, yet they felt the need to kill all but one off. and i will admit that i laughed pretty damn hard when the old lady chomps down on frank's arm and he says "she's gumming me to death" or something to that degree.<br /><br />honestly, i'm sad i wasted my nine dollars on this movie. the fact that i bought it underage kinda redeems that but still... it failed on so many levels. stick with dawn of the dead and 28 days later.
