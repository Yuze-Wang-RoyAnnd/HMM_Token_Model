when me and my gf went to see this film, we didn't know what to expect, however she assured me that it had good reviews. so i went along with it. we got into the cinema and bought tickets and went into the screen. after a while of sitting there waiting for the film to start no one else walked through the door. i was very suspicious as you usually get at least a couple of more people in any film screening. the film began eventually and we sat there. after a while of very little dialogue and very "arty" type moody scenes i was starting to realise why we were the only people there. it was disjointed with random cuts from the main story to kids in a skate park, the story it's self made no sense. the kid was meant to have committed a crime when he didn't and if he did, writing a letter to no one is not an answer and you shouldn't feel not guilty just because you wrote that letter, he should have been punished. there was no point to this film at all. i have no idea why we didn't go and get our money back part of the way through the film. i tried to give it a chance i guess. there was little concept to this film, and the execution was disgraceful. the writer and director and just about everyone else who made this film should have realised what they were doing and stopped. it is an hour plus that i will never ever ever get back. i'm sorry to anyone who liked this film, but...it's just so so awful, i mean really really really bad. oh well at least i never have to be subjected to it again.
