did the other reviewers watch the same movie i did? this was poorly written, poorly acted, and just overall boring. i made it well past the halfway point in the movie and then just gave up. i can't possibly imagine an ending that would have made the rest of the movie worthwhile. don't waste your time with this dog. seriously.
