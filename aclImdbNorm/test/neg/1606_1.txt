the horror of this made for tv film was that it didn't end with this one. it spawned a regular weekly series that was even worse than the pilot/movie. most films about various professions have some type of realism to them and of course are jazzed up to make it exciting. this had none of that. if the intent was to make in "camp" then it succeeded. it resurfaced on cable a couple of years ago and failed again. richard jaeckels performance as the master chief who does it all was the only redeeming part of this film. campier than the batman series of the 60's.
