not me.. if it came down to it, i could kick a dog's ass, and that's why this movie doesn't work for me. if it was me against the alien, or jason.. or.. hell, i dunno.. any other horror movie antagonist, then there'd be no contest and i'd have my ass handed to me barring divine intervention. a horror movie works because it puts people in a situation with a creature, person, being, entity, whatever, that is more powerful or resourceful or intelligent than they are, and then people think 'well what if that happened to me', and they get scared - and that's why this is a horrible idea for a story. i can't imagine myself being terrorized by a dog, so i'm not scared.
