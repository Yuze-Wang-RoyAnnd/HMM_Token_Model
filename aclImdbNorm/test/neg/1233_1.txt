i just watched lonesome dove, return to lonesome dove, streets of laredo and dead man's walk. all excellent. this sorry hunk of junk is cheaply done and poorly acted.<br /><br />in the previous series, captain call and gus mccrae come off as tough respectable cowboys. despite the fact that caption call is played by a different actor every time each one quickly won me over. in dead man's walk the boys are believable as the younger versions of the experienced texas rangers. in comanche moon they are just a couple of chubby rednecks. i had to stop watching.<br /><br />i suspect many of the glowing reviews for this show were written by the people who made this stinking pile. it's a sorry end to an otherwise great franchise.
