this movie was so dumb and slow was it ever slow. the only good part of the film was the girl in the tight shinny gold pants. there was no gore whatsover and what is a 80's horror movie without a little gore. plus the killer wasn't at all scary nor were the murders. but if you like to watch the world's worst horror movie then this is for you. don't waste your time like i did watching this.
