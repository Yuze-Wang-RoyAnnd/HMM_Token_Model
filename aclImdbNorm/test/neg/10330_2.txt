sandra bullock is my favorite actress..... but this movie was so horrible, i couldn't help but chuckle throughout the movie in disbelief that i was actually watching something so crappy. ha ha. the audio editing is horrible, they try too hard to come up with creative camera angles. because they're just weird and stupid. the script sucked. acting was horrible, storyline not very good. very unrealistic, even for a movie. but it is a 20 year old movie..... so i'll give it a bonus point for that. and yeah, the music was terrible. but we all got to start somewhere. and submitting these things is such a hassle..... 10 line minimum... bother. well now i know why i couldn't find this movie in the movie store.... i had to purchase it offline to see it... good thing it was only $.58 cents.... even though shipping was $2.59. oh well.... i don't recommend anyone wasting their time and money seeing this film...
