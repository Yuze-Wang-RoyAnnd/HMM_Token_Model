i agree with most of the critics above. more yet, i was shocked by the presentation of the love scenes with the homosexual couple. why? because while they --the director, the producers?-- didn't have any compulsion whatsoever in presenting the different heterosexual couples in the most passionate embraces including nudity and super close-ups of french kissing and all sorts of nude contortions in bed, completely unnecessary in their length and in the story, when the moment came to show the same experiences with the homosexual couple, they only dare to go as far as an excruciatingly painful hug, almost among scholarly giggles, with two very nervous actors. so, in reality, the makers of this film found homosexuality to be unnatural, as one of the characters says in some scene. what a difference with the spanish cinema!! i remember being at the projection of an almodovar film in an italian cinema in rome, and being completely amazed at the total lack of reaction from the italian audience, they were afraid to have a reaction!! when in spain people would fall down from their seats laughing at all the risqu`e situations and fabulous almodovar wit and flair. obviously in italy there are dark forces in its history that impedes the free manifestation of some very normal and natural emotions. pity. i must add that i was quite surprised to find that this same comment was censured by another correspondent. it's very bad and dangerous when we cannot be allowed by the narrowness of others to express our opinions about certain matters. where is freedom of speech? i don't know if that censor will approve of the changes i was forced to make in this comment, and i hope he won't receive the same treatment from some other narrow minded judge. pity again.
