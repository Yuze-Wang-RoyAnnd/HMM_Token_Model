this is unique in films of hitchcock's that i've seen, in that i didn't really enjoy it.<br /><br />in fact, i actually found this quite predictable and annoying.<br /><br />cary grant and joan fontaine are a newly married couple. he's the kind of "lovable rogue" character that you've seen in many films, without ever being lovable as far as i am concerned!<br /><br />in fact, it was a barely believable relationship at best, and at times seemed particularly false and implausible.<br /><br />unable to hold down a job and trying to live an opulent lifestyle, grant is led to borrow money that he cannot pay back.<br /><br />fontaine is convinced that he is trying to kill her in order to get the money she is insured for; and presumably what her late father was worth.<br /><br />average and rather uninteresting all round actually, but as usual you can see the influence on films that have come at a later date.
