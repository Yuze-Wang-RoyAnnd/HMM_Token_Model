i love low budget movies. including those that are intentionally or un-intentionally funny,excess fake gore,violence etc.<br /><br />this,however is beyond stupid. once you see the ending you'll say,what the hell was the point of all the killing scenes with no one around(except in a couple) to witness them.and how did the ending actually come about(i won't give the whole story away for those dumb enough to actually watch this) granny is like a psychic jason. first she's outside the window with a body and 15 seconds later she's in the living room knitting. the whole thing is a setup for a newcomer. they pull off graphic kill scenes,the knitting needles in the eyes,that only chris angel mind freak could pull off. and again,the very end was pre-posterous. 56 min waste of time. i've seen one of the directors other films and it was almost as bad. give me 20 grand and i could do better. this really deserves a big fat 0.
