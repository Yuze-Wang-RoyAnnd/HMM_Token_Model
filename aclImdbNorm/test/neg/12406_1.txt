the direction by wong is perhaps the all time worst in film history i've ever seen. this film makes my all time worst film of 2000, dungeons and dragons by courtney soloman looked like an oscar winner. the flaws in this movie is beyond explanation. the biggest one is the lack of depth. every scene does not develop fully as if the editing room doesn't know how to do their job correctly. its a shame that with such an all-star cast of talents and a famous popular traditional story can be destroyed by this lack of vision.<br /><br />i am so disgusted and hope that some great director like john woo or ang lee, decide to remake this film and do some justice. i'm not even sure if i can rate 0/10??
