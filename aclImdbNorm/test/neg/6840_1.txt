amidst all the many problems that make this a dire piece of celluloid is the stupidest plot device in recent cinema history. richard gere determines who the jackal's real target is through some form of revelation. he does not work anything out, it just comes to him. when in doubt "he's going after the first lady!". this film blows chunks.
