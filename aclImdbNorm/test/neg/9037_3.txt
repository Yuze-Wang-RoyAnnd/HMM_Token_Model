another movie that makes the story of the beach boys worse than it is. i especially remember the scene when brian says he's to quit touring and the other boys calls him traitor. i didn't happen like that, and like the movie indicates in the beginning is that some scenes are over-reacted. a movie about the beach boys doesn't have to be that way because a lot of things happened anyway. the sad thing is that this movie gives the wrong picture about the boys to those who ain't so familiar with the group. hard-core fans like myself knew that this isn't the entire true story and that's why i gave it a low rating 3. however it is the best movie about the beach boys i've seen so far, that says quite a bit about the other movies. if you want the truth i recommend the documentary endless harmony.
