first off, i refuse to even consider this piece of work a music video... i consider it a short film that uses excerpts of the song "thriller" in its soundtrack. to me a music video must be no longer than the song itself, and the song must play the entire length of the video. calling this a music video is like calling the great gatsby a poem. on top of this... let's face it... "thriller" is a boring 14 minutes, including the extremely dated werewolf transformation, the mindless vincent price poem (just because vp recites it doesn't mean it's not lame), and the least threatening zombies i have ever seen. sure, this was certainly a cultural phenomenon, but don't forget, this also happened at the same time the a-team was the #1 show on tv, so lets not give the culture too much credit on that one... one last point on this film's impact on the media on music videos... what exactly did this add to the equation that "billie jean" and "beat it" didn't already add? from what i can tell, it only added the practice of stopping the song for some dialog, or a superfluous dance scene... so you could say that all this video really did was give puffy the inspiration to make more annoying music videos... not quite my definition of great
