okay, if you discount the production value, the ugly outfits, and the big hair, this adaptation is still far inferior to the 90's version. first ann firbank (playing anne elliot), is literally ten years too old to play this role and her acting leaves much to be desired. amanda root (playing the same role in the 90's version) can express more in her big, brown eyes than firbank can with her entire face in a four hour production. anne is turned into a peevish, whining, boring character (and what was with the scene during the `long walk' where she stops to spout off poetry?). henrietta and louisa looked so much alike that the only time i could tell them apart was when they stood next to each other (henrietta was taller). and louisa! never was there a more obnoxious character! it was ridiculous to think that wentworth was supposed to be interested in her. she is supposed to be high spirited and pretty and charming, not stupid and silly with her ridiculous laugh that's like nails on a chalkboard. when she starts to chant, `to lyme, to lyme, to lyme,' i started yelling, `shut up, shut up, shut up!' the best part of the movie was when louisa falls those three feet at the cobb because i knew i wouldn't have to see her anymore in the movie. speaking of the fall at the cobb scene; it was the mose poorly acted, badly directed and edited scene of the entire film. how does a person fall three feet down, land on her feet, and still be knocked unconscious?<br /><br />on the plus size, the character of elizabeth was much closer to the book than in the 90's version. they also put in many more scenes with anne and frederick at the end.<br /><br />i'll admit, i have bought this movie, even though i knew how sub par it was, but i'm a huge austen fan, so i'll buy any movie adapted from one of her novels. watch this move if you're morbidly curious, or to appreciate the 90's version even more.<br /><br />the bottom line is, this version may follow the letter of the novel, but the 90's version follows the spirit.
