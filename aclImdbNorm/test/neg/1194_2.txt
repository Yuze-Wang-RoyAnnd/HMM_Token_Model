i watched this film in the theater in edinbourgh along with 3 other americans and our friend from manchester and we all thought this was a waste of time. we would have much rather spent an extra hour to watch vapid dialog of star wars iii that was playing down the hall than all of this. <br /><br />opening with one of the worst jokes i've ever seen committed to celluloid on the big screen, it did not take off with a bang. throughout the movie we got the feeling that the jokes were just trying too hard, the writers thought about the setup so much that you could see the joke coming 2 minutes beforehand, then when it came it was so lackluster that you couldn't even smile; i cite the giraffe cum-ming as a prime example. <br /><br />the plot itself makes for some interesting thoughts in my mind, which entertained me much more than what was going on on the screen. i think a lot more could have been done with that angle (the two different worlds, the fish-out-of-water experience of the characters, the confusion and surprise as people try to comprehend and distinguish the characters and writers from each other.) but too much time is wasted with pushing this painful plot to the end with as much 'bizarre' and 'goof' as is humanly possible. <br /><br />and to say the 16th century characters show any extra talent from the writers is an insult to intelligent writers and editors who possibly could have made this film a worthy 40 minute afterthought; but no, its a full length torture film of unfunniness. <br /><br />as we were leaving the theater, which had very little laughing inside it, i overheard the young hip electro-clash british couple behind me saying "that was rather good wasn't it. you never really knew what was coming next." and the girl responding "yeah, quite surprising." and that was it. if this is what is meant to get out of british people from watching a comedy: no laughing for 90 minutes but a teeny bit of communication between two lovers at the end, then this film succeeded. but i have more belief in british life than that.<br /><br />i've not not-laughed so hard at a comedy film since american pie ii.
