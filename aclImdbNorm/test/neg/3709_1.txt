zero stars out of ****<br /><br />endless descent has absolutely no redeeming values, whether it's the ridiculously bad acting, the laughably awful special effects, the incompetent direction, the stupid script, or the gratingly annoying musical score. it's the kind of pitiful production that makes me wonder how a movie like this could even have the slightest consideration for being greenlighted by a studio in the first place.<br /><br />i don't think i'm going to delve into the plot other than to say it's about a bunch of people who are trapped under the water and have to kill a lot of fake-looking creatures.<br /><br />let me go more into detail as to what is so awful about this flick. first of all, the acting is simply horrendous. jack scalia is ten times worse than sylvester stallone, a feat that is hard enough to accomplish as it is. the supporting performances aren't really any better. and what is with actor luis lorenzo, the guy who plays the cook, francisco. he has a high-pitched voice and an accent that sounds appropriate for a comedy, not a sci-fi horror film.<br /><br />the special effects are even worse. the creatures range from weird-looking eels to giant starfish and "mostquitoes." the effects look like something you would see in a muppet movie, and i don't believe i need to delve further in this issue.<br /><br />director j.p. simon has slight cult status because of all the terrible films he's made. i'm sure some will enjoy endless descent in an ed wood type of way, but i don't even think it's that good. everything he does is shoddy, especially the camerawork. the man cannot direct a movie, that's all there is to it.<br /><br />this was the last of four films that took place underwater, and it sure does make leviathan and deep star six (both bad films in their own right) start to look masterful in comparison. either way, just stick with the abyss.
