i won't lie, i rented this film because it was an "arty" film with some possible explicit sex. i got that scene and catherine deneuve's (briefly shown) breasts, but the rest of the film is just the usual long pretentious european art films with lines like "did i have a mother or father, i don't know" (paraphrased). usually delivered in long soliloquies.<br /><br />if you are curious about the transition of "art" to porn, might be an interesting look, with use of the fast forward button (i was still too slow!)
