i bought this film from e-bay as part of a lot of about twenty horror flicks, all about a dollar a piece. when watching this, my first impression was that it probably was from the late 80s. later on i began thinking - the linkin park posters on the wall and everything else seemed to hint that i was dealing with a more recent film. realizing that, the flick became an unbearable torment. the last 3 minutes were the longest in the movie history - the film just refused to end. is there a genre such as "horror for children"? in that case this film is definitely it. if there are parents, perverse enough to want to introduce their offspring to horror, i suggest this would be perfect for kids of about 6-8. the only thing i really liked was greg cipes who was much too good an actor for that kind of nostalgic retro bottom part of a drive-in double-bill.
