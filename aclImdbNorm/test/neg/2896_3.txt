i'm also a sf buff, among other genres, and i especially like those films from 60's and 70's with their "ideas over effects" premise that produced so many intelligent and likable stories put on screen. in a nutshell i completely agree with scott-886's review of this movie. i heard of this film, and being what i previously mentioned, a 60's and 70's sf buff, with a penchant for sf stories with touch of the "twilight zone", i expected a lot, and my expectations were heightened with reviews ranking the effects of this movie "second best" to kubrick's "2001 space odyssey". what a fraud. "journey to the far side of the sun", was ordinary, convoluted, half baked, silly looking film, with laughable amateur special effects (and remember i love films from that era and despise cgi), and it can be fully compared more to 60's sf disasters such as "marooned", which "journey" very much reminded me of. the idea behind it all is not that bad, but building the plot on a story of a twin planet to earth, on which the same world is inverted, asked for a master like kubrick to direct. needles to say robert parish is nothing like that, so he delivered boring and silly movie, that looked and felt like a matin'ee tv series of those days. not worth wasting your time on, even if you are an absolute fan of the genre.
