no words can describe how awful this film is. its like the director literally took a s*** in a roll of film and sent it out to the viewing public.<br /><br />the acting in this movie is horrendous, the plot is so dumb, and the deaths of each character is laughably bad. some stupid scenes include akshay kumar pulling a gun out of nowhere to kill a hologram (yes a hologram), akshay kumar carrying a bazooka around the town, rajat bedi getting beaten up by a poorly animated skeleton, rajat bedi and siddharth double penetrating monisha korella (how did they think this was straight?). also i'd like to point out that the animations are absolutely terrible. the scene that supports this statement is when kapal has the motorbike and somehow gains the glasses. the shopping job looks like it was done in microsoft paint.<br /><br />the best parts in this movie are with sunny deol. this man is so strong that he makes even god feel scared. in one scene, he literally breaks open a jail door by kicking it. chuck norris' round-house has nothing on that! he is even so powerful, that he can fly from london to india in a matter of 10 minutes! overall, this movie is perhaps the most poorly made movie in the universe. if you were to watch it, watch it for the hilarity that ensues throughout (btw this movie is supposed to be serious)
