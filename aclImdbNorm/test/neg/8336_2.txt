a horrible mish mash of predictable story lines and toe-bendingly poor delivered pc clich'es ad nauseam (races working together, the heroine being smart as well pretty, a guy sacrificing himself to save another life, a father/daughter relationship etc etc etc). the movie looks like something created for network television and should have probably stayed there. even the gifted tommy lee jones does not manage to salvage this bomb. i urge you not to waste money or time on this cinematic ruin from the time when disaster-movies roamed hollywood.<br /><br />the two stars are given solely to the cgi-people and the pr-peoples' ability to get even one movie-goer to sit through it.
