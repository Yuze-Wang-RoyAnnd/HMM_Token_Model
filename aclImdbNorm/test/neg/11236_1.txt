i had to watch this movie for a film class, i suffered the whole time through. i am not asian but was still greatly offended by this film. the film's basis is racialism, overall minorities (rex harrison isn't even asian!) are depicted in narrow-minded manner. the banning of the film in thailand illustrates the degree inaccuracy and subjective portrayal of asians. in addition, there has been critical attention given to biography of anna. many critics argue that anna added many fictitious events to her story to project herself in a good manner. some critics of the film and biography have even stated that anna made up the whole story. an awful film but good for discussion of biopics as form of meta-narrative fiction rather than a work of non-fiction.
