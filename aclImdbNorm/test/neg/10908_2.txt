another first: this french movie is my introduction to the world eric rohmer. perhaps i'm a bit hasty when i say that this is probably my last rohmer movie but i was immediately turned off by the way rohmer relies on monotonous philosophical conversations that never get to the point. there is a scene in the movie where the characters discuss love that i thought was never going to end. honestly, no matter how much i tried, i couldn't understand why rohmer is so highly regarded among cinephiles. he struck me as being one of those obnoxiously petulant people who are filled with hot air. if this is a sample of what his movies are about, i'm not interested. i don't care much for french cinema (usually reflective and speculative to a fault), so maybe i'm biased.
