the only reason i gave this movie a 2 and not a 1 was because for some reason i felt compelled to finish it out! basically, i wanted to see if there were going to be any aliens, any ufo's, anything at all suggested by the title of the movie, the cover of the movie and the beginning of the movie! i was very disappointed to see religion being thrown into the mix the way that it was. this could have been used to the movie's advantage, but i felt, instead, that the movie was trying to send subliminal messages to me! finally, how big was this cast's wardrobe!? i became so distracted by the number of different, and extremely bright, shirts each character had on in every new scene that i began to wonder if this movie wasn't really supposed to be classified under "poor comedy".<br /><br />toe thumbs down!
