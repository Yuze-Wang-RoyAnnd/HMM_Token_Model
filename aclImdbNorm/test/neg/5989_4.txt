the best thing about shrieker is the dialogue. like scream and i know what you did last summer, this movie is cognizant of the conventions of this type of horror movie and manages to come up with a few good lines and scenes that play on those conventions. unfortunately, shrieker is just boring. the plot is your basic ten little indians whodunnit with a monster controlled by one of the suspects/victims. you know from the beginning that each of the characters will get bumped off until only the hero(ine) is left to defeat the evil. and this is exactly what happens. absolutely no surprises and no tension. production values and acting were ok, but i had no motivation to watch to the end (although i did) because i already knew how the end scene would play out. the ending did surprise me a bit, because it managed to fizzle out, literally, instead of throwing out a bucket of special effects. maybe the special effects budget had been spent up by the end.
