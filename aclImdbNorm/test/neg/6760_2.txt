this movie is standard goofy sci-fi fare from the 50s. in its favor, the plot does manage to pull off an alien invasion without actually producing the aliens themselves. but come on now, if aliens needed energy and could absorb it from sources like hydrogen bombs, why would they come to earth? why wouldn't they just suck it out of a star!?!? the only credible reason for the presence of kronos is a direct attack on earth society, not the mere collection of energy. nothing like that is even intimated; kronos may have been built by a superior race but its activities on earth are the most primitive. the end that the scientist-heroes plan for kronos is based on nothing but pseudo-scientific gibberish. it amounts to the "reverse the polarity" gambit which has been used so much in bad scifi it has become a joke in itself. low and behold, this causes our unwanted visitor to release its collected energy. no one in power seems to care about the impact the release of that much energy (which by the film's end includes, among other things, the entire yield of a hydrogen bomb) will have on the surroundings. and unfortunately, by the time the movie ends, the surroundings are the suburbs of los angeles. whoops!
