like the previous two 'mad max' films, 'mad max beyond thunderdome' is not exception to the violence and strange plot. mad max is in a post-war society where he must destroy master blaster and get the children to 'tomorrow morrow land'. this is generally a warped film with peter pan references and tina turner, methane-pigs, and odd characters. i got very bored by watching it all, and it offered nothing to me. i did not feel inspired after watching this film; the only decent thing about this film were the extremely-odd characters that got picked off in various ways throughout the film. it's too weird for me, and it was much too dull.
