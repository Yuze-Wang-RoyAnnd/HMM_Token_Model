there have been many movies, on living the american dream. and this is one of them.<br /><br />first of all, on the technical side, there is a lot wrong. the audio is bad, i had trouble understanding the dialogs here and there, and the camera positions could have been better.<br /><br />they really tried to come up with a good movie, but for example the part where they show, how jonathan is loosing himself in the dream,with girls, drugs and alcohol, is done very badly. the acting is very poor as well from all the characters in the movie.<br /><br />i had a hard time watching it from the beginning till end, and couldn't wait for the movie to be over.<br /><br />if your expectations are low, and you're bored on a sunday with bad weather, watch it. if you in for a deep story with action, then this is not your movie.<br /><br />normally i would not have give a score of 1, but of 4.5 for this movie. but the reason i gave it a 1 is because of the bad audio, and camera uses, not to mention the bad cut scenes with cheesy effects.
