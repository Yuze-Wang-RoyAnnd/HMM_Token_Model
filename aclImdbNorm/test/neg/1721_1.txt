oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. my lifetime was drastically wasted by this pile of stink. i would rather chew off my arm than watch this film again. painful story line, painful characters and a painful two hours.<br /><br />the best way of describing this movie is a follows:- i would rather stick pins in my eyes and cut out my brain than watch another minute of this tripe.<br /><br />advice is to stay well clear and let your local dustman do you a favour of removing this rubbish.<br /><br />lin, you told me this was good!!!!<br /><br />goodaleebyeload.
