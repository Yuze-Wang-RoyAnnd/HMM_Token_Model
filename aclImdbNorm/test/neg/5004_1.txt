this movie was total cheese. it stank. the only thing good about it was the acting. other then that, nothing noteworthy at all.<br /><br />big time spoilers coming up! don't read anymore if you have not seen it!<br /><br />this movie is centered around a family whose happy and wonderful lives have been shattered as a result of their younger son and later as they find out older son have been molested by their daycare providers. although, they are called liars in court and the defense attorney is a real prick the jury finds them guilty and convicts them.<br /><br />in the end all i can say to the director is: "the next time you wanna make a movie like this, do it differently".
