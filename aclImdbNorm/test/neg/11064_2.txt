when i sat down to watch this movie i thought that it might be slightly good. but no. it was a ok film, not good, but not bad for most of it but then you get to the ending and it losses all credibility. they should have just left then dead. they did not leave the last bit it did not make any sense. if they had something at they beginning about a plane crash yeah but we didn't so it didn't work. the first bit is ok and i give them credit for that but the rest is just plane bad and unnecessary if you are thinking about going and watching this movie don"t it is awful go and rent something that is actually worth watching. i give it 2/10
