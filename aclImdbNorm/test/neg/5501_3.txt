several things become apparent after the first few minutes of this film. first, the scenery and special effects are incredible -- the best, and if everything else worked as well, its austere presence might have made it a great film.<br /><br />but as soon as the actors open their mouths, you suddenly realize that you are sitting in your den watching a movie. the story itself is full of clech'e and melodrama, and the dialogue is some of the worst i've ever seen. and as if that weren't bad enough, they made a fool out of the protagonist, and in my experience, you don't want to do that unless the film is a comedy.<br /><br />bottom line: i had a hard time getting into it, and i wouldn't recommend it.
