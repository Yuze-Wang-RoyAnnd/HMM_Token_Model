uggh! hanna-barbera of the 60s and 70s! what lousy and unwatchable cartoons that were thrust upon us by these hacks! it's a shame really, as in the 1940s and 1950s "hanna-barbera" meant quality--because they produced so many wonderful tom and jerry cartoons. however, with the major cost-cutting efforts of the late 1950s, cartoons in general began to look pretty poor and budgets were slashed. in fact, william hanna and joseph barbera were fired by mgm and replaced by a team of czech animators who had never even seen the original cartoons! so, in the late 50s, the team was out of work and decided "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em"--and began producing horrid little cartoons themselves--with horrible animation, backgrounds and writing.<br /><br />it's unfortunate, but the team's production of crappy cartoons worked too well---making them rich and the most successful producers of cartoons of the 60s and 70s. during this time, again and again, bad production values was their norm and a long list of very forgettable cartoons were created. in this case, the amazingly bad inch high private eye--a completely unfunny and stupid idea. if you want to know what the show was about, the title says it all.<br /><br />rotten to the core and strong evidence that the production team had total contempt for us kids!
