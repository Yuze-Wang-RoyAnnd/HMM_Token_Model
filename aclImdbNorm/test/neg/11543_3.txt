set in the philipines, lethal panther 2 is a dreary early-90s martial-arts action flick which sees a reckless cop hunting down the nasty criminals who killed his wife. a rather cheap looking production with almost no artistic merit, this film relies on the quality and quantity of its action. but whilst there is no shortage of fisticuffs, gun fights and explosions, the quality is just not there. the endless battles are desperately lacking in originality or excitement, with poor editing and mundane direction making this film a real chore to sit through.<br /><br />the usually impressive yukari oshima is totally wasted, with her natural athletic ability overshadowed by some excruciatingly bad wire-work. the ballistic action scenes are an unimpressive mixture of 'slow-motion flying-through-the-air-whilst-shooting' heroics, crazy vehicle stunts, and endless bad guys lining up to be shot.<br /><br />with so many better examples of the 'girls and guns' genre now available on dvd, i suggest that you leave this one well alone (unless, like me, you'll endure pretty much any old rubbish in order to be a completist).
