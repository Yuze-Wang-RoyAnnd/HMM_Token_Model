randy bowers (john wayne) comes upon the half way house at just the right time to take a break from the trail, and discovers a slew of dead bodies inside, among them a man he was supposed to deliver a message to - ed rogers, proprietor of the establishment. he's observed by the dead man's niece sally (alberta vaughn), from behind a hidden room, where she remained unobserved during the carnage.<br /><br />"randy rides alone" was directed by harry fraser. he uses a filming technique here as in other of his films, where he fast forwards the action from one location to another, usually involving a rider on a horse. it's pretty well done and appears quite innovative in these 1930's era lone star westerns.<br /><br />pre-gabby george hayes is on hand, sans whiskers, and this is the first time i've seen him as a villain. in fact it took a few scenes to realize it was him in a dual role, first as hunchbacked businessman "matt the mute", communicating via pencil and paper, only to turn into marvin black, leader of a gang of outlaws. black's gang was responsible for the murders at half way house, in an attempt to coerce sally into selling out to matt/marvin. another staple player is here as well, yakima canutt as a black henchman named spike. interestingly, yakima portrayed a villain named sam black in another fraser/wayne oater, "neath the arizona skies".<br /><br />there's a fair amount of time-killing horseback riding back and forth between black's gang and the sheriff's posse, as john wayne's character maneuvers to expose the bad guys. in the end, he saves the day by securing sally rogers' thirty thousand dollars, at the expense of destroying the half way house, where he exchanges some sticks of dynamite for the loot in a safe. greedy marvin black attempts to open it with his six-shooter, and the explosion is a fitting end for the villain. in his best "aw shucks" attitude, john wayne falls under the spell of the pretty sally rogers, and alas, randy rides alone no more!
