i honestly expected more from this movie. that may have been the problem. there was not one time when the camera was still - ever. on close ups, the camera shakes, the subjects move, and i get a headache. the cuts are so often and so fast, that the viewer often finds himself/herself wondering what just happened. (look out, spoiler alert) and at the end of the movie, when you expect to have a happy ending after being put through so much useless thought to comprehend what is going on, they end up losing. to me, this was a basically terrible movie, wrecked by a camera man with adhd, and lack of a meaningful meaningful plot.
