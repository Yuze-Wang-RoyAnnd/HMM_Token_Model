this is probably the worst movie i've seen in a long time. independent or not, solid writing is a must. ditto for directing and acting. i know these actors can act (i've seen them in sporanos and more...) but this movie is very bad, very bad. maybe it's the script, maybe it's the director. probably a little of both.....probably a lot of both! technically ok, just bad, bad, bad... i have a theory that the backers for this movie also own the poker magazines, because i saw a very favorable review in one of the magazines. " hey' we made it, so it's gotta be good, right?" not so fast bucky. i know it takes a lot of hard work and money to even get a movie made, much less sold and distributed, and for that i commend these folks. but the final product, leave a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />p.s. i won a free rental and chose this movie from blockbuster. tomorrow i'm going to get my money back.
