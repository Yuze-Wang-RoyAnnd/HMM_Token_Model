this is one odd film. it seems to be aimed at a younger audience, but is filled with sexual innuendos. the whole premise is rather absurd, not just the idea of some shrunken heads of three dead kids doing some crime fighting, but the same said kids taking on a gang of tough older guys is a little far-fetched, but then again, the parents are mainly absent in the film and there is a lack of authority figures to keep the kids in line.<br /><br />the cast are good though, meg foster plays a very butch mafia-like leader, with the handsome a.j. damato as the leader of the bullies. aerky egan and rebecca herbst are well cast as the young lovers, though for a comic actress of her talent, leigh allyn baker is notoriously wasted in this film.<br /><br />overall, the film is unusual, but i don't think that is enough to make up for the poor quality and bumbling execution. the scenery is all rather dull and the "special effects" quite dismal. sit this one out, unless your in the mood.
