nico mastorakis's banned movie was quite disappointing in my opinion. the movie is about a couple, who go to a greek island to kill of all perverted people (apparently). you know you got something pretty sick when one of the first scenes include a guy having sex with a goat and then killing it off.<br /><br />but things only get worse from that point as all scenes pretty much look alike. they meet some people, so they either kill or have sex with them (preferably both).<br /><br />the ending is ok allright when the couple turn out to be brother and sister and she is just letting him rot somewhere but overall one would have expected more. no substance here i'm afraid.<br /><br />3/10.
