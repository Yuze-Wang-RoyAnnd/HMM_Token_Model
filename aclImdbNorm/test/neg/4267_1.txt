i find the critique of many imdb users a little harsh and in many cases find that they crit the movie from a very professional viewpoint and not that of the guy on the street that wants to sit and watch something just to get away from it all.<br /><br />in this case however i have to say it was bad. i am a scifi junkie and there was nothing in this movie that grabbed me for even one second.<br /><br />there was no proper storyline. i may be an idiot but i still do not know where the government was that was so worried about these pieces.<br /><br />the pathetic attempt by the main character to put together these 3 pieces is scary. half the time the two pieces were already in place and he simply had to add the third. a 3 year old kid would have been able to put them together.<br /><br />this movie was bad.<br /><br />dominic
