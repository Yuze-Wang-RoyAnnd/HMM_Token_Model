i am being in no way facetious when i say that this movie was worse than any other movie ever made. worse than "batman & robin". worse than "manos, hands of fate". seriously, it's that bad. when people tell me that a movie is terrible i use the "two girls" scale to figure it out. if the movie is comparable to "two girls" then i won't watch it. if it's twice as good, maybe i'll watch it, but only to laugh at the retards who paid somebody to make it, because a movie twice as good as this one would still be a piece of garbage.
