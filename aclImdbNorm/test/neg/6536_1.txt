so then... this is what passes as high art for the likes of sxsw film festival and sundance, eh? well, i suppose i can relate as long as story, script, dialog, acting (save for ms. aselton), cinematography and editing are completely irrelevant.<br /><br />i remember telling other film-making friends some years ago that the biggest problem with digital video was that we were now going to have to wade through a future sea of crap to get to anything worth watching now that anyone and his brother (or brothers in the case of the duplass') could run out and make a movie. "the puffy chair." need i say more?<br /><br />this feature length video is yet another chapter in the dismal, ever-expanding world of "dudeology" movies; young guns armed with a dvx100a, a few thousand dollars, a hastily written, shallow script, and some friends they call actors who decide one afternoon to make a movie and voil`a!, instant feature video-makers. don't get me wrong -- i'm all about independent cinema (i.e. hollywierd sucks). but having said that, you can't argue with some of the realities of that system. <br /><br />if the duplass brothers would've had to have gone out and raised a real budget and bring on real producers, its clear a script like this would never have been green-lighted! and therein lies the problem. there is no longer such a thing as a vetting process for getting films (sorry... videos) ready for production. just grab a dv/p2 camera and off you go! and what makes it worse is that high-profile festivals like the aforementioned actually embrace and encourage this kind of nonsense. and why? precisely because its no-budget. <br /><br />i think its important, especially in todays climate of indie films, to quit allowing video-makers to high-jack the language by labeling themselves, "filmmakers." there is quite a difference in my book. when you have to go out and actually put your script on the line, asking friends and family or business people for real money to make a feature "film", knowing the potentially losses at stake, then you will know what it means to be a "filmmaker." but dropping a few hundred at sam's club for some dv tapes, some soda and chips doesn't cut it. <br /><br />oh... and by the way... i have to mention how utterly annoying it was to listen to a female being addressed as "dude" throughout the entire movie. even mark borchardt reserves that intensely-overused moniker for his male friends only where it is at least endearing where his buddy mike is concerned!<br /><br />i think its high time the indie film community started to call out these shoddy, no-budget videos for what they are, and simultaneously scold prestigious festivals for giving such casual efforts, high praise. either that or ask these festivals to at least have the courtesy to add a new category to their festival line ups... "dude films."
