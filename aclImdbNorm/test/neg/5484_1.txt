remember when rick mercer was funny? 22 minutes was a great show when rick mercer was on it and made in canada was a great show once too. talking to americans was such a funny special too. but like my friend said "rick mercer woke up one day and wasn't funny any more" i think that day was when rick mercer report went on the air. what is the point of this show? rick mercer reads wacky fake headlines, shows pictures of bad sheds that people mail in and then spends about 20 minutes of the 30 minute show going somewhere and just talking to people hoping to say something witty or clever enough to get on tv and maybe even make somebody somewhere laugh. we're supposed to be interested in seeing rick mercer visit a gymnastics team and then try to do some of their moves, and then suck at it on purpose while trying desperately to be "funny". rick mercer got old or just lost interest or just ain't funny any more. even his classic rant bits have lost all their bite and humor. you can say that about cbc comedy in general though because how many years have they been sticking air farce on tv to deliver the same kinds of useless jokes?
