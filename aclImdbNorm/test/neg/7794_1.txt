do the writers that conjure up these type of "comedies" have such empty lives that they have to embody them in tragic shows like this?.<br /><br />why the talented and gorgeous busy phillips is amongst this trash is beyond me,i cannot stand the hispanic girl whose accent sounds very fake and is so unfunny and annoying as is the other african-american girl with the shrill voice.<br /><br />the jokes are often stupid, the jewish guy yells a lot and the show never goes anywhere, one particular episode with the solider looking for love was just terrible.<br /><br />i don't believe there would be that many working in a looking for love office and only one man? of course all of the woman are in tight fitting tops and tons of make up to make up for their lack of talent.<br /><br />i actually found holly funny in her older shows and i have always admired busy but this show is dumb, empty and had nothing going for it.
