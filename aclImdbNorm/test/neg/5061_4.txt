angel-a is a change of pace for besson; monochrome, mawkish and rather mediocre. it is well photographed on location in paris, although subtitle-readers should note: quick-fire dialogue and good cinematography may make for frustrating viewing.<br /><br />this film is no "wings of desire" or "wonderful life". despite its shared themes (heavenly intervention averts suicide, angel/mortal relationships ensue), besson does nothing to enlighten or inspire us. even the well acted, teary moments, rapidly descend into toe-curling sentimentality.<br /><br />the film's flawed ideology irritates; an angel whose message of love and respect for self is constantly undermined by her own violent and promiscuous behaviour; a "happy ending" which negates the hero's supposed journey from helplessness to self-esteem and independence.<br /><br />verdict: quite nice to look at but confused moral and philosophical messages tarnish the film precisely where it should shine. 4/10
