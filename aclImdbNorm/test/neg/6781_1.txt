one of the worst shows of all time. the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for. the fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors??? never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part. every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, "you see kids..." pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show. the stories were as unbelievable as the actors. lame would be the best way to describe it. somehow this show makes a slug like ice-t more believable as a cop, and he wrote the worst song about cops ever recorded.
