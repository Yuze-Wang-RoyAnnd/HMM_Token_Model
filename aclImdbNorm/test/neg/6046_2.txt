a sci-fi network original. not the best. not far from being the worst. an electrician(richard grieco) stumbles onto a "key" that can open a gateway to a parallel earth that has been taken over by mutant spiders. the mutations have been controlled by a super-sized alien queen for the past thirty years. she has already eaten up the population of this parallel world that resembles chicago minus inhabitants. guess what? now she must find another world to feed on. the electrician leads a four man team that reluctantly finds themselves with the task of saving the world. the finale confrontation is probably the best part of the whole movie. the cast also features: richard yearwood, colin fox, kate greenhouse, jason jones and david newman. one would have thought that the sci-fi network could have spent more money on special effects.
