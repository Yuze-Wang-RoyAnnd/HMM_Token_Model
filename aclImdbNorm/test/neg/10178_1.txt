first of all, i have nothing against christianity. i believe, every person has the right to believe what he or she chooses. but i cannot imagine how dumb a person has to be to believe this! what a waste of believers' money. they'd better use it to feed some starving families in the third world countries. i don't want to talk about talk acting or plot of this "movie", because i couldn't find any of those in this. story's simple - two reporters, one (a) is atheist, the other (b) for some sake has abandoned religion. b regains his confidence in religion and teaches a a lesson - believe in christ or go to hell. this message appears after like ten minutes and keeps repeating to the end of the movie. people, do not believe the rating of this "movie", read reviews first. i didn't and wasted an hour of my life :( ps: why is it classified as sci-fi? because of those few weird sounds and a bit of bright light from the sky? pps: u.f.o. = satan's evil doings? that's a new one :)
