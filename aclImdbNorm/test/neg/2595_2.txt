have you ever seen one of those shows that became so popular that it could eventually get away with any crummy nonsense and repetitive halfhearted gimmicks that it's creators can get away with? if you haven't, then you've never seen family guy.<br /><br />fans of the show seem to think of it as witty, edgy, and poignant. it's none of these, it is however dull, repetitive, insulting, and uninspired.<br /><br />the "humor" of the show comes from two sources.<br /><br />1) irrelevant idiocy. the show often has flashbacks to things that have nothing to do with the plot and are mostly just absurd and pointless. and then there's the random movie references in which the shows characters reenact a scene from a popular movie without effectively parodying it . . . or parodying it at all(which isn't funny!!!!!).<br /><br />2) the same crap that's in every episode the show. the one guy is a sexual deviant with std's, aha ha! isn't that funny?! hey, ya know what's even funnier? making the same joke about him anywhere between one and fifteen times in a single episode. and don't just tell it numerous times in a single episode, make sure you drag it out so that an entire scene is devoted just to telling the one joke. now also imagine that this same routine is used over and over again for practically every character in the whole series.<br /><br />the offbeat "un-pc" humor isn't as "un-pc" as they would have you believe, mostly they just say whatever morons think about the latest newspaper headlines, politicians, and random celebrities.<br /><br />the series had it's moments, but now i think it's time just take the show off the air and be done with it.<br /><br />you know what is funny? i still like this more than nausicaa of the valley of the wind.
