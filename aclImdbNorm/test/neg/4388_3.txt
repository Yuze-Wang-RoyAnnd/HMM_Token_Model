look at the all the positive user comments of this movie, then check to see how often each one posts user comments. they post once. it seems companies are probably paying for services which post junk pro-movie comments on imdb.<br /><br />this movie was awful. the plot was stupid. the acting was poor. the jokes weren't even funny. the movie included minor nudity from what looked like porn actresses but none of the other characters.<br /><br />it was clear from the first 15 minutes that movie wasn't funny. there was some slapstick here and there but most of humor was supposed to be derived from the characters talking behind each other's back and spreading rumors. this isn't even done well. every joke is obvious and you see it coming.<br /><br />the movie is worthy of fast forwarding or better yet not watching.<br /><br />i regret watching this movie and if i could charge the studio and distributor for 1.5 hrs they stole from me i would.
