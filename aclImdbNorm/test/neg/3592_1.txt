ok, i will make this review short and to the point for those people whose mental capacity is perfect for watching this movie. everybody knows of motion picture association of america's ratings: g, pg, pg-13, r, and nc-17. for the purposes of this movie, i think the mpa should create a new rating standard: iq-20.
