it had its moments, but overall when i watched this cartoon as a child i was bored out of my mind. the only thing that kept me watching was the fact that it was a cartoon, probably my first exposure to anime. it is also one of my least favorite anime's, i remember others one involving a giant ship in space that made no sense, but was more enjoyable because they were in space. i also remember one with these people dressed like birds that was a bit strange, but more entertaining. i do not really like car racing though at all, did not then and still do not so that is probably one of the reasons i did not care for this show even though today i am an avid anime fan. the characters were a bit goofy too, and then there was the horrible scenes where virtually no action was taking place that was probably used to cut down on animation costs and to pad the show. the gadgets in the cars were cool though and provided some entertainment for me back then. overall, i find this show to be rather unwatchable compared to newer animes and some from the same era, but this is just a personal opinion i am sure many other reviewers love the show which is cool.
