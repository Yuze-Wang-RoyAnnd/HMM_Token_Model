aside from frankie muniz chattering too fast to understand (malcolm in the middle flashbacks?) this film still cannot conjure up a scare. the idea with the "countess" and the history surrounding her placed into the story was fun but the plot, and many side plots, just don't tie together. plot synopsis: murdering ghost lures victims through video game. toss in some blood spatters and a special effects and you've got yourself another bombed out would be horror flick. the ghost cronies resemble the ghost in "the ring two" far too much. the acting and constant and dramatic change in everyone's emotions is unbelievable. save your money.
