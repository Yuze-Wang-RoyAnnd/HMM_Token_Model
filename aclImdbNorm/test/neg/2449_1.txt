before i saw this masterpiece i never would have guessed that a devastating and hideously contagious virus could be defeated by the use of lutheran prayers... and "erbs". ralf moeller's performance is gargantuan; the realism incandescent. i was so inspired i'm flying straight to zambibwia tomorrow to crack out the pesto and get my hands together for third world prosperity. god bless this film.<br /><br />seriously, i'm going to have to watch troll 2 and anus magillicutty just to believe that it is possible to concoct more hamfistedly clich'ed dialogue. it's so tortured that taking a cheesegrater to your knuckles might well be preferable to sitting through it. the only subtlety it manages to achieve is in its thinly disguised racism, as the poor islanders turn to ineffectual dumb-ass collective prayer which achieves nothing until the "ubermenschlich, linen-shrouded teutonic hero moeller, with his direct line to yahweh, can provide a blood sample which the horn-blowing yankee scientists can get to work on and save the hapless natives. this movie sucks.
