so you're a giant mantis and you've been hanging out in the arctic for a while, and you're tired of eskimos hitting you with snowballs. what's a giant mutant insect to do? head for the big city, of course! see the sights, maybe catch a show on broadway. but wait! just when you find a nice cozy tunnel to call your own, some pesky humans start attacking you!! argh! time to smash!<br /><br />anyhow this movie is one step up on most other giant bug movies, because it has pretty decent fx for 1957. but that's about it. avoid unless you really need to see another big bug smash things, or see another perry mason actor in a b movie.<br /><br />4/10
