wow, where do i begin? after suffering through this wretched $1.00 rental (thanks a lot, family video) i just had to make a few comments. i did not bother to write down the names of the 3 actors in the film, but hopefully you will know who i am talking about.<br /><br />a monster truck terrorizes the countryside and chases two college-aged buddies to their doom. they encounter a hot girl wearing slutty clothes. i mean, this just sounds fantastic in theory. i was laughing hysterically at the dvd box while i walked it up to the girl behind the counter at the video store.<br /><br />acting: the hot girl, played by aimee whatever, is visibly laughing through many scenes where she is supposed to be scared. the other two major actors in the film, the fat prankster and the vanilla straight-guy are both terrible. the fat guy thinks he's jack black. he's not. the other actor, our hero, over-emotes and misses all his cues and comes across as some generic character you might see in a made-for-nickelodeon movie about skateboarding in the early 90's. look: i don't expect great performances in movies like these, but at least the actors can make an effort to not be annoying. you can be an incompetent actor but still be agreeable (i.e. john wayne). at least that aimee gal is attractive.<br /><br />script: holy ****, who thought this dialogue was funny? i wouldn't have the nerve to play this out in front of my grade school drama class, much less pitch it as a film script. unfathomably bad. more on this later.<br /><br />production: ok, this is the one place where the film definitely succeeds. production quality is amazingly high. the look of the film is very good. apparently the only talented person who worked on the movie was the director of photography.<br /><br />ok, here are my biggest gripes: 1) the guy driving the car never drives faster than 25 miles an hour.<br /><br />2) the guy driving the car is well out into the country before he realizes there is a fat man in a mask in his back seat. he is supposedly meticulous about recording gas mileage and keeping his antique car in good condition but he does not notice a 300lb jack black impersonator in the back? come on.<br /><br />4) characters never change their clothes. there are two hotel scenes. presumably, showers are available to our characters yet over the 3 days this movie takes place, none of the characters bothers to change their clothes.<br /><br />5) comedy. lighthearted, slapstick comedy does not mix with horror. period. you can't have our characters running away from a monster truck one second and the next second have them verbally jousting one another with some dopey light/comedy music playing. this kind of pacing virtually ruins any tension in the movie. movies like evil dead 2 which mix comedy and horror understand that tension can be loosened yet never completely eliminated with humor. monster man doesn't get it.<br /><br />i'm irritated that what could have been a very funny horror movie was ruined by a director who thought he was a lot more clever than he really was. oh well.
