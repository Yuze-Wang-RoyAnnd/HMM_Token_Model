hey! the grudge 2! what up, man? i have a friend i would like you to meet. the grudge 2 meet johnny's worst of 2006 list. johnny's worst of 2006 list meet the grudge 2.<br /><br />what's going on here? i was under the impression that this was supposed to be a sequel to the grudge rather than a remake. if that's the case then why does it do nothing but rehash the original? this floater doesn't even feel like a movie. it's just a 90-minute soundtrack of the weird contortionist chick making that annoying croaking sound.<br /><br />a sound on which i'd recommend you not get me started. it was kind of creepy the first time i heard it, but i've heard it about 12,367 times since 2004, so it's pretty much run its course. and it's made even more annoying by the 20 people in the audience who thought it'd be funny to imitate the sound whenever there was a quiet spot in the movie. sigh.<br /><br />folks, you're not funny so just shut up! i promise you, every single time that a character was walking slowly through an empty room (which is approximately 97% of the movie), somebody in the audience would start it up, "uhhhhkkkkkkuuuuuhhhhhkkkkkk." yes, i know that's a horrible way to replicate the sound with letters, but you get the gist. so then some dude in the audience would giggle, and not to be outdone, deliver his own rendition. i was very close to just walking through the audience and punching random people.<br /><br />i told you not to get me started.<br /><br />there's absolutely nothing about the grudge 2 that i can recommend. there's not a single original scare or idea in the entire film. there's not one memorable acting performance. are you a sarah michelle gellar fan? welp, enjoy her two minutes of screen time and one line of dialogue. are you an amber tamblyn fan? i hope you can deal with the fact that she's given nothing more to do than walk around looking like she's suffering from a pinched nerve. can you believe the story (if you can call it that) is even worse than the grudge's? <br /><br />at least the original was fairly creepy and boasted a few effective jump scenes. i didn't jump once during this lametrosity (yeah, i made the word up, deal with it). that's right. not a single time. the "scares" are so manufactured and they are so blatantly telegraphed that there is absolutely no shock value once the "gotcha" moment arrives. watching this movie is like playing a good game of chess - you're always four or five scenes ahead.<br /><br />there are also some weird scenes thrown in that make no sense whatsoever. one that immediately comes to mind is a scene where a girl drinks a gallon of milk and then begins to regurgitate it back into the jug. huh? i say huh?!?! the audience laughed. i shook my head and sighed. there was a lot of that during the movie. laughing. sighing. head shaking. falling asleep (i did twice).<br /><br />the movie even makes a 1/5th-hearted attempt at a plot "twist." wow. it's so bad that i don't think we should even dignify it by labeling it a twist. did they really think anybody would be surprised at the revelation of who was hiding under the hoodie? please. it was as shocking as elton john coming out of the closet.<br /><br />and of course the ending goes the whole non-closure "look, we might have another sequel" route. as soon as the credits rolled the audience booed. my sentiments exactly. had the audience paid money for this turd burger then things would have most likely gotten violent, and i would've gladly led the charge.<br /><br />we learned from the grudge that there's a japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful grip of rage, then a curse is left behind. much like a ben affleck movie, it's a "stain" that forever becomes a part of the place where the death occurred. well, in the grudge 2 we learn that when a horror movie covers its budget during its opening weekend then its sequel will be rushed out, and more often than not it will be as bad as this and will leave a stain on any theater where the movie shows.<br /><br />the gist <br /><br />if you're a total wimp and never saw the grudge then this might provide a few cheap scares. but i strongly recommend saving your money, otherwise, there's a good chance you'll be the one walking out of the theater with a grudge.
