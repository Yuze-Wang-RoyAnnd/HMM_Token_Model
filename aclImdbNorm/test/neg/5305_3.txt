chili palmer is tired of doing movies and know wants to do some success in music. being half mafioso half expert negotiator, he wants to rise in the music market. however, know everyone is like him and making the good singer linda moon to record a hit will be harder as expected. the first part is funny and filled with irony, this one falls into the easy jokes and has many less good moments. only the two women (uma and milian) are decent in their part. most of the film is done with histrionic character, excessively exaggerated (a little is ok, too much is disgusting) and the only one that one could save is the gay bodyguard, who, at least is coherent, the rest, are too much idiot. the most surprising thing is the fact that the movie is not boring, everything happens so quick and there are so many things happening that you do not have time to get bored, if you want to follow the movie. it may insult your intelligence (a lot!), and the movie is bad(yeah!), but, well, it's not boring.
