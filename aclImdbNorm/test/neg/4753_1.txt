this entry doesn't contain a spoiler. it doesn't have to. the movie is as predictable as the sunrise. the element in the first alien movies was the suspense that something could happen. this was so in the first two predator movies, though less prevalent. requiem has totally removed the element of suspense and replaced it with blood and gore. you know people are going to die (well duh, it is a avsp movie), but you know who is going to die and when they are going to die, and where they are going to die before it happens. the directors should take a lesson from hitchcock who said, "suspense is not a time bomb going off under a table. suspense is a bomb not going off under the table". what's the sense in going to a movie when you know exactly what is going to happen and when? if you really, really want to watch this movie, wait until it comes out on video and then rent it, but by no means would i ever buy it.
