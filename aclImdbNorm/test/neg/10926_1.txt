one of the commentators on the subject of lil' pimp (dbborroughs of glen cove), got it right when he/she stated that the movie is really bad but i take exception when he/she commented on the animation.<br /><br />the animation wasn't bad because of macromedia flash. it was bad animation because it was directed wrong. flash is just a tool. in the right hands, an artist can create animation as full and fluid as any disney film and, in the wrong hands, it can look as bad as the stuff on the internet, which is where lil' pimp originated and should've stayed there.<br /><br />studios such as cartoon network, nickelodeon, disney, and warner bros., create wonderful animation using flash (i.e., puffy ami yumi, foster's home for imaginary friends, mucha lucha, etc.).<br /><br />lil' pimp was an ill conceived piece of tripe that was made because revolution studios bought media tripp and lil' pimp was one of the properties included. roth and company thought they'd make a quick buck exploiting a turd like lil' pimp and the sham was perpetuated by it's producer, amy pell. the reason for this third trimester abortion of an animated film is that none of the executives at revolution studios had the pragmatic brains to sideline mark brooks and peter gilstrap (they really tried their best but were way in over their heads), and hire real writers, directors and at least a semi-competent producer. they did one thing correctly though, they hired some of the best storyboarders, designers, and animators in la, but as lil' pimp demonstrates, one can buy the best sports car on the floor but if you're a moron, you'll wreck it for sure.
