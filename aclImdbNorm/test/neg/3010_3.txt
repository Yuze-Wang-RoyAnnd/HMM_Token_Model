a professional production with quality actors that simply never touched the heart or the funny bone no matter how hard it tried. the quality cast, stark setting and excellent cinemetography made you hope for fargo or high plains drifter but sorry, the soup had no seasoning...or meat for that matter. a 3 (of 10) for effort.
