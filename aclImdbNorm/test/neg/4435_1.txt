legend has it that at the gala hollywood premiere screening of 2001: a space odyssey, about 20 minutes into the film rock hudson yelled out "would somebody please tell me what the hell this movie is about?" well, i have rock beaten by about 19 minutes, 59 seconds. this movie made absolutely no sense at all. who were those people? where were those people? what were the rules of the game called quintet? are there any rules to quintet? were robert altman and his cohorts making the movie up as they went along? what was paul newman thinking when he signed on to this? maybe ol' fast eddie saw zardoz and thought "well if connery can get involved in a futuristic film that makes no sense, so can i." maybe the good stuff is on the cutting room floor and all we get to see is the incoherent stuff. also, did all the cast get to keep their individual funny hats? you never saw such bizarre looking hats all in one place in your life. quintet just confirms what i've always thought: when altman's good he's superb, but when he's bad, he makes stuff like quintet
