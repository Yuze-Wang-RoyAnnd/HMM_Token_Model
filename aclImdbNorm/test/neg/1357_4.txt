i'm sorry but i cannot even partly agree with some comments on this awful piece of sh...<br /><br />english is not my native language, because i'm a german citizen, so please do not blame me for inappropriate grammar structures or something *gg i cannot understand why this movie got such a high rating? 6.3??? are you kidding me? this movie has completely no sense, not even a seem of good acting...<br /><br />when i looked at the comments on the da vinci code, which has - i think - nearly the same rating, i had to bang my head on the table , because i watched 00 schneider directly after sakrileg, and oh my god , there are worlds between them.<br /><br />the majority of the posters in this board tears every hyped movie to pieces while rating this crime of movie making with a 6.3 and denominates helge as a genius. of course , he knows how to make money, but i think the main aspect of your opinions is the fact, that german isn't your native language and you just ignore - or rather don't notice the bunch of crap which is said in the sentences. ok , i must confess that some scenes are funny, but all in all , a 6.3 is just too much for my compatriot ;)
