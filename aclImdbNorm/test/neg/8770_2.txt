...not to waste your time watching this vanity project. i've had my comment deleted twice now, for reasons that i have yet to understand, other than the suspicion that someone involved with "gone" isn't happy with what i had to say. so, i've pared things down to the nitty-gritty this time with an excerpt of my original comments that can in no way be taken as a personal attack on anyone, nor unfair commentary: <br /><br />""gone" is the sort of train wreck that gives new meaning to the words. horrible, stilted dialogue, a script that just plain flails about like a fish out of water, acting that would embarrass the most self-centered of community theater divas, cinematography inspired by the "survivor" school of swooping crane shots followed by static, nostril-exploring close-ups, terrible adr work, special visual effects that aren't, pedestrian music that totally fails to sustain any mood or emotion, terrible editing with utterly pointless freezes and fades, no art direction to speak of---the litany of badness just goes on and on...i felt genuinely cheated out of the time it took me to fast forward through most of it...time that could have been better spent staring at a wall...under no circumstances should anyone unfortunate enough to be reading this subject themselves to this "movie," because long before it's over, they will be wishing they had been "raptured" before they made that mistake." <br /><br />case closed. amen.
