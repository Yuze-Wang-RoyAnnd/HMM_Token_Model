i really like harrison ford so i eagerly rented this movie only to be disappointed minute after minute. mr. ford seemed to be walking through very warm water looking for a place to urinate. his co-star was very good and had the better lines. the story intrigued me but the mistake - big mistake - as everyone is identified via driver's license or passport before they board any american commercial aircraft left numerous plot questions in my mind. <br /><br />i could have cared less about these people. in fact, the sub-plot of the internal affairs investigation was more interesting than the two lovers killed while flying first class to miami.<br /><br />i am disappointed in the director, sydney pollack who gave us the classic tootsie and other films. this one is a waste of time and energy.
