if you like poor se, (some) bad acting and a total lack of credibility, this is a movie for you. so a really cheap looking movie, but i liked it anyway. why? because i like those kind of movies. i can't help but smile when i see these kind of movies....... what were the producers, actors, director and se people thinking when they made this film? don't expect an "abyss" or "alien", just a (very) low-budget horror/adventure movie.<br /><br />there is one nice "splatter"moment when a guy's head is shot off, but for the most, the horror is pretty tame. the final monster is pretty cool too.<br /><br />it's only 73 minutes long, so you can t go wrong there. maybe you can pick it up at your local videostore or watch it on tv. i'm sure you will have a good time watching it.<br /><br />but don't say you weren't warned.............
