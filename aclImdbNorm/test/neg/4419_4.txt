occasionally funny but generally boring. i did recognize robert hegyes from welcome back carter (aka epstein) as the ex-celebrity criminal. there is a knee slapping, gut busting scene with the french lady having a bad reaction to american food. s. baio, s. kellerman, and tom arnold are billed but have only minor roles. you never get to know the characters and it's hard to care what happens to them. not recommended.
