the original road house was a classic cheesy 80s movie, which although it didn't have anywhere near award worthy writing or acting, was a very enjoyable and popular film, largely due to the presence of star patrick swayze and the great supporting cast, along with some excellent fight scenes and eye candy.<br /><br />16 years later, and mgm / sony attempts to re-create the magic which left us all quoting one liners and reciting the three rules of bouncing... with a movie which quotes all the original's best one liners and recites the three rules.<br /><br />were this an amateur fan made film, it would be seen as a loving homage to one of the most popular of swayze's movies. as a professionally made film, it falls flat on it's face right into the dvd bargin bin, with its continual reuse of lines and plot from the original movie becoming more of an annoying sign of lack of originality rather than cool references to the original.<br /><br />having said that, with new lines such as "i'm gonna kill you just like i killed your father" no wonder the screenwriters decided to rehash much of the original script.<br /><br />i knew this was never going to be anything special, being a straight to dvd sequel, but i had at least hoped that there might be a couple of new ideas and fresh things included to live up to the road house name, but what you get is simply just a 2006 remake of the same film, with a little narcotics added in.<br /><br />were i the director, i'd have removed all references to the first film so as not to tarnish the original and it's characters. as it is, we got patrick swayze's character now supposed to be dead (killed off screen in a lame way by jake busey) and his brother and son now the main characters, who strangely enough have completely different surnames.<br /><br />my favourite part was that dalton's 'son' drove the same car his father did, a genuinely cool homage, although it was later ruined by having the car meet its end exactly the same way as its predecessor did. that's a good example of how this film goes too far in including sequences and ideas from the '89 movie.<br /><br />also of course who can forget the legendary moment where wild bill promises to kill shane "just like i killed your father" and then proceeds to attempt to dispatch him in a completely different manner. amazing writing there. i see schaech is listed as co-screenwriter. stick to acting, or preferably, nothing.<br /><br />overall though, this is an ok film if there's nothing else to watch and you want to turn your brain off for an hour and a half, or if you haven't seen the first road house, but hardcore fans of swayze's classic will be totally disappointed almost to the point of feeling insulting at how much of a rip off this movie is of the first. as someone once suggested as an alternative subtitle for this film, "even jeff healy is glad he won't be seeing this one!" stick to the original road house and relive the good old swayze days!
