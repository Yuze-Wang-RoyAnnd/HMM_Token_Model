seen this one in a sneak preview yesterday and must say it was terrible. after the credits i thought: "hey with this cast it'll probably be pretty good". didn't at all turn out that way. <br /><br />lame predictable groaners, terribly simply drawn characters (maybe except a little ms. lara's) and an ending one could foresee 10 minutes into the movie. and worst of all, it misused a delicate theme (handicapped persons) for low level and mostly tasteless jokes without ever touching anything but the surface of the issue. the handicapped person the film sympathises with the most is the one who is just faking it. what kind of message is that? and the film doesn't have a thought through ending at all, it basically comes down to: "i love you, doesn't matter that you acted like a prick."<br /><br />to sum it up: great cast that must have been terribly bored to sign up for a terrible flick.
