"disappointing" is the best word i could think for this film, especially considering the glowing reviews it receives from some other users.<br /><br />one thing that really spoils the film is that it is unabashedly partial(in both senses of the word). not only does it present a very selective description of the games (focussing as it does on the us athletics team) but it also contains several inaccuracies, most of which serve to exaggerate the difficulties the us team faced.<br /><br />what is even more disturbing is that all the omissions and mistakes (?), appear to glorify us sportsmanship to the exclusion of other athletes (with a few celebrated exceptions). for example, the viewer is led to believe that the us won the majority of medals in the games, when in fact they won only one out of four gold medals and one out of 6 total. similarly, many athletes are portrayed as caricatures of their respective countrymen (thus we have an arrogant brit, and a wine-swilling french). this attitude does very little service to the olympic ideals that the film is supposed to celebrate.<br /><br />in conclusion, i believe that this film would appeal to that part of the us audience that is looking for a quick boost of national self-esteem. those looking for a detailed and historically correct description of the games are advised to look elsewhere.
