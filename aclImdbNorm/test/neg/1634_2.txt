another in the long line of conan wannabes that tired to cash in on that movie's success, this italian monstrosity is about as bad as they came. you know it's a bad sign when your heroes fight invisible enemies because the movie was made so cheaply there wasn't money for either adequate special effects or to hire real people. i won't even bother going into the plot as i defy anyone to follow it and make sense of the storyline. maybe it's the television cut i watched, but i can't imagine any version being that much better. it all seems so random to me. evil sorcerers, cavemen, giant snakes, medieval castles, grenades, and hang gliding
