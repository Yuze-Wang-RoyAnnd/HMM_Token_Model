i know a couple people who look just like the lead actress in this film (or, at least, like the character she portrays.) they all give me the creeps and i would be the last person to ever lend one of them a gun or even a sharp knife. she has one mean and ugly-looking expression. if you can conjure up a bit of sympathy for her, let me know.<br /><br />of course, i might have the same expressions of concern and fear if i had an imaginary friend who had been killing off my real friends and acquaintances for the last 15 years.<br /><br />and for our european friends on the imdb, i'm saddened to say that, yes, some colleges and universities in the us teach courses on paranormal phenomena, relying on the pathetic defense that it represents "academic freedom" and open inquiry.<br /><br />this film is not worth your while. you will have no sympathy for any of the characters (except for aunt lydia, who gets offed pretty early) and the plot makes no sense.
