in the muslim country of khalid (fictional), its benevolent leader/dictator,reed hadley as amir, is dying of cancer. amir dies and a desperate plot unfolds. his body is wrapped in aluminum foil and taken in a clandestine operation (the population does not know of his death) consisting of his doctor (nigserian) and mohammed, out of the country to perform a risky brain transplant. the surgery is being performed by the disgraced dr. kent taylor, who believes there is no chance of failure and has two assistants. one of them is about 3 feet high (master blaster did indeed run barter town) and the other is a mutilated & traumatized 7 foot giant named gor. what could possibly go wrong??<br /><br />did i forget to mention amir's deathbed american, blonde-barbie wife, tracy or that dr. kent has a dungeon with female slave test subjects & delusions of grandeur? how about a brain transplant that didn't take? there is a lot of double-dealing throughout this and people are killed, but i'm not going to lie to you anymore : mission accomplished. the ends justify the means. if you can accept that then you will not have to waste 80 minutes. i hope that is warning enough. don't say i didn't warn you. if you must watch, then don't watch alone and have plenty of medicine standing by.<br /><br />-celluloid rehab
