if this film is an accurate display of j. smits acting skills, i think he made a big mistake leaving television. hasn't he watched any films "starring" david caruso, especially "cold around the heart"? along the lines of acting ability, what about mary-louise, she has done much, much better. yes, it is a terrible script, ineptly edited, and totally lacking in continuity, but skilled actors can and have overcome similar obstacles. a very big disappointment.
