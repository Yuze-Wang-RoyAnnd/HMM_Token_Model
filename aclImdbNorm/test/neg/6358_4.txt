*spoilers - sorry!* the first word that sprung to mind whilst watching the film is 'gremlins'. it's the only critters movie i have seen from the four movies, but i enjoyed it. it wasn't too complicated as i hadn't seen the past two, but i thought it was quite a good movie all the same. <br /><br />critters starts with a man, his son and daughter stopping off on the way to a vacation (although it turns out that they end up at their own home - which i have no idea what the hell went on) the girl meets up with a boy (played by leo dicaprio) and they go hang out in a nearby forest. they meet this weird guy who tells them to be careful and stuff because of the critters. he seems a bit psychotic and if i was in that situation, i would not speak to him. the critters steal a ride of the girl and boy's car and end up in their flat thing. they hide out in the basement and end up killing this lazy jerk. they then nearly kill this fat woman and the girl's dad. they are chased higher and higher up the flat until they hide in the attic. the critters eat stuff in the kitchen (spoof of the gremlins kitchen scene???!) and i can't remember (not a good thing) but i'm sure they have to go back for something/someone. anyway they end up getting out and saved. the psychotic guy comes back and before he kills the last two critters he is told he can't because they are endangered and so he sends them home.<br /><br />the ending was disappointing and i was annoyed that only the lazy guy died as there were quite a few annoying characters i would personally have killed off. it's a thrilling, exciting movie worth a watch. but, if you're looking for a better version of this genre i recommend the gremlins movies. sorry!
