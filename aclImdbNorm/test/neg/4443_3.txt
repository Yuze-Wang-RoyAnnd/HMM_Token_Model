watching quintet is not unlike watching a group of people playing a word game in portuguese, or some other language you do not understand. you get the idea that they are playing a game, and if you watch closely enough, you may just begin to understand the rules. but, why bother, since it is clear you can't join in and you wouldn't want to if you had the chance.<br /><br />director robert altman is not one to beg an audience to like his films, let alone understand them. sometimes he lets you slip into the picture to be a part of the crowd, like in m*a*s*h, nashville and a wedding, films so full of hubbub and orchestrated chaos, one or two more bodies in the scene wouldn't make much of a difference. and other times, he seems to resent the fact that someone might even be watching his film; as in images or three women, where the stories are almost personal monologues made for an audience of one, altman. with quintet, altman seems to purposely dare anyone to become involved with the narrative. <br /><br />you can't depend on altman to do the logical or the expected, which is sometimes the thing that makes his films so remarkably iconoclastic. but sometimes doing the unexpected isn't daring, just dumb. for instance, in quintet, we are introduced to a young woman who is apparently the last person on earth capable of getting pregnant, and she is, indeed, with child. this last ray of hope in a decaying society is almost immediately extinguished; altman doesn't even wait until the end to play his last depressing card in this elaborate nihilistic and pessimistic tale. he lets us know how empty and meaningless life is right off the bat. brave? maybe. stupid? definitely. devoid of a purpose, he tries to build a story on a rapidly melting iceberg, all the while reminding us how pointless the effort is. <br /><br />for the record, quintet, can at least claim to be prophetic. the story is centered on a treacherous game played by the various bored characters. it is a form of tag (the assassination game): a handful of people target each other for elimination, each as a would-be assassin and each as a would-be victim. two or more can form alliances to kill a third. as they die off, new targets are assigned. whoever lives, wins. all of this happens at some exotic, inhospitable wasteland. it is, to a great extent, an extreme, sci-fi version of "survivor" -- minus the commercial plugs and faked "reality."<br /><br />it is not a bad concept for a sci-fi epic. a post-apocalyptic setting, a microcosm of the world (the cast is pointedly multinational), a game where no on can be trusted or least not for long, and where no one really wins. literally a cold war. a steely eyed director with a taste for dark humor and violent invention could have a field day. the mystery in quintet is not in the game or how it is played, but in why it exists it all. if the game "quintet" is a metaphor for life, then altman, seems to see nothing in the material but a chance to show life to be an empty, meaningless game -- a conclusion as obvious as it is untrue. given the lively, albeit cynical nature of the rest of his diverse films, i don't believe that altman believes in quintet either. and if altman has no faith in his material, why should we?
