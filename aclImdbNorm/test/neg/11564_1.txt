i am not familiar with the producer's other works, but this movie is a piece of crap. <br /><br />i never saw the mst3k version, but i can tell you, mike and the bots probably didn't save it. <br /><br />i love a grade-z movie as much as the next bad movie fan, but this was almost unwatchable.<br /><br />there was no credit for who did the voice of "the dark one". sounded a bit like patrick stewart at times.<br /><br />a group of high school students who found a junk super-8 camera in the trash heap could make a better movie than that.
