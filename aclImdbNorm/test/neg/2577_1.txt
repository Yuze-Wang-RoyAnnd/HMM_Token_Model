you get a good portion of steven seagal environmental anxieties, and some breathless mountain views along with cow-boy scenes (or alternatively use parts of any remains of the horse whisperer). you then add a large piece of outbreak virus or similar (attention it must be more lethal and at least biohazard level 4) wrapped around a fat militia group leader. you add one teaspoon of martial arts, and a zip of explosions and gunfire for the taste. add the classic red indian herbs for the extra taste. serve immediately.<br /><br />what is the name of the film you get ?: the patriot. perhaps the worst film of steven seagal. i am sure that seagal tried to say something in this film except the usual i-am-a-cook (but-also-an-ex-seal) but his recipe was confusing and the taste was awful.
