is it just me, or is this an awful film? i'm going with it's an awful film...<br /><br />knowing full well that it's a guy flick (usually defined as full of car chases, crashes, gunfights, explosions, etc.), i still expect some small degree of credibility. if i can't somehow believe in the premise, the film will not work. thus, we come to the problem with "assault on precinct 13."<br /><br />not one for spoilers, i never report details of the plot. however, i will make an exception here, because the plot is so inane. bad guy is jailed in precinct 13. bad guy's buddies want to bust him out. surprise. the bad guys' buddies are actually corrupt cops. brooding, troubled, but heroic young cop saves the day while romancing the girl. ugh. yes, it really is that simple, and that dumb.<br /><br />"assault on precinct 13" takes place in detroit. not a bad setting for crime and corruption (i spent 3 months there in late 2004, so i know what i'm talking about). even so, it's outrageously violent and insulting to the police and the citizens of detroit. i have spent a lot of time in downtown detroit, but i cannot imagine how the final chase wound up in the downtown detroit forest. i must have missed it...<br /><br />there are no refunds for watching bad movies. save your money. there were too many good films in 2005 to waste even $3.00 at blockbuster on this one.<br /><br />final rating: 1<br /><br />(only because i have seen worse films.)
