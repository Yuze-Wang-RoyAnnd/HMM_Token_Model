i thought this series was going to be another fun, action series with some dynamic plots and great performances. i was wrong. while i like jamie denton, this show is hardly worth watching at all, unless you enjoy watching some people brutalized and the actions of the agents supposedly warranted under the theme of "national security." the show is great propaganda for the current government, and spews out jingoism as though we talk that way every day. after a couple of episodes, it was boring the hell out of me, and i started watching reruns of house invaders on bbcamerica instead. rather watch csi and without a trace, without a doubt.
