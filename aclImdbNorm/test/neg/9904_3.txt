what is this!! its so bad. the animation looks so terrible , it looks like a ps1 type game. the actors are awful, they just cannot act to save their lives. i sat through all of this film an then at the end i was annoyed when i realised i had wasted 3 hours of my life. i've not heard of this film, did it ever actually come out in the cinema or did it go straight to dvd? a girl got shot?! what is up with that, it was just a stupid film. they totally copied 'the day after tomorrow'. its got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen. i would definitely recommend to people to not waste their time with this. you could spend your time watching 'the day after tomorrow', its a lot better. well thats what i think of the film. actually why have i wasted my time writing about it, ah dam!! its really annoying me, its wasted 3 hours and 10 minutes now.
