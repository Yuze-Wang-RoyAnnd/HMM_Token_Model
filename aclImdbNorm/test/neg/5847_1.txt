demi and woody are married, but they're poor. they meet robert redford, and he's really rich. he takes a fancy to demi, and since he's a gambling man he makes the couple an "indecent proposal:" one million dollars for a night with the little woman.<br /><br />at this point you need watch no more of the film because you can put the details together in your sleep. of course demi is going to accept the offer. if she doesn't there's no first half of the movie. of course it will affect demi and woody's marriage. if it doesn't there's no second half of the movie. and of course everything will turn out okay by the time the credits roll. if it doesn't, there's no happy ending for the sake of box office.<br /><br />the absolute best thing you can say about indecent proposal is that demi moore looks good in a black dress. as for the rest... the script is incompetent, the direction amateurish, the performances negligible. i suspect redford, moore, and harrelson blush and change the subject every time the film is mentioned. do them--and more importantly yourself--a favor. unless some one offers you a million... miss it!<br /><br />gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer
