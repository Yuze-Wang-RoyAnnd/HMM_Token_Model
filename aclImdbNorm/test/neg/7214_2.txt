man stop making sequels to great movies. the original was a great movie that was over the top with fights,sex,and one of the coolest characters that graced the screen in the 90's. the story is believable as if your been to bars in the outs of the south you would know. but here comes this piece of junk roadhouse 2 last call. lets just hope they are serious with the title and never make another roadhouse ever again.it doesn't have the charm of the characters of the original nor is the story really believable. the story is more of a steven segal type action that even though roadhouse 2 is a b movie it still doesn't click as some b movie action still sales the movie no matter how cheesy it is. the only reason to rent not buy this movie is that we finally find out the one question is left from the original roadhouse. patrick swayze's character dalton, is dalton his first name or last name? well i'll save you the $4.00 rental fee. dalton is his first name as in dalton tanner. never make another roadhouse!!!!!!!!!!!
