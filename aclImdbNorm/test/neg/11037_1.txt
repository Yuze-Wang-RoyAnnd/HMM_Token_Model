i have been reading comments on imdb for some time now. an 8.3 average for this movie just plain gets on my nerves. i don't mean to pull one of those "i just signed up for an account so i can post on this movie" bits..... but, i just did. the only theme you will come away with from this movie is that incest does not deserve to be ridiculed.<br /><br />now, i realize many 'hoity-toity' film people love this movie; nevertheless, it is crap. the thing that really gets to me is the fact that the director expects you to have sympathy for the 'villain' in the movie. if you do have sexual relations with your sister, you should probably be an outcast from society. just my personal feelings i guess. yet, i sat through 2 hours of this *expletive* expecting some really deep reasoning behind dae-soo's imprisonment.<br /><br />i tend to like a lot of foreign movies, but this is my first encounter with a korean flick and it has put them last in line in my book. oh... i feel better already after a little venting.
