loki, norse god of mischief, creates a mask that endows the wearer with cartoon-like powers. at the command of his father, odin, he spends the rest of the movie looking for the mask so that it can cause no further grief to mankind. in the meantime, the possessor of the mask conceives a child who inherits the powers of the mask. etc. etc. if this sounds like a pretty thin plot line, it is. add to this the fact that the movie is handled ineptly from start to finish, and the result is very, very bad. you can find worse movies, but you'll have to actively search for them.<br /><br />for the most part, son of the mask is presented at the intellectual level of a pre-schooler, but in light of scenes such as the mask-baby urinating copiously in six different directions, including on his father, this premise seems unlikely. i asked my son who he thought might have been the target audience for the movie, and he responded "convicted felons," apparently forgetting for the moment that the constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.<br /><br />but just making a bad movie is not a sin, or hell would be overflowing. what makes it a sin is that $72 million was spent on this piece of garbage. to put things in perspective, the day after we watched son of the mask, my son and i watched "good night, and good luck," a movie that garnered six academy award nominations (including best picture), and was brought in for $7 million. that's right. just one-tenth of the amount of money spent on son of the mask. this, then is the sin -- to flush good money down the sewer, when it could have been better used in making watchable movies, or feeding starving children, or for that matter, almost any other purpose. the producers should truly be ashamed of themselves.
