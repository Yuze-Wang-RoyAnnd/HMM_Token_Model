on the scale of 1 to 10, i gave this a 4. i thought the film was not very good, with too much violence and not one character to like.<br /><br />on an erotic scale, i give this a 6. many of the sex scenes were tinged with an underlying ugliness. i always enjoy nudity, and nancy travis and faye grant come through, but the sex scenes were more humiliating than erotic.
