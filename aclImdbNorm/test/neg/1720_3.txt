oh, boy, it's another comet-hitting-the-earth film. coming within a year or two of deep impact, armageddon, space cowboys and various other stupid flicks with rap stars in them, you'd think people would be burned out on this concept. apparently not, since i rented it, hoping it might not be awful: dennis hopper was in it, after all, and he's a good actor, right?<br /><br />i forgot something important: along with peter o'toole, robert de niro and quite a few other esteemed actors, hopper has a penchant for appearing in dreadful films. not only that, but he seems to prepare for them by taking forget-how-to-act classes. his performance in tychus is so awful that you expect divine or edith massey to appear in some scenes.<br /><br />i don't know what else to say about this rubbish, other than if you're into things crashing into the earth films, watch deep impact, and then armageddon and space cowboys at a stretch. forget the others altogether. this one really is bottom of the pile.
