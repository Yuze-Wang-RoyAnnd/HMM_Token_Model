this film is a bad film but to gain any nutritional value from it i recommend watching it back to back with rosemary's baby.<br /><br />there is a lot to learn seeing how different directors can draw different performances from the same actors playing the same characters. observe minnie castevet (ruth gordon) and the fine work she did in the first film vs the awful rendition in this film.<br /><br />it is also interesting to see how the same characters were played by different actors. which leads me to wonder if anyone involved with the sequel were aware of the first film and did any of them watch rosemary's baby before making this?<br /><br />if your interest in films is purely superficial then you would best avoid this one. i have a lot more to say about this film but i really don't want to go there.
