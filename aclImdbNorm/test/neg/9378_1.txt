25 august 2003 league of extraordinary gentlemen:<br /><br />sean connery is one of the all time greats and i have been a fan of his since the 1950's. i went to this movie because sean connery was the main actor. i had not read reviews or had any prior knowledge of the movie. the movie surprised me quite a bit. the scenery and sights were spectacular, but the plot was unreal to the point of being ridiculous. in my mind this was not one of his better movies it could be the worst. why he chose to be in this movie is a mystery. for me, going to this movie was a waste of my time. i will continue to go to his movies and add his movies to my video collection. but i can't see wasting money to put this movie in my collection
