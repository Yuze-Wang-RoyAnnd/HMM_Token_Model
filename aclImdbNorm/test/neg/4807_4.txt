i'm a massive fan of prison dramas which is reflected in oz being my all time favourite american tv show . i guess the appeal lies in a type of smug voyeurism of wanting to see bad things happen to bad mens' bottoms , but i found don siegel's riot in cell block 11 to be rather disappointing . okay i knew since it was made in 1954 it would be devoid of bad language , graphic shankings and gang rape but even so it's a rather weak film compared to prison portrayal in earlier movies like each dawn i die and white heat . the problem lies in the preachy tone of the movie with riot leader dunn being something of a prison reformer . yeah that sounds ridiculous since he's a violent anti hero rather than some limp wristed tree hugging do gooder on a salary , but that's what he is in essence , he wants to see prisoners rehabilitated to rejoin society rather than being made to suffer . there's also a problem of making a b movie with such radical themes ( quite ironic that siegel would later make dirty harry where the only good criminal is a dead one ) and that is the cast isn't very good with emile meyer as the warder being especially irritating in his performance . like i said a disappointing movie
