don't believe the hype. if you have high hopes or have anticipated this movie to any degree, you may be disappointed. even the hilarious and talented steve carrell can't save this poorly written, over-long silly spy flick. for the purists (fans of the original tv series), this movie bears little resemblance to the original characters and influence. agent 99 and maxwell (except for their names) are simply not the same characters. there are several isolated references to the original, but not enough to convince this fan that it is anything more than a poor shadow of the tv version. for those not familiar with the original tv series, you may not be disappointed but chances are you will be bored. there are a few cheap hollywood political shots as well (really pathetic and oh so typical for an election year). we left after the first hour and weren't alone. some left after 20 minutes.
