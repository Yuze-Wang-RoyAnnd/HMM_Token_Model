this is not a new film. it is a re-cut of 1994's "emmanuelle, queen of the galaxy", and it has been significantly truncated. warning: many characters appear in the credits that have been cut from the movie!<br /><br />if you want to see this one in its original form, pick up "queen" - avoid this one at all costs, as the cuts make it even choppier than it was originally.
