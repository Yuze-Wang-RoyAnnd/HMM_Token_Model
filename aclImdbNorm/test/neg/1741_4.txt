uzumaki, which translates into "spirals", arriving within this new wave of asian horror films following such hits like ringu, ju-on and the eye (two of them with remakes.. and much more coming like dark water and tale of two sisters), falls short of the spooky, supernatural thriller element so characteristic of the other movies, the only thing that remains is weirdness and not in a tim burton or david lynch kind of way, but in a irrelevant and dull way. <br /><br />its start with a girl, some other kid with a crush on her, her best friend and his dad who's obsessed with uzumakis! everything that happens concerns uzumakis, people die and you see uzumakis. so okay, it'll go along with it, i'm kinda amuse by spirals myself, characters don't seem to go anywhere, but i'll play along. we find out the town is cursed by uzumakis, people start screaming at uzumakis and the point is uzumakis are everywhere, the movie is a disaster, it doesn't know where to go, except to show you the power of uzumakis!!!!!!!!! there are some cool concepts like when the mother cuts her fingers because she sees uzumakis on her fingerprints but then there's another scene where she hears her husband (from beyond the grave!!) tell her that she also has uzumakis in her ear, the way they handled that scene was just laughable, not even cheesy fun, there are also some (a little bit) of cool visuals, like the collection the father has of uzumakis and the girl with the uzumakis hair.. yep, uzumakis hair, its out of context though, its seems like it was taken out of a fruit snack commercial where if you eat an uzumakis fruits snack, its taste is so incredible your hair turns into uzumakis, now if this wasn't bad enough, suddenly, out of nowhere there are snail men.. or mansnails
