this is easily the worst adaptation of greek mythology i've ever seen. it utterly fails as an adaptation of the original myth, inventing silly plot twists and reducing the 12 labours to... 3 or 4, i think. it makes up utterly needless things to try to integrate other myths in clumsy ways which bring into question the writers' having ever read the myths, like changing birds to harpies, lions to sphinxes, the oracle of delphi to tiresias, and bulls to a pedantic version of proteus, even integrating aspects, never seen outside of sam raimi's entertaining series, concerning his first marriage, to a woman with the co-opted name of one of the furies so it sounds appropriate to the period.<br /><br />i could accept much of that, but it also fails completely in pure film standards; most painful is the dialogue, leaden, portentous pseudo-shakespearean tripe. it is a poor re-interpretation of the myths, making a sad attempt at the kind of post-modern revisionism that crichton's "the 13th warrior" attempted in regards to the beowulf legend, while still including the strictly mythological elements such as clear interference from the gods and magical super-strength. a sad, sad failure of an entertainment experience, who i'm sure many of the quality actors involved regret deeply.
