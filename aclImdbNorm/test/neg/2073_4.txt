dull acting, weak script...worst spanish movie in years...i was<br /><br />attracted by the (naked) beauty of paz vega, but as an actress<br /><br />she's useless, you almost can't understand what she's saying...<br /><br />about the story there's not much coherent to say...we heard of it<br /><br />before, but as this is a "modern carmen" we find a few changes: -the french soldier is now a basque soldier. -merimee himself is a character in the story. -carmen is a dangerous "bandolera" in love with a famous<br /><br />"matador" and she can speak fluent basque...<br /><br />can anyone understand this mess?
