the cast of "all that" returns for good humor in the "good burger" a place similar to an old fashioned fast food restaurant. the comedy is terrific, the fun is non-stop, and though clich'e, is a passer for kid and family comedy.<br /><br />a movie for all ages, this movie is meant to enjoy, laugh, and pretty much a lazy movie for a rainy day, as that's what i'd save this movie for, a rainy day. usa aired it today, and since i know that the cast of "all that" is in it, i thought that it might be a bit of a chuckle burner, but in good fun, as keenan thompson and kel mitchell (probably one of the best young duos of that time) were terrific together, the pieces came together, and everything worked out, and it made it into good family fun together with some lazy day work to get off the bad day.<br /><br />may i take your order?
