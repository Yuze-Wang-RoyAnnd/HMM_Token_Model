interferencia starts as unemployed martin sanders (andres bagg) hears something strange on his phone, he hears a mysterious man talking to a prostitute named diana & arranging to meet her. soon after martin reads a local paper & sees the front page story about a prostitute being murdered & thinks back to what he heard. martin confides in his friends laura (virginia lustig) & aaron (oliver kolker) but they don't believe him. then shortly after the same thing happens again, the phone call, the man, the prostitute & her death reported in the papers. martin decides he has to find the killer & put a stop to his killing spree but who is it?<br /><br />this argentinian production that was apparently shot in just eight days (why so long?) on a budget of about $3,000 (why so much?) was written & directed by sergio esquenazi & i cannot believe some of the glowing comments interferencia has on the imdb. out of 195 user ratings as i write this 113 of them rate this pile of crap 10 out of 10, i am sorry but there is no way anyone should be giving a film this bad a quite literally perfect score of 10 out of 10. if a score for a film on imdb is fixed then this is it, i honestly don't believe that if you showed interferencia to 195 average people that well over 100 of them would rate it as being absolutely perfect, no way on earth. the user comments are also amazingly positive, all by imdb users who have only wrote comments for one film, this. the one user (besides me) who has actually written more than one comment gave it a rock bottom 1 out of 10 which sounds just about right. everyone is entitled to an opinion but i would stake my life on the fact most of those positive comments are from fake accounts set up purely to big this piece of crap up. where do i start? how on earth can i adequately describe how bad interferencia is? the plot is a mess that basically lives or dies by it's terrible twists, while most twists turn a plot on it's head & alters the perspective of everything that has gone before in a clever & relevant way & are genuine surprises here in interferencia the twists destroy the first half of the film & makes it utterly pointless in a 'it didn't actually happen' sort of way & the twist is so poorly handled that it leaves you asking more questions than it answers. what made martin go mad? why did he imagine the phone calls? why did he imagine a killer? why did he imagine the newspaper headlines? no explanation is given for martin's behaviour during the first hour or so of the film, there's just this absurd revelation that it was all in his mind & that's it, that's all the exposition there is. then there's a plot twist about martin's missing wife & her lover before martin for reasons unexplained starts to kill his friends for no apparent reason. i am sorry but interferencia is so bad, it's so boring, it's so badly written & thought out that i honestly can't think of a positive thing to say about it. sorry guy's but that's how i feel, quite simply interferencia is one of the worst films i have ever seen & is a complete mess both conceptually & technically.<br /><br />according to the imdb interferencia was hot in just eight days, to be honest it doesn't feel like that at all. nope, it feels more like it was shot in five days! the whole film is an eyesore, interferencia has probably the worst nighttime shooting i have ever seen. it's like no attempt was made to light the scenes, it's like the makers just went into a dark room or basement or whatever & just shoot the scene regardless of whether you could see anything. the scenes set outside in the daytime have this horrible unnatural blue green tint to them for no apparent reason which just looks daft & becomes increasingly irritating. this strange tint is not repeated on indoor scenes so they are also quite jarring & noticeable. there's no real horror or scares, in fact i would say interferencia is more of a thriller than a horror. as far as gore goes there are two decapitated heads in a fridge, a knife is stuck in someones mouth & nothing else.<br /><br />according to the imdb this had a budget of about $3,000 which makes interferencia one of the lowest budgeted films ever commercially released surely? some people think just because a film is low budget all reasonable viewing standards should go out of the window & we should accept any old crap, wrong! to watch this on dvd you will still have to pay good money & i personally think we have the right to expect some sort of good product. if this can get released & praised like it's oscar worthy then we can all release our holiday camcorder footage (including embarrassing karaoke footage & scenes of total blackness as we forgot to take off the lens cap) & win top prizes at the next cannes film festival! the acting is awful although the female lead virginia lustig is actually rather sexy & helps ease the pain of the final twenty odd minutes as she features a fair bit.<br /><br />interferencia is an absolutely terrible film, seriously i beg you don't be fooled by all the fake positive comments, there is no way anyone not involved in this or have some sort of agenda is going to give it a 9 or 10 out of 10. an amateurish mess that is truly horrible to sit through. sorry but that's the way i see it, sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind... you have been warned!
