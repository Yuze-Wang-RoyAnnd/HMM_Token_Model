previous tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. this one is from a guy in love with his own writing. it isn't inglorious, its disgusting.<br /><br />i absolutely hated inglorious basterds. the entire point of a film is to entertain - if u call bashing people's heads and removing their scalps entertaining!!!! - and if there is one unforgivable sin a movie can commit, it is extreme boredom or disgust.<br /><br />the movie is just a collection of endless and excruciatingly boring and disgusting scenes of people talking at tables in various languages. there is even one scene where 3 people talk for nearly 45 minutes at the same table, before, thankfully they are all shot. i wished they would have been killed off after 5 minutes. even woody allen knows when to shut the f**k up.<br /><br />this table talk style is a tarantino hallmark, but in other films, i actually cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking. here, i couldn't care less. all of quentin's films display an enormous confidence, particularly jackie brown. but here there is a pervasive feeling in every scene, tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film.<br /><br />is it violent? sure there's torture and scalping galore, but you'd have to remind me. thankfully, the film was so thin, i didn't even remember i had seen it earlier in the day when until i saw a review headline on msnbc.<br /><br />he's out of gimmicks and apparently dying to write a novel. but do us a favor qt and spare us the movie.<br /><br />i walked out of this movie halfway through and i would never recommend anyone seeing it no matter what a die-hard quarantino fan he or she is.<br /><br />i give it 0 / 10.
