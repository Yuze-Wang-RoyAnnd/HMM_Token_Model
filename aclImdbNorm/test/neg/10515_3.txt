ron hall pulls a triple threat as he writes, directs and stars in 'vampire assassins'. derek washington (hall) is your clich'ed cop-on-a-mission who finds himself up to his neck in some nasty vampire action. tossing away his badge he searches for the last vampire slayer (no not buffy!) to take back the streets and vanquish the bloodsuckers back to the grave.<br /><br />'vampire assassins' is a horrible film. it rips off so many other films (can you say blade?) that it never even attempts to establish it's own identity. the script is non existent. the action is horrible. who says a micro-budget stimulates creativity? there is nothing even remotely interesting here. you will get nothing out of this except a headache. stay away at all costs.
