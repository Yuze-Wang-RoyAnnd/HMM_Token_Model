here he is. a new horror icon for the new millennium. better than freddy. more dangerous than jason vorhees. more evil than michael myers. hard to believe, i know. but his time is here....<br /><br />ray the prick.<br /><br />yep, the antagonist, ray is a complete prick. this is partly because of the naughty things he does. also because he has a scar (oh, scary) on his face. but mainly because ray the prick has been milked.<br /><br />yep, ray doesn't channel evil. he doesn't even become cursed, not even by a voodoo spell. nope, ray the prick has been milked. as deniro once said, "you can milk anything with nipples". and ray has been milked. of evil.<br /><br />how do you milk evil you ask? snake nipples, i reply. snake nipples.<br /><br />why ray you ask? because he's a prick, i reply. capital p.<br /><br />watch out for the new line pictures extravaganza entitled "freddy vs. ray the prick".<br /><br />thought your new horror saviour was jeeper the creeper? well not any more, cause ray the prick is here. and i'm frightened.<br /><br />pity about the atmosphere-less, pg-13, unoriginal workmanlike quality of the film though, because ray's a star.
