strange, often effective hippie zombie flick, starring the unforgettable husband/wife team of alan and anya ornsby, this movie isn't as bad as most in its genre, but is still way high on the cheese-factor. includes several bargain-basement zombies, outrageously campy dialogue, a scene-chewing performance by alan ormsby, several gay/kinky grave-robbers, and one straange soundtrack. wife anya puts on a performance that's so odd, one has to wonder if she's really acting at all. there are much worst pics of this kind during the era (look for any al adamson flic), but it's no night of the living dead. director/writer "benjamin" clark, is really bob clark, who went on to create the purile "porky's" early 80's teen exploitation disasters. he has only now resurfaced after 1 inexplicably good movie ("a christmas story") to return to his dreadful ways with "baby geniuses". weirdo alan ormsby later wrote the kinky nastasia kinski/malcolm mcdowell version of "cat people". moocow says check this hippy horror movie out for fun, zombie frolics, and campy dialogue :=8)
