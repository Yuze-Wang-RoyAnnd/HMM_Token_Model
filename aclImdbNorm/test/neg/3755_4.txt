big fat slob 'uncle buck', played by john (eats-a-lot-of) candy, visits the sane members of his family for a week in order to baby-sit two cute kids (gaby hoffman and maccauley culkin) and a pretty but snobby teenager (jean louisa kelly). the shenanigans begin when buck makes breakfast and then tries to sleep in a bed two sizes too small for his blimp of a body. <br /><br />mostly dull, but peppered with two or three funny scenes including buck trying to get a word in edge-wise on the telephone with his angry girlfriend (amy madigan) and his meeting with a very disgusting clown.<br /><br />candy looks like he weighs 600 pounds.
