nothing to watch here. it's all been done (and better) before. who cares about this woman - deficient in every way - as a mother as a wife and as a friend? in one instant when she could have taken the high road - she jumped into re-addiction with both feet and held her breath - for no better a reason than "me, too!" if she wasn't the pretty and young person she portrays on screen - but looked more like the real human wreckage that is represented by our family members, neighbors and friends who really suffer from additions we'd change channels in a nanosecond.<br /><br />this movie starts out at the bottom and goes downhill. nothing redeeming, no lessons taught - nothing uplifting in any way. none of the main characters even evoke sympathy, let alone empathy. (well, maybe the snake.) i would have had more fun if i'd shut a door on my hand. who needs drivel like this?
