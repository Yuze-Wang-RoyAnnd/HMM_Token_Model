as i was flipping through the channel i came to a channel 124. it is an urban channel. i saw this movie on and decided to give it a try. i almost became a mass murderer due to this film. i have done home movies and they are oscar quality compared to this huge mass of dookie. the lighting was terrible and the acting was absolutely unrelentlessly bad. i would rather watch star crystal....... holy cow maybe that is not a good example. the main question i have about this film is... was it to be a morality film? the reason why i ask is because ther was one line where this lady in a wheelchair says " i would have been another gang statistic" oh my head is starting to hurt. after hearing that line i went into the kitchen and pulled out a knife ready to stab anyone who dared watch this movie. but some sense kicked in and i just changed the channel to watch the man with the afro paint. well that is all i have to say about this movie. if you want to endure this pain go ahead but not recommended for those with short fuses or a bad case of tourettes
