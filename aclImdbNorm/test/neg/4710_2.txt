i rented this movie because elijah wood has done some good work and i thought this might be an overlooked treasure. it was not a treasure. i don't know if this was straight to video, but it should have been straight to the dump.<br /><br />elijah wood fans will like the fact that he appears shirtless in a much-too-brief shower scene. but, no sane person would like this script. imagine memento played by teen actors, but ten times more confusing and a hundred times less plausible. case in point: janeane garofalo plays a caring psychologist (apparently `keeping the chain of mediocrity alive').<br /><br />as if false memories syndromes and mind-over-matter medicine weren't hokey enough, the movie also hinges on one of those unexplained psychic twin bonds that keep the plot moving and the audience baffled. this same twin bond creates a few too many contrived love scenes between wood's character and the girl from she's all that, who plays the saintly sister of wood's angry cancer-victim friend.<br /><br />adding to the triteness of this screenplay, wood's other friends are a mentally challenged cancer victim and kidney, a young black boy afflicted with a mysterious kidney disease. kidney's dying wish comes true when dr. garofalo gives him his own walkman. this character's hackneyed function in the story is matched by his on-again, off-again relationship to walking. usually bound to a wheelchair, kidney has several inexplicable scenes showing him pushing others around in it.<br /><br />kindey's characterization may be one small detail, but it is indicative of this film's many other flaws. the bumblebee flies anyway is definitely bumbling, but it never flies.
