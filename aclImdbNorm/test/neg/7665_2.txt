'airport 4' is basically a slopped together mess for universal studios to try and work a new twist - the concorde supersonic airliner - into their 'disaster-in-the-sky' formula.<br /><br />bogged down with unintentional humor, the best of which is when george kennedy sticks his hand out of concorde's window at supersonic speed to fire a flare gun at a heat-seeking missile following the aircraft's flight path, and the simple fact that these dumb passengers keep re-boarding the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air. many stars in this one including robert wagner, sylvia kristel, alain delon, and martha raye as a nervous passenger. <br /><br />not really related to the other 'airport' films.
