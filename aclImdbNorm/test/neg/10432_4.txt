i saw this on a screener dvd a couple months before it was released.<br /><br />i liked the main characters and the overall story but some scenes are pretty sloppy and confusing. the sets were fitting but a few just looked like left overs from freaks & geeks or reminded me of a cell phone commercial shot in a middle class home. definitely not what the dvd cover claims, "destined to be the next stoner classic", hardly.<br /><br />wardrobe and hairstyles are done well and yes, there are some really pretty girls in this, always nice to see a good looking cast.<br /><br />almost every scene contained guitar that just droned on and on. sound design was a bit poor. i think less would have been best.
