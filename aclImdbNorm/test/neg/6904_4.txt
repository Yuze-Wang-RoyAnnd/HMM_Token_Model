let's see... a couple dozen gary larson gags, as well as his illustration style, a possibly legally difficult wholesale appropriation of an aardman character, a more than generous sprinkling of art direction from various pixar films, positively lion king-esquire villains living in what amounts to an elephant's graveyard in the middle of farm country, oh, and a stinking' riverdance joke ten years after any possible relevance. the kids (three and five) liked it, but boy, it was a haul for dad. just another weak attempt from nickelodean films to hitch on to the animation explosion. i really, really wish they had spent a little more money on character design, on rendering, on a script, on a director.
