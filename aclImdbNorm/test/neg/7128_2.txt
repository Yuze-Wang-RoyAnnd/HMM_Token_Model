all the way though i was thinking to myself "oh god why!" at the very beginning i thought "right it might be average," but the acting and plot on most parts was atrocious.<br /><br />every part in it was so predictable, even though the first movie seemed to bare a large resemblance to the ring, it was a half decent movie, but this just seemed to take all the good things about the first and made them terrible. some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves, eg. the part were geller falls off the building had me in stitches. my girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down i was kept commenting on what was bound to happen next, and more times than less i was right.<br /><br />why does going into the house make her come after you, it doesn't make sense. it was a poor excuse for a lot of killings, and no really depth was seen at all.<br /><br />you can see everything coming, which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching. oh shes behind her ... didn't see that one coming *yawns*.<br /><br />surely these people must have thought to... oh i don't know, carry a knife round or at least try and fight back, instead of being eaten but someone hair? at best during the movie i was very mildly scared (and i mean mildly), i was just crying out for the credits, as they rolled i exhaled a short "oh thank god." if you haven't already, don't waste your' time and money on this; pointless, plot less, sorry excuse for a sequel!
