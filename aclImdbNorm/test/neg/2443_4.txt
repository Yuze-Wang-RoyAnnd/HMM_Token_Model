miserable film. not even to be compared in one breath with "to kill a mockingbird," or "in the heat of the night."<br /><br />yes, there is racial prejudice but the film is at most ridiculous. <br /><br />come now. would you really have elizabeth patterson, of all people, guarding a jail so as to avoid a lynching? patterson, in her day, played everyone's mother and was the landlady in "i love lucy" before fred and ethel mertz bought the building.<br /><br />imagine exhuming the body so that it will not come out that the black man's gun killed a white man?<br /><br />claude jarman jr., who was so fabulous in 1946's "the yearling" appears in this mess. he still had those sad eyes. my eyes would be sad too if i appeared in this awful film.<br /><br />to me, this was nothing more than a faulkner flop all the way.
