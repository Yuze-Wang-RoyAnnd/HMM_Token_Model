this movie is simply bad. first of all the story is just weird and it's not good written. it leaves you with questions when you're finished. sometimes that's ok, but not in this case.<br /><br />the acting is nothing to write home about. the adults does a ok job, but the kids, taken in consideration they are kids, does not a good job. i thought the lead role, ian costello as mickey, was worst. well, to be honest i'm not sure that was the lead role. never quite figured who this movie was about. mickey or pete.<br /><br />there were some shots that stood out, but over all there were nothing exiting about the cinematography. the sound, however, was better. there was a nice score. a little adventure kind of score, though this didn't look like an adventure film to me. it had some elements of an adventure film, but it was more of a drama. however, it was hard to tell who this film was meant for. children? hardly. there is too much language and violence for that. adults? i don't know. it had to many elements of a children's movie in it. it was like a adult movie in a children movie wrapping.<br /><br />the story was just weird. i don't have much of an idea of what it really was about. you was thrown right in to it without knowing anything, but there were all the time references to something you felt you should know. the fact that the children's parents were dead for instance and that mickey blamed pete for it. you expected to get to know what happened , but you never got.<br /><br />all together this movie was bad and a waste of time. there was no drive in it. nothing to really move the story forward. this is not what you spend your saturday night on.
