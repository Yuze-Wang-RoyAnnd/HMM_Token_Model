i borrowed this on dvd from a friend the other day. i didn't really know what to expect. i haven't seen a lot of russian movies, and i don't think i've ever seen a russian war movie. maybe that made me expect something different, something more along the line of an imagined russian mentality. but whatever those expectations came from, they were put to shame as this is a quite ordinary war movie.<br /><br />the whole formula of following a few young people from their recruitment, through training, to deployment and through some battles, is well known. we have seen it done both many years ago, as well as more recently (as with jarhead). sure, there's a difference here because the movie is about russian soldiers instead of americans as is almost always the case. but in general this could just as easily have been a vietnam-movie. i guess that just underscores my feeling that afghanistan was the soviet unions vietnam. a country that should have been a pushover for a superpower made the war drag on for years with terrible loss of life both for soldiers and civilians.<br /><br />the good points in this movie i felt were good photography (there are some beautiful ambiance shots) and decent effects for what i guess must have been a rather low budget movie. what made me disappointed is mostly the story itself. it just doesn't manage to stir any emotion in me. mostly because the character development is lousy. and to really feel something when people are gunned down you have to make them people, not just faceless cardboard cutouts. they fail to do that in this movie. also it's overly long, and that seems to a kind of trend lately. in my opinion a movie that's more than two hours long has to have a lot to offer, and this movie doesn't cut it. also there is a disturbing music that's put like a wet blanket over every scene. especially in the action scenes this is highly disturbing, not that you need action-music but something more than just slow keyboard-music would be nice. otherwise the production values were good enough, that was not where the problem was.<br /><br />i don't know how to view this movie. as a reminder of the fact that no matter where you are, war sucks? that russian film-makers have already watched too many american war-movies to make something original? regardless of which, this movie is rather clich'ed, lacks in spirit and while it has acceptable technical qualities, it lacks in script and character development. in the end it just becomes another of all those war-movies that fails to make you think, and fails to add something to the genre. i've seen a lot worse, but a lot better too. i rate this 4/10.
