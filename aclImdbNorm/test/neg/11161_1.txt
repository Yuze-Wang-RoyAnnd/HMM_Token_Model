the whole set-up of this contrived disney family film (ad-exec gets his teenage daughter a horse because she "wants one more than anything else in the world") is just an excuse to film the big climactic horse-show at the end. all the other ingredients (the ad campaign for the stomach pill, kurt russell as a potential boyfriend for the youngster, lloyd bochner as a potential rival for dean jones over the affections of diane baker) are shelved near the end simply to showcase the horse. over half the picture is padding, and worse: it is whiny and obnoxious. the kid is the ninny-sort who cries on the couch with a dog in her arms, and as usual she gets her way. * from ****
