i've seen this movie n i can say that this is really a bad movie. the director's gone nuts... of course.. he does know a lot about the army, but then he certainly is a cheap guy. there are a lotta technical flaws in the movies as well...<br /><br />okay... here's my doubt- in the end when they rescue the family (including a girl who was just raped)... why do they leave them there outside their place? i didn't see any ambulance around! there are a lot of aspects in the movie that are real... but then i just wish the major had narrated/helped/assisted some other good director n made the movie.<br /><br />mohanlal surely does deserve a better director!
