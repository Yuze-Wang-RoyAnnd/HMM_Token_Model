i can't believe the amount of reviewers who praise this as realistic. i'm a million miles from being an expert, and i'm never going to climb a mountain; but even the very basic knowledge attained from reading into thin air, and watching everest beyond the limit and a few other everest docs meant that this film just got more and more ridiculous as it went on. there is some good climbing footage at the start; and when the billionaire mission leader asks early in the film "how much experience above 8000 metres do you have?", i was encouraged to hope that this might be a gritty and accurate man-vs-nature odyssey. instead you have a bunch of climbers zooming up a mountain with no acclimatisation; climbing with goggles off in full sun, and they are barely ever out of breath performing miraculous feats of endurance. only near the summit is a little fatigue suggested, to dramatically accentuate the physical feat of climbing such a monstrous peak, almost as an afterthought. if you have no knowledge of mountaineering, give it a look: be prepared for some clich'ed heroics (although no more clich'ed than a hundred other passably diverting flicks), and a clich'ed outcome. i've been developing a minor fascination with high mountains and was looking forward to watching k2; but other than some amazingly beautiful scenery, it was a let down because it was so far removed from reality. i can imagine some experts being employed in the making of this movie, but then being conveniently ignored in the pursuit of the heroic, and sadly fantastical storyline. also, you would sound like a bit of a tit if you said "welcome to the death zone" at 200000 feet.
