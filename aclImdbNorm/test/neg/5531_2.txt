corny and horrible, i was not surprised this short lived show didn't make it. i remember fondly when tales from the crypt tried reusing these corny episodes like they were actually scary. coupled with bad acting and lousy music, i was surprised this crummy showed was ever conceived. it never showed up again, and one can only be thankful for this circumstance.
