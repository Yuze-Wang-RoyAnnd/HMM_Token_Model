i bought this film on dvd despite the "stale" review and that was idiotic... that review was completely accurate and i have never seen any worse "erotic" film in my long life! even if it partly was lovely filmed and had interesting surroundings, plus a nice cover... but my own extreme erotica (c) films are over 100 times more erotic (just in the soft delicious aspect) with probably less than 100 times of this films budget! the story have no logical connection with the first film or the famous book... or any new (exciting) element of slave training, except some very strange and sad developments... then did the main male character - klaus kinski - not look a bit like the second master of "o" he try to play... and not even lovely arielle dombasle, did look delicious in any scene!
