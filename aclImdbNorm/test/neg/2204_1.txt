this movie is such a piece of unbelievable crap. first let me talk about the pros: sandra bullock in a black bathing suit.<br /><br />now the rest of the story which is all pretty much bad. we have said computer programmer angela bennett (who's online profile is angel - how witty!!! i bet the directors cheered over that one for an hour) who basically checks other company's software for errors/glitches etc. so we start with her ordering pizza on the internet and then putting on a fireplace on her monitor (extreme computer skills shown thus far). this is after she finds some virus on a macintosh program which crashes the whole system after hitting the escape key. this is apparently a huge problem yet the virus created to do such could be done in about 1 minute with a simple batch file.<br /><br />any event, we move on. she gets this call from some other bloke (that works at the same company) and this fool says to go click this symbol which apparently opens up some secret internet gateway to a bunch of unprotected 'top secret' data woohoo! angela saves this crap on a disc and now the people that created this loophole are out to get her. this of course is only after she hooks up with one of the bad guys only before he tries to kill her before she jumps in the ocean off his boat, before she winds up in a random hospital.<br /><br />problem #1: you can't create a loophole on the internet to gain access to a bunch of top secret fbi data. where the hell did this come from? since when can a group of hackers control the basic flow of the internet (even in 95)? problem #2: angela would need proper identification before a hospital or clinic would release her. she could not just pack her things and go.<br /><br />then these 'hackers' or whatever change angela's id so she can't get help from anyone and conveniently enough all her id is gone. so she returns home and a cat and mouse chase goes on and on and on.<br /><br />apparently all police and fbi people are stupid and don't believe her. so then she has to utilize a bunch of tactics to enter into the building where she works (where the person who is now filling in for her is) and get back to her old computer. she starts talking to some other random bloke and finds out who is behind everything through some bs ip address that the director knows the audience is too stupid enough to believe.<br /><br />then she runs to some center to mail all this information to the fbi. she apparently has to use a mainframe to email stuff to the fbi. but then the same fool that tried to kill her before throwing her in the water catches her and easily hacks into the fbi again (wtf?). but remember that cool virus? well somehow she luckily gets that and even though the virus only worked on software, it now works on the entire system too. it brings down the whole mainframe which has all the fake information because the mainframe was just sitting in the middle of some convention... what the hell is this crap! anyway, the now uber virus works and angela (the real one now) runs away and later kills the evil dude with a fire extinguisher. he of course has a gun, runs up to her so he's like 2 feet away and then decides to aim. classic hollywood.<br /><br />all in all this movie is so full of bs and crap. anyone who doesn't know a lot about computers will be wildly fooled into thinking this crap is possible but not one thing is accurate concerning computers or the net. and i honestly doubt i'd see a multiplatform virus for mac and a mainframe computer (*cough lmao*).
