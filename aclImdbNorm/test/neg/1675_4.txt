when this movie was made in 1980, i was a teenager in the football stands playing as part of the audience. this was done at mooseheart, illinois. the big letters spelling out "mooseheart" at the top of the stands were covered up with a banner in the movie. the director would tell us to cheer loudly at certain points, as if a touchdown was being made. st. charles juvenile correction center is a real place less than 30 miles from mooseheart, although i think it may have closed down recently. during one scene, they show a black woman and a white man in the audience watching the game. right below them, you can see my sister noel's head (she was 11 at the time). in the vhs version, i can only see the top of her head, but when i saw it on tv in 1981 i could see her whole head and my sister jacqui as well.<br /><br />i thought the movie itself was ok for a made for tv movie. since there's already a description of the movie here, i need not repeat it. it's worth seeing at least once.
