if this movie had a point i never discovered it. a very depressing movie which supposedly is about the final evacuation of the residents living in a dam site area on the northfork river in montana. the problem is that there is no actual northfork river in montana. there are several north forks but they are branches of other rivers which divided into north and south forks.<br /><br />	the opening scene of the movie is a coffin bobbing to the surface of the lake but the scene is never tied into the story and the viewer is left to speculate as to its meaning. but much is left to the viewer's speculation in the movie. another example is when a team of dam employees responsible for the evacuation of the residents arrives at the dam headquarters, another group of people are departing. some remark which is almost inaudible is made about these people which makes no sense whatsoever and there is no followup in the movie to explain it.<br /><br />	the movie is butchered into several stories and the film keeps switching back and forth between stories which is quite disconcerting. and the stories are weird. in one of them the occupants of one property refuse to be evacuated because they are living in a home that is built like noah's ark.<br /><br />	another senseless story centers around a sick orphan who is dying and somehow he is sharing his presence with a house full of ghosts and in an orphanage with a priest at the same time. if anyone can figure out what the ghost story was about the author must have explained it to them.<br /><br />	the scenery was stark and the sun never shines. there are snowy mountains in the far distance. i guess the purpose was to set the mood. the time period is set by the fact that the evacuaters all drove ford sedans of the 1946-48 era although the events are supposed to have occurred in 1955. the acting was mediocre. when i saw the billing for this movie it said that darryl hannah was in the picture. if she was, i didn't recognize her but i surmise that she was the ghost lady.
