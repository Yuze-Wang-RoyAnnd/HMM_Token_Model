i made it through half of this, but was not enough of a masochist to see it all. the first half of the film had next to no dialog ! almost everything was voice over commentary to carry the story. the scriptwriter forgot that sometimes less is more and tried to explain several millennium of detailed history in the voice over. at the same time he forgot to do any character development. most science fiction fans don't require huge amounts of character development, but it would be nice to know why the two main characters who survived the destruction of the space fleet together ended up fighting each other. <br /><br />there are some good things going on in the film. the soundtrack was well done. some of the computer generated graphics are very good, but others were just mediocre.
