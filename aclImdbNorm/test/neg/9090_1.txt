i was reading in a stuff magazine about some of the goriest, bloodiest films that asia had to offer and i immediately jumped to netflix to quench my thirst. boy what a mistake i made. this movie is one of the worst films i have seen. first and foremost no plot, what i expected to be the plot (see: "revenge") turned into a series of events just happening in a effort to spend their special effects budget of $14.89 and waste studio time. they should have kept their money and not wasted their time nor yours.<br /><br />when a major plot twist occurs, tetsuo ii: body hammer is given a new identity and i wasn't buying it. a flashback is given that should answer our questions, but seemed to me like i turned on showtime at 3:47 am and dropped acid. the movie continues and spirals out of control with cheesy graphics and special (olympic) effects.<br /><br />do i seem bitter about this film? yes. did i see iron man? no. was there a plot? no. was it so symbolic that i didn't understand? no. was there a body hammer? beats the hell out of me. so take my advice and stay away!!!!!! <br /><br />(i must admit though i have had so much fun writing this and laughing to myself about this film that if you want to laugh, watch it!!!)
