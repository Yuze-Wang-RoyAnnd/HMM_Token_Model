hello - i normally love movies. i'm 19, i have seen many and dislike only one or two. this one though, the second it finished, i had to pull my sister (who had wanted to see it) out by the arm and i burst into tears of laughter as soon as i got out because it was such a ridiculously awful movie. <br /><br />why it was awful: - all the cows had udders, especially bothersome were the male ones with udders - none of the characters were unique or engaging, except perhaps the main coyote dag - the idea of cows keeping watch against coyotes is just ridiculous - the 'funny' moments are repetitive and become simply a sequence to out-do the last one - the themes of working together, which should have been present at the end, were nonexistent. instead, people get the impression: well, i'll take this all upon myself, and in this case i was lucky that my friends decided to back me up without my knowledge - all the moments similar to the lion king (as mentioned below) were beyond corniness, even for a kid's movie<br /><br />and...the worst of all... it parallels the lion king in every single way responsible father figure who is killed by coyotes (the coyotes are essentially the hyenas, with dag, the lead coyote, being the equivalent of scar) the farm falls into chaos, odis (the cow, though basically simba) wants to play around, and is shocked that his dad died, believes it was his fault (even though in this movie, it was his fault), confronts the coyotes and gets an ass whooping, after which dag tells him to leave, and on the verge of leaving, odis somehow decides to go and save some chickens and his friends back him up (by complete surprise of course, he leaves without knowing they will come help him). <br /><br />other things taken from lion king: stars moving around as signs, father figures referring to stars/signs in a mystical loving way, the obviously circularness of how the father ben found odis and took care of him, and how at the end odis' love interest gives birth and he has a similar experience. birth at the end? good god, what the hell... and even similar type music, which seems completely tacked on at the end because it is completely different from all the previous music.<br /><br />honestly, this is the first movie i have ever seen where i really was rooting for the bad guys - i never understood what other people were saying, until now.<br /><br />bottom line: don't waste your time to go see this. convince the kids not to see it, and re-watch the lion king. either that, or take them to see the ant bully, which was creative and artistic.
