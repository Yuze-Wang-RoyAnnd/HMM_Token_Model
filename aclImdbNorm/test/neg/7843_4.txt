this film must have done well in the box office, in order to give gator the budget it deserves. this film had no budget, needed a script rewrite, and a better ending. there is flashes of brilliance in this movie. the boat ride scene, burt driving the mean machine, and his chat with his parents. you can tell burt is a southerner, and not a actor. this movie shows what gator would be like, burt's best film. too, bad this film did not have the same funding and was done on the rush. 4/10
