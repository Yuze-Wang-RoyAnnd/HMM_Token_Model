just saw this at the madison horror film festival and was disappointed. a few shocking, funny moments (fisting the hollow carla, a urinating harpy in the dreamland) and two competing interesting premises (similar to new nightmare with belief bringing a mythical character to life and also lost highway with a man living out a fantasy in his head) but had long stretches of no movement and incoherent plot development. just because you use the framework of dreams or a mental fugue state doesn't make it lynchian. you need the compelling visuals and creepy performances.<br /><br />positive things: dr. maitland had real comic timing and all the girls were very cute. carla's father, chalmers, and ingrid pitt looked like they were having some fun. and tom savini at least looked like he had his lines memorized and we couldn't see if he was just reading cue cards.<br /><br />i get the hammer references, but it looks like the director realized the script was a snoozer and just added some shocks to try and get some laughs out of whatever footage he could put together. but they don't work because they're too few and far between and create an inconsistent tone. condense this to 30 minutes of all the fun parts and you could have a surreal goofy short, but at feature length, skip it. it's not "so bad it's good" it's just "so bad it's boring".
