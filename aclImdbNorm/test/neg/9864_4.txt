as long as you keep in mind that the production of this movie was a copyright ploy, and not intended as a serious release, it is actually surprising how not absolutely horrible it is. i even liked the theme music.<br /><br />and if ever a flick cried out for a treatment by joel (or mike) and the mst3k bots, this is it! watch this with a bunch of smart-ass wise-crackers, and you're in for a good time. have a brew, butter up some large pretzels, and enjoy.<br /><br />of course, obtaining a copy requires buying a bootleg or downloading it as shareware, but if you're here on the imdb, then you're most likely savvy enough to do so. good luck.<br /><br />and look for my favorite part....where dr. doom informs the ff that they have 12 hours to comply with his wishes....and he actually gestures the number "12" with his finger while doing so....it's like "evil sesame street"....hoo boy.<br /><br />...and of course mrs. storm declaring "just look at you....the fanstastic four" is just so heartwarming....you'll laugh, you'll cry.....<br /><br />so if you love schlocky sci-fi, this one's fantastic for you!
