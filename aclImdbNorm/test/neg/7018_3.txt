lucille ball cannot sing or act or dance. this makes the quality of her performance in mame all the more dreadful. she's not allowed to do the low-brow slapstick that made her a hit on tv so she has to rely on building a character. unfortunately, ms. ball never learned that skill as none of the tender moments have any warmth. how does she really feel about patrick or beau? we never really believe the words she says. that vacant stare of ms. ball is suppose to convince us she is emoting but there is no chemistry between her and bruce davidson, robert preston or bea arthur at all. for this reason every scene she's in is flat.<br /><br />moreover, when ms. ball opens her mouth to sing we are immediately made aware of the reason why the studios dubbed her voice for every other musical she starred in earlier in her career. it was stated that she demanded her voice be used so this is a mistake of ego as well as leadership. it is made worse when she is singing in voice-over and she has to "act the moment" without words. whoever thought that would work forgot who was playing mame.<br /><br />i understand that rosalind russell did the role on stage and in the film auntie mame. also, i am aware that angela lansbury won a tony for her performance in the original 1966 broadway musical. neither of these women were known for their singing voices, but both could have pulled this off better than lucille ball. why they went with her is the worst in blatant miscasting.<br /><br />the only person that gets out unscathed is bea arthur. she's big and wonderful, catty and common in all the right amounts. unfortunately, you keep waiting for this movie to take off and invite you to join in on the fun. but the film never does and you can't. no one besides bea arthur appears to be having any fun.<br /><br />an additional bad review goes to director gene saks. saks is known as an award-winning director of musicals and comedies for stage and screen, including the broadway musical this film is based on. none of that skill and expertise is of aid here. the poor editing and storytelling quailty in this movie is beneath a director of his caliber. that glaring error in the execution of the movie is not the fault of ms. ball.
