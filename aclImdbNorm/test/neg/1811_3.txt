to be honest, i've never been to the congo or even africa, and after watching the made for television movie heart of darkness, i do not think i'd want to. the movie completely shames the book to the highest level possible. though the book was not the best i have read, after watching the movie, i seemed to appreciate the book a hundred times more. nicolas roeg, the director of the movie, did a horrible job portraying joseph conrad's novella into a movie. i give roeg some credit for trying to attempt the impossible by making the book into a movie, but this may not have been the job for him. the movie was unsuccessful to express any part of the novella other than the basics of the plot. the set and scenery also lacked the beauty conrad portrayed of africa in the book. in the book marlow had seen so many great wonders, but in the movie you did not get that same experience. no, i'm not blaming everything on the director; the acting in the film was just terrible. all of the actors were dull and uninteresting. throughout the whole movie i felt as if the actors were not putting forth any emotions, as if they were reading from the script the entire time. tim roth, who plays marlow, did not portray marlow's sense of adventure for his journey into the congo well. marlow's journey to find kurtz was supposed to venturesome, but i didn't experience that in the movie. i would not recommend watching this movie, especially if you have read the book already. it does not come close to doing justice for joseph conrad's novella. conrad's words capture the reader and take them on the journey with marlow, on his quest to find mr. kurtz, where as the film did not. a great novella, but a very poor film. heart of darkness, the movie, is based on the book written by joseph conrad also called heart of darkness.
