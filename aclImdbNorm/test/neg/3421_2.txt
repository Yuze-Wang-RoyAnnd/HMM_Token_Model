this movie illustrates like no other the state of the australian film industry and everything that's holding it back.<br /><br />awesome talent, outstanding performances (particularly by victoria hill), but a let down in practically every other way.<br /><br />an "adaptation" of sorts, it brought nothing new to macbeth (no, setting it in present-day australia is not enough), and essentially, completely failed to justify its existence, apart from (let's face it, completely unnecessarily) paying homage to the original work. if there's one body of work that has been done (and done and done and done), it's shakespeare's. so any adaptation, if it's not to be a self-indulgent and pointless exercise, needs to at least bring some new interpretation to the work.<br /><br />and that's what this macbeth fails to do. as it was done, this film has no contemporary relevance whatsoever. it's the same piece that we have seen countless (too many!) times before. except with guns and in different outfits.<br /><br />apart from the fundamental blunder (no other way to put it) of keeping the original shakespearian dialogue, one of the more cringeful moments of the movie is the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot out towards the end, during which i completely tuned out, even though i was looking at the screen. i never thought i had a short attention span, but there you go.<br /><br />i suppose the movie succeeds on its own, very limited terms. but as australia continues to produce world-class acting talent, its movie-makers need to stop being proud of succeeding on limited terms, and actually set high enough standards to show that they respect for the kind of acting talent they work with.<br /><br />a shame. an absolute shame.
