i really don't understand who this movie is aimed at. from just the absurdity of it, not to mention the ridiculously bad acting, cheesy dialogue, and the fact that the villain is a child, i'd assume this was meant to be a children's movie... but i think there may be more swear words than pulp fiction, not to mention constant references to drugs and general mayhem and killing-so which demographic is it trying to please? this movie is too schizophrenic, like trying to combine country music with heavy metal, in the end no one is going to like it because it's a bloody paradox. i would recommend this movie because it's so funny (in a bad way) except the actors are so patently unbearable that i wouldn't want to suggest otherwise.<br /><br />i'm completely serious when i say that i could not watch more than 15 minutes of this. terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiible
