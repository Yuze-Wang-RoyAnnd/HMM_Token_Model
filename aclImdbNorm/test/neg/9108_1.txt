this is so bad it will be my contribution to the next bad movie party i go to. it is clear from the start that steve gutenburg was taking this role seriously.... the other principles were walking through their lines. i think they got a whiff of how much it stank early on and they were going through the motions for their paychecks. sean bean "acted" as usual but was spared sharing space on screen with any of the principles till the final scene where it was like an actor walking onto a high school stage that is how defined the contrast was. some actors do not look good scruffy. some actors should not bulk up for a part. those two statements apply to "police academy" steve. his scruffy look translates to bum and indigent and his bulking up makes him look potato lumpy not buff. pair that with one of the worst scripted dialogues in hollywood history and you have bad movie. i can only guess that all of the principles really really needed the money for remodeling or something or their agents signed them before the script was written by the monkeys that must of typed it out. i would love to know the back story to this disaster.
