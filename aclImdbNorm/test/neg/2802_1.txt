i was in blockbuster and i saw a film called "dark harvest". the cover art looked great, the plot wasn't that bad, and the tagline (you reap what you sow) made the movie look pretty good. but i was dumb that day, because i did something i should have never done. i rented a "straight to video independent horror film" walking out with my much better rentals, i went home, popped dark harvest in the dvd player and it began. i figured i would watch the trailer after the film was done (bad idea) but went ahead and watched it anyway. now to the review.*possible spoilers* first off, the acting by the "kids" sucks, and the scene when the 2 (main characters) are talking, the lighting sucks, and the buildings even look fake! now they go to this house, where sean connel's (i think he's the main character, i don't care) relatives lived there. all of a sudden one by one, they all start getting killed by...(gasp) a killer scarecrow!!!! ahhh!!!!! the scarecrow is obviously the definition of low budget, and the scenes where the scarecrow is computerized looks so fake it's hilarious. it makes dinosaur noises and everything! and then at the end...they shoot the scarecrow with a gun (that is red for god's sake and looks like it was purchased at a local family dollar) and it pauses for a while and then.....(gasp) blows up!!!!!!<br /><br />save yourself some time, i'm telling you this movie sucks. if you need to pass an hour and a half, look at the wall, because looking at the wall is a+ fun compared to this disaster. it is quite funny though.<br /><br />overall grade: f if there was anything lower **f-** than i would give it that.
