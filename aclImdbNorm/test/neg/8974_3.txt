having some idle time before going to work, i looked at my "50 movie pack comedy classics" dvd collection and picked the most obscure title in the pack: zis boom bah starring a forgotten grace hayes. "classics" is obviously the operative word here since most of the titles i've never heard of and i suspect they're all in the public domain. anyway, this movie also stars her son peter lind and his wife mary healy (who i just found out is a new orleans native from the state i live in, louisiana) with benny rubin as a malt shop proprietor and huntz hall, taking a break from the east side kids, as peter's buddy. the plot, about a vaudeville mother trying to turn her rich carefree son into a responsible one with him unaware of who she is, is for the birds and doesn't have many funny scenes though i did like peter's celebrity impersonations and his dance with hall in drag. and the songs and dances are entertaining in themselves. rubin, however, is all over the place with his confusion of the american vernacular of the time and almost everything concerning him makes no sense whatsoever (though i did like his funny dance). since this was only 61 minutes that i'm sure played on the lower-half of the double feature bill, i'll be charitable and give this one a 3 for the few entertaining bits that i mentioned enjoying.
