this film is boring, boring, boring, boring, and boring!!! it's not the worse film i ever saw, on the contrary, but.......how shall i put this.......it's boring! there is some very nice scenery and some clever dry wit but that's about it. if it was advertised as a travelogue i would rate it a 7 but it's supposed to be a film with a plot, some drama, and for god's sake a point or a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />i read some of the comments on this board about this films and i wondered if they saw the same movie as i did.<br /><br />see this film (yawn) at your own risk........one thing for sure- it really is rated correctly= g rating! (which most stand for god awful boring!)
