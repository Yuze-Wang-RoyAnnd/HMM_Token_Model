i don't even know where to begin...<br /><br />it's is not worth typing a review so i will just quote what another user posted because i agree thoroughly, but i give it 1 / 10 instead of 2 / 10 "i am at a loss to find the words to express how bad i thought this film was. the initial precept was promising, but in all respects afterwards it was totally awful. let's run through the main points. plot - good initial idea but truly terrible development. there were many points when i thought "no, nobody would do something that stupid". the ending was amazingly anticlimactic. characterisation - all of the characters were either completely bland or grotesque caricatures. i keep trying to think of one that wasn't - possibly the mother, but that's it. music - intrusive, inappropriate and generally terrible. direction - totally amateurish. cinematography - doubt they've heard of it. camera angles / stability / zoom levels often really bad. i am totally bemused at how this film has scored so highly. it's the worst movie i've seen at the cinema for years, if not ever."
