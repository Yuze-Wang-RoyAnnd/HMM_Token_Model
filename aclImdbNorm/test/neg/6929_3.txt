i have loved the book "a little princess" for most of my life, and was very excited that there was a movie. but i was appalled at this adaptation. not only is the acting wooden, and the plot a convoluted mish mash of various incidents in the book, but the theme is all wrong. the real theme of the story should be that a girl can be a princess only when she behaves like one, as sara does when she gives 5 of her 6 buns to a beggar child, even when she herself is very hungry. the theme of the movie seems to be that all girls are princesses, which cheapens sara's actions considerably, and seems more like it should be written on a hallmark card than applied to this story.<br /><br />there are many other things wrong with this movie- too many to list, but here are just a few of the larger ones: this story should be set in britian in the mid 1800s, not america during the first world war. miss minchen is harsh to sara from the start, making her actions when sara is left penniless much less startling than they would be if she was syrupy sweet at the beginning, as she is supposed to be. nowhere is it mentioned that becky is black. sara's father does *not* come back, he is dead. it is his closest friend, and collaborator in the diamond mines who finds sara, and restores her to her proper place. in fact, the diamond mines are not even mentioned at all, though they are the source of sara's wealth.<br /><br />all through everything that sara has faced, she always acts like a princess, giving what she can, and forgiving those who hurt her. she would never have called lavinia a "snotty two faced bully". such a thing is completely out of character for her, and undermines the entire philosophy that she is to be well behaved no matter what.<br /><br />this is by far the worst adaptation of a book to the screen that i have ever seen (with the notable exceptions of "ella enchanted", and "anne of green gables the continuing story")the plot of the book is wonderful, and skillfully written, so i do not understand why the director felt that it needed to be changed to make it interesting. i would suggest that anyone wishing to know this story should watch the 1987 version, which is far superior. or better still, read the book. it will be more worth your time than the hour and a half wasted on this version on the movie.
