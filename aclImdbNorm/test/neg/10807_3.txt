now i did watch this when it first came out on vhs, and all my friends and i thought it was a pretty good movie, but then again, we were teenagers. but honestly, not that good of a movie in retrospect. sort of a hair metal, dokken version of carnival of souls. but a bad movie does not exactly mean it is unwatchable; however, this one seems to lack the charm a lot of the regular mst3k fodder usually contains. but if it was on cable, and i was bored and drinking beer--sure, i'd watch it again. but then again, i've watched howling vii about five times now, so maybe you really shouldn't be listening to me.<br /><br />anyone else think it kind of sad that the director supposedly commented on his own movie? and why did he feel the urge to use caps lock so much?
