i just finished watching disappearances at afi fest 2006 with about 30 other people in a mostly vacant 1000 seat auditorium. the festival programmer, after seeing the lack of audience, started his opening comments with, "well at least a few of those attending the festival have good taste in film". well mr. programmer, after watching this film i must answer back "no we don't, and either do you!" this "back-woods" period piece follows young (not so) wild bill as he and his mystic family dangerously run illegal canadian whiskey across the border during america's prohibition. the old-time outlaws (kris kristofferson and company) not only need the money to save their ramshackle vermont farm but want to introduce little wild bill to the virtues of manhood.<br /><br />although handsomely photographed, this adventure story lacks what makes films of this sort good, "tension" and believability. kristofferson's lackluster performance and dry monologue reminds me of a dream i once had where al gore was playing the role of willy wonka. i just didn't care and when wild bills mystic grandmother appears out of thin air to give him advice it just didn't fit. yes, i almost fell asleep more than once.<br /><br />gary farmer does do a good job as the cameron frye in ferris bueller character; brother-in-law of big bill while the teenage chris mcdermott does uses those piercing blue eyes to his acting benefit.<br /><br />but overall expect to see jay cravens disappearances playing at a block buster $2 bin near you.
