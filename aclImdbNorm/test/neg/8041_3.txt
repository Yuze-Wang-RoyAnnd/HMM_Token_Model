i would think that this was one of those films whose director hadn't read the book it was based on, were it not for the fact that they are just slightly similar. it is certainly possible for a great film to be "based" very loosely on a book and this was certainly the latter but not the former.<br /><br />there were a number of flaws. one was that it tried to be too much like the railway children, probably because adults would expect this, being from the same author. another is that it also sought to be too like harry potter, down to the music and in overemphasizing the setting. i have nothing against j k rowling or the films but the book is just nothing like the harry potter ones. i thought the psammead, though very well voiced by eddie izzard and in character too, was almost gratuitously in a totally inappropriate environment. i may have missed something here, as the comments made about one of the characters' own books may have been a reference to the inaccuracy of the adaptation. there was also no need for the extra characters, and today's special effects could easily have been used to tell the story as it was written, but they weren't.<br /><br />i saw this film with my two children, one of whom knows the book and the other of whom doesn't. the one who does know it thought it was all right but wasn't as enthusiastic as the one who doesn't. i'm not sure what this means.
