without doubt, one of the worst films ever made. sluggish and without structure, tension or story, the film coasts on the thin premise of "putting together a show". conflicts are resolved within two or three seconds of their inception and dialogue is random and incidental. everything is put together in a slapdash order and often "stepping out" feels more like a deleted scenes reel than an actual movie. the film seems to exist merely as a showcase for gaudy and totally random liza musical numbers. shelly winters can be seen in the far superior octo-epic "tentacles", and the real liza can be found in the showtime release of "queer duck: the movie".
