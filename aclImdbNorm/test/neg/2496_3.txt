the united states built the atomic bomb in order to show their superior military power and to end the second world war. the movie fat man and little boy is a portrayal of the efforts of american physicists to invent the technology necessary to create the bomb, and the tension that existed between the scientists and the military over the potential uses of the bomb, and even the acceptability of its creation. the scientists thought that the bomb should be created as a deterrent, a mechanism that would halt the war by wasting as little life as possible. fist, they saw themselves as in a race with german scientists, who were attempting to build nuclear weapons themselves. when the germans were defeated, many scientists hoped to stop work on the bomb project, as they knew that the japanese did not have the technology necessary to build a nuclear weapon, and therefore did not pose a threat of massive loss of life. those who favored the continuation of the manhattan project hoped that the bomb would be used as a demonstration, inviting the japanese head of state to view its deployment upon some tiny deserted island. this massive display of force, they felt, would be enough to win the war-no killing would be needed. the us military, under the direction of general leslie groves, hoped all along to used the bomb as a actual weapon to be deployed against the enemy, first against the germans and then against the japanese. because of the persistence of japanese soldiers on the small japanese islands, the us decided to drop the bomb on populous cities in order to end the war, first hiroshima and then nagasaki. the display of that vast amount of force also served notice to the rest of the world that the us was the dominant military power, a message aimed especially at russia, whose growing military power and economic weight in eurasia threatened our preeminent world position. fat man and little boy was a movie that had good intentions in mind, but muddled them rather badly by the choice of actors, script, and cinematography. one of the main points of the movie was the struggle between the military view of science for killing, and the scientific view of science for knowledge. the keystone of this conflict is the continued disagreements between general groves and dr. oppenheimer. mr. newman does his job in the part of the general, craggy, massively angry, and radiating his dependence upon the success of the project. dwight schultz, on the other hand, never puts up much resistance at all to the general's demands, always looking rather weak, deflated, and phlegmatic in his audiences. john cusack presents a stunningly unsympathetic character in as flat a role as i have ever seen-it looks like he is just reading his lines. laura dern seems to be suffering from the same malady. none of the characters are helped by the script, which is almost childishly ridiculous in the way it attempts to explain scientific concepts unscientifically, offers the most unrealistic stock relationship between mr. cusack and ms. dern imaginable, doesn't even give us the cheap thrill of watching the army drop nuclear bombs on japan, and relies heavily on voice-over-a technique that is evil anytime, even when explaining a characters true innermost thoughts, or for the narration of something that cannot be possibly show on the film medium, but is used here to read some absolutely trite selections out of cusack's diary. the cinematographer offers us several shots of the ominous shadow of the two bombs, which might be striking if it didn't look like they were cardboard cutouts instead of bombs, the fake atomic fire really does look fake-and why use it when the stock footage on hand is so genuinely stunning and realistic--, and the pervasive brown tone doesn't seem to be thematically appropriate. besides that, it's not a bad movie.
