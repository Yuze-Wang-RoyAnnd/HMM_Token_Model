there is a fantastic song in killjoy 2 that goes on about how clowns are usually really nice and fun but killjoy is a killer. i don't recall the song in the first movie but when singer olimpia fernandez sings 'killjoy, yeah killjoy 2' is sounds like the 2 may have been added in for this dire sequel. the film is much worse than the first movie and that was really bad. this time the cast, including the usually excellent debbie rochon have given up trying and director tammi sutton creates no tension and presents merely a dull and steady film. full moon pictures produced this during their 'urban' phase, none of which was very good but none so bad as here.
