this soap is worse than bad: it's poisonous. of the many television shows that have had a corrosive influence on british society over the past twenty years, eastenders is the prime example. for two decades this show has celebrated the oaf, the thug, the wide-boy, the tart, the gobby, the violent, the sexually-incontinent, the criminal, the ignorant, the unambitious ...<br /><br />how many times has someone or other remarked that eastenders "mirrors life"? life on which planet, exactly? <br /><br />it's written about "working-class" characters, as imagined by middle-class people who have taken a course in creative writing. eager to show to their middle-class peers how familiar they are with the "working-class" they dream up the lumpen rabble that is the citizenry of eastenders.<br /><br />this has a toxic effect on some minds less well-equipped than others to handle fiction, and so we find members of the real population assuming the attitudes and demeanour of the inhabitants of walford.<br /><br />thus, it came to pass that eastenders mirrors life; but only after life had been hoodwinked into mirroring eastenders.<br /><br />other soaps have followed in ee's footsteps, filled to their stinking gunwhales with ugly, potato-faced, shaven-headed, pot-bellied characters, scowling at each other and issuing threats constantly. this is the proletariat as perceived by the writers who produce this trash. the writers will grow rich on the proceeds of such output, and will go on to enjoy the finer things of life in their rarified enclaves. meanwhile, the burgeoning number of new, tv-induced drones will proceed inexorably toward cultural bankruptcy.<br /><br />and there you have the new priests and the new creatures of the early 21st century. much of this is due to the immeasurable power of that illuminated boxful of dancing pixels in the corner of your living-room. it's your fault, gentle reader: that's what you chose as the only window through which to look out from your prison.
