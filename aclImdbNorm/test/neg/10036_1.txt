are you kidding me? this is quite possibly the worst, amateur movie i've ever seen. the casting was horrible, the acting was worse than horrible and i'm sorry, the guy at the picnic speed loading his plate full of food was somewhere near pointless and the demonic turd and chamber pot chasing drew around was nothing more than comical. when i herd about the bell witch, i wanted to believe. i read some literature on it and thought it sounded like it was possible a plausible story. but this movie just destroyed that. ric white (director, writer, lead actor, etc) takes himself a bit too seriously and i think he gives himself a little more credit than he deserves....do yourself a favor....skip this one.
