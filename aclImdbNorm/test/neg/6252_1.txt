ok. i'll admit it. i'm a huge fan of b-movies. back when michelle bauer, linnea quigley and brinke stevens ruled the roost. and back then, even the bad movies were still good. unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad. even a small cameo by brinke stevens (reprising her role as linda from "slumber party massacre" 21 years earlier) doesn't help this one out. a group of cheerleaders take refuge in a fancy cabin after their van breaks down. a psycho stalks them one by one, catching them in various states of undress. bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad! skip this turkey and go rent "slumber party massacre." 1/2*
