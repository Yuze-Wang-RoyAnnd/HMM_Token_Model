the novel weapon which serves as the basis for this atrocious piece of garbage is one of the best techno-thrillers to come down the pike in a long time.the character of solo, who is not supposed to look like a human, is a wonderful creation and it was simply awful to see him reduced to just another terminator-clone with mario van peebles horrendously trying to "act" like a robot. there is nothing worthwhile about this film.<br /><br />why does hollywood insist on snapping up the rights to excellent novels and then butchering them? there are so many things wrong with solo that listing them seems as unfair as inviting a man with no legs to a brisk game of hopscotch. avoid this awful film and seek out the 2 novels by robert mason that feature the awesome character of solo. the books are weapon and an excellent sequel solo.but don't pay any attention to this awful dreck of a film.
