this movie was playing on lifetime movie network last month and i decided to check it out. i watched for the first 20 minutes and then shut it off b/c i am sorry but plot holes that are integral to a movie's plot make the movie nothing but garbage.<br /><br />the movie is about a woman who accidentally runs a child on a bicycle off the road, leaves to get help, returns only to find out that it's being called a hit and run and there's a hunt for the 'monster' that hurt (in the end killed) her.<br /><br />this is a movie about a female in an affluent neighborhood who has 2 small grade school children and who is an active, sociable woman and yet in order for this movie to work, it needs to be believable that she does not own a cell phone. sorry, but that's complete bs especially when everyone else seems to have one - they used theirs to call 911 when they found the girl lying on the side of the road - when our lead female left the scene of the crime to go phone 911 at some payphone. when the lead female comes back, the ambulance is already at the girl's side and there is chatter about how horrible the person is who hit and left her.<br /><br />just dumb. sorry but i am not willing buy that this woman doesn't own a cell phone which is needed for the movie to work. please don't insult my intelligence movie, thanks. maybe if this took place in 1970 or 1960, i'd buy it but it's clearly a present day (1999 at the time) movie. ..but wait, if she had a cell phone, there would be no movie. pfft.<br /><br />the woman clearly knows about technology since she had computers in her house, ones the kids played games on so all the movie had to do was make her cell phone dead in the car, making her resort to another way to call the cops.. leaving out a cell phone altogether just created a ridiculous plot.
