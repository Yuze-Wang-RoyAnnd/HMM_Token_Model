this film derives from a long running itv sitcom by the same name.the sitcom lasted for half a decade roughly and brought to our screens rigsby,phillip,alan,mrs jones & vienna.<br /><br />then in 1980 the film version hit the cinemas.now when it did,sadly richard beckinsale had passed away & was replaced by only when i laugh actor chris strauli.<br /><br />i myself felt this gave the film a different feel.i would have preferred if it wasn't shot as richard was a key character.thats like having the porridge film without godber or mackay!<br /><br />the film did have some classics moments definitely but it felt a bit de-ja-vu! many parts were seen before in the tv series. now if you saw the movie first rather than the series you would get a different feeling about it then the series fan!<br /><br />saying that leonard is definitely on top form and makes the movie,just like in the tv series.the film has recently had a new lease of life on dvd and is usually on terrestrial over a quiet weekend.it is a cracking good film,but for rigsby fans you may feel that youv'e seen it similarly before.<br /><br />saying that though its worth a buying/watching<br /><br />7.8/10
