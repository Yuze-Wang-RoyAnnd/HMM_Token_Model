this is one of those so-called "hollywood social commentary" films that wants to have it both ways. and believe me, in this film, both ways are clich'ed and stereotypical. stop-loss is a 21st century john wayne film dealing with some anti-war sentiment but clearly ending on the note that "if you are a man in today's society, you get your act together and march off to war with your buddies." in many ways the film was a great sequel to taxi to the dark side as it portrayed a military equally as insane and out of control, a quasi frat party/animal house extravaganza mixed in with a texas red neck world of repressed homo-erotic proofs of masculinity. this movie had it all in one scene after another of clich'ed imagery. and then rebellious military deserter ryan phillippe goes on a "road trip" with best friend's girlfriend, an artificial storyline manipulation to visit families of dead servicemen, maimed soldiers in military hospitals, etc. and finally to broach the issue of fleeing to canada or mexico. but male honor and patriotism win out in the end, as all freshly scrubbed and handsome, he rides off into the sunset on a bus with his buddies back to iraq and a world that a few minutes before he assured everyone he could never again tolerate. full metal jacket meets sands of iwo jima . but in the end, john wayne rides again! and a hollywood blockbuster ultimately gets to keep both sides of its audience in the palm of its hand
