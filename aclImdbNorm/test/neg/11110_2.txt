excerpt from tv guide:<br /><br />this week on the love boat, captain stubing has his hands full when a cryptozoologist gets on board with an unexpected cargo! join the captain, isaac, gopher and julie in a fun-filled halloween special. guest starring a guy in a really bad lizard suit as the chupacabra.<br /><br />this is typical, lame sci-fi channel cut-rate fare. the captain of a cruise ship, played by the once respectable john rhys-davies, is in charge of a carnival cruise along the coast of mexico. his daughter is along for the ride, and she's earning her keep by being the ship's kickboxing instructor. pay attention, everyone, that kickboxing will come in handy later! it should be noted that the captain's daughter is pretty uncoordinated and painful to watch. it would have been good if she might have taken a couple of kickboxing classes before trying to play an instructor in a movie.<br /><br />captain stupid and his daughter join mrs. thurston howell from gilligan's island, a kooky cryptozoologist and a dark, mysterious stranger on this 90- minute ride into boredom.<br /><br />that's right, i said cryptozoologist. he keeps mentioning that he brought some precious cargo on board that he needs to check out. needless to say, the box contains a chupacabra that somebody decides to let out. from this point on, a man in the rubber chupacabra suit runs around the ship, killing people. captain stupid is powerless to stop it. he decides to call in the marines but telling them that there are a bunch of terrorists on his ship.<br /><br />the marines respond. they say all that marine-speak stuff like "hooya" and "get some". but those silly marines are no match for a chupacabra. they don't really tell anyone where they're going either, so there's no help in sight. i guess no one will really miss some lame battalion of lost marines. but don't forget... captain stupid's daughter is, thankfully, a kickboxing instructor. yay for little stupid! she comes in right in the nick of time, she beats up the bloodthirsty goat sucker and saves the day. chupacabra means goat sucker. therefore, chupacabras suck. but there's no way that chupacabras suck anywhere near as much as this movie.
