okay, so when a friend of mine told me he was supposed to direct mm2 and mm3, i thought, heck, i got to check out monster man and see what its like, maybe i can get a part in it, but when i popped it into my dvd player and and tried to choke down the first 45 minutes of nothing but bad, bad i mean horribly annoying bad comedy from that fat ass thinking he's funny, not to mention how looooong the director spent on the pointless desert road trip, i cam to the conclusion that these guys didn't have a clue of what they were doing and missed the boat by a long shot. the story had potential to be somewhat different than the usual bs you see on the blockbuster/hollywood video shelf put out by lions gate these days, but they surely messed this one up. why put so much time and effort in shooting annoying bad acting and bad jokes, why not shorten the road trip and put more of the plot in the movie. myabe the writing was so bad that they had to cut out a lot of the movie or maybe the director didn't shoot enough of the horror and gore, that they had to find filler to make the usual 84 minutes???? all in all, and i'm being easy here, maybe because a friend of mine is the bald redneck in the bar scene that gets his skull crushed when chasing the three leads out into the street, i will give it at least 1 star for trying, and the gore/kill scenes weren't that bad, again, they tried. too bad, lions gate could have created a cool franchise from this idea, but failed. i don't recommend paying to rent it, maybe you can find a cut down version where the movie starts from the hitch hiker scene. crap!
