right then. this film is totally unfunny, puerile, has gags from other films, has songs from other films (blink 182's "mutt", grand theft audio's "we luv u"), an unlikeable leading man, a ridiculous plot, and lame parodies of films like mission impossible 2 and american beauty. redeeming features? shannon elizabeth and jaime pressly. enough said.
