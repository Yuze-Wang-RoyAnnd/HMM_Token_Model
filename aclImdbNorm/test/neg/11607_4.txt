the big problem i had with this movie was that lombard's character is, as another user put it, "unnecessarily cruel". lombard plays the role of ann krausheimer smith, who believes she is married to david smith, played well by the sharply dressed yet appropriately bumbling robert montgomery. the movie has some funny moments, especially when montgomery's character goes to great lengths to try to get his "wife" back. understandably, she is upset because the marriage is technically not legal, but she only finds out three years into it.<br /><br />lombard's character seems quite cold to her "husband's" sincere attempts to woo her back. while not being highly adept in that effort, montgomery is nevertheless visibly loving, and yet lombard is as cool as a pillar of ice. there are almost no clues suggesting any sort of reconciliation between the warring couple for much of the movie, and it is hard to see any sort of comedy- even dark comedy- in that aspect. to some extent, the movie almost suggests a sadistic undertone, with lombard's character getting a "kick" out of her husband's feeble efforts. while one might consider this another 'battle of the sexes' type of movie, the reality is that it is a highly lopsided battle, if that: montgomery's character, while certainly flawed, is not flawed enough to make it a typical exemplar of the masculine chauvinist/misogynist (an excellent example of that is michael douglas in 'war of the roses'). in fact, the character is largely effeminate, as revealed by not only the sharp dress of montgomery (which probably owes largely to the perennially sharply dressed actor himself), but also to his discomfort in attempting-but failing- to play the role of a womanizing bachelor. his only major flaw is his vanity, but that fault does not balance out with his partner's excessive cruelty. and there is no suggestion that she is trying to instill any jealousy out of subconscious love. this is what makes it so cruel, and sad. montgomery's character simply looks weak. in reality, no wife would want a man so weak unless she "wears the pants" in the marriage. but then again, a woman who wears the pants in a marriage would never seek to be so cruel because she has already affirmed that role early on. hence, the whole theme seems weird. this movie is neither a champion of feminism (lombard's character does show some signs of the sort of independent-oriented woman of the 60s, but that idea is soon quashed and the character falls back into the 1940s), nor an even-sided battle of the sexes (as montgomery's character is truly a cipher of masculinity and therefore a lost cause).<br /><br />this movie is, on the surface, a slapstick, but beneath that veneer it is really much darker, with sadistic undertones. all of which makes its resolution appear, well, odd. (maybe that oddity was the whole point?). in any case, slapstick this movie is not.
