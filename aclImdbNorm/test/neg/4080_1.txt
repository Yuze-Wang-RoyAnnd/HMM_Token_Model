was this supposed to be funny? this is one of those films that just doesn't work. the first one, bruce almighty with jim carey, had some very funny moments. this one had none.<br /><br />steve carrell, who was brilliant in bruce almighty, fails to deliver here. his performance is very ordinary and he can't carry it off like carey did.<br /><br />the one good thing about this is i only paid $1.95 to rent it. it's a movie for children...very young children who have only seen about 4 films or so in their short lives.<br /><br />it's interesting to note that where jim carey stars in a film and they make a sequel without him that it's usually a huge turkey. anyone remember son of mask? (imdb worst 100 films of all time) avoid this one movie lovers.
