this film captures the short moments between a mother and son in rural russia, as she lays dying.<br /><br />i am so torn between being nice to the film or declaring it a test of patience. on one hand, the film is beautiful, with the sparse dialog capturing the essence of their feelings. there is really nothing to say, because everything that needs to be said is conveyed beyond words. the son shows so much care, love and patience towards his mother, that i think it is a celebration of unconditional love towards one's family. it also cruelly reminds me that i could be in a situation like this, stuck in a joyless place, having to take care of a very ill person. "mat i syn" is cruel reality.<br /><br />on the other hand, "mat i syn" moves really too slowly. do i really need to watch a train passing by the horizon for over 1 minute? with my previous experience of "telets" and "aleksandra", i am so tempted to put "mat i syn" among them as a total bore.<br /><br />i guess one has to be in the right state of mind to appreciate this film. i surely see the beauty of it, but maybe i am not in the right state of mind.
