please do not blame korea for this bad movie. i am in korea (please excuse bad english). it sadden me to see these movies which make korea look like obsessed with blood and sex. it sadden me even more to see animal killings and hear americans say that is how korea is. we do not eat live animals!! so please stop excusing movie for its crime by saying it is the culture! there is scenes with the man eating live animals and non koreans think it is normal. no it is disgusting to us too. the director is a misfit, sick individual who has obsession with killing and sex with family members. i wish america and france will stop glorifying this bad man who is laughable in his own country. please watch any other movie from korea, that will give you ideas of how artistic we really are. this movie is rubbish.
