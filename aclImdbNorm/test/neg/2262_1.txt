i am insulted and angry over the idea that a sequel to 'gone with the wind' should ever have been undertaken. having expressed that, i have no problem with the quality of the acting or the actors in this film. the performers are talented people whose talents were wasted on this piece of garbage. the hype surrounding this book and film just happens to be an exercise in futility. i think it will go down as one of the misguided films of hollywood. i don't believe that the beloved characters created by margaret mitchell should have been soiled by the ideas and interpretations of another writer. the film and the book should be on the list of worst ideas conceived in the world of publishing and film-making. the sad thing is that people actually made money off of this tripe.
