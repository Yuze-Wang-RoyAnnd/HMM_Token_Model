**possible spoilers ahead**<br /><br />whenever fans of bad movies congregate for more than a few minutes, a name that invariably comes up is that of larry buchanan. this amazing director has given us remakes of other turkeys (zontar the thing from venus), cheap-jack crime dramas like a bullet for pretty boy, and tawdry conspiracy flicks like down on us and goodbye norma jean. the loch ness horror is a humdinger to say the least. overlooking the fact that loch ness is extremely long and narrow, larry filmed this howler on a wide and round california lake. early on, the film boasts some dazzling (for the budget) underwater photography and creates some atmosphere in spite of itself. then it degenerates into windy dialogue uttered by no-name actors with lapsing scottish accents, not to mention a soundtrack that will do nothing for the much-maligned bagpipe. at one point, campers sing "you take the high road, i'll take the low road," just to throw in one more scottish cliche. if scottish people ever decide to jump on the political correctness bandwagon they'll sue larry buchanan over this film, his surname notwithstanding. the monster looks like a giant papier-mache puppet and it makes the dragon in beanie & cecil look terrifying by comparison. in one unforgettable scene nessie takes to land and, to evade some patrolling soldiers, the fifty-foot long critter tries to hide behind a tree-and the soldiers don't see it! the loch ness horror is a true mind-boggler that must be seen-several times--to be believed.
