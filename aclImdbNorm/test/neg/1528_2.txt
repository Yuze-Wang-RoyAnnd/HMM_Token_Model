where do i begin with the killing mind before i mention the good bit? this movie is about a young psychological profiling fbi woman, or something, that for some reason goes to work for the lapd for a wee while. there are some recognisable faces, like the "i love you, man" bloke from wayne's world, playing a cop (nice beard-age too!) and two guys who always seem to play cops playing..... you guessed it, cops. one of them was one of the cops in gross point blank following john cusack about the place, and the other is the fbi guy with specs in final destination, who is also in the fugitive as another cop. i know the fbi, us marshalls, cia, etc aren't cops, but they're all the same. they enforce the law to a certain degree, that makes them cops in my book. feel free to disagree with the definition of a cop all you want, they're still seen as the ones who are trying to bring the bad guys down. any, i digress. the woman is working alongside these cops who just seem to sit around in a library in the basement or something, and for some unknown reason decides to reopen a case that hasn't been looked at for yonks. she saw the dead body as a kid, so naturally decided that she can reopen the case cos she was personally attached to it! i also like how the person profiling other people's psychological state witnessed a murder scene as a child. surely that's the kind of thing that can screw with someone's head?! she starts asking questions off some journalist who covered the story when it was open, even though he appears to be the same age as the woman, so he presumably was either writing for a newspaper when he was 10, or he wrote a few school reports on it, and she decided he'd be the best person to ask about it.<br /><br />we then see that as well as reopening homicide cases from 25 years earlier, she tries her hand at petty theft as some really inconspicuous bloke sprints through a busy street wearing a balaclava. way to blend, moron! anyway, she and the cops she's with eating ice creams in the park give chase after him, and whilst crossing a bridge with a woman and child standing on it, the thief grabs the baby from the mother's arms and throws the baby in the river. this, if you haven't already guessed, is the best bit of the movie. i'm not sadistic, and don't have a hatred for babies or anything, but the scene just looks so stupid i promise you will wet your pants laughing at it if you should watch this movie. it gets better when the cop from final destination & the fugitive jumps in to rescue the baby then declares to his friend "it's a baby!" how did he not know that before he jumped in, is beyond me.<br /><br />anyway, she chases after the thief but loses him. later on she remembers that a random dog didn't bark at the thief, so assumed it must be his and decided to track down the thief through the dog. the dog had no markings or anything on it, so how she knew where to find the dog, and thus find the thief is another question i won't go into. it was shortly after this that i stopped watching. the story was moving really slowly, and after i had stopped laughing at the baby throwing bit, i had kind of lost interest and missed what was being said.<br /><br />saying that, i'll go ahead and assume that the killer was the journalist bloke because he seemed a bit shifty, and she was spending a lot of time with him, and anyone who watches columbo knows that the person outside the police force who spends most time with the investigating officer is your bad guy. plus, other people's reviews say the killer was pretty obvious, so i'm sure it was him.<br /><br />so all in all, a pants film, but worth watching just for that one glorious scene.
