this movie made me think....of how i could write something about it without personally dissing the director and all the actors, who, as an australian, i am proud of for actually getting out there and making a film.<br /><br />but the movie itself? let me tell you a story....<br /><br />found this dvd in my local rental shop yesterday and had vague recollections of the reviews at the time of cinema release here, so i thought i would give it a go.<br /><br />for some reason, i decided to watch the 'special features' before i watched the actual movie, not something that i usually do. turned the 'making of' off halfway through, as i'd had enough cringing at the 'aren't we so wonderful for putting together such a hard hitting film with such a raw script' attitude.<br /><br />the movie? ugh. full of clich'es and pathetic character development. the actors? well done guys, you are aussies and i applaud you. and, just like a footy team is only as good as the coach that directs them, you unfortunately did not have a great script to work with.<br /><br />i felt that the movie actually trivialised so many of the subjects that it seemed to want to cover. i have seen many reviews here that refer to it as nothing more than a soap. agreed.<br /><br />finally (and forgive me if i don't phrase this correctly), i was extremely disappointed that there were no optimistic overtones at all. yes, we all know that life is full of hard stuff, and yes we know that things such as incest do occur, but i really find it hard to applaud a movie that has not one piece of joy in it. i believe that a director has a responsibility to put it in there somewhere. otherwise, the movie is all about them and their feelings, they have created it for themselves, not for an audience.<br /><br />which i think is the basis of why this movie isn't so great. the special features mention that the director wrote the screenplay in a 36 hour sitting, the day after he himself tried to end his own life. well, it may have been cathartic for him to do this, however the movie reeks of self-indulgence when you know the story behind why it was written. "i feel horrid, i'm going to write a movie about feeling horrid". (note: i have read the interview with andrew urban, and understand why thalluri needed to write something to help him through his own issues, but i believe there is a line in film that cannot be crossed - the line of making a movie purely for your own emotional needs, and i feel that this is what has unintentionally happened here)<br /><br />by his own admission, the director had no technical experience at all, and sadly, this makes the movie come off looking like nothing more than a year twelve media project.<br /><br />as for any recommendations that this movie should be studied at school, or that all teenagers should watch it - not sure there either. because there is a very dangerous line at the end. i too have been in a place where i have thought that someone who no longer has to 'face life' is 'lucky', but as an adult, i do worry that this line could be influential on a young viewer that was in a vulnerable frame of mind. might be in there to promote discussion, but again, it reflects no possibility of redemption or joy in this story as a whole. in fact, it almost indicates that there is more sadness to come.<br /><br />i haven't seen elephant, but i just might go find it, given all the comparisons here.<br /><br />nothing personal here guys, i do hope you can make another movie someday, and we all have to start out somewhere, so forgive me if i've been too harsh. i am glad that you are proud of what you created, which in the end is what life is all about. it's not a movie i would recommend though.<br /><br />oh, i did like the way the time-frames often collided, thought that was an interesting way to film. <br /><br />but the whole "its the quiet ones you have to watch" - we already know that.
