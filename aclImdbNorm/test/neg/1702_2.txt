i had high hopes for this production, being one of my favourite works.<br /><br />indeed, a lot of it is reasonable: helen baxendale is not a bad lady macbeth, but lacks the devilry which the original character is infused with. many of the minor characters do well, and the scottish settings are superb.<br /><br />the big disappointment to me is jason connery in the title role: he seems to be reading his lines off a cue card with the wrong glasses - surely for the first time, as well. he can do so much better. any production when compared to the sublime ian mckellen (macbeth 1979)who to my mind gave the gold standard performance, is going to struggle to be appreciated, but i actually fell asleep and had to rewind this one before i could get through it - hardly a great sign.<br /><br />honestly, one to avoid.
