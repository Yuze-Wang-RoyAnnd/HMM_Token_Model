clearly, andreas bethmann would like to wear jess franco's crown whilst coveting (at least cinematically) the old workhorse's wife, lina romay. romay plays a corrupt, salacious, masturbating prison warden in this modern, ambitious w.i.p. film. with some exceptions, many of franco's films are ineptly produced and directed in a slipshod, hurried manner. shots don't always cut together and the sound mixes can be horrific. while watching "angel of death 2" (aka "prison island massacre") i asked myself if bethmann is deliberately trying to replicate franco's patent shoddiness, or is he just naturally shoddy like his mentor? is this movie deliberately bad, which would be self-defeating, or is it simply bad by neglect? after a hitchhiker is forced to give a gunpoint blowjob, her rapist fills her mouth, then fills her vagina with some drugs. minutes later, she is hauled into a clifftop prison for reasons not explained and subjected to the leers and rough handling of staff and other inmates. as this is a wip film, there are lesbian scenes galore and plenty of violent behavior. the gore is bloody and sadistic, too, with delights such as teeth pulling and scalping (courtesy of olaf ittenbach). the acting is pretty awful and the fight scenes are lame, but there is a love of sleaze in every frame and an understanding of what trash fans enjoy. unfortunately, the flat script makes for a flat movie. so, despite numerous atrocities, hardcore sex, and a guest appearance from jess franco, the experience is an empty one. but isn't that what most jess franco movies are?
