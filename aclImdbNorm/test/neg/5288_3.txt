dr. chopper starts shortly after teenager nicholas' (robert adamson) mum has died, he is still cut up about it but every cloud has a silver lining & in this case it appears that his mum owns a log cabin at lake tatonka the self proclaimed 'friendly place for happy people' that she didn't tell him about. so nicholas together with his girlfriend jessica (chelsey crisp) & three friends, jimmy (butch hansen), reese (chase hoyt) & tamara (ashley mccarthy) head out there for a fun weekend. unfortunately things don't go according to plan, the cabin turns out to be little more than a run down shed & their neighbours turn out to be dr. chopper (ed brigadier) & his two nurses who go around killing anyone they meet to use them in horrible experiments...<br /><br />going straight-to-video/dvd dr. chopper was edited & directed by lewis schoenburn & this film seems to be having a hard time here on the imdb with some pretty harsh reviews, while i think dr. chopper as a horror film is pretty worthless i don't think some of the criticism i've read is entirely justified. the script which takes itself very seriously is credited to ian holt (whether he likes it or not...) who has a role in the film as detective crocker according to the imdb cast list although i can't remember any character of that name, maybe he was one of the cops at the start? anyway, the basic story is alright i suppose although it's a tad dull & lasts for too long, it's typical slasher fare with some sort of evil character running around bumping off our annoying american teen cast, you know the drill by now. besides some brief & undeveloped nonsense about dr. chopper using body parts to replenish his own deteriorating body there's not much story here & the script seems to exist solely to invent situations for girls to take their tops off, there's the inevitable sex scenes, there's a sequence where some girls have to complete a sorority house initiation topless & there's even a couple of lesbians here as well one of whom is seen without her full compliment of clothing. oh, & when i say topless i mean they aren't wearing any tops but they all keep their bras on so you may want to bear in mind there isn't any actual full frontal nudity in dr. chopper at all. so there you have it really, it's an average story that has a mildly surprising twist at the end which is wasted, is populated with poor clich'ed dumb character's that exist only to showcase some cheap gore scenes & girls in bras. to be honest i expect a little bit more from my films but then again maybe i'm just being picky.<br /><br />director schoenburn does ok actually, this is by no means the worst looking film i've seen although it still looks cheap. there's no style here, i didn't think it was scary & there's no atmosphere either. the gore is restrained & restricted to some dead bodies & severed limbs, there's nothing new here or any particularly convincing special effects. dr. chopper is also one of those films where character decisions & motivations are ridiculous.<br /><br />technically this is a little rough around the edges but is reasonably well made on what was probably a really low budget, the forest locations are suitably isolated although the cops office looks like someones front room & the two nurses outfits at the start look like stripper outfits. the acting is alright, it could have better but i've certainly seen worse.<br /><br />dr. chopper indeed features a doctor who rides around on a chopper motorbike but unfortunately that just isn't enough to satisfy me, despite it being a reasonably competent production the lack of any real gore, nudity or a decent plot sinks it without trace.
