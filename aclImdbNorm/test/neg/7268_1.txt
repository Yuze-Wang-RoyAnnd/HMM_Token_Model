what the hell is this!? that was my first reaction to this film (actually, my first reaction contained more swearing). this isn't star wars! star wars is space battles, this movie has none. star wars is the force, this movie only has a retarded witch with a magic ring. star wars is lightsaber battles, this movie hasn't got any battle worth mentioning. star wars is humor, this movie isn't. star wars is a galaxy far, far away, this movie has horses in it!!! besides all of this, how did lucas get the insane idea to let a five year old baby do the leading role !? big, big disappointment. do you like star wars? don't watch this! 1 out of 10
