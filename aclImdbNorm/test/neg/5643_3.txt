i could not believe the original rating i found when i looked up this film, 9.5? unfortunately it looks like i am not alone.<br /><br />the film, is slow and boring really, one of the sad things is that if the film had been given a realistic rating of around 5 or 6 then the expectation would not have been so high.<br /><br />unfortunately, this was not the case, so when watching the film, and seeing the poor story and acting, i am left giving it a 3/10 score.<br /><br />vinnie jones is superb in lock stock, and also snatch, and he plays a great hard man, however, he should stick to this role. its a bit like when stallone and schwarzenegger have done comedy films, they just don't work.<br /><br />neither can he play lead actor, he plays better as supporting or otherwise. when he plays lead, his acting talents are too 'in view' and shown up as not really very good. mean machine is another good example of this.
