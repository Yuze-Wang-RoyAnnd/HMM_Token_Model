obviously, someone was looking at catching onto the "blair witch" wave.<br /><br />this movie was set up like all the "reality" haunted shows that are popping up on tv lately (and i must admit, i get a kick out of these), but this movie is much cheesier! probably the first three-quarters of the movie is filled with the "participants" going through the house, whining. give me a break! spending 10 minutes whining about going up into the attic is not my idea of a good time. any paranormal happenings are blatant setups. no strings, but too perfectly caught on camera to be real. the "participants" were not very likeable either. two goofy guys who don't take it seriously, one girl who scares at the drop of a hat, and the quintessential over-played "paranormal" person. is this becoming the clich'ed-"formula" for a ghost movie?<br /><br />i have to admit, the last 15 minutes or so were pure tension. they took every ounce of tension in the movie and stuck it in those 15 minutes. i admit, i spent that time pacing in the kitchen. i really wouldn't recommend this movie to younger viewers, even if it is pg13.<br /><br />if you're looking for some entertainment, if you don't take it seriously, you will get a kick out of this movie. there's tons of situations to make cracks about! if you're looking for an great story-line.. look elsewhere ;)
