salesman lenny brown (woods) is fast losing his knack of selling the proverbial ice cream to eskimos. given a chance to shine in california by a philanthropic entrepreneur, brown and his wife linda (young) live the high life off tax shelter investments; a fortune they lose when the federal government changes the tax laws.<br /><br />seven hundred thousand dollars in the red, and in need of a 'boost', the yuppies without portfolio begin to hoover vast quantities of colombian marching powder up their hooters, until they find themselves with rather hungry monkeys on their back. after briefly cleaning up, linda's coke-induced miscarriage sees lenny once more careering like a pinball between uppers and downers. living purgatory follows.<br /><br />a contemporary take on reefer madness, with perverse echoes of albert brooks' lost in america, the boost was overshadowed on release by tabloid revelations concerning an alleged affair between woods and young, and their tumultuous falling out. woods, then engaged to horse trainer sarah owen (now his ex-wife), reputedly slapped a $2 million lawsuit on his spurned co-star for "emotional harassment" during filming, citing fatal attraction-style late-night phone calls to his fianc'ee and, in one noteworthy incident, reputedly leaving a mutilated baby doll on his and owen's doorstep.<br /><br />ironically, the lack of chemistry between the supposedly loving leads is one of the more depressing aspects of this latter-day exploitation flick - the only real passion woods demonstrates towards young is when he's kicking her around the room. the script too is hilariously dreadful, perhaps mitigating young's near-comatose performance when given howlers like "stay with me - 'til i fall off the earth" to emote. further, given woods' edgy dramatic personae, his jittery descent loses all credibility when actually he looked that way to begin with.<br /><br />ultimately, the boost must be seen in context: in the 21st century cocaine use is ubiquitous. however, in 1988, with america still embroiled in an unwinnable "war on drugs", the very fibre of the nation looked to be in peril - hence one of the most hellish - and for that read hysterical - depictions of drug-abuse.
