the only reason i bought the dvd was to satisfy my curiosity about the scene when liz (kim basinger) strips to the music of joe cocker: you can leave your hat on! that was the best part of the whole film. not because the scene was any good; only the song. i am not saying it was a terribly bad film just not that good. disappointingly so!<br /><br />especially when the exploration of male and female sexuality could have been expanded upon. instead of expanding on the dangerous side of lust, obsession and infatuation and where it can lead to it drags its heels obscurely from one idea to the other. for example when john (played by rourke) is able to leave her on the top of the big wheel, liz (kim basinger) is unconvincingly rattled at the bizarre experience courtesy of john's sense of humor but less rattled at his sexual exploits involving the ever willing liz; and like one reader mentioned, that for a woman to enjoy sex she has to experience the dangerous side is unconvincing. this "dangerous" side is not exploited enough in the film and one gets a sense of anti-climax from the view point that it all could go horribly wrong. the theme of bondage makes an appearance often but only just takes one to the brink of danger and then all goes well.is the film sending the message out that this kind of "foreplay" is fine! if the film was making a point about the pitfalls of bondage and by extension the ugly ramifications of sad-masochism then maybe it would make a good moral point. instead the film awkwardly jumps from one "sizzling" scene of rourke feeding basinger and blindfolding her to another. in a film that could have been good it falls flat on its face because it does not expand and extend the themes the film is maybe trying to relate; thus for me it doesn't have a plot nor a theme just a mixture of ideas.
