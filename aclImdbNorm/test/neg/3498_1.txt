this movie was offensively pc, predictable and clich'ed. i couldn't imagine a movie that better exemplifies the myopic, narcissistic preachiness of today's hollywood. if you haven't seen this don't bother watching it. if you have, show some courage and tell people how awful it really is. my wife, a minority in her own right, was offended by the inherent and unendingly racist message of the film. this movie has nothing to do with the real world and has little, if anything at all, to add to any discussion about racism in this country. instead, it's the kind of cheap, sensationalist crap that is promoted as deep and challenging thought. what kind of a bubble do you have to live in to think that this is at all impressive?
