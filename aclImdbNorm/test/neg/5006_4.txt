it is is very sad to see someone of the calibre of george c scott in a low budget thriller which would have been better if the original novel was written by graham greene and directed by someone somewhat more experienced in the genre. not to mention a better cinematographer. there are so many missed opportunities with the scenery and carnival merely glossed over, rather than captured to locate the movie solidly in the exotic setting of the novel.<br /><br />elsewhere in the viewer comments on this site, one very astute observer complained about the variety of diabolically bad accents in this film. ever since i saw george c scott as rochester in jane eyre, i have prayed for him never to ever accept again a role which required him to assume a british accent. just every now and then, he could just possibly pass for british or a very british sounding south african played obviously by an american actor. i can stomach meryl streep's extraordinarily laboured accents (both british and australian) - at least she gets it right even though with every utterance, she demands that we marvel at her skill. well, i am sorry that mr. scott is no meryl streep, and it just destroys the illusion - like having michele yeoh speak excruciating mandarin with a strong singaporean accent in crouching tiger etc.<br /><br />peterson acts no differently than what we see on csi. except he is still very handsome and more or less slim in this movie. he is the harrison ford of tv. same old expressions for every emotion, every situation. no on second thought, ford has two - perplexed/pained and happy. i have never seen a smile on mr. csi!
