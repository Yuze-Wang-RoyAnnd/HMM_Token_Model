i saw this movie yesterday on a public service channel. they had advertised it as an awful movie, and so i was drawn to see it, and i was not let down.<br /><br />a group of 18-19 year old go to an excavation site at an old viking castle in denmark, to try to uncover the myth of the berserker vikings. strange things happens: something is in the forest, and people start disappearing.<br /><br />the main thing about this movie that really bothers me, is that the story is supposed to take place in denmark, where i happen to live. there were so many places in the movie where the hollywood-style overlapped danish reality. it really made the acting and drama look ridiculous in my eyes.<br /><br />you never see the characters interact with any of their surroundings. its feels like a mini-hollywood in denmark, and it takes away the credibility of the movie. when at one point you hear someone speak "old danish", it sounds exactly like modern day swedish. really bad research, considering the director is from denmark.<br /><br />the characters in the movie used gps and maps, and that's really funny, since denmark is about the size of your backyard. nomatter where you are, there is never more than 50 km to the sea, and 500 meters to civilization. and if you are at a castle, there are going to be tourists everywhere. we see a lot of overviews of forests in the movie, and sometimes, we see what appears to be north american vegetation(?) the story did not exactly appeal to me, maybe because the acting was so bad. when the characters see the bog creatures for the first time, they are not even scared. i guess their acting skills were insufficient to display realistic emotions. at the end, there is an unexpected twist, but it didn't impress me, since i didn't really care.<br /><br />the bog creatures are cheap, but they had the potential to be scary. unfortunately, they fail, since we get a good look at them standing in the forest when the characters arrive at the castle. also, there are no really scary scenes, since the bog creatures are mostly just standing around.<br /><br />anyway, conclusion: disregarding the facts, the movie is your typical b-horror flick. i guess people from other countries can enjoy it more. as long as you are unaware of reality, it doesn't matter. just like i think of usa as one big action movie set, everyone else can think of denmark as a forest with a castle.. and some living-dead people in a bog..
