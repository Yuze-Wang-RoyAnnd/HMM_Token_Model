if you have plenty of time to kill and the dvd was given to you by your friend for free but still it may require lot of courage to watch this film which does not have good script or humor for that matter.<br /><br />on the acting front imran is frozen in time/acting, tushar kapoor was slightly better than imran in this movie paresh rawal was good at comedy was usual. <br /><br />the story revolves around a college campus where imran is a bad boy n tushar is the good one, they pretend to be the opposite of respective nature and so the story goes on.....<br /><br />watch it only if you don't have any thing to do and the film is running on your local cable tv.
