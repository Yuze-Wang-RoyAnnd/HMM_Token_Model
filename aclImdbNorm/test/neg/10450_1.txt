i'm not really sure where to begin. from start to finish, bad, stinky bad, like stepping into a port-a-john on a 100 degree day. if you force yourself to watch this as i did, keep some vicodin handy for the pain. i will never understand how flicks this bad make it past the cutting room without the entire reel ending up on the floor. the movie is a cross between gumby rides pokey, meets the terminator, meets wally beaver playing cowboys and indians without the cowboys. i've seen better animation in the original cut of the blob. you will get more entertainment from watching gone with the wind while suffering from the puke and poops. bad acting and hokey lines will have you squirming and wishing you had rented peewee's big top or watched every episode of gilligan's island back to back. ugh..i'm going to go slit my wrist now.
