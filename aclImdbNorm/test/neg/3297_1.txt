i'm one of those gluttons for punishment when it comes to sitcoms these days-i still will check them out every once in a while.my observation is that most of them aren't very funny even the ones on major networks that are getting high ratings ,i just don't get who is finding them gut busting funny. while a few have made me crack a smile ,none of them made me laugh out loud,i usually change the channel after a few minutes. now on the fox network they churn out new shows like changing your underwear,for some reason they think they can make a good sitcom,wrong dead wrong. they have beat this dead horse so much it is to the point of hiring just anyone they can find to write a crappy pilot with bad dialog and just churn them out.let's take a brief look at the latest piece of junk that fox has churned out called "the war at home"<br /><br />i watched about 5 minutes of it and that was generous. in this particular episode,the daughter is mouthing off to her parents doing the i'm an adult now rant.the dad gets fed up tells her "ok fine,go ahead and do whatever you want,if you screw up it's your problem" to which she replies"well i guess your mad but hey at least i didn't get aids"(cue the laugh track,no way that can be a live audience unless they have been paid to applaud such garbage)-i found the crack about not having aids to be in such bad taste. well hey at least i don't have to watch any more of this crap. take a hint fox, stop wasting your time with sitcoms.ok well you have the simpsons but it is now getting really old and tired as well.
