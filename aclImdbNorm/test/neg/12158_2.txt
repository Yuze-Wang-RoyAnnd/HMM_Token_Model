i watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful! <br /><br />awfully long - even though they managed to skip through the majority of his life!<br /><br />awfully boring - the parts they included were long-winded, and for some reason the director chose to cut away from some of the action and left huge parts of the film unexplained! <br /><br />awfully inaccurate - the whole'mystical' side to this film was a joke, and last time i checked ghengis khan wasn't exactly a nice guy! <br /><br />awfully acted - i found several of the characters hard to believe, they were very two-dimensional and lacked and kind of depth! <br /><br />a saving grace of the film was the cinematography. that is why i gave this film a 2 star-rating rather than the bare minimum! however, if you want to look at something pretty i would recommend buying a picture instead! <br /><br />all in all this film was an awful waste of my time and money! please do yourself a favour and give this mongolian turkey a miss!
