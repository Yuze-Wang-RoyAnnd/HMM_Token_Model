first off, i'm a huge bronson fan, have been since the late '70s. i watched every film he made on the big screen since "love and bullets", which ironically was the beginning of his end as a big name, hollywood-blockbuster star.<br /><br />i kept hoping that things would turn around for him, that he would make a really good film in the '80s, but that never happened. and i don't know what he was thinking when he signed with cheapjack studio cannon and hack director j. lee thompson for most of his latter films.<br /><br />"assasination" gave me some hopes when i saw that peter hunt was directing instead of thompson but those hopes were quickly dashed. first off, the film looks incredibly cheap, like it was made for about 3 mil, minus bronson's inflated salary (i heard he insisted on 5 mil per picture which is probably more than the rest of the budget for all his cannon films). the white house scenes were filmed on the va grounds in west la - i was taking the bus when they were shooting. nice job on recreating the white house but did no one think about getting the palm trees out of the shots? guess not.<br /><br />secondly, the supporting cast is really bad. ireland was dying of cancer and despite this she's not bad but the horrible asian woman playing bronson's sidekick was typical of cannon's talent at the time --non-existent. i would be real curious to learn how she got this role. i can't imagine a worse actress for the part, plus she's a good 40 years younger than bronson! the story is not that bad and it's something that bigger and better-budgeted studios did later (eastwood's "in the line of fire" and costner's "bodyguard" film) but the way it's staged here is really sad. i'm wondering if they could not afford to do more than one or two takes per shot. none of it is believable in the slightest. if secret service men really behaved like the keystone cops in this movie we'd have presidents rotating out of office (and out of life) every few months...
