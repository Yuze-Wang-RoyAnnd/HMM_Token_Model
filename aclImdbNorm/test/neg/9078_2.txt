the evil that men do (1984) was one of the few non-cannon films charlie bronson made during the 80's. unlike most of the cannon films charlie starred in, this one wasn't fun or entertaining. charlie basically tortures and brutalizes people for over an hour and a half. if you thought he was mr. emotion before, wait until you see this! <br /><br />in this one, charlie goes to an unnamed central american country and shows the populace that whoever messes with chuck or his people have to pay the piper. this one is no fun. it's not cheesy or campy, just brutal, sadistic and not in a good way. <br /><br />i didn't like this one. i have no love for this film. no recommendations because it's not worth watching. maybe if they didn't cut the hell out of it. watch with precaution.<br /><br />don't bother.
