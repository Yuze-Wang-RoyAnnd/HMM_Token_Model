given this film's incredible reviews i was expecting something truly exceptional. it certainly starts well with witty and sharp dialogue, and a fine cast in place. a series of robert altman-style interwoven stories reel the viewer in with some compelling scenes. i found it gripping entertainment right through to the second half of the film when sadly, it collapses like a pack of cards. a series of ludicrous coincidences and right-on messages stack up until i'm left deeply disappointed and wondering what all the fuss is about. paul haggis has tackled the subject of race in la, and that alone seems to have elevated this movie to a new level of interest. given that most of the academy voters live in la and have experienced racism to some extent, this film is sure to have an impact on them. that means the oscar for best picture will go to the race movie or the gay movie. let's hope it is the latter, because brokeback mountain is a bona fide masterpiece that deserves recognition.
