i watched this film with a group of nazis, a french archaeologist and my ex-girlfriend on a small island in the mediterranian.<br /><br />when the tape was started, myself and my girlfriend were tied to a wooden stake at the far end of this cave like area. i told her to close her eyes and no matter what happened not to open them. the nazi's and the archaeologist didn't close their eyes and after a few seconds started screaming. the nazi's faces melted and the archaeologist's head exploded.<br /><br />after a few seconds the video tape popped out of the vcr and landed back in it's box and the top snapped shut. myself and my girlfriend were left unharmed.<br /><br />consequent to this experience, the video cassette was put in a wooden crate and stored in a huge warehouse of identical wooden crates, never to be see again.
