not as bad as "billy bathgate" but close. try as he might, warren beatty just could not be believed as bugsy. whenever he flipped out, instead of being shocked by the violence, i found it pretty embarrassing because it was so phony. the other actors don't fare as well either. annette bening just doesn't have what it takes to play seductive women, she is better off with safe characters. as many have noted, joe mantegna would have fared better if the script had him as a more believable george raft. only harvey keitel emerged unscathed, but then again this guy can do these movies in his sleep. and robert beltran, with just one line, steals one of the big beatty, bening scenes. with these films, i'm never sure if the director is intent on making the mobsters seem like normal businessmen or if it just comes out that way. either way, i don't like it. these guys were killers and no matter how much las vegas is indebted to bugsy siegel, i don't think that a movie should be made glorifying the guy, especially one with a big studio backing.
