i was supremely disappointed with this one. having just read the wonderful oscar wilde story, i had hoped for at least a little of the magic to translate onto the screen. well, there was none. this version played like a condensed, dumbed down reader's digest movie. not only did it feel rushed, it was cheapened and needlessly re written. major characters and plot points were either changed or completely removed. i appreciate the difficulties in trying to bring a novel to the screen, especially on what may very well have been a limited (tv) budget, but there is no excuse for mangling a great story in this way. i thoroughly recommend reading wilde's tale of the depravity that exists under even the most beautiful exteriors. but i cannot advise anyone to rent this travesty.
