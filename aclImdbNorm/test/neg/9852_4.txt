the tv show was slow moving and the 'offbeat' characters were sometimes irritating. only through the miracle of fast forward was i able to make it through the first 2 hours. <br /><br />the write-up indicates that it's some kind of comedy/mystery but i didn't see much of either. <br /><br />if it really picks up after the first 2 hours, please let me know, because i doubt that i will watch the rest without a recommendation.<br /><br />this review is supposed to be without spoilers so i will continue in a vague, non-spoiler, fashion. i found the two main characters uninteresting and unsympathetic. i found myself asking 'would a normal adult do that?' the man with the hedge trimmer looking out the window was irritating and when the male lead interacted with him, he looked pathetic. would a normal adult put up with someone as irritating as him?
