critics have started calling it the oscar winner club, understandably. what after halle berry won it for monsters ball then going straight to the diabolical catwoman. hilary swank triumphs in boys don't cry and follows it with the core. jamie foxx takes a nosedive as a pilot in the dull stealth after scooping a gong for ray. now it's seems hollywood starlet charlize theron craps all over her "monster" oscar with this one of the worst sci-fi spectacles ever made.<br /><br />the film loses its audience interest after a mere 20 minutes meaning the only thing really worth staying for is the fact that despite the film being rubbish charlize theron is still an exceptional actress who is clearly making the best of a crude and laughable premise. not only is aeon flux ultimately shallow but for an action flick it's also really very dull. it will only really appeal to comic book fans and horney teenagers who like the idea of theron running around half naked for 90 minutes. flux only really succeed in failing.<br /><br />set against the 2011 virus that kills 99% of the world's populace, and in the last city on earth, bregna, the survivors, some four hundred years later, in the year 2415, are continuing to live in the goodchild dynasty, the name of the scientist who developed its cure.<br /><br />all is not well in this utopia and it is not what lies beyond its high walls that protects its citizens from the never ending jungle but what unspoken, unwritten taboo that holds and binds these unwritten taboo that holds and binds these unfortunates' together that lies within these walls of paranoia, conformity and unquestionable obedience. filmed in and around berlin, ironically, this is a story set against a totalitarian state, a walled city, where its peoples are no longer capable of reproducing, and its sinister and most secret plot of how it sustains life.<br /><br />aeon flux is the assassin that has been assigned by the underground rebels to change the course of mankind, forever. this is the story of her fight for justice, freedom and revenge.<br /><br />aeon flux combined lousy narratives, ropy pacing and truly dire effects. looking more like an unrealistic video game rather than a film. the only thing that is fortunate about the failure is that no sequels are in the works, flux might just be the beginning and the end of what could have been one of the worst franchises in history, thank god for the lousy box office takings then.<br /><br />my final verdict on this truly lousy feature? there really isn't a story here just charlize theron jumping around in a black suit like a grass hopper. the acting is very wooden moronic and emotionless compared to the other cinemas that are out there today. it try's too much to be like an adaption and doesn't really take much from the cartoon which is what i was expecting, the only thing that was done half right that pays tribute to the cartoon was the fly in the eye scene. avoid at all costs.
