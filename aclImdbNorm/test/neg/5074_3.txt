how? i wondered why i hadn't seen this in theaters, or even a single commercial for it, and then after i saw the movie, i realized i was duped hardcore. i am a big transporter fan, and a big blade fan, so when i saw this i imagined some killer fight scene between two badasses, lots of gunplay, a whole bunch of stuff. instead, i got the ryan phillippe movie with a brief cameo by statham and snipes. the guy that does the audio and video in the crime lab got more screen time than wesley. it was like renting a jackie chan movie expecting a bunch of kung fu and getting erin brockavich. i expect bad movies from hollywood, but actors like snipes and statham should treat the fan base better.
