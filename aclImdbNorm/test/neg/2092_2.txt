"shut the front door" that's what i said when i was told that blockbuster got a new movie in called snakes on a train. okay, maybe that's not exactly what i said, but you get the point. i didn't need to know who was in the movie, or anything else. all i knew was that i am renting this movie.<br /><br />i probably should have asked what it was about though. in retrospect, i don't know if i would have really wanted to watch a movie about a mayan curse that causes a woman to give internal birth to snakes and have them spit out of her mouth. nor would i want to see a movie that features a guy who looks strangely enough like a pedophilic version of leif garrett.<br /><br />anyways, while the curse might be interesting on some levels (well, maybe not), there was still promise of these annoying characters getting eaten or at the very least, killed by snakes. so i was willing to sit through the first hour of very little happening other than a texas ranger forcing a girl into a nice little titty grope so she can keep her cocaine, or the hispanic shaman that likes to occasionally stab people. but then, all hell broke loose, and the girl started to spit out more and more snakes.<br /><br />*spoiler alert* so everything's going well at the end, and i'm willing to overlook the fact that some of these snakes all of the sudden turned out to be 25 feet long. after all, people are getting eaten, so it's all good. but then all of the sudden, and i'm not going to tell you how because that would ruin the best part, one of the snakes is about 300 feet long. then it proceeds to squeeze and devour the train, with all the graphic artistry of serpentaur from the old gi joe cartoons. unfortunately, i could not make a nemesis enforcer connection with this movie. anyways, so you would think that a snake that big, who ate a train, would be pretty unstoppable. well not if you know your mayan voodoo rocks and have the ability to summon tornadoes from heaven. yeah, that's all i'll say about that.<br /><br />in short, this movie is bad. really bad to the point where you might be numb after watching this, or your brain might hurt. i didn't give this a one, because no matter how stupid it was, it still wasn't as bad as date movie. so if you like camp or badly constructed b horror movies, this is the one for you. if you think this will actually be cool like its bigger, more infamous brethren, just walk away from the box if you see it. and i'll leave you with a quote from the movie that should basically sum it all up.<br /><br />"snakes can't get on a train!" because that's just silly. not like they make stops or anything....
