to this day, i have never seen elizabeth shue in anything else because of the stench of this movie. poorly acted, poorly plotted and racially neanderthal, it took place in a chicago where every black person apparently lived in a blues club. . spoiler ahead. . . . . ..<br /><br />spoiler: her "blues" solo was even more painful to watch than her clueless acting and the intro into it - 'nobody leaves without singing the blues' -- was as dumb as a post. the children her character was babysitting were insufferable and well before the movie's end i was wishing for something horrible to happen to all of them.<br /><br />i have to say though, there is one special thing about this movie; it takes a lot for a movie to offend me but this smoldering piece of tripe did what chopper, the phantom menace and catwoman could not -- make me sick to my stomach.
