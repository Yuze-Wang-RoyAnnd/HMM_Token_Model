after the book i became very sad when i was watching the movie. i am agree that sometimes a film should be different from the original novel but in this case it was more than acceptable. some examples:<br /><br />1) why the ranks are different (e.g. lt. diestl instead of sergeant etc.)<br /><br />2) the final screen is very poor and makes diestl as a soldier who feds up himself and wants to die. but it is not true in 100%. just read the book. he was a bull-dog in the last seconds as well. he did not want to die by wrecking his gun and walking simply towards to michael & noah. <br /><br />so this is some kind of a happy end which does not fit at all for this movie.
