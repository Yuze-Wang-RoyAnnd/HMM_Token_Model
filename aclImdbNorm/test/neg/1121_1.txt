makes the fourth theatrical release (the one national lampoon took its name off of) look like a comedy classic. a complete mistake and a sad attempt to capitalize on a once-proud franchise. painfully unfunny and unwatchable...even for a tv movie! the cousin eddie character has become progressively less amusing, from the original vacation when it was fresh and unique, through christmas vacation when it was starting to wear a bit thin, to vegas vacation where it was actually annoying to see come on-screen (but, in fairness, there were a lot of things that were annoying to see come on-screen in that movie!). but this attempt to move the character up to lead status is unfortunate to say the least. the vacation movies themselves met an ugly death in las vegas, and this hope at reviving even the thinnest thread of the series for television was thoroughly misguided. chevy chase and company put together a great trilogy back when he was in his prime; now let's just pull the plug and let the title rest in peace. (one tiny note of interest: the original audrey griswold--dana barron, the first of four actresses to play the part, including juliette lewis--returns to the role 20 years later! one is left only to wonder...why?)
