this movie is crappy beyond any limits. it's incredible - a very bad ripoff from jaws and other (better) shark movies. a really bad one - everything is really pathetic. the story is purest crap, actors are bad, effects very cheap, no creativity whatsoever. it looks like some really debilitated children took jaws script and arranged it randomly, then its parents took their 8 mm camera and shot the movie with their neighbors. the music is really inappropriate, just some "elevator" music, bland and overly optimistic when nothing happens, then slightly less optimistic when shark is around or when children gets depressed (again listens to very loud elevator music). carlo maria (the author) should be so ashamed he should ask for his name to be erased from the titles!! the movie acts as perfect demonstration how crappy music will destroy ***any*** scene which is supposed to be thrilling. there is one major difference to jaws though: in the beginning of jaws there are comments about stupid people who try to kill shark with dynamite. well, there is an attempt to kill a shark with dynamite. when this does not work, guys take an ***big load*** of dynamite and spent like 1/4 of movie by placing explosives in some sunken ship. this is really original way to catch the fish i have to admit! they use so much dynamite like they would try to kill a battleship (i would guess bismarck class of battleship) or to dig another panama channel. this is just incredible. i'm glad they did not try to use napalm-flamethrower or tactical nuclear strike to eliminate this bad, bad approximately 2 m shark. well, there is mystic disappearing native indian (who looks like german pensioner) too in this mess. this is not a movie, this is a warning example how bad the movies may be! as a warning it is useful. but the public should be protected from this crap. most of italian movies is bad, but this... this is really exceptional in the worst sense of the word.
