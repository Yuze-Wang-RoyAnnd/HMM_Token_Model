this is going to be my first review on imdb and i'm glad that the standard rating is 1 out of 10 because then i don't have to change anything...<br /><br />first there are awful movies. movies you can make a laughter out of, like island city, battlefield earth or conan the destroyer. that is totally acceptable. they makes a great party enhancer. then there are the worst movie ever. i cannot believe how utterly crappy this steaming pile of dog turd was.<br /><br />i found it on a second hand store on vhs and bought it quickly because i like sci-fi, terminator, post-apocalypse and stuff like that. everything on the box art was very promising. then i loaded in the tape quickly when i got home and the first thing that i noticed was... what? there was maybe 10 minutes (or more) of switching between present clips and flashbacks in a very annoying blue effect, with sounds that makes you puke. and it just continues over and over. then some "acting" kicks in and you wonder why you were ever born in a world, where this abomination of mankind actually exists... and then i realized, there are actually two prequels. i didn't think about it first, but the title says "3" in it... and i was horrified. but as i actually in great pain and agony watch it to the end, i thought nothing could ever make me feel worse about myself and this universe... but then a little text showed up saying... "next..." and... nemesis 4?!?!?! no please no!!!!!!!!
