all right, let me start by saying i love the original rs for the 64. the graphics were new, the ships were really fast and cool. the missions were a challenge, but you had a strategy to come up with. the computer didn't tell you every step of your mission, you could wander and explore. <br /><br />that's the first thing that's wrong with rl, everything you do is under a timetable and controlled by other people. i mean, shouldn't you, as the leader, be telling people how to handle each and every mission? <br /><br />and speaking of missions, why do they intersperse the original trilogy with completely made up crap? never mind.<br /><br />i was so waiting for this game when i heard they were going to allow you fly through the asteroid field from empire strikes back. i think anyone who is a fan of the films wanted to do this. so, they give it to you. it's the stupidest level in the game. you start by flying through the asteroid field with ties chasing after you, and your whole objective is to get farther into the field while shooting the ties. you have to kill them all to get ahead. hey, remember how many han killed when he was in the field? none, they all had poor piloting skills compared to him. i just wanted to be able to dodge the asteroids as they came at me, but instead i have to use my automatic aim guns to kill ties behind me.<br /><br />that was the biggest disappointment, you have no control over your flying, everything is sluggish. all except for the a-wing, probably the fastest and most maneuverable ship in the entire fleet. but, oh yeah, didn't han say the falcon was? anyway...<br /><br />you finally get to the battle of endor. here is the ultimate level, you get to destroy the death star, everyone's first instinct is to pick the falcon and be the leader. but, of course, you get there and have to do stupid pre-chosen strategies like finding (not to mention deciphering the difference between) the tie-bombers. this is impossible in the falcon, by the time you have spotted one group the frigate gets destroyed. the only way to get passed this part is to pick the a-wing. after this you have to attack the star destroyers and that's a real stupid chore. this game makes you feel like you're the only one defending the rebel alliance.<br /><br />after you frustratingly get through that 'fun' fight, you get to the death star. and here, you might think 'yay! i get to destroy the death star', and again, like in the asteroid field, you have to do some tedious thing while narrowly getting passed the tunnels of impending doom. your mission is to protect the ship in front of you, remember that from the return of the jedi? it's so moronic because if you pick the falcon, you'll die because you're not maneuverable enough, but if you pick the x-wing, you have to keep locking and unlocking your s-foils. so it's a choice to either kill the bad guys, or try to catch up to lando, who apparently doesn't know how to maneuver. thus dying in the process.<br /><br />the bonus stages aren't even worth aiming for as each level just gets more and more frustrating. it makes me feel the way i did when i saw the new three films, upset and in need of killing something. lucky for me, smash bros melee exists.<br /><br />i hope with the wii they come up with something a lot better and have the original trilogy levels to full capacity. i'm going to sell this game the first chance i get.
