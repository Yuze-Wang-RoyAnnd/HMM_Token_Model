the film's executive producer is none other than that messenger of peace thru transcendental meditation, david lynch, the director's father. i wonder what david's guru, his holiness maharishi mahesh yogi, would have thought of this production. the hypocrisy here is as repugnant as is the film itself. it's a safe bet that samuel l. dieteman, phoenix serial killer and devotee of recreational violence, would have loved every minute of it.<br /><br />i doubt if many would fault this film for its cinematic craft; on that level it's quite good. but on a moral level, it's the most disheartening movie i've ever seen.<br /><br />spoiler coming<br /><br />i guess it's the phoniness of the thing that saddens me the most. morally-numb generation xers learn a craft and a little post-modern aesthetic theory at art school or film school and then get involved in the arts-and-entertainment industry; and here's the result: a film which wallows in human suffering, injustice and carnage, much of which is witnessed by a nine-year old who sees her entire family brutally murdered by a couple of recreational-violence killers who, at the end, ride off into the sunset.<br /><br />no more spoilers coming<br /><br />for whom are films like this produced? narurally, sadists are going to adore this - why wouldn't they? but who else? as i noted above, there's some really good film craft here, but good craft can be applied to any subject matter. why apply it to stuff like this? also, the movie is very suspenseful, but that's not because of the graphicness & grossness of the violence; it's suspenseful because it's well-directed & well-acted. i'm sure the ghost of alfred hitchcock could explain this much better than i can.<br /><br />so what has been put before us here? and above all, why? <br /><br />yes, our world can be an ugly, dirty, even evil place, but shouldn't we dissent when an "artist" makes it her/his business to rub our faces in it? or worse still, to stick it in the faces of those nine-year olds who will, one way or another, end up seeing this on home dvd? <br /><br />i hope that people will see to it that this film is not seen by their kids. yeah, i know - dream on, bernon...
