bled is a very apt title for this as you watch it you will feel your life being bled from you . the clich'e in horrors is about people doing exactly what they shouldn't ( going down into the basement or going up into the attic) then the trouble ensues take heed then don't watch this film .show the brains that victims in horror movies never do stay clear do not enter .and if you need anymore incentive this film? is as bad as the worst uwe boll film i mean ,the house of the dead bad. i have often thought about entering a review of a film on i.m.d.b. and ,after watching some based on the comments herein ,i discovered i guess everyone's entiled to his/her opinion. please trust me on mine
