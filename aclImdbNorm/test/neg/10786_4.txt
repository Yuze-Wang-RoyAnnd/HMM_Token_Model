jeremy irons and forrest whitaker are good actors. but this movie was badly written. first of all, during the hijack scene, irons sits too comfortably in his chair...he appears to be reading something, and rather calmly too! perhaps the director shot the actor in between takes? also, the violence at the hijacking was a big letdown. slow-mo, bullets flying--how his wife and daughter get killed is just not that interesting and the tension is lost. his grieving afterward wasted another 10 minutes. then he decided to "get revenge" and talk to all his industry journalist friends and ambassadors (he's a journalist for the stuffy economist rag) and lo and behold, they actually give him tips on where to find the bad guys! how do they know? but what really made me turn the movie off halfway through was when irons finds his way into a warehouse where baddies are hanging out--but not the baddies who killed his wife--and blows them away anyway. so he's just a murderer. he gets away and, well...i shut it off. i mean i couldn't figure out how his friends knew anything, and also i thought he was after the remaining 2 guys in custody who were the original hijackers. instead he's going after their friends, i guess, or anyone who hangs out in warehouses and leaves automatic weapons laying around. the suspense was just totally conventional and the dialog was lame ("it's ok son, crying helps," he says to his son. son says "no it doesn't" and father says "you're right..it doesn't.")irons takes on questionable roles--like that one dragon movie he did. he was excellent in brideshead revisited, which is a completely different animal than this lukewarm thriller.
