writer & director jay andrews, a.k.a. jim wynorski, serves up more of his characteristic shlock with a decent cast menaced by grade-z computer generated reptiles in "komodo vs. cobra," as generic a rip-off of "mysterious island" meets "jurassic park" as you can imagine. the chief problem with this predictable yarn about monsters dining on mankind is the incredibly phony special effects. the cobra and the komodo are hilariously awful. however, the graphics people do an okay job of integrating the monsters with their victims, not that any of this is in the least believable. clearly, "komodo vs. cobra" had a budget that so low that virtually everything non-human in its looks as fake as all get out. this cheesy monster epic takes place on a remote island where the u.s. military conducts top-secret dna testing on animals. the result is that gigantic komodos and cobra thrive in this tropical island paradise. as the action opens, the primary scientist is gobbled up by a cobra that likes to swim. after, we are introduced to a group of 'greenpeace' like environmental protesters and a journalist. planet one organizer jerry ryan (ryan mctavish of "hellbent") pays charter boat skipper jim stoddard (michael pare of cbs-tv's "houston knights") five grand with the promise of another five grand if he will take them to this forbidden island. meanwhile, the u.s. military suspect that something is amiss on the island so they send their own team of men who give eaten by the supersized predators. our heroes run into the last remaining scientist on the island, dr. susan richardson (michelle borth of "wonderland"), the daughter of the scientist responsible for this insane science project, who tells them that the military is going to target the island for destruction. the title match between the two overgrown predators occurs in the last quarter hour after our heroes, who have been consistently whittled down by the monsters, find a helicopter and take off in time before the military pulverizes the island. there's no tension, suspense, or anything worthwhile in this substandard creature feature. the best thing about this yawner is composer chuck cirino's orchestral soundtrack; it gives "komodo vs. cobra" an epic feel. usually, jay andrews writes and directs tolerable drivel, but this ranks far below his low standards. the sexy women fare better at survival than the guys. in one scene, our heroic group fords a river and we don't get to see any wet t-shirts. drat! there's nothing in the way of memorable dialogue or relationships in this dreck. i think that the military guys do far too much saluting when they get their heads together to conspire. let's hope that michael pare got a good payday out of this garbage. the ending as one of the scientists takes on the characteristics of a lizard comes strictly as an afterthought. it's not so bad it's good, it's just bad.
