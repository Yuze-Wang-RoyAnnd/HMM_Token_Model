a group of douche-bag teenagers go up to an old mining town in hopes of finding gold nuggets. the one hitch in the hair-brained scheme is that the ancient supernatural miner whom the gold belongs to doesn't wish to part with his treasure so easily and so begins to dispatch the interlopers accordingly. <br /><br />literally clich'e-sprouting dialog, horrible acting, some insanely terrible 'southern dialect' and a lame unmemorable killer who resembles jeepers creepers (without the aforementioned's predilection of young boys naturally) combine to make this stinker just about unwatchable. even cult legend actress karen black in a small role can't save this aberration.<br /><br />eye candy: elina madison shows (badly lit) t&a <br /><br />my grade: d- <br /><br />where i saw it: tmcx
