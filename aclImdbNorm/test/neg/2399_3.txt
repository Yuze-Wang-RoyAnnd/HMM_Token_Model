i'm sure that the folks who made this movie think they're doing something wonderfully politically correct, because they manage to criticize u.s. wars in afghanistan and particularly iraq by suggesting that the u.s. does war well, but doesn't clean up afterward, thus sowing the seeds for future trouble. furthermore, they do this without making islamists the enemy and without making republicans the enemy, since it's the republicans that are in office and are doing this supposedly great thing, bringing down the ussr by covertly supplying a war in afghanistan.<br /><br />but seriously now . . . do we really want a movie that repeatedly says "let's go kill some russians!" like that's the greatest thing a red-blooded american can do? and are we supposed to find this congressman adorable because he surrounds himself with women with big hair and revealing clothes? even his supposedly smart assistant, who is always dressed professionally, keeps looking at charlie like he's just the most wonderful, handsomest, greatest guy around. as if she's nancy reagan to his ronnie. julia roberts does a bang-up job in her role, but basically women are really demeaned in this movie, and it was really annoying.
