what annoys me with so called 'science' programs such as these is that it is presented as if it were a fact that dinosaurs live 'millions' of years ago. firstly, nobody can even conduct a scientific experiment to prove that the earth is millions/billions of years old. it's a shallow theory based on inaccurate radiometric dating methods with huge assumptions thrown into the evolutionary pot.<br /><br />secondly, nobody can prove that evolution ever happened. all darwin's missing links are still missing ! if you look at all the fossils anywhere in or on the earth, they are complete animals of a certain kind eg: a dog or a cat. nobody has ever found the skeleton of a dog turning into a cat or in the example presented in this series, a dinosaur turning into a bird.<br /><br />this is utter hogwash. there's more proof that santa claus exists than any animal changing into another kind of animal.<br /><br />all the ideas presented in this series is an attempt to eliminate the idea that the universe and the everything in it, was created.<br /><br />this series is not science. it is a religious world view that hides under the banner of science. science is something we can observe and repeat. what you are seeing here is science fiction. <br /><br />if you want to watch a science fiction program that has the decency to admit that it's a science fiction program, then rather watch star trek or star wars.
