this is absolutely the worst comedy i have ever seen. it's hard to explain though, because (unless you've seen this) i bet you've never seen a comedy that was not good or bad; it's just there (that's the original part-not good or bad, just there)! <br /><br />let me say that i have seen every comedian appearing in a main role, and like them all. that's what makes this such a mystery. the supporting leads are actually acting (although the dialog is bad). the only character that is fairly good is the one played by john goodman. he does a pretty good job with what little dialog he has, and actually has one funny line (i won't spoil the only funny line in the movie, in case you decide to watch anyway. it involves a pancake.) the big mysteries are the main leads. i won't call them characters, because no characters have been developed. this script is so juvenile that they don't even bother to give the leads fictional names. they all just use their own. they don't even seem to be trying to act. it's as though they are all reading out loud to each other from scripts that the local junior high sent to them. i actually wrote a paper like this for my english class when i was thirteen-it wasn't funny either.<br /><br />bottom line, just don't bother to rent this. it isn't funny. it doesn't even have the kind of bad dialog you can groan to. i just sat there and stared through the whole thing. it was so boring i couldn't even work up any irritation at how bad it was. i can't imagine how this is even getting a rating of 4 here.
