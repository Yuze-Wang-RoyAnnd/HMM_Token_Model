... ever! (i always wanted to write that:) many years ago (in 1993 as i recall it) one of my former classmates persuaded me to watch what he called "a epic masterpiece". to this day it stands out to me as the worst movie i have ever seen. the acting, the story, the effects - everything is bad. unless you are one of these people who just loves to appreciate trash, you should pass on this. however chances are that since you are reading this, you've already seen it.<br /><br />out of almost 500 movies this is the only non-short i've given a 1/10.<br /><br />i haven't seen any other low-budget asian warrior flicks, so i guess there's even worse things out there! scary... <br /><br />:p
