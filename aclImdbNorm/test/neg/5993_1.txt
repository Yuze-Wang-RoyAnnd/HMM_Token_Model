the creature? yeah, it and the movie it stars in. hell would seem infinitely more frightening if the damned were forced to watch this for all eternity. six college students shack up in a condemned hospital to save money and end up victims of an ancient monster who must claim five victims before it returns to "the shadowy world from which it came!" other than having major logic and coherence problems (plus the fact it appears to be unfinished), this disaster is terribly acted, written, edited (by j.r. bookwalter) and directed, and the make-up fx are almost nonexistent. it's also significantly shorter than it claims (at only 80 minutes), but i'm not complaining. it's the worst movie i've seen from executive producer charles band's full moon productions and boy is that bad!<br /><br />to note, i almost didn't bother with a review, but this has gotten inexplicably good reviews on here and i figured a varying opinion was in order. proceed with caution!
