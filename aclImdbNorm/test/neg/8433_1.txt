i've seen a lot of movies in my time and this one really stands out as being the absolute worst movie ever made in the history of film making anywhere in the world. it took me 3 efforts to watch this movie. the first time i fell asleep after 15 minutes from boredom, possibly because i was already tired as it was late at night. the second effort i managed to get through 35 minutes but yet again i found myself asleep. i can go on and on like this but i think you're getting the point......nothing happens ever in this movie. a complete waste of time and money. this movie really sucks. watch it and you will know what i am talking about. if you can get 40 minutes into this movie without shaking your head and wondering what the hell is the point of it all then you are indeed a masochist. the only reason i gave this movie a 1 out of 10 is because 0 was not provided as an option. i just thought the world needed to be warned before either hiring or worse yet...buying this trash. later!
