rozema's 1999 adaptation of mansfield park is far superior to this ostensibly slightly more faithful film. the 1999 film is reviled by many austen purists, but i admire the job rozema did in making mansfield park her own. it may not be strictly jane austen's mansfield park, but at least it was well-written, beautifully shot, and well-acted by a superior cast. i don't see how austen purists can be any happier with this 2007 version from itv (and rebroadcast on masterpiece theatre/pbs). the screenplay is shoddily pasted together and dumbed down to boot, the production values are lackluster, and the cast (apart from jemma redgrave and blake ritson) are largely guilty of bad acting. i can't think of a worst miscast than billie piper as fanny price. her look was all wrong (bleached hair and dark brows??) and her talent simply wasn't suited to the material. sir thomas looked constipated the whole time. michelle ryan as mariah was on autopilot, as were the actors who portrayed the crawfords (when i think how superior alessandro nivola and embeth davidtz were in the '99 version, i just kinda shake my head).<br /><br />i haven't seen the 1983 version, so i can't comment on it, but i'd advise anyone who's curious to give the '99 version a chance. read the novel before or after and make up your own mind.
