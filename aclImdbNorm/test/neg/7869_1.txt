dear movie director:<br /><br />in the future, when trying to create a sense of urgency, it might be best to have your hero *run* instead of jog/shuffle. especially if you're trying to reinforce a time line. for example, if you're trying to convince the audience that the bad guy really will kill the hostage if the hero doesn't find her, it's probably a good idea to convey the feeling that your hero believes it may actually happen... let's face it though. making a *good* movie obviously wasn't your goal. your goal was to pump out some garbage that will make more money than it cost. otherwise you might have hired some actors.<br /><br />sincerely, bored viewer.<br /><br />this is the worst movie i've seen in a long time. i can't say that it's the worst ever, because i was able to finish it. it was bad, bad, bad though. dude, where's my refund?
