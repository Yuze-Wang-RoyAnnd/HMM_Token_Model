some sciencey people go down in a cave for some reason and there's some sort of creature that's killing them.<br /><br />i usually give a more detailed plot, but i wasn't paying too much attention to this. overall, it was dull and the only time you'll be really paying attention is during the action scenes, which the director did wonderful on.<br /><br />the acting is alright, but the characters are so dull and forgettable they blend in your mind. you'll forget who lived and who died for 2 reasons: 1. the kills are boring 2. the characters are boring.<br /><br />the ending might have shocked me more if i knew who was who.<br /><br />so you're looking for a creatures-in-cave movie? check out the descent instead.
