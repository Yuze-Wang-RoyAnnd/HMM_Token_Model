this might be for those who have been to summer camps, but it sure isn't an entertaining camp. i went to one before, but it didn't make me scream up and down for joy. instead, it made my head hurt.<br /><br />the first thing you notice is that bill murray actually had some hair in the 70s. yeah, and he also didn't mind running some. but to get him to run a lot, you would need to give him a woman to chase after.<br /><br />its not that some of the stunts can't be funny. for example the running joke with one of the councilors who is always waking up somewhere else due to the movement of his bed. instead, its that the jokes and stunts were poorly setup and executed. it just failed to be funny.<br /><br />to somebody who loves comedy, this is a pain. others are glued to it for life. i wish it was more like leonard part 6, but it doesn't come close.
