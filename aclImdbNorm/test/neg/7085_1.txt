this is quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. everything about it--acting, directing, script, cinematography--is dreadful. the alien (a human in sparkly suit) claims to be from a nearby universe; one assumes the scriptwriter meant "galaxy" but didn't bother to get a dictionary to check his terms. a better title for the film would be "it came from the planet of plot contrivances." the plot is excessively silly and nearly nonexistent. the humans are all given magical macguffins that conform to a tortuous series of unlikely restrictions just to move the bare plot. any thought to the passage of time is ignored. now it's a couple days after meeting the alien, then bam! all of a sudden there's only a couple hours left until zero hour. do yourself a favor and miss this movie. you will make yourself stupider for having watched it. the ending is particularly silly, and should have been accompanied by someone going "ta-da!!!!" as the scriptwriter just pulls something random out of his butt. i think the real alien plot is that this movie sucks so bad you'll get cancer watching it. if you can watch the last 10 minutes without crapping yourself ("enemies of freedom"--honestly) laughing, you're retarded.
