i think there's a reason this film never came close to hitting theaters. it was probably my neighbors down the street who filmed this movie with their mother's video camera. the acting is very amateur. this movie is definitely not something you would want to watch unless you were extremely bored. the actors even seem to double as directors and crew members, with no "professionalism" whatsoever. should the director(s) and/or actors choose to continue with their endeavor of making movies, i would definitely advise them to brush up on their skills and perhaps take a few (ok, many) classes on film-making and acting.
