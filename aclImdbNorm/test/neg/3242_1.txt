oh if any day u wanna see a supernatural thriller turning out to be a comedy watch this movie<br /><br />this film was a shocker as it had so many actors in it but what they do and how they fit in?<br /><br />the handling of the college scenes is like a school play where each person comes talk and then the next person comes infront<br /><br />okay reasons to laugh at the film: 1) akshay, suneil, aditya panscholi, sharad kapoor, arshad warsi as college students 2)akshay carries a gun in college 3) some pathetic stunts and sfx<br /><br />there are several more flaws like why doesn't the snake save his lover from being raped and comes in so late? also why he doesn't kill all of them together there only?<br /><br />but afterall they have to make a 2 hrs + film so hence you have a tortorius movie<br /><br />the movie is painful to watch the film was directed by rajkumar kohli who was an expert making such films in the past and had a successful record of films like jaani dushman(1979) and nagin rajkumar kohli wants to help his son's non existent career right from virodhi(1992),aulad ke dushman (1993) and qahar(1996) all flops he tried hard to promote his son and he also casts big stars so that his son gets noticed, sadly nothing could help his son's career<br /><br />the film has several comical scenes like the death scenes, how the actors after being bashed by the snake are so fit to fight him again and the climax<br /><br />direction by rajkumar kohli is bad music is bad<br /><br />that brings us to the cast akshay kumar - ordinary stuff, he has nothing much to do rather then stunts suneil shetty- awful sonu nigam- the worst debutante award goes to him, he gives cartoon acting a new meaning aftab- terrible arshad warsi- nothing to do sharad kapoor- bad aditya panscholi- irritates sunny deol- is comical in the scene when he comes to save sonu lol manisha koirala- ordinary rambha- akshay's pair kiran kumar, raza murad are as usual raj babbar- hilarious for wrong reasons the girls are awful which brings us to munish kohli this guy has a huge physique, he is even more stronger and taller then akshay kumar sadly he comes across as poor man's akshay his voice is awful, his expressions are painful the only thing he has to do in the movie is wear glasses and make an evil face rajat bedi is awful
