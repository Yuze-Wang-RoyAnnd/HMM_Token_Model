i usually love teen/high school genre flicks, but this film was really lacking in originality. the only premise this film has is four friends cheating their way through high school and the strain it puts on their friendship. there's just not enough depth in the story or the characters to keep the viewers attention for the full length of the film. the acting isn't all that bad although the actors don't really have much to work with as the dialog is tripe and clich'e'... after watching this movie, one must wonder how on earth a producer could come across a project like this and think, "i must make this film." no wonder it couldn't get a theatrical release. andrew gurland is a hack, avoid or burn.
