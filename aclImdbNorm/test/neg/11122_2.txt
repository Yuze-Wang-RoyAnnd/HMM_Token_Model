well, the sci-fi channel keeps churning these turkeys out... and they seem to get worse every time. when normally good actors like john rhys-davies and giancarlo espositto come off as rank amateurs, you can imagine how abysmal the rest of the cast in this waste-of-your-time effort is. the only halfway decent thing is the rubber outfit of the creature(which is glimpsed in such quick flashes that you don't really have time to see how phony it really is). the dialogue...the plot...if this "movie"(and i use the term loosely) was food, jack-in-the-box would be a gourmet meal compared to this. watch a re-run of "the munsters" for the 372nd viewing- your time would be better spent(and a lot scarier as well)!
