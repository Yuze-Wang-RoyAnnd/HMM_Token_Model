badland is one of the worst movies i ever seen. most of the time this is fine and i can go on with my life, but i feel the need to warn others in this case. as a veteran of the iraq war i feel it necessary to say that the story, plot, acting and depiction of what soldiers go through upon returning home was pure garbage. it was as if the director/writer/whoever latched on to whatever clich'e about returning soldiers and ran with it and ran with it and ran with it..not to mention i would imagine there was absolutely no research put into this film. the "marine" uniform looked like it was fresh off a surplus store shelf and was a pattern not used since the first iraq war. i won't go on forever, this is a horrible movie. if you are interested in the stories of returning soldiers there are much better alternatives. i recommend going to your local library.
