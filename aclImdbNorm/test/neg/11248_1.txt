this movie was completely stale and uninspired. the central premise of this movie was basically a bunch of stereotypical black people sitting around a barbershop exchanging painfully unfunny repartee. i did not laugh one time during the entire movie. i could have sat in any barbershop in america and have heard this banal banter, and maybe have even come out with a decent haircut. i cannot understand why this mess got any favourable reviews, much less why so many people have wasted money on this. none of the characters here were funny or worth caring about. i really didn't care whether the rival barbershop across the street would cause nappy cutz to go out of business. don't waste your money on this one, folks, as that is the only way to get hollywood to stop churning out these shambolic pieces of rubbish. 1* out of 5
