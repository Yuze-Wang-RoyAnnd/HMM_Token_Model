i watched this movie on tv last night, hoping for a realistic account of what could happen if there were an outbreak of some highly transmittable disease. i was disappointed, and i think the movie was garbage. it did not seem real to me. some of the acting was awful, in particular that of the doctor. she was about the worst i've seen. the whole thing played like a cnn 'worst case scenario'. even the obligatory disaster movie human relations bits didn't seem sincere. i have seen some disaster movies, in particular those weather ones, which are actually so bad they are amusing. this one is almost as bad, but it is not even amusing, it is tedious and boring.don't bother with this one.
