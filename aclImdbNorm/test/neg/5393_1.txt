like many, this dung heap caught my eye while i was channel surfing. it's a horror film, set in the woods, it has a stupid title, but hey "michael rooker" is in it, and he has been a part of some great horror flicks, i know he wouldn't steer me wrong.... ugh! the most insulting part of this, is that i actually watched it. i see director johnny martin is a stuntman, well this stunt simply sucks, and how he got some of the actors to do this watery bowel movement is the biggest mystery of all... i can understand casper van dien, but shame on you mr. rooker. your good name in the horror community has been forever tarnished, and your agent should be fired immediately. i'm sure this nugget of fecal matter is available on dvd, but if you enjoy the .99 cent menu at mcdonalds, you'd get more for your money there.
