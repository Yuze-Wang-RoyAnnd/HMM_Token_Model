i endured this film just to satisfy my curiosity. it has to be one of the worst films i have ever sat through. i am amazed that this film currently has a 7.5 star rating. the acting is awful, script is non existent and the characters are so predictable and hollow. for a funny film i cannot remember even snickering once and fail to see how it could be defined as a comedy. do yourself a favour and stay well away from this dross and check out some more worthy alternatives that would give you far greater pleasure. check out films like the holiday or 27 dresses, these movies would offer a far more satisfying cinema experience. i sincerely hope more educated film goers vote negatively for this film, in the manner it genuinely deserves there bye giving it a more realistic rating that other film buffs could base their judgement upon. come on folks let's be fair to everyone concerned and give those involved with this film a true reflection on what it is they have produced - an extremely mediocre picture that deserves to be forgotten very quickly.
