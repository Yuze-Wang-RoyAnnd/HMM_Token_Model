without a doubt, the biggest waste of film of the year. this movie is poorly structured, sadistic, cruel and filled with unlikable characters. on top of that, and maybe the worst crime, it's uninteresting and vastly predictable. as soon as bill pullman's character doodled on the photo changing the word from "evidence" to "violence," i had the entire plot figured out. there are no surprises and there is no compelling reason to watch this trash. the only redeeming feature for me is that i saw this thing for free on my hdnet cable and didn't waste any money. i would truly be angry if i had paid to see it in a theatre.<br /><br />anyone that labels this thing a thriller really needs to get out more. an awful, awful film in every way that matters.
