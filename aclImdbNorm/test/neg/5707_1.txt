the main character is a whiny, irresponsible study of how to throw yourself a pity party. she loses it at the drop of a hat, acts pathetic, is schizophrenic, and left me wondering why on earth she doesn't understand why these 'friends' of hers haven't called her in three years. (get a clue, sister - you're a juvenile mess!) i couldn't stand her or the friends. i never felt connected to any of the characters. to make the entire movie even more unbearable, someone went far out of their way to put the world's most hideous collection of crocheted and knitted hats in existence on film for all of eternity (this alone should warrant someone be put on wardrobe probation for a decade!)<br /><br />the acting wasn't awful, but not really believable either, and in the end the only thing that i did care about was the two hours i'm never going to get back. don't waste your time - go catch up on a dentist appointment instead!
