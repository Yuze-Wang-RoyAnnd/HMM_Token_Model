i saw this on a boring sunday morning just this morning. well i was drawn to the fact that it's an outdoor movie.. i was hoping to find some nice sceneries but it the views where just limited.. they just go back and forth in the same spot all over again.. i hate it when they're using this so called hi-tech stuffs like the this motorola blue-tooth headset they're using to eliminate the use of a walkie talkie it was just so funny.. they look like amateurs. and they where like advertising those badly designed alien-ware laptops that could link up to a satellite to find people.. i couldn't say more about this tv-movie.. the ending was bad that it looks like they cut it short eliminating the use of rescue helicopters and etc.. */**********
