okay, so writer/director larry bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in hollywood in order to produce his own film and fill up the cast with eye-catching names. good for him! now what he really still needs is inspiration and talent in order to come up with an actually worthwhile scenario rather than the overly pretentious and wannabe convoluted crap he penned down here. "hell ride" isn't a movie; it's a hectic and hopelessly inept fan-boy endeavor to bring homage to the notorious biker-flicks of the 60's and to the recently revived grindhouse cinema formula in general. with "hell ride", larry bishop embarrassingly fails in his set-up and there are many obvious reasons for this. he hasn't got a story to tell
