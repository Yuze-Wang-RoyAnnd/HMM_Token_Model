this has to one of the most pathetic, predictable and badly acted films i have ever seen. clint eastwood has never been worse, never have i seen somebody less convincing on screen. i was laughing at him the whole way through. then there's this romance kinda thing between him and the gorgeous rene russo, which was even more pathetic than the one between mr.connery and ms.zeta-jones in entrapment.<br /><br />one imdb user posed the question: what's not to like about this film? i'm asking: what is to like about it? and the answer is: john malkovich. he is an absolute genius and probably the best movie villain ever (he even saved con air you know). but that's it. <br /><br />this movie is called in the line of fire, but 'bodyguard 2: the rip-off' seems to be a more appropriate title. watch only if you are a die hard john malkovich fan. otherwise, avoid at all cost. *1/2(out of five)
