i like the concept of csi, but the show is spoiled by some seriously wooden acting. the medical examiner has the best lines and delivers them in an arch, offhand manner that livens up the story. unfortunately he has little screen time.<br /><br />also, why does jorja fox always look and act so utterly unhappy? i know that forensic investigation is a very serious business, but the characters, for the most part, seem to confuse seriousness with humorlessness and a complete lack of personality. i can't imagine dating either sarah sidle or catherine willows; what would you talk to either one about? i'm waiting for the episode when, at the end of a shift, catherine picks up a remote control, points it at grissom, shuts him down, and wheels him into a closet until the next day.
