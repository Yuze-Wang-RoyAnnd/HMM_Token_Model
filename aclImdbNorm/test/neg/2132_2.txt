movie i have ever seen. actually i find it one of the more entertaining episodes of mst 3000 i have seen. not that it was good, but for anyone who has seen manos: the hands of fate knows this one wasn't two bad. the monster in the movie looked terrible, everyone wore upsetting swim suits, and the plot was laughable. i still don't have a clue as to why they made the monster, they never really gave a good reason. the lead female had to be the scrawniest gal i have ever seen. they would have done better if they cast the gal that was killed at the beginning as the lead. on the plus side the dolphins acting was great!!!
