for years i hesitated watching this movie. now, i know why. not only is it a comedy that fails at being even remotely funny, but there's also just nothing to laugh *at* about the movie. it was even worse than i'd expected. i rented this sucker and still felt cheated out of time more than money. i have never seen a film that annoyed me that much. it is a movie about stupid people that are doing stupid and terrible things. i don't really know either how someone with common sense could actually act in this kind of movie. i have used imdb for some time but felt obligated to register just to help prevent poor unsuspecting folks from renting or, worse, buying this stinker!! really a waste of time and money. i must say that the plot line is awful.
