ok, no one will confuse this with citizen kane but you've got to love a movie where the women are always topless. there are a few catfights and some kinky sex as well. on the other hand i hope they didn't overpay the guy who wrote the dialogue. here's a prime example. after one of the captive girls dies: <br /><br />"this is terrible. it reminds me of the day zenobia died" "a relative?" "no, my favorite cow." i guess they saved some money on the script and blew it on great special effects like that plastic crocodile. i will say that it took me three sittings to make it through this fine work of art, never a good sign. i guess that's what happens after a while when everything looks the same. i hope the folks waiting to rent it next didn't get too impatient. don't worry folks, it's on it's way.
