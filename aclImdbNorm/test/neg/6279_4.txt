h.g. wells' war of the worlds by director david michael latt is a slightly less-than-average flick which isn't too bad if one considers the budget he had to work with - only $1 million. for this budget, the production value wasn't too bad - the best part of it is the visual effects (i was thoroughly impressed with the cgi considering the budget) and sound design. the less-then-stellar parts of this film are the story which is very prolonged at best (but again i think this is because of the budget they had - they had to prolong certain scenes to create the feature length 97 minutes), the acting (again it's because the actors had no story to work with), very few exceptional camera shots, and the music. however, again, i can let the negative parts go for the most part only because this film was made for a meager budget and still had good production value. still you should,d see it for the sake of seeing how a low budget version of war of the worlds can be made even with flaws. 4 out of 10.
