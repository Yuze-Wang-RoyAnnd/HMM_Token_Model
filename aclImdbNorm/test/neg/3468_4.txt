'leatherheads' tries so hard. tries to be light hearted. tries to be a comedy. tries to be a love affair. let's see, it tries to be a 'his girl friday' by way of 'the sting' by way of 'it happened one night' by way of a dozen sports movies. alas, trying isn't doing and the movie is as soggy as the last game's field.<br /><br />a fan of movies would watch the big fight scene in the speakeasy between the duluth bulldogs and some soldiers and realize that the fights that john ford staged with such style and verve and humor in movies like 'the quiet man' or 'donovan's reef', or 'the searchers' may have seemed easy to do but obviously aren't. i would bet george clooney thought channeling john ford would be easy as well. how hard could it be: masculinity run amok, punches, bottles broken over heads, an imperturbable piano player...just put it up there on the screen with some happening music. sorry. it takes a master to make fight scenes flow.<br /><br />movies aren't wished into existence. humor is hard. romance is hard. slapstick a lost art.<br /><br />i once read that you never wanted to sit too close to a ballet performance. something about not wanting to prick the fantastic bubble of the performance by hearing the thuds of the dancers' feet or the grunts of the lifts. this movie is like that...all strain and good intentions, handsome actors, nice sets, but it thuds through its paces rather than gallops like the original galloping ghost, red grange, who the movie is loosely based on.
