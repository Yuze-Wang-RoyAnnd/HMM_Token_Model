i am still trying to figure out what the target of this movie was: 1) whether to show how stupid, disorganized, unprofessional and arrogant the police is (i surely could add various adjectives here, but i think my point on this is clear). 2) whether to show how a twisted-minded crook that does not know what he wants from himself can create chaos. 3) whether to show if a persistent detective will solve a case just by asking the criminal the same stupid question over and over again till the criminal answers? 4) or was it just to show that any 90 minutes of filmed material can still be called a movie
