my wife and i watched this movie because we plan to visit sicily and stromboli soon. fortunately (or unfortunately) the landscape and seascape (complete with tuna) are the only believable members of this cast. we expected reasonable well-written and well-acted movie, but were disappointed. its only redeeming grace is an extended and remarkable fishing sequence full of authenticity: thrashing tuna, nets, wooden boats with long oars, and passionate, if superstitious, fishermen.<br /><br />the movie's sequencing is stagy, its dialogue stilted, and the acting ranges from stiff to completely "over-the-top." one scene, in which bergman stresses out as her macho, native and na"ive husband sics his ferret on an "innocent" (but apparently already deceased) rabbit would be perfect grist for a monty python skit.<br /><br />when the volcano blew we hoped for a merciful end to the suffering (ours and the casts'). unfortunately, the movie continues to flail on, staggering finally to a melodramatic and absurd ending. unless you're really into old-time tuna fishing, pass this hokey effort by.
