though stephen gyllenhaal is a good tv director with a few good full-length to his credit, "homegrown" is just a mess in its script and direction. despite performances from billy bob thorton, john lithgow, kelly lynch, jon bon jovi, jamie lee curtis, and ted danson, a cast this good couldn't save the film.<br /><br />gyllenhaalics will know that jake and maggie are in the film but you don't see jake very well and maggie's only in it for 30 seconds as babysitter tipping off lithgow's character about a bust. it's not even a lowbrow pot comedy as the film was intended to be. it just wasn't funny.
