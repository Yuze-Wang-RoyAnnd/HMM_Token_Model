worst movie ever seen. worst acting too. i cannot imagine a movie worse then this. nothing to see. no acting at all.t hey (actors) should look for another job. i cant't understand who was stupid enough to actually put money into this movie.<br /><br />i'm sorry for eric roberts. must be tough...i cannot imagine how huuuge his mortgage must be to justify taking the job!<br /><br />the ladies in the movie...perhaps they better stick to xxx.<br /><br />as for the leading man...what a lead! he better be put on a lead and stay there! i can see him being more successful at barking rather than acting. <br /><br />overall rating: do not rent...do not buy!
