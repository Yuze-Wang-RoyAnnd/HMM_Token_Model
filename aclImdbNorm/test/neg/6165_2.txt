i'm sorry guys, all who thought this film could be something great, i'm afraid you would be disappointed.<br /><br />the standard, the movie wanted to set is completely ruined by some very simple plot. so simple, that the movie is not evolving until the end. i asked myself if the plot wasn't about the action but about the main character (played by mickey rourke), but i found that the character was inconsistent - either he is a professional killer or some guilt haunted brother. but both don't go together, because the kid he tries to guide poses him in dangerous situations where no professional killer would put himself. now, joseph gordon-levitt, is a good looking actor, but he played his character a little unnatural. i didn't believe his acting, it looked like the director tried to pull out of him some personality he couldn't provide. and he didn't have to, because his less crazy behavior was creepy enough. the only one whose acting was great, was diane lane. if not her, i would give this movie 1 star.<br /><br />in conclusion, i expected to see some well played movie and some interesting plot. and i completely blew it with my high expectations.
