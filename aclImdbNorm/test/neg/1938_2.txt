i have not watched every jackass episode. it was mildly entertaining if nothing else was going. but after watching jackass #2 i was fond of bam and dunn. they had a nice attitude in the movie jackass so i figured i'd tune in on viva la bam. boy was i mistaken. seriously, you could pair a bunch of 2'graders, provide them with the same budget and i bet they could knock off something more creative on the screen. i mean, c'mon mtv!! at 23 where most people are tuned in you give us this rubbish.<br /><br />everything seems so forced. you don't know the characters because there's no attitude at all. you can't appreciate bam or dunn, or anyone for that matter. if there would just be a tiny tiny doze of thought. anything we won't forget as soon as next shot goes on.<br /><br />they finally manage to create a good shot and you like whats going on. you sit there, just waiting for their reaction, and then some jerk closes the scenes with two lame sentences and bang. was that the close for that shot or what, please?. if i had been there i would freak out and laugh. do some insane stuff and have my adrenaline pumping but these guys... just scripted stupid reactions.<br /><br />yes they get a few chuckles of the audience by cheap gross jokes, or gigantic jokes which in my opinion are such a waste of cash. <br /><br />many many normal humans which was not taken under the jackass wing could in a heartbeat write a far funnier script. or impress with visual camera work. even spontaneous wannabe cool guys without a script would pull of a better job. mtv could in a whim bring more soothing material on the screen. you just need to fire the writer of this stupid show.<br /><br />some scenes actually require a bit of courage and therefore 2 stars.
