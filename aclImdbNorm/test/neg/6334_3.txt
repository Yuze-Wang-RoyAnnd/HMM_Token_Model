another sadistic and ultra-sleazy late 70's/early 80's revenge movie?? wes craven sure launched a popular trend with his "last house on the left" although "terror express" is more like a rip-off of other rip-offs, like "i spit on your grave" and especially "night train murders". storywise, this movie has absolutely nothing new to offer so the only thing left to do for director ferdinando baldi was to multiply the sleaze-factor by a thousand! this is actually just a soft core porn flick that gets a little bit rough near the ending. on the night train from rome are three hopelessly imbecile loser running amok. they provoke the male travelers and sexually harass the females. things get a little out of control and a traveling convict comes to the rescue of a prostitute who keeps being screwed around by the three. this is a very tame movie and there wasn't even enough budget to buy a couple bags of fake blood. this type of movies is generally infamous for the brutal rape sequences and the discriminating behavior towards women, but the sex in "terror express" isn't unsettling at all. on the contrary, these 'rapists' spend more time orally pleasuring their victims then getting some themselves! the music is great, the dialogs are unintentionally hilarious and the characters are the most ridiculous ones i ever beheld. the villains are wimps and the train-passengers are so motionless they look like part of the set. if you like your exploitation as sleazy as it gets, this is your film. however, your hunger for blood and controversy will definitely not be stilled. "terror express" should be in the porn-section of videostores.
