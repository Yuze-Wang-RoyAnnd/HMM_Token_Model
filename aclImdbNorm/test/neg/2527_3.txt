while everyone does a decent job in this film, i agree with the other comment: it's too loose and scattered, too much like a script-less experiment with really talented actors. as such, it isn't enough to hold your attention. having said that, there are a few really funny moments, one involving dylan mcdermott and a flaming shot glass that i think anyone who's been that drunk would find as funny as i did; the other is a split-second with an inflatable dinosaur. crispin glover does his usual nutty twitch-fest guy and does it fine, harry dean stanton does his usual nutty patriarch (repo man, anyone?) etc. good cast, not enough to keep it going. just a few gems, seconds long.
