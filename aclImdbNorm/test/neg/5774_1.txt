and unfortunately, so did i. any movie that relies on a bad pun as its tagline or its title should be relegated to the $2.00 bin, but we decided to try a second consecutive bad movie for movie night. we had a winner in "house of the dead"--go with that one if you want a laughable flick.<br /><br />some witch jumped into the water after being set on fire by mr. miner. some guy took a dump in the woods. and that same guy grabbed a new girlfriend right in front of his old one. i don't remember much else. the last third of the movie was utterly insipid, and we were all waiting in agony until the end.
