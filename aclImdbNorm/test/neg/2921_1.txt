i'm thinking of some things for this movie: first, really is a very bad movie. this is really "superbad". the film looked very promising in the trailers but fell flat... maybe the original idea was good, but between a bad script and bad acting the movie became boring and empty. my advise is don't waste 2 hours of your precious time. you have been warned. this is the first movie i rated 1 star at imdb.com... second, none of the characters are likable. you really don't care what happened to them... third, the villain is very easy to identify. the grandson kills his father, sodomizes the friend's son, get the maid pregnant, smothers his grandfather... like jt says, "if you like evil with no retribution, this is your movie". nothing more to say...
