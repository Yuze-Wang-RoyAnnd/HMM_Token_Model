since i am required to write minimum of 10 lines, and this garbage deserves not only a single one, i'll start with the following: 1. i voted awful for this dreadful so called "movie".<br /><br />2. let me explain why these turkeys mr. david varod produces are shot mainly in my beautiful homeland, bulgaria (just in btw, for the illiterate people around - this country is in europe, based north to greece and has absolutely nothing to do with mexico and uruguay) some years ago, nu image has invaded our country and started making crappy mostly direct-to-video releases. why here? because here they pay derisively low fees to the bulgarian crew and to the bulgarian actors (most of them distinguished ones) which are, in many ways, better than most of their american colleagues. personally i am ashamed of that fact. the reason is, of course, the greediness of the americans involved and their wish to get most, if not all of the profit. actually it would't be so bad if only the production wasn't so filthy and pale. there hasn't been a good picture shot here for years. at present nu image is being sued here over the very questionably purchasing of our national cinema production centre called boyana films. no doubt about it there has been corruption, there has been deceit, there has been a lies in this recent purchase. the bulgarian cinema is dead. long live the bulgarian cinema!
