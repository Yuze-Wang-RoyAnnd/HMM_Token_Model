chip foose is an absolute genius and the end result of the projects are truly amazing. the co-hosts do a good job. i particularly enjoy watching the "project" come together. the end results are much better than when they came off the assembly line what with the mechanical and cosmetic advances of today. however, i do get annoyed somewhat at the fact the "projects" seem to be the property of the already rich and/or famous. it's too bad the ones getting overhauled can afford the undertaking. let's see now, vince neill of motley crew gets a car make over for his buddy. hello! if he (neill) were a true friend he would have paid to have his friend's car restored. what a joke! another episode shows a middle aged seemingly well-to-do gal getting her '56 caddy named betsy done. the husband of 30+ years was behind it all. the couple looked like money was not in short supply. what a shame. i guess the lunch pail guys like me will have to save for the day that will never come. i happen to own a '53 ford project chip. will somebody pick me?
