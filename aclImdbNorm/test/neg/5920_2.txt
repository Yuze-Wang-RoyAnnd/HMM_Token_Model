i thought this movie was awful. i understand it was shot on a small budget but the acting was terrible and the movie itself was just plain dumb. the plot was predictable and the central character was an unsympathetic moron. in fact, all of the characters were unsympathetic and none were fully developed at all. the audience relates to no one in the movie. it was supposed to be suspenseful but if you don't care about the characters, it's hard to get "into" the movie at all. i felt like an outsider being forced to listen to someone tell me a stupid story. all the plot twists at the end were just a little too much - i was actually laughing when i guess i was supposed to be "shocked." all in all, i thought it was really just a bad movie.
