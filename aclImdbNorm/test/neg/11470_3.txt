i'm desperately trying to stay awake while watching the movie solomon kane. i have about a 20 minutes to go. if it gets any better, i will come back here and let you know, but somehow i doubt that will happen. solomon kane looks like it is based on the video game dark watch, and it sounds like it is based on the video game legacy of kane, but unfortunately neither is true. i hear it is based on some comic book or graphic novel or pulp fiction or something else that i have never heard of, but whatever it is based on, there is nothing original in this excruciatingly boring movie. the atmosphere is stolen from the movie 300, which wasn't that great in the first place. the tedious overacting takes itself so seriously that it's nearly hypnotic, and to be clear i mean that in a bad way. the plot is practically non-existent: violent guy trying to be nonviolent meets friendly family, friendly family is murdered, violent guy becomes violent again. all the characters are stereotypes taken from waterworld or book of eli or the hills have eyes or, whatever, just choose another apocalyptic slash fantasy slash wizardry movie that you have seen and there you have it. someone, somewhere, said, this is how to make a movie: use a blue filter to make everything look mysterious, add plenty of slow motion shots of horse hooves splashing in murky puddles, add snowflakes hovering around while two boring characters are speaking to each other, and oh yes rain pouring down dramatically to distract from the fact that nothing is really happening, and don't forget the black silhouettes walking toward us with fire blazing behind them, and lots of torches burning, and of course blurry fight scenes during which it's not clear what is actually happening because we don't have the budget for the gory special effects so just throw in the sound of metal clanking, and, oh, by the way, don't let any character live long enough for the audience to understand them, relate to them or sympathize with them, and cross fingers, hope that fans of sword and sorcery films will eat it up, even though it is complete doo doo, and go straight to video, do not pass go . . .
