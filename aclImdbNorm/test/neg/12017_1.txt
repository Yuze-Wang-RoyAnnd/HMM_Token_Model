this was just an awful movie. i've watched it once when i was roughly 12, i am now 19 and i don't think i will ever forget this movie.<br /><br />i still feel sick whenever i think about it, it was just everything horrible that could possibly fit in one movie. i really don't understand what kind of person would enjoy this utter rubbish. it's not enough to simply turn off your mind to enjoy this movie, i can enjoy the dumbest made-for-tv disney movies as much as the next person, but this is something else completely.<br /><br />usually i don't like to judge a movie until i have seen it myself, but believe me i am doing you a favour. do not watch this movie.
