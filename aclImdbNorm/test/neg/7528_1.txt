pep squad is at a very low point with its confusing plot line and horrible acting.<br /><br />first, let's tackle the characters. cherry (brooke balderson) continues to hold an outrageous, boiling anger throughout the entire film, which is due to her overwhelming passion to become prom queen. however, it becomes completely unknown to the audience why cherry wants to become prom queen in the first place. before the nominations are even read off, she storms around the school with a constant disinterest upon being there, and shows no interest in the place or its students to begin with. why does she care so much to be their prom queen? brooke balderson apparently presents an "acclaimed" performance but in reality just spends the entire time with an angry face, stomping around, killing people. maybe it's just me, but i think if you handed any young actor/actress a script that only requires him/her to act insanely angry, you're not asking for much. you're also not allowing the character to develop very well.<br /><br />beth's character, played by jennifer dreiling, is even worse. dreiling shows absolutely no emotion and no connection to her character whatsoever. when being harassed by her principal, she knocks him down (after several seconds) with no feelings of disgust or shock or anything equally traumatizing. her lines are read like she is reading trivia off the back of a cereal box.<br /><br />throughout the rest of the film, the students in charge of his kidnapping sound more like they are planning a barbecue than deciding what they will do with their principal, sitting tied up in their basement.<br /><br />meanwhile, cherry is off killing several female prom queen candidates, and no one even notices or cares. (yeah, i get it, i get it, the whole town is worried about prom. very realistic. at least you could throw in some funny scenes with the cops, but that might be asking too much.) for example, right after cherry drives by the school and shoots down a handful of students, beth is found being interviewed by the local media. the reporter mentions "the shooter" in a way that makes it seem like no one knows who killed these innocent students, but then one second later asks, "what do you think about guns in the hands of minors?" or something to that effect. where did the reporter jump to such conclusions? <br /><br />at the end of the movie, after cherry kills the winning prom queen and prom is deemed over, with the media showing up again, beth simply adds that "she understands (cherry's) need to be heard" and walks away with her friends, smoking cigarettes in a calm, unaltered mood. no one is even strayed by the fact that they just witnessed a murder.<br /><br />not to mention the students constantly parking in a yellow zone, and no one seeming to care that there is a sudden rise in violence in the town, julie living in a large house with no parents present, and the bizarre party at her house (maybe i'm a little left out of the scene, but last time i knew, high school parties did not involve naked women artistically dancing in a pool of water while men bob for marshmallows and everyone basks in their "i'm so indie and mod" attitudes), beth's parent's horrible acting with her mother acting over-the-top and her father simply nodding at everything the mother has to say (and not in an entertaining way either), along with stupid scenes such as the new black principal running after cherry as she tries to shoot her with a gun. yes. very realistic.<br /><br />the only compliment i can give this movie is that the photography is wonderful. the angles are flattering and the screen is very clear and crisp with each shot.<br /><br />too bad the acting and script aren't.
