hi guys, this is my first review and i would had to have picked the worst movie to review. as i only watched 5 minutes of it but trust me you could see this movie was going nowhere. the acting was deplorable, the camera work and lighting looked as though it was shot and run by a pack of 10 year old's. no offence to 10 year olds.i just couldn't take anymore i got off my couch, took the the house of adam dvd out of the dvd player and threw it in the garbage. maybe if you are a colin farrell fan this movie may interest you, because the character in the movie, anthony, is a colin farrell look a like. but that is as far as it goes, he certainly will never have col's acting abilities. i gave this movie a rating of 1 (awful) only because there were no minuses in the drop down list cheers.
