my friend zac rented this movie free of charge since his mom works at a rental store. i still feel ripped off, since i won't ever be able to get those 100 minutes of my life back. having watched the first "dark harvest" the night prior to this viewing, i expected to at least see a crappy remake of the first film. wrong.<br /><br />there isn't a single scarecrow in the movie (unless you count the one of the cover of the box), nor are there any real death scenes. the movie got its r rating from an 8 year old girl screaming "god d**n" at her father.<br /><br />there is no amount of tequila that could make this movie bearable. believe me, we tried.
