being a huge street fighter fan and thoroughly enjoying the previous film, street fighter ii: the animated movie, i was really looking forward to this one!<br /><br />however, it seemed that the film had no real sense of direction or purpose. most of the characters i could not associate with and it just lacked the intense action that made the other mentioned street fighter film so superior.<br /><br />there are some good points however, the animation is superb!!!
