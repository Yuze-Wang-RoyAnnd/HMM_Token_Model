quentin tarantino's partner in crime roger avary (co-writer on "pulp fiction") ventures out on his own (q.t. goes exec. prod. this time) for this over-boiled french thriller.<br /><br />eric stoltz is zed, safe cracker extraordinaire who has drifted over to france from the u.s. at the request of an old friend. there he teams up with a motley crew of drugged out hippies who, with little or no planning, think they can knock off a bank vault full of gold bullion on a french national holiday.<br /><br />avary has reworked the robbery gone wrong theme that tarantino developed so well in "reservoir dogs", only "killing zoe" is not good enough to survive on the strength of this alone, so avary has thrown in a rather beautiful distraction. julie delpy is zoe, a student come call girl who entertains zed on his arrival in paris. a stunning distraction she certainly is, but nothing more.<br /><br />i guess our director wanted to add a different angle to this basic theme, but sadly the move did not help to add the depth his shallow plot so desperately needed. there was never a story in this idea, which was nothing more than that, an idea. even the surreal journey into the seedy dives of paris is uninspiring. i figure one would have to concede that there was never much of a movie in the story of a bunch of gangsters shooting each other up over a botched jewellery heist either, that is until you add intricate characters and snappy dialogue. "reservoir dogs" had it, "killing zoe" did not.<br /><br />stoltz's strong interpretation of the doubtful zed and jean hughes-anglade's mad portrayal of the obsessive ring leader do nothing to lift proceedings. in short, avary has unsuccessfully attempted to conjure entertainment out of nothing.<br /><br />friday, september 15, 1995 - astor theatre
