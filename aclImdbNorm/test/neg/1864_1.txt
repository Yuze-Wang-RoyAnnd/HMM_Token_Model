this is one of the worst movies ever made. i can't believe how bad it was. i was shocked at the awfulness of the "ghoulies" masks. they are obviously halloween masks! the mouths don't even move when they talk!!!!! why did they feel the need to make the ghoulies comical and goofy? whenever they do anything there seems to be this circus-like music and overused bonk and boing noises when they hit people. the bondage dominatrix lady is one of the worst actresses i have ever seen. this movie is just bad. the plot is nonexistent. the mom from one tree hill is in this though and she has obviously had a nose job since this was made. why did the main character from the first movie return to make this garbage? bad bad bad movie.
