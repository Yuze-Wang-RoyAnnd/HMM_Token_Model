(spoilers)<br /><br />oh sure it's based on moby dick. totally obsessed and it destroy's him. it's a total folly. the movie starts off rather well, but by the end of the film, everyone else is destroyed and the main star's mind is a blank.<br /><br />the supposed half sister is never convincing. some very poor lighting effects. music is interesting. but little else. it took me over a month to finally finish the darn thing. i suppose if you like being john malkovich, you might like this. but where as bjm was a great movie that i just didn't want to watch again, pola x is a movie i just hate to high hell. the only possible excitement in the film is the gratuatious incest sexual scene towards the end of the film. (hopefully yer not thinking of catherine either.)<br /><br />this movie is severely boring, depressing, and poorly directed. not highly recommended. if if you like french movies. (go watch crimson rivers instead)<br /><br />4/10<br /><br />quality: 5/10 entertainment: 1/10 replayable: 0/10
