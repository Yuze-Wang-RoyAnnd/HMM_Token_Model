another french film with absurdity. baise-moi(f*ck me) tells the story of two young women who come together to kill and f*ck. one of them is a porn star who escapes from her community after being raped and killing her boyfriend. second one is a hooker who kills her flatmate and sees her boyfriend being shot dead. after those incidents they meet at a tube station(both misses the last train)then the whole thing starts. they find a bound and come very close. they abuse men sexually, take drugs, drive around the country and have lots of sex. thats all about baise-moi really. we can see that they have no mercy for their victims. they even kill a woman for her money. both actresses are real porn stars in france that affects the movie in two different ways. they look so comfortable in sex scenes, nonetheless, they can't make the whole film worth watching as ,to me, the film does not require no further ability of acting than that. it is a version of thelma and louise on a different level. i could recommend you loads of things to do instead of watching baise-moi. so, bother to watch if you wanna see a pointless, kinky film. * out of *****
