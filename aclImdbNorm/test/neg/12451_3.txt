this is an adaptation of an edith wharton work, whose writing is amazing. sadly, this movie never shakes the feeling that these 20th century movie people don't grasp the 19th century repression and desperation wharton's work depicts. ward and dalton aren't so bad, but alicia witt's wooden performance made me wince. she was supposed to be playing the restless element of the story, but she stood like a stick the whole movie long, and i never believed a word out of her mouth. when she asks sela ward "why can't i move you?" near the end of the film, i couldn't help but answer: "that's what i've been wondering for the last hour and a half!!!"
