i got this movie as a buy one get one deal at troma.com with the ruining (which isn't much better). the main reason i wanted it was to see star worms ii: attack of the pleasure pods, the dvd is a double feature with that movie. i really didn't know what actium maximus was at the time, and when i saw the trailer i got scared. it looked awful. but hey, what can you tell from the trailer? well, apparently i could tell a lot. this movie honestly made no sens to me. the special effects were so terrible you cannot tell what in god's name is going on. i understand mark hicks had a extremely low budget, but come on. and it is sad, because in the interview he sounded like this was to be an epic film and meant more than you could see. but sadly, watching the film is one of the most boring hour and 15 minutes of anyone's life. it is so utterly painful to sit through. i really can't even explain the plot to you because i didn't understand it at all and i have sadly seen this film two times! apparently they used some type of puppets for the "alien dinosaurs" like they did in star wars. but these special effects are awful, i can't stress it enough. and most of the time bad special effects are okay but this film needed them badly. it takes place on some futuristic planet where alien dinosaurs battle each other and bad actors in hooded sweatshirts run around, and they look like they are in the kkk. and some box with a blue light on it is the president. i know in the interview mark hicks said something about making this a television pilot, well, i can see why this didn't make it to cbs or nbc. there are two good things about this film. 1. the music is actually pretty good, it has an epic score that sticks in your head for days. and 2. lloyd kaufman's introduction is as always hilarious. overall, don't waste your time but check out star worms ii: attack of the pleasure pods!
