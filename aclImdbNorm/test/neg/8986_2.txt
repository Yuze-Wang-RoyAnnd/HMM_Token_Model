the story is about a psychic woman, tory, who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic childhood past (the death of her childhood friend and abusive father). tory discovers that her friend was just the first in a string of murders that are still occurring. can her psychic powers help solve the crimes and stop the continuing murders? <br /><br />you really don't need to find out because, oh my god! this was so so so so bad! i know all the nora roberts fans will flock to this movie and give it tons of 10's. then the rest of us will see an imdb score of 6 and actually think this movie is worth watching. but do not be fooled. the ending was predictable, the acting terrible (don't even get me started about the southern accents *y'all*) and the story was trite. just remember....you were warned!
