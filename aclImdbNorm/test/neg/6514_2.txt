two l.a cops track down a serial killer nicknamed "the family man" who has wiped out whole families and when one of the police officer's wife takes the deep six, questions are raised and it turns out that a serial killer isn't responsible but rather mobsters. the idea of seagal in a serial killer movie is an interesting concept, indeed one could see seagal play a good serial killer however making him a cop who has a ridiculous penchant for prayer beads and razor sharp credit cards comes off more stupid than likably ridiculous. also a running joke involves wayon's enjoyment of eating powdered deer penis and well this raunchy material is utterly out of place. not to mention the beginning of a school being taken hostage, due to a boy's breakup with his girlfriend. after seagal neutralizes him, the girlfriend tells the young lad that she loves him. now there is a lesson to be learned from all of this, if you want your girlfriend back, taking the school hostage may get you back on her good side. i myself would think flowers or the old fashioned phone call might work, then again though, i'm old fashioned. besides who am i to put a damper on somebody else's brilliant reconciliation plan.<br /><br />* out of 4-(bad)
