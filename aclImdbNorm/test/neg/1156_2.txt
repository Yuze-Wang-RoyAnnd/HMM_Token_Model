i am a big fan of horror movies, and know a lot of info on serial killers. obviously the director of this one refused to research the film he was creating, because half of the movie was fictional. more than that, the character of ed gein was portrayed in the wrong light. i did not rent the movie to worry about the deputy and his girlfriend erica. i rented it to watch ed gein and his legendary story. this movie was awful, the only reason i gave it a 2 out of 10 is because the gore wasn't too bad. acting= horrible actors= sub par movie= waste of time.<br /><br />a big upset all around, but i wont give up my search for a good horror movie.
