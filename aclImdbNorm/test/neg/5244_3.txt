another b-movie for teenagers, based mainly on cgi-effects, industrial soundtrack and some medieval imagery. it's a pitty that the legend for beowulf is used in such uninspired manner. i am a fan of christopher lambert, but i have to admit that he is getting worse as an actor and his movies too. rent it if you are teenager only.
