i liked half-life. i am still it's fan. it was frightening, intelligent and challenging. i don't tell any news it is one the best fps ever made. maybe i'm too hardcore half-life fan but the so called half-life 2 is not half-life 2.<br /><br />and i have a question: is this the next chapter of half-life? maybe the creators -valve- thinks so but i don't. where are the intelligent enemies? where is the frightening atmosphere? nowhere. i believe they wanted to make a bit different half-life (instead of another research station story), but they didn't just made a very different one, they made something that has to do with half-life like for example quake does to doom. the entire game so unsightly and unreal that it's almost forlorn.<br /><br />though the physics are truly great and there were a few good level to play, the idea to make a revolutionary physic-driven gameplay has utterly failed. when you get the gravity-gun, that can move objects, you can expect with rights to use it as a weapon- that would turn the schematic fps gameplay upside down. the truth is, you can't use gravity-gun as a real weapon. why? because the best you can do is throwing boxes and barrels that don't do much damage. if you want to keep an object in front of you to protect it can fall from about 3 shots. if you want to throw an exploding barrel to your enemy it can explode in your own "hand". the gravity-gun doesn't work as a weapon. the best usage is solving some physic-puzzles. i ask valve: why? the truth is you must use your boring, schematic fps weapons to the end(except for last level) weapons are not that made original half-life a classic. if gravity-gun would be always like at the last level -a real weapon- i'd admire what valve did. but not this. this is disappointing.<br /><br />so if you want half-life then you are searching at the wrong place. maybe you will enjoy it but i repeat: it is everything but not half-life and even not a faithful continuation of that. this is the greatest disappointment of all time. valve have shown they can make awful games too. they have managed that.
