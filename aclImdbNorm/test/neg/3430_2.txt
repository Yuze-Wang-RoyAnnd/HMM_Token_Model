other than john krasinski, this movie was absolutely terrible. the lacey chabert and andrew keegan love story was as clich'ed as possible, full of unbelievably bad lines about how her parents wouldn't ever let them be together and super-hammy longing looks. none of the "emotion" had any depth or reality whatsoever. the two accented-characters (dean edwards as rupert and whoever it was playing the gun expert)....once they saw how bad the accents were, couldn't they have decided to just drop them and rewrite a couple of lines to avoid giving the audience headaches? apparently not. i don't even know where to start with the editing, particularly the sound editing. if you hate obvious over-dubbing as much as i do, don't watch this. that being said, krasinski was great. off the bat i'll admit that i'm a huge office fan and that's why i rented this. but he's quite entertaining as the "off-the-wall friend with crazy ideas". he's got a clich'ed role, but he still manages to make it as entertaining as possible. the ending was awful. just flat out terrible. the idea of the robbery gone awry had potential, but keegan floundering around after being shot, all the way to his studio to fall ontop of a painting of chabert (which looks nothing like her) is the most cringe-worthy scene.
