i simply cannot believe the folks that made and performed in this movie really took it seriously. the skits on snl look more real. everything was laughably fake. the goofy gunfights, the ridiculous fist fights, the dialogue, the sappy background music, and even bo's blind eye. had it been billed as a comedy, it still would have made more sense but still would be bad. i can see this as "entertainment" only if you get a room full of stoned college kids watching it like it were rocky horror picture show. imagine some of the stuff you saw on blazing saddles, like mongo knocking the horse down or the old lady gettinf stomach-punched. now imagine the producer wants you to take those scenes seriously and you get the gists of this disaster.
