i wasn't impressed with the graffiti artist, despite it's artsy (aka. low budget improvisation) appeal. there is little dialog and at least for me, i was disappointed that it didn't give more credit or promote the work of guerrilla artists such as these. instead, it was a story that covers familiar territory. two guys who basically do little more than tag buildings become friends, tagging partners, and eventually experiment with a relationship. they seem like opposites, rather uncomfortable together. little is explained about their backgrounds and the things between the two young men happen at rapid speed (although, this i can understand because it's only 70 minutes or so). there's been countless numbers of similar plots and productions in recent years to the point that the sphere of independent film is starting to become just as saturated with this particular storytelling just as the mainstream has become saturated with this and more.<br /><br />much of the film may bore the viewer who needs immediate dialog and purpose. the primary figure of this story (at least extensively), performs his routines with nearly no dialog, no insight, and nothing else to carry the viewer. and, for a short film, i wished they could've gotten to the point a lot faster. that, aside from the typical plot annoyed me. yet, there was something about a momentary glimpse into the daily habits of at least two graffiti artists, even if most of it was rather unoccupied time.<br /><br />recommended if you're tired of the mainstream crap and don't mind an indie picture and have some interested into this underground, urban art form. but, you really have to watch it for yourself, because this seems to be one with a more acquired taste. for more recent indie films centering on graffiti artists, check out transit.
