bad news for anyone wanting to film a full-length parody of a lifetime network movie- the makers of a deadly encounter have already done it, albeit unintentionally. all of the lifetime tropes are there- a divorced mother in peril from a deranged stalker, an unreliable ex-husband (who, of course, cheated on her while they were married), and a police department that patronizingly dismisses her complaints, forcing her to stand up for herself. especially jaw-dropping is the scene where the heroine, after enduring a break-in and the attempted murder of her mother by her seemingly ubiquitous stalker, decides to relieve the stress by going shopping! having seen first hand the harassment of a co-worker by some creep she met at church, i know stalking is not a joke, but it certainly is in this movie.
