on a flight back from london, i watched she's the man; apparently air canada has a crap movie policy. perhaps that's not the best way to start a review of this movie. amanda bynes plays a girl who loves soccer so much that she pretends to be her twin brother to get on a team at a boarding school across town. even if you check your mind at the door (on a 6 hour flight you have to), the story is implausible and ridiculous. there are some moments of humor, mostly from comedian david cross as the principle, but the intricate love polygon doesn't really inspire emotion, although is is cleverly mixed (with the caveat of mindless plausibility). the ending is just as ridiculously mindless as the rest. i guess if i was a 12-year-old girl, i might have really enjoyed this one.
