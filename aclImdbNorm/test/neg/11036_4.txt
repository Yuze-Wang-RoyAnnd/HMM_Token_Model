a pretentious but - to varying degrees - watchable collection of mostly pointless "stories".<br /><br />but let's start from the top.<br /><br />kaurismaki: if one ever wondered what finnish love/romance was like, perhaps this dull little oddity is some indication. subdued feelings, non-emotions, apathetic faces and a very depressing prospect of moving from finland to siberia! i guess the sequel to this story will be "for our honeymoon we move from siberia to greenland". aki obviously had no clue what to write for this little movie, so he just made up some half-assed non-"story" centering around a band he particularly likes (or maybe they're his friends) because we get to watch them and listen to their music more than the two principal characters.<br /><br />erice: first off, i've never heard of this guy before
