greyfriars bobby was not a westie - bobby was a skye terrier. a highlight of my childhood day trips to edinburgh was to go to the monument to bobby. i grew up with the story of the valiant and loyal little dog, as every child in my generation did, and i remember lining up with my mum outside the cinema - with many, many other dundee children and their mums - to see the wonderful disney film. how could a movie based on such a wonderful story have been made using a westie, for heaven's sake. that's like making a movie about the life of robert burns, for instance, and portraying him as an englishman. i say,give bobby back his breed!
