the movie had an interesting surprise. somewhat psychologically gripping. and the makers could have ended it tastefully without making it just another of a rash of movies put out by hollywood promoting homosexuality and/or other sexual deviances. this could have ended with a "pay-off", but there were other motives behind the pen. what torques me off is that the mud slung in your face after you've seen the whole movie. like the disappointing "the talented mr. ripley". yeah sure, i'm just another puritan. this gay content tarnished the whole film. i wouldn't positively judge a movie for artistic or entertainment value if its sole purpose was to promote an ulterior political motivation, more so for this.
