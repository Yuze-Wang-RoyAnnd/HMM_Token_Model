beats me how people can describe this adolescent exercise as film noir. true there's a gun & a bottle & a dame & the lead is a private eye, but that ain't what makes the genre, folks. this thing plays like reheated tv cop show stuff - lots of bloody beating & lousy continuity - with a dash of chinatown memories thrown in. pretty hard to watch beyond the first 10 minutes. you want contemporary feel, watch anything by john dahl.
