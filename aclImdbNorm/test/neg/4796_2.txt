it didn't feel like a movie, and was thankfully short (under 90minutes), it felt more like a commercial of possibilties in computer graphics: most of the special effects are great, to be sure. but that cerainly don't a great or even a good movie make. not saying it's absolutely worthless viewing, since it's possible to see what are the possibilities in cgi or gci, or what ever it's called.<br /><br />as i read somewhere, "you can't fix it in the cutting room", a bad story and non-directed actors, can't be fixed in the cutting room or even with the most magnificent special effects! things can be improved in the cutting room if they have a real director and material to work from.<br /><br />however they thought this could be sold in usa is anyones idea, since usa is the crooks.<br /><br />and isn't it sooo typical of low budget stories, they have to create an imaginative country south of mexico??<br /><br />well well i gace it 2! just because of the special effects, the rest is absolute trash!
