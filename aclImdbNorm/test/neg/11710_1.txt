this movie twists the facts of anne and mary's lives into something unrecognizable. to make mary boleyn, who in fact was a rather dim and foolish creature, and make her the "good" sister is just silly. it is anne who was in fact the far more interesting character, and that is why it is her life, and not mary's, that has been told so often.<br /><br />in response to an earlier review, i fail to see how anne's life was so "criminal"... to me it's henry who was the real criminal. whatever anne's motives for winning the king and withholding her affections in order to gain a crown and husband has to be taken into context of the time in which these real-life events took place. anne, in comparison to the majority of most of the courtiers in her time, was a relatively innocent figure. most modern historians discount or have disproven most of the myths and slanders that this movie perpetuate about her, and i have never heard of anyone who actually believes the rumour than she slept with her brother. this movie is so sensational and false that it is maddening to think that someone, without knowing anything about this period in history, could walk away believing anything this movie has presented as "fact".<br /><br />i won't even get into the weird filming of the movie... but i'm pretty sure that cameras weren't invented in the 16th century, so i don't understand why anne and mary are talking to one throughout the movie... it's a really bad plot devise and is jarring and annoying, to put it mildly.<br /><br />anne of the thousand days is not accurate either, but is infinitely more entertaining and at least comes closer to telling the story of one of the most intriguing women of history. don't even think about renting this.. it's two hours you'll never get back!
