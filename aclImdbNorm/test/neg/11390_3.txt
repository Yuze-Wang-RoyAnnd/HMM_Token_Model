brainy, cross-dressing little boy finds success on the spelling bee circuit despite an unconventional and dysfunctional upbringing. shirley maclaine directed and stars as the child's grandmother, and it is always fascinating to see long-time actors getting their chance at directing a film, the material that they're drawn to and the actors they choose to work with. here, the only person well-cast in "bruno" is maclaine. the child actors seem to have been picked for their twinkle and cuteness, and squishy-hearted maclaine holds their close-ups for excruciatingly long periods; nothing about these cherubs seems natural, not the lines that fall without consciousness out of their mouths or the interaction they have with adults or even each other. as the boy's disgruntled father, poor gary sinise hovers around the edges, in mock shame, always with a pained look on his face. towards the end of the film, maclaine turns the whole thing into a passel of hugging scenes, and even concludes with the kid hugging the pope in rome! another ungodly treatise from a talented actress-turned-director who, much like sally field and her film "beautiful", cannot seem to stop winking at and nudging the audience. shirley uses ethnicity for shtick, and childhood innocence as a punchline. the children in this cast roll their eyes, crack wise with mature comments, use big words--but when one mealy-mouthed boy calls our pint-sized hero "gay", maclaine's granny instructs him to go over and punch the kid out (in front the media!). how's that for progression? * from ****
