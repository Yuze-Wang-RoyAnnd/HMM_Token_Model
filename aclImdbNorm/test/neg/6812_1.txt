ever had one of those nights when you couldn't sleep and just turned on the tube to see what was on? that is how i ran across this tripe. for myself, i would have been better served tossing and turning for the 97 minutes i wasted with this film.<br /><br />in its attempt to "be real" this movie's characters come off as such gangsta stereotypes that the story should have been the premise for a wayans brothers movie. the dialog? please! it sounded like a white man was trying too hard to write this film.<br /><br />the editing was horrible. one of my "favorite" scenes involved a car chase down a bunch of narrow alleys. cut to the characters being chased, though, and they are driving through a park complete with baseball fields in the background.<br /><br />when any of our "homies" get shot in this film, he bleeds miraculously through clothes that have no holes, which is more than i can say for the plot of this predictable load of....baking soda.<br /><br />indie films can be great even if they are low on budget and effects, but they still need to have some cinematic integrity. if i could have given it a 0, i would. if you watch it, i hope it is on cable, because even the cheapest rental would be too much to pay. actually, 97 minutes was too much to pay...
