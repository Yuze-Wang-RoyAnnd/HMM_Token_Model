this movie was extremely disappointing, i thought it would be another 'marijuana comedy' but don't be mislead, it's not at all. there are barely any weed-related jokes that come to mind, i don't even think they smoke any weed in this movie. the marijuana field is merely a plot device.<br /><br />my impression after seeing this film was that four friends were bored one summer and decided to write up a script full of (their idea of) witty dialog and make a movie. the product is bland dialog supported by mediocre acting, to say this movie has no 'hook' is a huge understatement. don't waste your time or money.
