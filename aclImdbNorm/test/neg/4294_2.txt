"the yoke's on me" is undoubtedly the most controversial film in the stooges' 23 years of shorts. the reason is understandable; by today's standards, this film can be considered racist. for this reason, it is rarely shown, if ever, on television.<br /><br />let me just state that, for the record, the japanese seen in the film were not soldiers; they were japanese-americans sent to a relocation center during world war ii. they were treated and shown as the evil enemy in this film. by all accounts - including the us government, who made an apology and reparations in the 1980s - japanese-americans during world war ii were as loyal and hardworking as any american. their imprisonment during this time is a dark blot in american history.<br /><br />there are some stooge laughs in this film, but the memories of how japanese-americans were treated during this time sullies the entertainment value. let's not confuse the loyal japanese-americans with their representation in this film as evildoers. loyal japanese-americans and the world war ii-era evil empire of japan are not synonymous. 2 out of 10.
