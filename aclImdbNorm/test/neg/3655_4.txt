the guy mentioned to sue for the 1.5 hours wasted of his life, i cant disagree on that one. the movie started as some kind of class project cam thing, and ended up in a dark room. whenever the girls where fully nude there magically appeared light all over, i know i dint write the script or having anything to say about it. but this one is like a bad remake copy of saw with a bad ending. to think of a man who actually wrote this story, sick. this is really a shocking movie cant say ist horror cause its not. its mere the brutality and the violence that made me sick. it really is frustrating to watch a movie without ending, its like bang, in your face. the movie is done now you can go home. <br /><br />cons -cam -lighting (althrue i think is was supposed to) -overdone -sickening<br /><br />cons -real in your face -acting was good in my opinion -it sucks you in<br /><br />overall the movie is not my taste of movie the witer wanted us to know that these things happen, and the man wrote his own little fantasy. if you ever saw the movies saw ? they all had a moment of comfort in it something to hold on to. this one ? does not. maybe its just me, that im too soft but this movie made me tremble, and the story is real short, sick man kills girls slowly. but the actors sucked you in this movie every blow every scream you could almost feel it.<br /><br />and to be honest, i was to quick to judge about this one, its a terrible movie ? no its not. its an overdone example of reality, this is a real as it could get. but don't watch this movie if you expect great mystery or a real plot, or even some kind of story. man gets girls in a dark room and kills em one by one, thats really it.
