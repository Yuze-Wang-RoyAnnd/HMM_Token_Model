warning **spoilers**<br /><br />lord knows i have seen some bad movies in my time and this one makes me just as angry. this is an insult to people who are looking for a bad movie. the "story" involves a stewardess who discovers her boyfriend (badly acted by otherwise great robert wagner) is a murder, thief, and just an overall puke face. after the concorde takes off, he sends guided missiles to destroy the concorde. so while the concorde is traveling at the speed of light, our "hero" (played with utter stupidity, george kennedy) opens the window in the cockpit then, sticks his hand out the window to fire at the missile! i'm no rocket scientist, but it seems his hand would at least get a wind burn. then towards the final "climax" when the concorde is headed for certain disaster and everyone will die, a passenger turns to his fiance and proposes marriage. a priest just happens to be sitting in the next row and proceeds to marry them as the planes is crashing! (i'm not making this up) wow, the guy who wrote the script must have been sniffing glue for a week.
