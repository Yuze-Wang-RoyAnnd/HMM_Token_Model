i do not know which one was first released earlier in 1970 . cannon for cordoba is an "europen western" it was made in spain. this means this is fairly inferior to sergio leone's so-called #western spaghetti and to the real american masterpieces of john ford, sam peckinpah, howard hugues,john sturges and anthony mann, in my order of merit. this order is not to be interpreted as all john ford westerns are better than all by sam peckipahn's. i think imdb's 100 sort them out all pretty well.<br /><br />the worse about this firm is the casting. george peppard is fit for a sergeant's role, raff valone for a "maffia capo" and giovanna ralli to a "puttana" in "piazza vennezia" in the sixty's in rome.
