sure, i like some indie films. a lot, actually. i don't always understand them, and that's okay. not all of them were meant to be understood, especially by mainly main-stream people like me. i'm probably showing my ignorance, but i'm still puzzled why 'book of revelation' is called that. i love those end-of-world stories and the only thing i could see similar to the end of the world and this film was the torture it took to get through this. i'm not talking about the subject matter; perhaps i've been subdued from all the other torture/porn i've seen. it was just the incredibly slow story, one hour 15 minute material stretched for nearly two hours. (major spoilers lie ahead) hetero-man dancer gets abducted, seduced and raped six ways from sunday, or in this case 12 days, by three hooded women. upon his release, after his somewhat distraught dancer/girlfriend barely flinches (other than dropping a glass) after wondering which she missed more: him or the cigarettes she originally sent him for upon abduction. still in a state of reasonable shock, he refuses to talk, and she goes on to work without so much a hug as if nothing happened and he takes a well needed shower. problem. as much as he's tormented through the flashbacks to his, uh, "attacks," he's as equally aroused. granted, i haven't been bound and used as a plaything, but i doubt i would really "be in the mood." oh, i forgot, and how does he try and solve this crime? sleep with as many women as he can to try and spot the birthmarks or tats the criminals had. i see where they're going with it
