the sole reason for someone wanting to see this film would be because of john leguizamo. i remember the previews, and it looked to be another second rate comedy. but the fact that mr. leguizamo starred, tried to redeem it. his name, how known it was at the time or not, tried to sell it.<br /><br />i was pretty disappointed with the performance of leguizamo. his days on "house of buggin'" (an "in living colour" clone), were his tip-top. there is a fine line between wackiness and idiocy, and we'll just say that leguizamo crossed it tenfold. he looked like he was trying to be too outrageous and crazy for the camera. as a matter of fact, i'll say that he tried too hard. madcap humor spilled over into stupidity, and the film was spoiled. i can't say i blamed him, if you were given this opportunity, you'd try as hard if you could, right? your eagerness cost you dearly though mr. leguizamo...<br /><br />the pest follows in the tradition of any comedy film, and plays the "race card", and more. no group is left out from being poked fun at. blacks, latinos, whites, jews, koreans, germans, homosexuals, and the blind are among those singled out. again here, things get too overboard, and too much tries to get spoofed in too little time. the resolution of the film takes all of five minutes to clear up and move back to normality.<br /><br />when you have a film, and you're going to bypass plot and reality for comedy's sake, just make sure it's funny, or all you have is 90 minutes of senseless film. which would sum up leguizamo's "pest" quite nicely...
