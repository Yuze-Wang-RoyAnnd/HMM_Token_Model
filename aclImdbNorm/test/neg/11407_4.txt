i swear i didn't mean to! i picked this out only since it looked good on the back! this movie wasn't scary at all and actually was very confusing. the demon wind was only actually used a couple of times and people were killed off pretty cheesily. the one major bright spot was seeing sherri bendorf from slaughterhouse play in it. seeing what happened to her, however, made up my mind for this little turkey of a film. a 3 out of 10. next!
