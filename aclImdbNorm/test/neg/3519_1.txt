i recently watched this movie because i'm a big kinski fan. but, oh my god. don't get me wrong. i love this guy. but in this movie his whole acting is just simply a refusal to work! but fortunately he isn't the only one to blame. first of all the complete storyline is totally weak dealing with a gunmen looking for a murderer while kinski is stuck up in jail for a crime he did not commit. that's all. all the dialogs and characters are so bad it's making you scream. but maybe that's the fun of it all. if you know the kinski-biography it's obvious that kinski didn't care about those movies at all. especially all his italo-western roles. he just took the money and that was it. again, this whole movie is totally weird. only for hardcore-fans of the genre.
