odious chuck norris decided to put one final nail in the coffin<br /><br />containing his film career before going to the safe world of cbs<br /><br />saturday night carnage with this hysterically bad supernatural<br /><br />actioner.<br /><br />for such a dumb movie this thing sure is plotty. norris is chicago<br /><br />cop frank shatter. first off, what kind of last name is "shatter"?<br /><br />have you ever met any shatters? genforum.com has no listing for<br /><br />the last name shatter, which opens up any half clever viewer to<br /><br />replace the "a" in shatter with an "i." he and his partner, calvin<br /><br />jackson, do the same old buddy cop routine you have seen<br /><br />before: make funny with the pimps, and make their captain mad.<br /><br />jackson, looking like the theoretical love child of whoopi goldberg<br /><br />and rick james, quickly wears on the nerves with his constant<br /><br />complaining and eddie murphy-patented facial expressions.<br /><br />shatter and calvin become involved with an emissary of satan,<br /><br />whom we are introduced to in the too long opening scenes.<br /><br />prosatano is a demon who is locked in a crypt by king richard the<br /><br />lionhearted. the demon's scepter, from which he gets his power,<br /><br />is busted into nine pieces and hid in nine different parts of the<br /><br />world by holy men. in 1951, some grave robbers accidentally let<br /><br />prosatano out and he begins collecting the nine pieces. he<br /><br />disguises himself as an antiquities professor named lockley and<br /><br />always happens to be giving a lecture where a holy man is killed<br /><br />and a piece of the scepter is taken.<br /><br />norris brings in his "walker: texas blunder" cohort sheree wilson,<br /><br />who plays lockley's assistant. she helps norris with his<br /><br />investigation, they make goo goo eyes at each other, and our<br /><br />intrepid investigators travel to israel after a rabbi is killed in<br /><br />chicago. while in israel, calvin is given even more to complain<br /><br />about: the heat, the lack of restaurant accomodations, the lousy<br /><br />drivers, and the fact that he is missing the chicago bulls playoff<br /><br />games. norris even manages to work a cute israeli kid into this<br /><br />nightmare. bezi steals calvin's wallet, and hangs around the men,<br /><br />leading them around israel and not arousing any sort of<br /><br />appropriate suspicion.<br /><br />eventually, lockley (prosatano) assembles all of the scepter<br /><br />pieces, but needs the blood of royalty to complete the ceremony<br /><br />and call up the devil. where to find royal blood? well, sheree's<br /><br />father is a duke! she has an american accent but she is the<br /><br />screenwriters' convenient method of forcing this monstrosity<br /><br />toward its inevitable conclusion. sure, this minion of satan may<br /><br />have killed countless hundreds over the years, but how is he<br /><br />gonna do against a good old fashioned american butt kickin'?<br /><br />after prosatano has been vanquished, killed by his own scepter (i<br /><br />envied him, he did not have to watch bezi steal calvin's wallet<br /><br />again), we are treated to an awful coda involving a bearded man<br /><br />who has been watching shutter, i mean shatter, and calvin on<br /><br />their quest. you see, it was foretold...somewhere...that two<br /><br />warriors from the west would defeat prosatano. the silent<br /><br />bearded man who watched over the couple was none other than<br /><br />jesus...i kid you not. he is listed as "prophet" in the end credits,<br /><br />but you and even your pets will recognize the subtle christian<br /><br />reference the film makers are trying to exhibit here.<br /><br />like in "i use a walker: texas ranger," norris is aging and cannot<br /><br />get into his fight scenes too much anymore. he kicks a lot, and<br /><br />people fly over furniture in slow motion, and then norris gives all of<br /><br />his line readings in that monotone voice of his. oh, what a real<br /><br />director might be able to fashion out of him! his brother, aaron,<br /><br />who has directed him in other films as well, has no sense of story<br /><br />or momentum. scenes are thrown in for ego's sake, not to<br /><br />entertain. the scenes when the dynamic duo first meet bezi drag<br /><br />on and on, and then bezi is not all that important to the rest of the<br /><br />film.<br /><br />the film was shot on location in israel, which means the<br /><br />americans could insult the israelis in person. there is not one<br /><br />likeable israeli character here. the israeli police captain is a jerk.<br /><br />the cops' driver does not know english, and calvin convinces him<br /><br />that the word "sh*tty" is a compliment. nothing funnier than<br /><br />mocking those stupid foreigners on their home turf, especially<br /><br />when all this racist humor is coming from an american minority<br /><br />who would have been more than offended if the tables were turned<br /><br />and the israeli cop was mocking the african-american cop in<br /><br />chicago.<br /><br />this film is badly written, badly acted, and badly directed. it does<br /><br />not work as action, cop drama, or even horror. it just shows that<br /><br />the now defunct cannon studios was willing to throw their money<br /><br />into anything, no matter how badly it was planned. "hellbound" is<br /><br />surely a most adequate title. i disliked this movie intensely.<br /><br />this is rated (r) for physical violence, gun violence, strong<br /><br />profanity, some sexual references, and some adult situations.<br /><br />
