if it weren't for the editing out of curse words and a superimposed blur when one character give another the finger, it would be easy to mistake this low-budget snoozer for a sci-fi channel pilot. the plot about the government's attempts to destroy a group of telekinetics it originally trained as military weapons ends ambiguously enough with the hero, himself gifted, in pursuit of a telekinetic survivor bent on revenge. alas, the movie is talky, boring, predictable and even devoid of interesting special effects. top-billed louis gossett, jr. has a minor role as the evil government bureaucrat who originated the program and now wants to eliminate all traces. he walks through the part and it is hard to understand why he bothered. other members of the cast do a decent job with a script that demands little.
