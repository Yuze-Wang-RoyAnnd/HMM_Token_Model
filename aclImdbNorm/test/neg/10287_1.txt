this p.of s. was highly recommended to me by two friends that have great<br /><br />(similar to mine) taste in films and have seen more than anyone i know.<br /><br />i have no idea what they saw in this movie. sadistic,cruel and repulsive is fine in an entertaining movie,but this is a windbag effort trying to pass itself off as highbrow lowbrow movie making.or is it lowbrow highbrow?<br /><br />the ancient generation gap clich'e "no redeeming social value" comes to mind. bill pullman is trying,maybe a little to hard,and except for the kid the rest of the acting seems self-conscious and kinda lame.<br /><br />save yourself from this and watch a double feature of "in cold blood" and "the hitcher".<br /><br />as somebody said, this would never have been made if jennifer lynch was not the overrated david lynch's daughter.
