while in madrid i was able to see a screener copy of this film. wow! gallo is amazing in it. very unusual performance he gives. aside from gallo's genius, the film however is a dull a film i have ever seen in my life and at times is so poorly done it borders on laughable. i am also a val kilmer fan so he was part of the reason i made such a grand effort to view the film. the problem is val is really only in one scene. having his name in the cast as the lead is an insult to my intelligence and to the rest of the cast. i have only seen stranded of the directors other films. both films are far far below average but both contain very interesting vincent gallo performances. if you are as much as a gallo fan as i then see this film regardless of how bad it is. if you do not like gallo then there is zero left to love.
