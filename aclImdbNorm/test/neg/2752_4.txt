shemp finds out that he stands to inherit a million dollars if he is married within 24 hours. considering how hideous he looks and his personality, it isn't surprising that he can't get a taker--that is until an article appears in the paper explaining his predicament--at which point five crazed women appear from no where to claim their new hubby (plus the money, of course).<br /><br />while i don't hate the three stooges and like to watch their shorts on occasion, they never, even on their best day, came close to the brilliant comedy of buster keaton. that's why i disliked this film, as it was a ripoff of the plot from keaton's masterpiece, seven chances. with the stooges it wasn't uncommon for columbia pictures to steal old comedy plots or just recycle older stooge shorts. so, from the outset, this film is a pale imitation of an original. it's also obvious that this film lacks the charm and subtlety of the original and the gags generally seem very forced (paricularly the phone booth scene). the cousin basil bit, however, was pretty cute and funny--though far from subtle! however, the worst aspect of the film was the not particularly funny conclusion. in the keaton version, hundreds of women appeared to marry him and the action became very fast and furious--here, it all stayed in one small room and lacked comedic punch--ending in a fizzle.<br /><br />overall, a dull retread. also, before marking this review "not helpful", be sure to first see seven chances to see what i am talking about--then you decide.
