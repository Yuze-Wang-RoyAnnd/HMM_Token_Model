didn't the writer for this movie see the other three? i loved the original, i thought 2 was the best, i tolerated 3 (it was ok, nothing special). but i hated this one. who dare they kill off ug? this was certainly not the ug who had been almost like a brother to charlie in number 2. remember his speech? charlie said, "you wouldn't just leave me on earth, would you". ug replied, "charlie, bounty hunter", saying that he was now one of them now. how dare the writers ignore this special bond between them and turn him into a baddie who get's killed by charlie (in a particularly awkward scene) just because they realized the movie was getting boring. in fact for the first 20 minutes, we get a new cast and have to wait this long until we again find out what happened to charlie, who was the hero we've been waiting to see. i kept waiting saying, "come on, when's charlie going to appear?" angela basset must be doing her best to deny she was ever in this turkey. moving it to the future eliminates the possibility of ever seeing a sequel with the original cast or in our time. i think the writers decided, that their movie was going to be the last and they could do whatever they wanted. this movie is totally out of line with the first two. and it didn't even seem like it was written by the same people who made 3. 3 at least had humor and could easily be seen by younger children. 4 is just ugly and mean-spirited (eric dare) is particularly cruel and unnecessary. i hated this movie. hated, hated, hated it. i hated the fact that anyone could like it and i hated the fact that it ruined what was one of my favorite camp classics. i give this a one start simply because imdb.com won't let me give it a zero.
