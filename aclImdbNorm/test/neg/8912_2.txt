ah yet another seagal movie.in no less than a few mere months arrive to populate the video store shelves.as bad as submerged?no.but that is not saying much.like perfume on a pig.<br /><br />seagal is professional thief who wants to quit,but goes for one last job only to be double-crossed by his boss.he lands in prison and is befriended by a gangster who helps him to break out and seek payback.<br /><br />its good to see seagal finally not playing an agent,cop,or what he usually plays.we actually get a usa location in las vegas it seems. then an eastern european territory as usual. there is no wire-fu either here.don fauntleroy does an okay job.<br /><br />however most of the action and fight scenes with stevie are clearly doubles.scenes from other movies,a lack of realism and logic in even tiniest situation.seagal and treech make a so-so team inspiring(unintentional) laughs one minute.sighs the rest.<br /><br />several notable faces turn up to slum it.. sleepy kevin tighe is a long way from his emergency days.nick mancuso shows up in sleepwalking mode to take a check.no more rappers.please? at this point the action scenes and plots are more predictable and recycled generically more than ever.its a stale scene that seagal needs to get out of or hang it up.he should have gotten out a while ago.
