let me preface this by going on record, i am a huge george clooney fan, and i love john krasinski in 'the office'. well, i was and i did.<br /><br />this was the world's worst hang nail and it took 113 minutes to rip it off. the stupefying boredom was interrupted only by my frequent efforts to read my watch and estimate when it would be over.<br /><br />every funny scene was in the previews. all three of them. there was no real story, no character development, and the script was just plain bad. i've had a colonoscopy that was more enjoyable.<br /><br />the title should have been superduper bad. this movie is a lock for a razzie. it should get a whole slough of razzies. i want my money back.
