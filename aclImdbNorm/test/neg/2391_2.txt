how better to describe it than scuzzy criminals on tv? and i don't mean in the show cops; here, they're actually being presented as protagonists.<br /><br />i don't see any remedial value in this show unless you have a perverse penchant for human tragedies. whitney houston is a tragic example of the fallen star; a star which bobby brown helped pull from the sky. bobby brown is nothing but a low-life criminal. why watch him? why does whitney stand by him no matter how despicable he is? this couple should be locked up and it's a loathsome shame they are making money and achieving a modicum of fame from watching the septic tank which is their lives and the human waste which is their character.
