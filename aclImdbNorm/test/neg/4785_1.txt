my name is earl(2005) <br /><br />review:......for i have seen this.<br /><br />this is something else. first off, how is this rated so high? i cannot understand that. this "show" is filled to the top with either annoying people, stupid people, or just plain unlikeable. the "gags" are hideous.<br /><br />i saw one episode where the wife of earl's brother wrapped and washed herself with dead fish. not kidding. that wasn't funny, that's repulsive. then she and earl's extremely stupid brother(and i mean stupid) then had sex. i nearly threw up.<br /><br />this has to be one of the most desperate attempts at comedy in a long time. jason lee is a talented actor, but is trapped in a helpless role in this horrible "comedy".<br /><br />earl is now in jail for this current season. let's hope he gets the chair just so this show gets put out of it's misery.<br /><br />the last word: this show would be funny to people who think larry the cable guy is funny. to the rest of the world, not a chance. avoid like the plague.
