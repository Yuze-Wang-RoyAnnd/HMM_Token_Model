completely overlooking the whole movie adaptation of a video game, this is another terrible movie by mr. boll. how he continues to be hired to make movies is a constant surprise to me and obviously most of the movie going community.<br /><br />as a whole i will say that this attempt was fractionally better than so many of his previous attempts. some of the dialog was even half way decent in far cry though he still misuses some phrases and in some cases he doesn't even use the phrases correctly.<br /><br />now besides the fact that jack carver is supposed to be american and not german, til was still entertaining in this role. one exception is the laughably lame lines he uses to get in bed with the girl. and we are supposed to believe that she is ready to have sex with him so casually after such minimal dialog? emile? simply there for comic relief i am sure and still lame. jack's character looks old and tired yet is still capable of the extreme acrobatics needed to avoid one of the altered super soldiers in the lab.<br /><br />don't watch this one for the far cry adaptation. but you might just waste an hour and a half watching it if you have nothing better to do.
