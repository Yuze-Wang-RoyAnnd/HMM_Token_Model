i think the best way for me to review this title is to split it into its pros and cons.<br /><br />pros: ~ they turn into wolves rather than plastic/cartoony monsters. ~ the chase of the wolves through the forest ~ "cash machine" by hard-fi being played<br /><br />cons: ~ some parts of the script makes you cringe (for example the terrible part where the woman escapes the 'games' of the "fortunate five" boys, and there's about half an hour of "dear cousin" and a round robin of "yes, see, we know gabriel's law") ~ the diving transformation is ridiculous ~ the obvious and ridiculous ending ~ aiden being told thousands of times to leave, and then goes "if you cared about me you would have left me" ~ the obvious characters ~ the unnecessary parcour ~ the completely unnecessary slashing of the arm by aiden ~ cringey speeches by gabriel<br /><br />you see what i mean.<br /><br />i adore werewolf films, and i tried watching this a few times to see if i'd like it better but it just made it worse. i think i'll just read the book and see how i get on.<br /><br />don't bother with this unless you have a 12 year old brother or sister into spooky things. anyone over that age may suffer and want their hour and a half back.
