avoid this movie. if you are expecting "the poseidon adventure" (1972), you may experience nothing more than a case of the 'bends'. this film offers nothing more than two extremely-long, and drawn-out, hours of complete boredom.<br /><br />the cast members act as if they are angered by the irritation of a bathtub of water overflowing on a bed of an insignificant's petunias. the script is totally unrealistic, and the film does not even have the feel of a disaster movie. in fact, everything about this movie is bad, with the exception of tom courtenay. it is unfortunate that such a fine actor got swept away, by a flood of misrepresentation, to appear in such a washout. when this movie was being made, the poseidon must have turned over, in its watery grave, in a sea of shame. and, shelley winters will rise again, from the dead (direct from the poseidon), to haunt anyone who dares to see this pathetic movie. i rate this film a 1 out of 10, but it really deserves a zero. this movie will make you want to avoid, or completely turn against, water. and, it will leave a bad taste in your mouth. it may even make you want to see "jaws" (1975), and befriend a great white.
