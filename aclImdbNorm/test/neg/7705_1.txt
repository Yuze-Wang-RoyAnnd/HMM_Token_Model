this fake documentary is flawed on a lot of points, it's badly made, has uninteresting characters but the biggest problem i have with it is the basic premise.<br /><br />this film uses the idea that h.p. lovecraft has traveled to italy and that some of his work is based on real supernatural events that he witnessed. i'm willing to go along with the notion that he traveled to italy (only for suspension of disbelieve) but that some of his work is based on reality and that insmouth exist is total nonsense.<br /><br />first of all, lovecraft didn't believe in the supernatural, in his letters he clearly states that he considered himself a mechanical materialist, his monsters where there to show that humans weren't so special after all. another myth used in this film is that lovecraft was an expert on the occult, he wasn't, all his knowledge on the subject came from the most basic sources.<br /><br />so we end up with a film about people jelling at each other a lot and when we finally see the monster, it's so bad that you can't even laugh at it, you just feel a pain in your love for horror.<br /><br />after seeing the film frankenstein lovecraft said that he felt sorry for mary shelley because he felt that her work was butchered. i feel sorry for lovecraft.
