when i bought 4 dvds for lb5.oo in a local shop it should have been warning enough that this movie was not up to the usual standard of david selznick productions. with a cast containing such names as james stewart and carole lombard i was looking forward to a real treat. as many other commentators have said it is an odd mixture of plot and scenes that doesn't quite convince. however, i am so glad that i did view this film as i now have the memorable saying 'never let the seeds stop you from enjoying the watermelon.' to live by. this should sum up everyone's life. pick out those seeds or spit them out or swallow them - and then enjoy the watermelon - life itself.
