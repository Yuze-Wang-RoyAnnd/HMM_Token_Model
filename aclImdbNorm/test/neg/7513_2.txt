this is a polarising film. people either love it or despise it, it seems. me, i despise it. the film comes from the same context as lindsay anderson's oh lucky man, but while that is a masterpiece, this is just horrible.<br /><br />both films take kafka's unfinished novel - america, for their inspiration and general ideal. america is a surreal story of a youth's travels through the country. kafka uses the this character as a pure observer, one who does not change over the course of the journey (although the book is about 300 pages and still seems only a quarter finished, so we'll never know). allowing kafka to concentrate and comment on the absurd/surreal situations and surroundings. oh lucky man follows this same template to show britain through the eyes of malcolm mcdowell and weekend does the same for france.<br /><br />both films are also hugely brechtian, using various tricks and techniques to point up the fact that this is not real, this is confabulation etc. but the difference comes where oh lucky man uses the constructed film to convey the absurdity of life and the class system, weekend uses the constructed film to bludgeon us to death with ideological polemic. because godard goes further than anderson in his brechtian principles, we end up with two principle characters in which we have no investment, at all. we're forced to spend 90 minutes with them, yet we couldn't care less about them. deliberately so. but in doing this, godard leaves us with a film that is entirely about his own message, which, in the first half of the film is provided through relentless and overbearing symbolism, and in the second half through a series of long speeches directed to camera. combined with unpleasant and unnecessary scenes such as the really horrible pig slaying, far worse than any of the off camera violence of the car crashes.<br /><br />the end result is like listening to a student political apparatchik droning on and on and on about his views whilst repeatedly kicking you in the head so that you get the message. the problem with brecht is, if you alienate the audience too much, then you've alienated them from what you are trying to convey. which always seemed self evident to me.<br /><br />the parts that really stick in the craw for this movie though, is the contrast between the extremely sexually explicit verbal description of the threesome at the start and the off-screen comical rape in the middle, which, even if it could be viewed as allegorical, completely destroys the film's faith in itself and it's characters, what little of it existed in the first place. it's so french with a capital f, it hurts.<br /><br />watch oh lucky man instead. that is a work of genius. weekend is a work of pretension.<br /><br />two stars, and only for the traffic jam scene and the piano scene, which are just hints at genius, although they actually make the end result more frustrating and unsatisfying as without them, this is a bad film by the worst most pretentious director in the world, with them, well it's obvious that this is a damn good technical director making the most intellectually pretentious film in the world. somehow that's far worse.
