post 1988 after the disaster gjs amitabh's films lost the quality they had earlier <br /><br />barring main azaad hoon released in 1989 which was a great film rest all films were craps mostly except hum(1991) later in 1991<br /><br />this is another of the crap amitabh films people rejected in early 90's<br /><br />the film he did like a friendship token to shashi kapoor who directed the film and he didn't take a penny the film also had rishi and dimple(again not paired opp each other after ranbhoomi) <br /><br />the film came in 1991 when bachchan had 4 releases and 3 flops amongst them indrajeet, akayla, ajooba <br /><br />ajooba came 2 years after toofan and jaadugar both supernatural films which were rejected this is another type of crap bachchan wears a mask and a krissh type outfit and performs magic changing 1 person to a donkey.etc of course being 1991 you can excuse the special effects but the film is too bad to be watched<br /><br />direction by shashi kapoor is not good music is bad<br /><br />amongst actors amitabh had become too old by 1991 and looked tired, his acting is okay but not on par with his best rishi is okay dimple is alright, rest are forgettable
