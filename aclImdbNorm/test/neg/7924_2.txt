this movie is... horrible and wonderful at the same time. i first saw it when i was about 13 or 14 years old, so it has a great deal of nostalgic value for me. in this movie, cesar romero actually plays the character of octavio, the man who "discovered" santana. there are also two other actors, monte markham (plays sam, who is trying to save his daughter) and peter mark richman (plays the priest), who have large filmographies, and these are the only performances that are okay. the rest of the acting and the movie itself have all of the b-film qualities that some of us cherish.<br /><br />i recently spent 2 years trying to acquire a copy of this movie, and it is almost nonexistent. i am assuming that it was discontinued very shortly after its release. but i did eventually find a copy and paid a pretty penny to acquire it. if you happen to come upon judgement day in a video store (unmistakeable with a cheesy green "satan" on the cover), count yourself among the blessed who live near one of the few video stores that still has a working copy. a must see for those of you who like to laugh at cheesy attempts at a scary movie.
