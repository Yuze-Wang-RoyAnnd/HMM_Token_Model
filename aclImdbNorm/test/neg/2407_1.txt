simply put, the only saving grace this movie has is settings, costumes and an ok punk concert. how h.r.giger must feel about his cyborg picture on the cover of this movie, i wouldn't like to know. right away, all i could do was make sardonic comments about the films protagonists, i was hoping that the "freaks" in this movie would execute them in gory fashion. i sense spoilers a comin'! i was wondering if this film in the spirit of the first 20 min. was intended to be as humorously half-baked as the rest of it? examining all the obvious political outcries (police trying to rape a "freak", the discussion of superficialities between the "freak" and the frat boy and the punk concert w/ the female vocalist) and the use of slow-motion in the fighting sequences (which screams "martial-arts coordinator") i just don't know. the character named "steve" irked me since he tries to pick fights w/ people off the street (he shoulda been mugged and raped) and looks bad when he broke that guy's neck towards the end (want me to show you how to do it?) i must say this though, if they would've developed other characters better than they did "splatter", this might have gone somewhere. if there was a 0 to give this movie, it would've got it, but alas it's a 1.
