according to "lucien rebatet" in his "histoire de la musique" (robert lafont, bouquins 1973 page 338) beethoven's character was not very compatible with women. he had quite a number of "platonic passions" with female members of the "vienese aristocracy" to whom he dedicated some "sonatas". but musicians , even composers did not qualify for husbands of "fine ladies". haydn was a "servant" of prinz von esterhazy, mozart died from drink or poison and bethoven was according to rebatet a frequent customer of "street prostitutes" in vienna. a british biographer, newman says that beethoven contracted syphilis, before he was 40. that he became deaf because of that, is possible, but not certain.<br /><br />the ninth symphony was premiered on may 7, 1824 in the k"arntnertortheater in vienna, along with the consecration of the house overture and the first three parts of the missa solemnis. this was the composer's first on-stage appearance in twelve years; the hall was packed. although the performance was directed by michael umlauf the theater's kapellmeister, beethoven shared the stage with him quiet.<br /><br />so what remains of this "female fantasy". ed harris interpretation and characterization are quite good, but too linear, based on the painting by ferninand waldm"uller date 1823. i have it in front of me. it shows a man that despises (perhaps hates) the world. with good reason.
