i've read the positive comments on this movie. i assume people who were in this movie must've come to this site to give it some good press because this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i always watch the whole film despite the quality or lack there of which explains why i watched this whole movie, but i don't think i laughed even once during the duration of this film. the jokes were mostly very bad, but when the jokes had some promise, the delivery was off. if you liked it, maybe you should lay off the buds because you need to preserve the 5 or 6 brain cells you have left. this movie had a poor script, bad acting, poor directing, weak plot... nothing of virtue and was not entertaining. if you haven't seen this movie, don't.
