i'm not even going to comment on what piece of trash this film is since that has already been established. however, watching this with my friends we all laughed out loud when the lead girl made a shelley hack reference while on the phone. we sat there trying to figure out why the writer would throw her into the mix. we can only assume he had a charlie's angels fixation at one time. based on that reference, we assumed this film must have been made around her charlie's angels run in 1979 or 1980, but from what i've read here it was made around 1987. you sure couldn't tell that from the poor production values. it seems as though it was made by a college student for a film class. and while by no means would i expect a low-budget trash fest like this to be politically correct, the rednecks in this film sure did like to direct derogatory gay remarks to each other. even so i'd still only rank this as the 2nd worst horror film ever made, second only to "nail gun massacre."
