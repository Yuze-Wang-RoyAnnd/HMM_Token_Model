i debated quite a bit over what rating to give this one because it's my least favorite herschell gordon lewis film so far other than the gruesome twosome, but it has the best acting i've seen in a lewis film. however, we all know that's not saying much. once the movie was done, i was happy because it felt like i had been sitting through a 4 hour movie, though it was only 82 minutes long. i'm trying to see all of hgl's films and that's probably the only reason to see this one.<br /><br />the gore is good as usual, the one thing that herschell seemed to get right. the acting is just as bad as usual with one exception. that exception is frank kress. now, would i say that he's a good actor? no way, but he's good compared to everyone else. the story is boring and flat and goes no where and by the end, i didn't care what happened just so long as it ended. i know this is a cult classic but i didn't enjoy it very much at all. i hope you will.
