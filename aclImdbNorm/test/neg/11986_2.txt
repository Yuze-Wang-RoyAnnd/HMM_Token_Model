i really liked the far cry game, nice graphics, good level-design, interesting and clever enemies, above-average length and even a somewhat decent plot. i am not by default against movie spin-offs of games. i thought "doom the movie" was hilarious. but what uwe boll has done here, is to take the game and modified every one of its good aspects and turned them into something horrible (well not the length, the movie runs only a merciful 90 min) the characters are even more stereotypical than in the game, which is quite an achievement. the entire plot is told without any twists or mystery. several blatantly ridiculous scenes tell you every bit of the story. and come on "genetically modified soldiers"? they could have come up with some better name.<br /><br />however, this film should get some award for the most idiotic love scene. i have never seen anything of the like. i could not believe they were trying to be serious "we have to get out of the wet clothes" "i think i'll get hypothermia" (although everybody is wearing t-shirts) "we need to cuddle together for body warmth" "is that your gun?" but... but ... weren't there people who consciously did this? there must have been a scriptwriter, a director, actors, a gaffer, an electrician, some food guy! why didn't anyone jump into that scene to stop this evil from happening? was this film done by ravaging, inhuman, genetically modified film people? i won't start at ranting about how many logical errors, inconsistencies and scriptwriting flaws there were, but even to the die-hard action-fan, this can't be anything but insulting.<br /><br />this film did actually ask for being rated 2 out of 10, so i'll do it that favor. but that leaves me to explain where the second star comes from. special-effects? nah. acting? not really. references to the game? you wish. wait! they used the font from the game for the title and the credits. that was neat.<br /><br />if you are looking for a flick for a bad movie night, go for "2012 - supernova", this one is just - sad.
