adenoid hynkel, a lowly soldier in world war one, rises in subsequent years to become the ruthless dictator of toumania. he creates an aggressive, antisemitic war machine and cultivates a little toothbrush moustache. sound like anyone you know?<br /><br />from the safety of hollywood, chaplin uses this soapbox to exhort europe to take up arms and defy hitler and mussolini. given that the united states in 1940 had more than a year of neutrality ahead of it, and no strong desire to embroil itself in europe's civil strife (remember, it was hitler who declared war on the usa, not the other way round) it is surprising that chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic.<br /><br />the story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides, and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly, humane, brave, etc., etc, chaplin is hynkel, and he also plays the jewish barber, the little hero of the ghetto (the tramp in all but name). needless to say, chaplin writes, directs, stars, composes the music and does the catering.<br /><br />in 1940 the full truth was not yet known about the third reich, and chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical foresight, but even by the standards of the day he gets hitler badly wrong. a comedian and a sentimentalist, chaplin tries to ridicule hitler by making hynkel silly and hapless. all this does is to humanise him. when hynkel the not-very-warlike soldier fools around with the big gun and the upside-down aeroplane, he becomes endearing rather than despicable. as dictator, he inspects his subordinates' technical innovations which don't work (the parachute hat, the bulletproof uniform etc.) and these passages are meant to make us think that the real-life nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside. in fact, hynkel's regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling bodgery.<br /><br />in truth, chaplin's day had already passed when he made this ill-considered polemic. at heart, he was still a dinosaur of the silent screen (check out the humour, with gags like staggering up and down the street semi-conscious, or the pantomime of the coins in the puddings). the hero schultz is meant to represent a yardstick of european decency against which hynkel can be judged, but schultz looks more like a character from operetta than a nazi. is it in any way believable that a schultz figure (if such had existed) would say to the fuehrer's face, "your cause is doomed to failure because it's built upon the stupid, ruthless persecution of innocent people"? and how does schultz come to be in the cellars of the jewish ghetto? if he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt, why does he persist in wearing his ruritanian uniform? chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of auschwitz-birkenau or treblinka, but the nazi concentration camp which he offers us is hopelessly out of kilter with the grim spirit of the age. as usual, chaplin thinks in terms of 'silent' comedy set-pieces, loosely pegged onto the narrative clothes line. there is the knockabout scrapping with the stormtroopers, shaving a man to the accompaniment of brahms, and the globe ballet (watch for the segment filmed in reverse).<br /><br />paulette goddard is the unremittingly perfect hannah. just as the people of the ghetto are impossibly nice, and the jewish haven in osterlich is ridiculously idyllic, so hannah is quite literally too good to be true. brave, defiant, resourceful, hardworking and (of course) beautiful, she is the canary of judaism in the ghetto cage. "gee, ain't i cute?" she asks, after the barber gives her a make-over. too cute by far, is the answer. she doesn't come close to ringing true, because chaplin has made her a caricature. the 'wouldn't it be wonderful?' speech which chaplin puts into her mouth is typical of the author - too wordy, too emotionally cloying.<br /><br />jack oakie is great as napaloni, the fascist dictator of bacteria. he brings a whiff of much-needed comic brio to the proceedings, but the film's underlying weakness remains. if napaloni is silly and ineffective, how can we fear him? and anyway, the stuttering stop-start of the back-projected train is a fine chaplinesque example of a gag that is persisted with far beyond its comic worth.<br /><br />and where did the jewish barber acquire that immaculate hynkel uniform?
