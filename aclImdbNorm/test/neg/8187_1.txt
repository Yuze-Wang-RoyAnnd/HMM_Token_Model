this is a truly awful movie. the jokes are few and far between and the pacing is a down right endurance test. the only thing funny to come out of this production is it's comparison to the classic film "this is spinal tap."<br /><br />avoid this film as if it were one of the plagues of the bible itself.<br /><br />
