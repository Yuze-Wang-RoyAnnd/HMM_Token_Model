i have never before voted 1 for a movie on the imdb, but for this one i am sorry the scale doesn't go down to -10.<br /><br />all i can say abou this movie is that i saw it in a sneak preview, and it was my worst movie experience ever. i don't mind the stupid jokes. i can live with the silly story. but when i see those dumbly grinning "main characters" with their pseudo-foreign speech (only germans will understand what i talk about), i felt i kind of loathing i never thought i was capable of. (if they had left them out, the thing may actually have been acceptable...).<br /><br />there's not much more to be said about this one. you may laugh once or twice, because it's so ridiculous, but that doesn't make it any better. it is definitely not funny.<br /><br />if you live outside of germany, be happy and rejoice that this awful work will most likely never make it to your cinemas.<br /><br />if you do live in germany, avoid this movie at all costs.
