other commenters have described this movie as "classic 1950s scifi" with clever use of stock footage and documentary footage, and clever character interaction.<br /><br />nothing could be further from the truth.<br /><br />yes, this is classic 1950s scifi...but 1950s scifi at its most blindingly stupid worst.<br /><br />consider that the mantis's first prey is a radar station shown first from the air, then on the ground... but the station is (from the air) pictured as on a mountaintop, with snow on one side and semi-cleared dark ground on the other side, but when (on the ground) investigators visit the site, it's suddenly on a flat, evenly white plain, miles from the nearest mountain.<br /><br />consider also, the ludicrous pseudo-scientific babble of the highly-recommended expert who is brought in to examine a huge claw. he says "well, we know one thing... it can't have come from an animal, because every known species of animal has a bony skeleton. even reptiles and birds have bones." he then goes on to say that some creatures ...snails, shellfish, insects... do not have bony skeletons. excuuuuuse me ? let's define "animal", here. not even in the 1950s could anyone over the age of six take this man as an expert in biology, since he clearly doesn't know what an "animal" is, nor have the ability to name several broad categories of animals who lack bony skeletons (sharks, rays, jellyfish, insects, mollusks, arthropods, gastropods, sponges, arachnids, echinoderms....you get the idea.) the characters are cardboard, 2d stock types... scientist, sidekick girlfriend, big bad monster. nothing here shows any sense of creativity. no pulse, no life signs.<br /><br />there're no witty dialogs, the special effects are silly even for their time, and the stock footage is employed with a reckless disregard for continuity. this is b-movie making at its dead worst, with a production crew that clearly couldn't be bothered to try even halfheartedly.<br /><br />use sparingly, as sleeping medicine or punishment for small children who're easily offended by bad science.
