forced, cloying, formulaic. do these adjectives make you want to run to rent his? miriam hopkins was brilliant in the original "dr. jekyl and mr. hyde." a few other early movies of hers, notably "the story of temple drake," are never shown but said to be excellent.<br /><br />here, she is cutesy, bossy, and thoroughly unappealing. ray milland as a greeniwch village bohemian not at all convincing.<br /><br />the two child performers are creepy and also bear no relation to the village as it was then.<br /><br />speaking as a native of greenwich village, i find the setting ersatz, generic, and phony. not that i was around for a couple generations but my relatives were there in 1937. it isn't funny. it isn't remotely authentic. we don't care about the characters.<br /><br />so many movies were made about the struggling masses vs the capitalists at this time, and done with elan. "easy living" comes to mind. it didn't take place in the village. but it rings very true. this rings with a thudding knell.
