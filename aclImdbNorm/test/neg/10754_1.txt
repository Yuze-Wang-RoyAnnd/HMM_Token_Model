i went to see this film last night at the national film theatre in london, as a birthday treat. it was the the first time i've seen it, and i think it has now overtaken the dreadful "twister" as the worst film i have ever seen. disjointed for no reason, self indulgent and full of imagery that oscillates from the crass and obvious to the obscure and unintelligible, not particularly beautifully or grimily shot, i really don't understand why this is considered classic, gay or otherwise. i normally enjoy films that push boundaries or even films that are hard to watch because of their length or unusual cinematography. but this was truly, truly awful.
