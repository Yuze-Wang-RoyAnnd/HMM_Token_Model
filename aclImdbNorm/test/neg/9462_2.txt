**spoiler* it gives away the very irrelevant ending**<br /><br />at the beginning of this movie, there was a brief intro to the world of gore by the master of gore movies, h.g. lewis. he talked about how this movie was lost, and then found years after the director's death. he also talked about how gore movies were measured by the amount of stage blood used in it. blood feast was a 2 galloner, 10,000 maniacs was a 5 galloner. but, then he goes and claims that dr. gore was a 15 galloner. i want to know where half of the 15 gallons went. watching the movie, i saw very little near 15 gallons. agreed, there was a fairly large amount of blood, but no where near 15 gallons. some of the dismemberment scenes were definitely pretty gory and realistic, strings of flesh and all, but i wouldn't say 15 gallons.<br /><br />"end!!! ennnnnnnnndddddd!!!" does that sound familiar? that's what you should have been saying near the last half of this movie. after the igor character was tossed into the acid bath, the movie slowed to a painful crawl. there was no coherent end, as it didn't fit into anything the 90 minutes before it provided. she drove off in a van with a total stranger, big deal! that's what happens when you keep an individual (i won't say person, because she doesn't qualify as a person) very innocent about the world around her. the doctor teaches the girl that a man is to be loved, so every man she meets, she loves.<br /><br />even though h.g. lewis told us at the beginning of the movie that we may not like the acting, the directing, or even the gore... i will go with choices a and b. both were terrible!! it was enough to give me bad dreams of cut editing and people with shifty eyes as they talk to one person. but, i made it through the movie, and came out stronger. too bad i couldn't say the same after finishing robo c.h.i.c.<br /><br />this was a bad movie. i can usually take my doses of vinegar in good stride, but every once in a while, you get a movie that bites back. i think this movie took off an arm or a leg (haha... *sigh*) admitted, i did enjoy the stare down scenes, where the good doctor stared at his future victims and opened his eyes really wide and just stared. it was very similar to fuad ramseys in blood feast when he stared at that lady in his catering shop, and did not use his power after that. i guess this movie picks up where fuad's powers left off.<br /><br />*final judgement* the movie should have stayed lost. good day<br /><br />-scott-
