this is what they came up with for prop comedian carrot top's first feature film.<br /><br />a stupid surfer (carrot dude) inherits an r&d enterprise from an old kahuna (jack warden). things go less than swimmingly, but get much worse when the company is threatened with a hostile takeover attempt by corrupt corporate raiders. the most implausible thing about this movie is that smart-girl courtney thorne-smith would find this red-headed step-child fascinating in the least (but then, he just inherited millions). 'classic' moments include comic larry miller drinking sweat from a plastic cup.<br /><br />funny comedy? try un-funny toilet humor, and that's exactly where this belongs - in the toilet... flush twice.
