the video case for this film reads "a story of beauty, passion, and forbidden fruit". are they talking about the same movie i just saw?! they can't be, as the film i just saw was beautiful, but there was no passion and as for the fruit, this is all hogwash meant to entice the potential viewer to see this movie. if only it did have some passion or some life to it, i would have greatly enjoyed this film. instead, it was an agonizingly slow paced and not particularly interesting film that i would definitely not want to see again. it isn't that it's a bad film (after all it is very beautifully filmed), but it is dull beyond belief. i kept waiting for something exciting or interesting to happen, but then the movie just ended. there was no great sense of excitement, mystery or anything--just a rather unexciting story about a young girl who becomes a servant and spends the next 10 years of her life working as a maid.
