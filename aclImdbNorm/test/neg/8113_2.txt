a traveling couple (horton and hamilton)stumble onto the town of gatlin, where kids have slaughtered the adults and are always eager to slaughter more, along the way they're separated and peter horton of course must save his wife from these tiresome, er terrible tykes in this very bad adaption of one of king's best short stories. in the original story king managed to create tension and draw personality of his characters, however all of that has been zapped from the production and all that is left is a repetitive bore which is far too predictable to be all that suspenseful. also the effective ending used in the story is in favor dumped for a happy ending which makes the overall impact mute. there is some atmosphere and stylish directing but no plot to back any of it up. the kids are woefully unconvincing also.<br /><br />1/5 matt bronson
