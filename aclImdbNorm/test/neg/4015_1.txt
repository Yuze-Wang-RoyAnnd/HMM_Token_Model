i saw the episode about living on minimum wage. it went as far as an oprah winfrey's appearance for the said episode. it's bad enough people struggle making ends meet week to week. then having this hypocrite exploiting the problem. i didn't appreciate the constant complaining from him or his significant other, throughout. queston is how any people have the power to pay their medical bills from the er? sure he shows that the bill is high, but he paid the remaining balance(from his own pocket) after-wards from his "harrowing" experience. how many poor people have that type of privilege after 30 days to pay off their bills. instead they are starving and "robbing peter to pay paul". complaining throughout the episode isn't a humbling thing for him. the movie and restaurant scene is appalling. another privilege he has that poor people don't.
