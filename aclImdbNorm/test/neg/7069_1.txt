a friend warned me that this was the worst movie he had ever seen. i was curious, because it had developed a bit of a cult status. i like a lot of odd indie cult movies so i gave it a shot. i have to agree with my friend. it is a steaming pile of dung. i am sorry to the people who love this movie, but i can recommend much better stuff if you want to watch a twisted indie cult film. try peter jackson's dead alive (aka braindead), cemetery man (aka dellamorte dellamore) , or modern vampires.
