i bought this movie at a garage sale when i was like 15. i hated it then, and watching it again, just for the hell of it, it's even worse now. you can hear the director and cameraman in the background yelling commands like "zoom, zoom, zoom!!!". the are no special effects, just a raw piece of meat that is supposed to be a brain. this is utter crap, and i originally thought it was a one of a kind home movie or something that i bought. but this was distributed elsewhere and it's just really weird to know that other people have seen it. whoops i need 10 lines....well....this can be an interesting thing to watch to see how no-budget movies were made before the invention of digital cameras. this sucks. actually, yeah do watch this just to see if you can sit through the worst. if you can make it through this you can make it through anything.
