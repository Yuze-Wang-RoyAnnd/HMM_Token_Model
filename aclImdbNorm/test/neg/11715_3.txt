a couple of friends and myself visited the video shop a few years back and we were in one of those moods to rent some cheesy non seen flicks. my friend grabbed head of the family and we were greeted by a head sitting in a wheelchair. well that set us off laughing and we decided to have a bet to see who would be the one who had to go to the desk and pay for the movie. well you guessed it, it was me!!!!!!!! i have never been so embarrised in all my life. we got home and put it on and we rolled about the floor laughing for about 45mins because this was the funniest film in the world. i cant remember much about it but one thing i do remember was the blonde girl getting it on with some guy in the back of a shop every 5 mins. that head made me laugh and when i look at other peoples comments aboout this movie it makes me laugh even more. head of the family is so good and the head is funny and im still laughing ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
