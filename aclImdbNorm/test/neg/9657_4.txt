i find it amazing, that so many people (probably poles) have voted for this movie, giving it such grades (mostly tens). ok, the movie was fine, funny, but it was nothing special on the other hand. the only good thing about kiler is the dialogues, rather not comprehensive for non-poles. screenplay is primitive, the acting (except for jerzy stuhr as ryba) - awful. it's too much ado about nothing - fortunately it's not included in the top 250. p.s. the sequel "kilerow 2-och" ("2 kilers") is on the way and it's just the same story.
