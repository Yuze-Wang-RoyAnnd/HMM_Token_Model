this show is pretty alright and fun to watch, its a great disney channel shows and sometimes entertaining.<br /><br />i really enjoyed the first season but i hated the second and third seasons. this show has completely changed around. in the first season it was more about science and animals, all that is gone now in the season and third season. its more about her life and dating. ever since that gay kid (ben) came along, this show has sucked. the writers took a perfectly good kid show and changed it to a crappy teen comedy. disney took a turn for the worse. i cant stand to watch the newest episodes anymore, they're all garbage.
