what movie is this??? a horrible movie with the old boring concept of infidelity which has already been achieved by the "bhatt camp". the movie starrs emraan hashmi, udita goswami and dino morea. the movie has "no base". it just goes like this... dino an udita are married and living in a rich mansion. however dino doesn't like udita to the heart as he wants only her wealth. he loves someone else (tara sharma). so he bribes emraan to have an affair with udita so that he could catch them and finally split up with udita.. how boring!! however emraan falls in love with udita and vice versa. lastly when udita gets imprisonment for killing emraan, dino pretentiously tries to save her showing his false love to her. udita on the other hand does not understand this and feels that he loved her truly. so she lends all her wealth to dino. finally dino comes out of the police - station and goes with tara with all the wealth. what a fraud!! the songs are good and are the only thing good in the movie. now the individual ratings: (out of 5) emraan: * * udita: * 1/2 dino : * 1/2 overall acting: * 1/2 direction: * * story: * music: * * * 1/2 final rating: * 1/2 poor performances and poor casting....... music: good... i rate the movie: 1.5 / 10 (dont waste your time !!!!)
