i happened to catch this supposed "horror" flick late one friday night, i wish i'd gone to bed! tell me.. is a 3 ft tall raincoat-clad twerp on a gurly bike supposed to convey some sort of fear? not here, yet mi-low is still able to beat the crap out of the janitor (antonio fargas) who is three times his size(?) uh-huh. and the ending is so pitiful... it just leaves you hanging with nothing to go on what-so-ever! i found myself asking, "is that it???"<br /><br />acting is about as good as it'll get in a low budget film. the aforementioned fargas delivers a decent performance; but it is my conclusion that jennifer jostyn maybe one of the worse actresses to ever strut into tinsel town! sure, cute face, but bad acting.<br /><br />rating: 1
