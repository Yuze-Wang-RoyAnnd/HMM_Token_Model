this weird movie from texas is about fallon, a dilettante rich boy in the late 1800s (although he looks like a 60s c&w singer with greasy hair and sideburns) whose ship wrecks on an island owned by count desade (pronounced de-sayd) with his captain. the count is afraid of pirates and tortures a young girl who was once a pirate hostage and also tortures the captain. meanwhile, creepy former nurse cassandra tells fallon the secrets of the castle. the countess has leprosy and went mad! fallon is trapped but brings supplies. the captain is killed by a racist-caricature slave. fallon is thrown in the dungeon with the leper, who always thinks it's her wedding day. the leper bride is horny, bu cassandra kills her. fallon and cassandra escape the castle, but the count and his slave chase them with dogs. desade kills the slave and fallon kills desade. fallon and cassandra fall in love over the course of the next year, but when the supply ship comes, the crew refuses to take our lovers because they're both lepers now. they live for years in the castle...fallon's hair turns gray and cassandra goes bonkers. fallon puts her in the dungeon. our tale of love and leprosy ends.<br /><br />so bizarre it's watchable, and you can smell the drive-in popcorn.
