i watched this film because i thought it would be a classic amy adams movie. wow, this movie is so bad on so many levels it staggers the imagination. it is poorly constructed for one, also the script and the acting is just awful. but hey even johnny depp has a slew of bad films under his belt. the upside of this movie would be amy singing, and even on that score i believe better songs could have been chosen. amy is of course beautiful to see and if you are a die-hard fan of hers you will probably watch this title no matter what, just don't expect too much. i wish i could have found more to like but it was just painful to watch. i recommend sunshine cleaning or doubt.
