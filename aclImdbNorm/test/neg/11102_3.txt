my blurred childhood memories have kept the echo of the cult serie of belph'egor in the french 60's... so i was eager to see the big screen adaptation. i should have kept my money and gone for a stroll in the louvre.<br /><br />the idea of the scenario is still very apt and interesting (the fantom of le louvre) but the adaptation is ridiculous. the dialogues hesitate permanently between french irony and serious "american business" without achieving neither but not without sounding asinine.<br /><br />acting leaves somehow to be desired and special effects are meager compared to what one could expect (low budget ?).<br /><br />what is left of all that. not much outside a few good shots of paris ... which is seldom a disappointment.<br /><br />belph'egor was worth more than that.<br /><br />
