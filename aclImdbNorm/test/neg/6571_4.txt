supposedly, director william shatner had in mind a much 'darker' film when it came to 'star trek v: the final frontier' but the suits at paramount, looking at the huge box-office receipts taken in by its humor-filled predecessor, insisted the new film have plenty of laughs too. so what we get is arguably the weakest and goofiest of the six star trek movies with the original cast. there are bad ideas aplenty, along with a few good ones, and if you're in a charitable mood, you could look at 'the final frontier' the same way you would a so-so episode of the tv series. on the plus side, laurence luckenbill is a fine actor and gives one of the best 'guest star' performances in any star trek, big or small screen, ranking right up there with william windom's commodore decker. his portrayal of sybok, spock's half-brother, consistently lifts the film when it threatens to sink, which happens all too frequently. charles cooper is good too as the fat old klingon general korrd; too bad his role isn't as large as he is. if the story about shatner's intentions is true, then i owe him an apology, because i was prepared to lay the blame for the incessant silliness and not-very-convincing action scenes squarely at his directorial feet. the reason is i've always felt that, of all the trek regulars, shatner was the least 'tuned-in' to everything that makes star trek work and what makes it special to its fans. having read his trek memoirs, it's very apparent to me that he considered the show another action-adventure series that just happened to have a science-fiction setting. he preferred the vision of gene coon over that of gene roddenberry; coon was known for his work on the popular western series, 'the wild wild west.' shatner also mentioned that a favorite star trek episode of his was 'a piece of the action,' a silly second-season episode co-written by coon. so, finally given an opportunity to direct a star trek feature film, would not shatner follow his instincts and produce an action-filled flick with lots of tongue-in-cheek humor? well somebody did, because that's what 'the final frontier' ended up being. shatner himself definitely returns to form as the great ham and, as leonard maltin points out, the film suffers from a bad case of 'the cutes.' in the opening scene at yosemite national park, it's hard to say which is worse, the super-cheesy special effects or the godawful dialogue. running gags about equipment malfunctioning on the enterprise have run all the way from 'wrath of khan' and by this, the fifth trek movie, have run themselves into the ground. so has the idea of a 'skeleton crew'. one new development is an apparent romantic relationship between scotty and uhura and suffice it to say one does not exactly sense flames of passion burning between the two. it's a pointless subplot and adds nothing. the climactic scene where 'god' is encountered doesn't add much either; whether or not this was a good idea in the first place is debatable, but the scene itself doesn't make much sense. (the 'god' creature's abilities seem to vary according to what is needed at the moment.) roughly half of this is a tired retread of the climax from 'the search for spock.' leonard nimoy manages to salvage spock's integrity, even while spouting such un-spock-like lines as "get a grip on yourself, doctor." and deforest kelley, as usual, outperforms both shatner and nimoy; he really came on as an actor in the final trek films. so this trek outing isn't terrible, it just isn't very good. there was to be one more original cast trek movie before the baton was passed to the 'next generation,' and it was far better suited to the task than 'star trek v: the final frontier.'
