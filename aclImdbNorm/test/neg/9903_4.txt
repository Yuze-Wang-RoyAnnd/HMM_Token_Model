i think "category 6: day of destruction" was very unrealistic. the digital effects where like a children's cartoon. <br /><br />the actors didn't act realistically, for example, when the girl was shot she acted like she got tomato sauce splatted on her. <br /><br />the movie was boring but i watched it because it was on. <br /><br />the only interesting character was tornado tommy, he was funny!<br /><br />please keep the special effects real.<br /><br />i liked the comment: "what did we do to p.i.s.s-off mother nature?"<br /><br />i don't know what else to write to fill up the 10 lines. what else can i say the movie is so boring, i think my comment will be equally boring.
