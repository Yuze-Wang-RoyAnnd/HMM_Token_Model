this picture is a bad and blown up rip off of the michael pohl short film extinct from 1995. while michael pohl's idea was original and perfect for a short film setting, a sound of thunder's plot was poorly adapted from pohl's story and not fit for a full length feature film one would expect from a major hollywod studio. the tragic flooding situation that ruined the sets in prague was just one bad link in a long rusty film production chain in this case. for a studio to release such a product... it is a shame. especially for warner brothers, a studio which broke new effects grounds with shows like babylon 5 in 1993. on television. visual effects for television shows pioneering cgi in episodic television in the mid nineties were way more sophisticated than what is brought to the screen in this picture. in cases like this, sad as it may be: can the film.
