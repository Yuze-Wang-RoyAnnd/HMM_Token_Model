*** possable spoiler but probably not ***<br /><br />the game is called donkey kong but donkey kong is not even in it<br /><br />anymore! diddy is gone aswell!<br /><br />the 1st donkey kong country was one of my two all time favorite<br /><br />super nintendo games. (the other being super mario world)<br /><br />the 2nd donkey kong at least had diddy kong and good levels,<br /><br />although it felt more like a game based on pirates at times.<br /><br />however this one is the worst of the lot! it does not have the feel of<br /><br />the original or 2nd, the enemy's look stupid and the levels are<br /><br />even worse. it does not look realistic anymore! i did not enjoy his game unlike the last two, the first had great<br /><br />background music and the 2nd was not bad but the music in this<br /><br />game is horrible!<br /><br />it happens a lot these days that movies, shows and sometimes<br /><br />video games that start out fantastic, end up with it being ruined by<br /><br />a stupid sequel! i am sad to say i feel that donkey kong as a saga is not as good<br /><br />now that it has donkey kong 3!<br /><br />they should have left it at the original or maybe the 2nd one.
