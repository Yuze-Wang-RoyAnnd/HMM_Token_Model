a few bratty kids unwittingly unleash an evil that has lain dormant for the past twenty years and have to reap the ill fortune that comes with that.the campbell brothers' film before this "midnight skater" was fun & their picture after "the red skulls" was all right. so why is "demon summer" so mind-numbingly bad? i really don't know, it is better then their "splatter rampage wrestling" but not be much as the basement level of acting is cringe-worthy and when a 'horror' film is as talky as this one is, that's not a good thing. the story's been done to death in many other better films, so why waste your time on this one? <br /><br />my grade: d-
