this film is an abomination of all that is worthy in film making. the lead actor surprises his audience by not actually acting at all. we have to watch almost two hours of his bland soulless face. the jokes are all lame i never laughed once it was saturday night there were 5 of us having a beer all up for a laugh and then we put this on and you could feel all the warmth and colour being drained from the room. the film ended and the mood was ruined so we all went our separate ways, ruined the night ! ok so pros and cons. pros beautiful setting in hawaii, looks good on bluray. cons worst acting ever; you can tell everyone concerned is just thinking about payday. predictable poor plot. zero character development. forced jokes which fall flat. many shots of the guys penis which to be fair acts better than him and has more charisma. may all makers of this film hang their heads in shame and hold their flaccid manhoods cheap.
