at times when i watch this movie i start to think that the people who made this movie were on drugs.what's wrong with this film i'll tell you bad plot,bad jokes.bad acting and flat-out characters everything just bad.<br /><br />the movie is about pest vargas a two-bit scam hustler who is given the chance at $50,000 to survive for 24 hours by a german hunter who kills people for a living.so now pest must think of ways to out think this hunter before he gets killed.<br /><br />i know what your thinking "what the hell is this?" a another wannabe ace ventura trying to get money really this plot is just dull and confusing at times it changes the story plot and you get lost during the film.<br /><br />as for the funny scenes this film i had a straight face oh yeah i did smile a couple times but nothing laugh-out loud.besides the jokes are corny and seen before it's like watching ace ventura meets dumb and dumber but bad.<br /><br />as for character development it's dry and flat.you don't learn much about the main character pest all you know is he's a annoying scam hustler but that's it he doesn't change his image or be a little smart just corny.as for the german hunter all you is that he's crazy and wants to go back to germany.really you start to wonder why is this guy living on an island if has money to go to germany.the hunter's son himmel fares better but not much.he's really a coward and is snake-obsessed for reasons by the end he stands up to his father and sides with pest.<br /><br />as for the acting no only were there any memorable perforamces but just over the top.for example john legizomo is so over the top with performance and dosen't fit in his role he's out of place as for jeffery jones who plays the hunter same thing but gives a stereotypical performance as well.as for the rest either just no used enough or just over the top.<br /><br />overall bad comedy that you'll find for $2.00 at k-mart.
