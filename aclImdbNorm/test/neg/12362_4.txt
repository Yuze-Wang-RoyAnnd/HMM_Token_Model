eight legged freaks is a modern monster movie, like a remake of any of the old 'attack of the giant [insert animal here]'-movies of the 50s, 60s and 70s. or rather, it should have been more like a remake of the, instead of what is was. so, how is a monster movie done in the year 2002? well, from the typical opening with some chemical making the spiders grow to huge proportions, they mix movies like gremlins, jurassic park, starship troopers and flavor it with some parody like scary movie. gremlins is probably the best comparison, but eight legged freaks was so full of parodies and stupid jokes that it was sometimes more like scary movie. it was way too much, at least if you're looking for a monster movie and not just another parody movie filled with jokes.<br /><br />for a movie like this you don't expect much of the acting, and that is just the way it was. the story though was extremely thin, with just a bunch of loosely connected events to show off some action mixed with all of the jokes, leading up to an easily spotted and corny ending.<br /><br />i rate eight legged freaks a 4/10, and that includes the fact that the special effects where pretty good and that the noises the spiders made where hilarious.
