you'd think a movie about incestuous sisters who eventually murder their employer couldn't help but be gripping, but then you'd be wrong.<br /><br />there is no plot. there is no character development. there is no redeeming visual beauty.<br /><br />this movie is a waste of time. the exploration of how the relationship between the sisters develops is nil, their sexuality is never anything but a grotesque, the class relationships are glossed over, and employer is a silly caricature.<br /><br />ponderous silences and period clothing do not equal depth of meaning.
