lets be realistic here. this is one of the worst shows i have ever seen. my wife and kids showed real promise in its first season and only went down hill after that. it is so bad that words do not describe. the acting and writing are so dreadful on a consistent basis i wonder if damon wayans was producing such an atrocious show on purpose. from top to bottom every performance is ridiculous. damon wayans completely phones it in and george gore ii is so horrible i cringe at every over-acted line. can anyone really watch this show and find it to be entertaining let alone funny? please i implore you. do not watch this show. as soon as tv affiliates stop picking this up in syndication we can finally be rid of this absolute garbage.
