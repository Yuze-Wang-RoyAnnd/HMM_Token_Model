when i saw this movie, all i could think was: what a disaster! no i'm not talking about the volcano, but about the movie itself. i have seen a lot of movies, but this is certainly one of the worst ever. i don't care about the fact if a volcano erupting underneath downtown l.a. is possible or not. perhaps it isn't, but even than this could have been a good movie... but it sure isn't and i'll explain you why.<br /><br />i don't know how much lava flows out of an average volcano, but what i do know is that the volcano in this movie makes the vesuvius, etna and mount pinatubo together look like a little barbecue. i don't think there has ever been so much lava flowing out of a volcano as what we see in this film. i'm sure the director had a lot of money to spend on his movie, but i really wonder why he all spent it on the special effects and not on the script and the actors. i'm not saying that he should have hired a top cast, but this really is the opposite of what i would call good acting. their performances are so unbelievably poor that it makes the entire movie even worse.<br /><br />and what's wrong about the script you probably ask yourself. well, can you tell me who comes up with the idea of people standing a few yards or even a few feet from the lava without getting burned or having to hide for the heath? or people sinking in the earth when the flow of lava isn't even two foot high? <br /><br />i'm sure i wouldn't be proud if i wrote such a script, but apparently there are script writers in hollywood who don't mind about believability as long as it pays good money! very good money!!!<br /><br />when you see the movie, you'll probably agree with me that this is one of hollywood's worst disaster movies, not worth more than a 3/10.
