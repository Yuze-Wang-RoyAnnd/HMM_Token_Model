i just spent the last half an hour reading through the other reviews and i don't know if i want to laugh or cry. there's no way that adjl is like harry potter, danny phantom, fairly oddparents, other then a secret magical world, which has been close to overdone. also, no way is adjl anime. anime is very much a drawing style(and some will say more, such as plot and japanese origin), either way adjl is not anime so stop saying it is and if you're looking for something that is like anime, look else where, like teen titans and avatar.<br /><br />adjl is typical. it's just like all the other disney shows. an arrogant main character kid who thinks he knows everything and doesn't bother to listen to people who're older than him and continues to make the same mistakes. best friend sidekicks. repeative plot with a hint of a twist. and sibling rivalry. can't they once make a character that has brains and isn't full of himself? can't they have kids respect their elders? can't they think of something different with the plot? can't they have the siblings get along and not hate each other? adjl is just too generic, because you also have bad guys that get defeated and come back again, and are also complete idiots, that have no background for their hate. c'mon, you'll think that someone who's at least 30 will be able to out-wit a 13 year old.<br /><br />watching adjl is like watching nearly anything else on tv these day, same thing over and over again. nothing special, just new designs characters and one small idea that has been used again and again.
