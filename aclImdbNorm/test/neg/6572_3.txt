the voyage here is a search for god, the big guy in the sky, the big cheese with a beard. cunningly disguised as the thirst for ultimate knowledge. taking over from leonard nimoy in the directing chair is the shat himself, captain tiberius william shatner kirk. in an attempt at blending the fun corny aspects of the series with sci-fi histrionics {klingon dialogue consultant, really?}, shatner and his co-writers have only achieved what is almost an embarrassing parody of a parody. where's the danger,? where's the brothers in arms spirit,? in fact where is our badly underwritten crew?. star trek humour is a wonderful thing, when it's in the right places and done with a straight lace so befitting what has come before the final frontier. some light moments exist, but they do not compensate for the lack of serious moments. while do we really need another spock revelation,? really?.<br /><br />some nice sets and little knowingly trek moments aside, the final frontier is just a bad movie experience. 3/10
