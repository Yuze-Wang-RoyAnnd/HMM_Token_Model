there ought to be some kind of prosecution to punish producers from financing screenplays this stupid. i feel that some kind of criminalization of bad film might prevent more films this idiotic from being made. sure it has an interesting cast of characters, but i don't think i've ever seen a more cardboard performance from an entire cast as in this uniquely crappy piece of crap. that director ought to be punished somehow for not eliciting at least some kind of performance out of these people. so detachment is a theme, (no really, they'll beat you over the head with this one), it doesn't mean every character has to recite their lines as if they on npr. did i mention this movie was crappy? lastly i'm not sure what connection one's memories would have with terminal bone cancer, but i'm reasonably certain if you were totally brain dead your cancer would continue to grow regardless. this movie is an insult to cancer patients, medical professionals, and non-retarded people. oh, and lastly, bumblebees fly because they produce a sufficient amount of lift for their mass by beating their wings just like every other flying insect. i absolutely despise people presenting false knowledge as fact. next time do a little research before using an imbecilic misconception as a premise for an entire freaking movie. just kidding believe in jesus!
