after reading the mostly glowing comments about this movie i decided to rent it despite some suspicions of tv movies. i should have followed my instincts.<br /><br />i tried so hard to warm up to the movie and find merit in it but i just couldn't. the story never draws you in or rings true and the acting is perfunctory at best and laughable at worst. everything in this production is amateurish.<br /><br />always a joy to watch, mary mcdonnell may be the only performer to escape this disaster without damaging her career or reputation. i won't even bother checking the name of the leading man - hopefully he's back doing commercials.<br /><br />even poor vanessa redgrave, whom i adore and respect, seemed to be channeling katherine hepburn all the time appearing as if she were really drugged in the home. maybe she needed the money.<br /><br />if i can save one person from wasting 100 minutes on this tripe i will feel vindicated.
