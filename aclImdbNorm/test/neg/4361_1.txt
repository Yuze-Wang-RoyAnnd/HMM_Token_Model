...the first? killjoy 1. but here's the review of killjoy 2:<br /><br />(contains spoilers, so beware readers)<br /><br />oh my. oh, my, my, my. i'll start off with telling you that i had no hopes in the least bit that this movie would be good. considering that killjoy (the first movie) is without a doubt the worst movie ever made, the sequel didn't have much promise.<br /><br />as expected, it didn't deliver.<br /><br />the deaths were even lamer than in the first movie. there was absolutely no eye candy whatsoever, and every single prop looked so fake that i wouldn't be surprised if they had a kindergarten class make them.<br /><br />look, i don't even know where to begin. hm, for starters, the movie wasn't even feature length. it was only an hour and eight minutes long (68 min.), but then again, ending it early was actually a reprieve. in fact, that's the only reason that this movie wasn't as bad as the first, because the first was longer.<br /><br />usually, i don't give spoilers in reviews, but since i don't want any of you to go through the torture of watching this waste of film, i'm going to spoil away. not that there's much to spoil.<br /><br />let's start with the ending. killjoy is the pussiest killer ever. it takes explosions, firebombs, guns, etc. to kill all of the normal serial killers in horror movies. guess what it took to kill killjoy? a f***ing glass of water. no lie. in the end, a girl picked up a cup of water and threw the water on killjoy's face. then killjoy started screaming, and they tried to make it look like his face was melting by putting dried rubber cement on his forehead. then he laid there, and the people went to sleep.<br /><br />now let's hit the acting. very terrible. not even one person was believable in the least bit. i don't even know what to say, other than it looks like they just hired a few hobos living on the streets to act in this film.<br /><br />seriously, i honestly doubt that they spent any more than 100 dollars total to make this movie. they had nothing. most of it took place in the woods, which wouldn't have cost them anything to film on. the actors weren't giving in any effort whatsoever, so it's blatant that they were probably "working" for free. they didn't have any kind of special effects or nice props, and they probably used ketchup for the blood. hell, who am i kidding? they probably didn't even spend 100 dollars. they probably spent $3.29 on a bottle of ketchup and that was it. a f**kin' movie made with a budget of $3.29.<br /><br />for bob's sake, they couldn't even afford to rent a cop uniform. in the end, after killjoy dies, the girl wakes up and says "where is he?" and the main woman replies, "he's gone." then, suddenly, some fat goofy guy with scars on his face pops out of nowhere with a cell phone saying "you have a phone call." the girl answers and says "oh, hi mom!" and smiles. then the fat goofy guy walks along to reveal that it's a police officer. however, he's wearing khaki pants, and a regular button up green shirt, with a lame badge on the front pocket. hell, it was probably the badge that the director got when he was in safety patrol in 3rd grade. then they all got into a tan blazer and drove off as the credits rolled. they couldn't even get a police cruiser so they just got a tan blazer. f**kin' lame. killjoy didn't even have the ice cream van that he had in the first movie.<br /><br />killjoy is without a doubt the most flamboyantly gay slasher ever. if there was a slasher that wore hot pink spandex and carried a rainbow flag, he still would not be as gay as killjoy. killjoy isn't funny either (and believe me, he did try to be).<br /><br />the only good thing about this movie is an extremely lame threat given by one of the delinquents. somebody makes a comment to some boy about not passing third grade, to which the boy responds, "i'll show you third grade!" in a threatening manner. that has to be the absolute worst threat that i've ever heard. "i'll show you third grade!"<br /><br />this movie doesn't even work on a "so bad, it's good" level. it's filth. unless you did something bad, and you are feeling so guilty about it that you want to punish yourself severely, don't watch this movie.<br /><br />just remember; if a flaming homosexual clown with a huge black afro tries to bore you to death with gay jokes (and attempt to kill you at the same time), just throw some water at him. case closed.<br /><br />final rating: .1 out of 10
