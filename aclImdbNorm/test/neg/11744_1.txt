not only why? but "what were they thinking?" this must have been some<br /><br />sort of payback to gus van sant, because this is one of those odd movies<br /><br />that never should have been (re) made. it purports to be hitchcocks film<br /><br />frame by frame, but without the magic or the tension or the great film<br /><br />making. rent the original instead, spare yourself.
