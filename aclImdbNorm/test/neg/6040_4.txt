webs is a pretty odd movie, albeit slightly watchable. richard grieco plays an electrician who gets suck into a parallel earth overrun by mutant spiders, or something like that. the film itself was made with a modest budget, which explains the limited locales, and the somewhat tedious screenplay that manages to do very little with quite an interesting premise. basically a 90 minute episode of the tv show "sliders", and nothing more.<br /><br />4 out of 10<br /><br />(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review and reviews of other films in the genre)
