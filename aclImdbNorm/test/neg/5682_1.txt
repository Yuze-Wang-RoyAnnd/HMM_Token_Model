first i have to say that i don't like since fiction movies at all so much! but there are some movies i liked really. this is one of the others ;) i've the same opinion like some (most)others here. the film is still going on in my back, but the few effects are really not enough to watch the whole time....i think what they have done well are the animated sceneries with 3 suns and 4 moons, but its the only i liked. there are no intelligent dialogs (are there???). but its a great film for everybody who loves lara croft or some other girls in hot-pants... ;)<br /><br />for the directors: " stop to try again, please!!! "
