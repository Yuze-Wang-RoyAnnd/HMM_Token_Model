barney is that idiot dinosaur who (unfortunaltely) didn't go extinct with the other dinosaurs many eons ago. instead he sings stupid songs and has stupid morals about life that are 100% worthless and/or extremely dangerous: that is "strangers are your friends you haven't met yet!". the reason why i say he's evil? well, on youtube, there's a video of a barney song about toy balls. when it's played backwards, it comes out as "we'll all come hang you! let's stab the knockers!". don't believe me? see it for yourself! i also read on another review that they are now reading out pc folklore and fairy tales. now that is just stupid with a capital s! i mean, really! anyways, i don't recommend letting your kids watch this filth as it contains stupid morals like strangers are your friends (as said before), there is never a reason to be sad and if you are sad eat junk food, being an individual is taboo, magic can solve all of your problems and heaps of other ridiculous crap.
