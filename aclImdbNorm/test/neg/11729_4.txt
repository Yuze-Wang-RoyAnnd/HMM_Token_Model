dodgy plot, dodgy script, dodgy almost everything in fact. the most compelling performance is that of joanna pacula as lauren, but even that does not rescue this pointless and nasty film. the director's implicit invitation to viewers is not merely to suspend disbelief but to suspend judgement.<br /><br />presumably it is intended to be steamy and menacing, but although the film has its erotic moments they are few and far between. this sort of thing has been done better by lots of others. don't go out of your way to see it.
