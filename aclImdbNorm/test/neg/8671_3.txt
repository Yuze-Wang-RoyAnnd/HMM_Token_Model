this was just telecast here in the u.s. others have commented on the faithfulness (or lack of same) to the novel; the 1983 bbc version is far superior on this and all other counts. given the scope of the novel, it should not have been condensed to 85 minutes. key sections have to be rushed or alluded to, or omitted; there barely enough time just to get in the chronology of events, so character development has to be sacrificed: we cannot get much of a sense of who the people are, which robs us of what makes austen so great.<br /><br />one major negative for me was the cinematography, which i thought was just awful, and quite literally sickening. the camera is constantly doing ultra-closeups, and swirling around and around in circles. maybe on a small tv box this is ok, but on our 40" hi-def screen it was so literally dizzying that both my wife and i had to look away from the set repeatedly (my dramamine supply had run out). of course, this did distract from the rather lackluster i'm-just-reading-what's-in-the-script acting (isolated scenes are nicely done, but not enough to save things).<br /><br />adding up the score so far in the complete j.a. sweepstakes: i'd rate "northanger abbey" a success, because of superior direction and production values (and the story lends itself better to short treatment), "persuasion" ok (though not the equal of other versions, with condensation again being at fault), both far ahead of this attempt. i will hope for better in the two remaining novels in this tv reader's digest jane austen; like others, i am thankful they left p & p alone!
