after their star cross-country runner dies after a race, the members of a track team are stalked and killed by a mysterious masked murderer seeking vengeance for the girl's death.<br /><br />from the beginning of this film, it was quite obvious it was not going to be very good (at least as far as true quality goes). the 'dramatic' track race at the end of the introduction scene was one of the least believable sporting events i've ever seen in a film. it would seem that the winner of the race had never actually run before in her entire life. not just run track. . . but, run at all. ever. from there, we get a horribly unrealistic female navy member who was breaking numerous appearance rules with her jewelry and make-up, not to mention the fact that her hair was hanging loose onto her collar while in uniform. ridiculously awkward camera angles, pathetically done gore effects, and acting that ranged from frighteningly over-the-top to boringly under done (all in one actor, mind you) all help to make this film one of the most unintentionally hilarious horror films ever made. on the other hand, the writing wasn't all that terrible and the story was actually okay. but, the direction was horrible, made worse by offensively bad cinematography. the acting ranged from acceptable to just plain abysmal. regardless of all the embarrassingly bad elements, however, there's something here, whether it be cheese or something else that i can't figure out, that makes the film extremely enjoyable and very worthy of a watch. maybe it was just vanna white.<br /><br />obligatory slasher elements:<br /><br />- violence/gore: death scenes were fun enough, but the gore was just awful: blood squirts from impossible angles, no actual gashes or wounds from knives, etc. but, this film has the first 'death by football' scene i've ever seen.<br /><br />- sex/nudity: there was a bit of nudity (i mean, linnea quigley is in it, after all), and some overly horny high schoolers, but nothing to excess.<br /><br />- cool killer(s): if you think leather gloves, stop watches, track suits, and fencing masks are cool, this one is for you.<br /><br />- scares/suspense: not really any at all. there is one moment that takes place in the girls' locker room that i was preparing myself to be scared at. . . but, it just led to some typical stupidity and was ruined for me.<br /><br />- mystery: a little, but if you can't figure out the killer's identity about 20 minutes into the film, then i'm not too sure about your powers of deduction.<br /><br />- awkward dance scene: there's a great impromptu jam session ("graduation day blues") with a guitar & harmonica that leads to some awesome 80s bopping. this is followed shortly by some kind of weird blend of 70s disco and 80s break dancing that was probably the scariest part of the film.<br /><br />final verdict: 4/10. don't take it too seriously and you might enjoy it (just like most everything else troma touches).<br /><br />-ap3-
