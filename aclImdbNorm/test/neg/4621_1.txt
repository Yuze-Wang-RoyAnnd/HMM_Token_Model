i want to believe all new horror films coming out of japan these days are edgy and make for enjoyable watching.<br /><br />spider forest is neither.<br /><br />it is seldom that i finish watching something and end up teed off for the waste of time, but spider forest was an exception in this regard. i was very teed off. the makers of the film succeeded on one level; throughout the film i could not stop because i wanted to see the answer to the mystery spun by the storyline. i could not stop watching. that's why i was so angry when the film finished... they dragged me all the way through 2 hours of tedium for this poc? warning: spider forest is another one of those japanese "ghost" stories, though you don't realize that going in.<br /><br />i never want to see a japanese ghost story again. they're phony and contrived. "it's a ghost story" has become like a big rug under which to sweep any and all unresolvable plot holes you have in your story-telling.
