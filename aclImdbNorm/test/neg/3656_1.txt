from reading the back of the box my first thought was that this is probably a knock off of saw 2. i couldn't be further from the truth. it seemed to me like they gave somebody with downsyndrom a camera phone and $10.00 and told them to make a movie. the plot didn't exist and neither did the acting. it was almost as if i was watching a silent film about grass growing. it didn't surprise me at all to find out later that the entire film was "improvised". by the end of this "film" i had lost the will to live and i may have gotten aids just from viewing this piece of cinematic crap. it was about 70 minutes that i could have spent doing something that was less painful. like jumping off of a building.
