take your video camera, turn out all the lights in your house and film people running around with flashlights for an hour and a half and you've got the basic idea of what this film looks like. it is very irritating to watch this kind of movie. to be fair, there are scenes of daylight at the very beginning and very end of the movie. i like scary movies and creature features but this one just didn't do a thing for me. so sorry. i really tried to like it. there didn't seem to be much of a plot other than we've got to find a way out of here. didn't learn too much about any of the characters so it didn't matter if we lost one or two along the way. this isn't the worst movie in the world. "open water" holds that title for now.
