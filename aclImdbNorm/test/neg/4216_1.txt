alexandra ripley wrote a horrible sequel to margaret mitchell's masterpiece book published in the 1930's. margaret mitchell's heirs sold out their rights and for big bucks allowed alexandra ripley to write a piece of junk book even worse than barbara cortland romance novels. i was a huge fan of margaret mitchells book and the fake sequel by alexandra ripley was written just to cash in for money.<br /><br />although i always admired the acting talent of joanne kilmer and timothy dalton, this is a really terrible film. the script is horrible and full of clich'es. ann margarets cameo as belle watling is so awful i wanted to slap her.<br /><br />the only worthwhile thing in the movie is sean bean who gives a masterful bravura performance as the sexy, feral villain - lord fenton. sean bean's performance is along the lines of "the man you love to hate" and portrays an unsafe sex symbol.<br /><br />but sean bean is only in the first half of the movie so you then have to be tormented with watching an incredibly long 6 hour movie with an insufferably boring script.<br /><br />don't waste your money on this film, unless you are a hard core sean bean fan and just watch it for his wonderful performance.
