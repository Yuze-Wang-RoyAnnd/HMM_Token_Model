ok, it's watchable if you are sick in bed or have nothing else to do. the suspension of disbelief required to get through this movie is significant though. first, in today's modern society do you believe college coeds get that committed to someone in that short of a period of time even if you are a "virtuous" habitat volunteer who likes autistic kids? and the 2 week romance blossoms into a letter exchange that leads to john's "conflict" of whether to re-enlist right after 9/11/01...really? he asks her what to do? every guy we know was not gonna be sitting on the sidelines after those towers came down(my husband was one of them and i love him and am proud of him for going) john's character is so flat. he's nearly expressionless the entire movie. he's good looking but not spec ops...he seems unsure not confident, quiet instead of a hell-raiser, no tattoos, gets into a "fight" with the preppy boys that is nothing more than a pushing match really...walks around without a cover on his head nearly the whole movie...and there are military technical flaws everywhere (epaulets upside down?). the war scenes are dumb...john and another guy heading off on their own...huh?, then other guy gets shot and john drags him 10 feet and starts giving buddy aid before securing the area or back-up arrival or even having their backs against cover...it's a gunfight for god's sakes, you don't stop fighting until its over...heck i wanted to shoot john in the back. back home, when the truth is revealed and she spills the wine...we hated her for removing her shirt in his presence...wth? break his heart and then tease him into adultery? she's a head case trollop. best part of the movie is when he drives away from her...at least he had some self respect and honor there. overall unbelievable story and we generally did not care about these characters or their love. dismal!
