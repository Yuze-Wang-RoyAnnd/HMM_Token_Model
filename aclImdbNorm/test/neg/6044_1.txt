there is so much wrong with this movie. greico with a girls wig, old man scientist time machine fixer, tough guy jones who stays behind with a shotgun that has three rounds, spider people with tentacle hands and bad teeth, etc. the make up was so bad and they only had a few visible spider people on screen at one time (aliens cameron technique could have been used) instead they chose to dress every spider person the same way...badly. the nice thing about greico's acting is that he bobs his had at every syllable as if he is counting how many words he gets to speak in the script. it amazes me that with all of the information out there on dvd commentaries, people like this still exist who make movies. this movie could have been worse, how i don't know. oh and one last thing. i am going on a sci-fi movie hunt down. the people running that channel should not be allowed to procreate to further continue the nepotism that exist in film and television.
