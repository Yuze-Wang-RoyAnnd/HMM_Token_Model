wasted is just that, a waste of time. mtv is churning out made for tv movies at quite a clip nowadays. a friend of mine recommended this and i rented it, needless to say i will not be pursuing anymore recomendations from her anytime soon. this movie shows the rollercoaster of drug use. the problem is, you really don't care about any of the characters due to lack of believabilty and their own self discipline. this movie is in a word, annoying to watch, from the terrible camera angles to the quality of dialogue and pacing. the 'digital' format tries for realism, but comes up distracting. if you want a true scope on drug use watch requiem for a dream.
