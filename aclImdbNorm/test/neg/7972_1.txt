kristy swanson plays an elite hitwoman who is supposed to have knocked off a tv reporter for a group of bad guys,but once she sees this poor fellow at home playing with his kids she decides to junk the whole project and the tv reporter's life is spared.the hitwoman's life is up for grabs as the people who wanted this reporter killed now want her dead for not following through with her assignment.such is the basis for a movie called supreme sanction.<br /><br />supreme waste of time is more like it.we see swanson's character beat up,pummel and kill men far bigger than her.and she always one two fifty steps ahead of the group of murders who can't,for some reason,do away with this super hitwoman.having one woman do away and beat all these men,makes the movie seem so gay.it is too predictable once you figure swanson's character is going to win out anyway,thus making the film boring and inept.<br /><br />kristy swanson is decent actress,who in her younger days was always sexy and easy on the eyes.supreme sanction is not one of her better efforts however.
