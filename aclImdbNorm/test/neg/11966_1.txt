the initiation to the local sport team involves taking the newbies out to the corn fields and guess what? there is a scarecrow murdering people there. only one of the newbies survive but falls into a coma due to diabetes. meanwhile the scarecrow starts to kill all of the involved people, one by one. whats the scarecrows secret? will they find it out before the scarecrow gets them all? this is a low budget movie and it shows. sound is ok but picture is really corny. the plot/script really sucks and is quite pathetic and non logical. the acting is really bad and sometimes just laughable. cant really say much about the special effects cause there aren't that many but the few there is ranges from bad to ok(for a low budget that is). there is some nudity and thats probably the only thing worth to watch in the movie(that is if your a horny teenager, if not, skip the movie all together). another complete waste of time and money so don't see it. goes for hack'n'slash fans too.
