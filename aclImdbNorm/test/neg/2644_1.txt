this movie was horrible. if it had never been made the world would be a better place. come on, a flying wagon? what were they thinking? this was a sub-par movie with a horrible hook, and i would like a written apology from the studio that produced this, along with some cookies to help repay me for the time i wasted on this crap fest that i can never get back. if you payed to see this movie, i am truly sorry because i watched it on tv on a sunday afternoon when i had nothing better to do and it pretty much ruined my whole week. a flying freaking wagon?!?! and that's supposed to make up for having a horrible mother who cares more about her own screwed up needs than her children? no wonder they don't have enough sense to tell someone he is beating them, their mother teaches them nothing but that what she wants comes before everything else. absolutely horrible.
