....and now i'm up to episode #7. i really was hoping it'd be over by now (not to mention canceled, once everything connected with the show -including the actors - had been dumped along with some toxic waste in the middle of the ocean somewhere, never to be seen again), because this series really is dire. <br /><br />to have this program listed under the genre of 'comedy' is at best misleading! it's so hard to believe ben elton could write something this bad, maybe this points to a lot of input from the other writers in everything he's been connected with before. in some episodes i haven't even laughed once!<br /><br />oh, and i can't believe ardal o'hanlon actually stopped doing 'my hero' & started doing this instead, his decision making skills were obviously impaired that day - perhaps he simply can't read, and didn't realise just how poor the scripts for 'blessed' were. don't get me wrong, 'my hero' is not masterpiece, but it's a million times better than this piece of junk.<br /><br />and just to annoy me even more i bet this gets a dvd release as well, when there are so many great tv series' that aren't getting released!
