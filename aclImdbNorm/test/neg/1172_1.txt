the story of ed gein is a disturbing and terrifying story. ed was truly a messed up character and his legacy went on to inspire such 'greats' as the tooth fairy, norman bates, and leatherface. how is it then that such a fascinating man has inspired such a boring melodramatic piece of drivel?? ed gein made belts out of nipples, bowls out of skulls, lamps out of skin, danced around under the moon in suits of human skin. none of this made it into the movie because they needed to give us a fictitious story of a ridiculously awful deputy and his rather homely, sex-starved girlfriend. this movie seemed to go out of its way to falsify history. what baffles me is that most movies stray from the path of truth to exaggerate history; this one seems to do it to minimize it. i just don't get it.
