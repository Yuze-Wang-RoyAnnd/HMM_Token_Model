what the hell was this? i'll admit there were some scenes that caught my eye such as the 23 bullshit where the protagonist sees or calculates the number 23 everywhere he goes, but that was pretty much the movie in a nutshell?! for crying out loud this was supposed to be a suspense movie and being labeled as a psychological thriller i would have expected it to have at least some catastrophic effect on the mind but instead what did we get? we just got something as shitty as an animal control guy finding himself in the middle of a mid-life crisis and his journey to redemption. kinda like an old-man flick if you ask me. i probably should have just rented wild hogs, it wouldn't have made a difference. i mean who are we kidding, they should have made someone else the killer of that girl. by juxtaposing sparrow with the protagonist of that book the number 23 they were pretty much giving out the movie to the viewers by hinting that he was the killer all along. how would that have shaken our heads? shame on all of you voters who chose to show some generosity towards this wretched piece of work you call a movie and kudos to most of the critics who concurred with my reaction.
