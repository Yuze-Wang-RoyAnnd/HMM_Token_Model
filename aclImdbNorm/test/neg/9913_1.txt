anyone who complains about peter jackson making movies too long should sit through this cbs "event". there's about 45 minutes of story padded by 2 hours of unnecessary subplots, featuring bland by-the-book tv drama clich'es. bad science is a staple for crappy weather disaster movies, so i'm not going to complain about that. silly science can be fun to watch if it's executed in an amusing fashion. what kills this movie is it's 10 subplots... all of which could be excised without destroying what is supposed to be the central plot. the one character that is entertaining to watch in category 6 is tornado tommy, despite being a very annoying stereotype.<br /><br />note that i also didn't bother commenting on special effects. their quality should come as no surprise.<br /><br />not recommended.
