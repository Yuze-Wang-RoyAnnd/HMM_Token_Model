with pep squad receiving an average of 4.7 on imdb.com, no wonder steve balderson slanders this website so. but the fact is that pep squad is a poorly crafted "black" "comedy" (both words in quotation marks for a reason). it's a movie full of over-acting (cherry, beth's mother), coupled with a couple of lethargic performances (beth and julie's boyfriend). a movie where you can follow cars from twenty feet away in a gaudy red jeep and never be noticed. a movie chock full of not-so-appetizing cleavage and nudity shots that make you wonder, "does the director think this is funny? or clever?" most of all, the characters are so paper-thin and poorly developed that the film becomes quite unpredictable, but probably not on purpose. pep squad can't decide whether to be a comedy, or a drama, or a satire (patriotic music, i get it...). the movie fails at being serious, because the idea of killing for any school position (this being prom queen) crosses the line into insanity (not to mention shots of flag burning and drive-by shootings, a poor attempt at being controversial and edgy), and fails at being a comedy, for all the forced and awkwardly placed jokes (big butt mama, "funky" black principal, and excessive cussing delivered poorly by the principal cast). watching the documentary "wamego: making movies anywhere" only made this film more cringe-worthy, with praise lauded towards it by... the director and the director's father... hmmmmmm. not a black comedy, or anything for that matter. i guess kansas will have to wait.
