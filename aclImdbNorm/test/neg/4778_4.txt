when i saw 6.0 on imdb, i was rather impressed and excited to watch this movie, as a 6 for a horror movie should be rather entertaining. at first i thought it was going to be some disturbing, unseen evil force (having not read the book) to terrify the audience -- but it turns out to be something rather mundane -- killer plants. regardless, i am a rather open-minded individual when it comes to movies so i thought perhaps the movie would bring some kind of breakthrough spin on carnivorous vines.<br /><br />unfortunately, it failed to meet my expectations due to the excessive amounts of clich'e and lack of any originality. to top it off, the female lead character continues to annoy you off with her stupidity. unless the movie is intentionally a bad b-rated movie that is entertaining in the hilarity of badness, no movie should ever ever ever have a main character irritate you if one expects the audience to care about the character. such roles should be reserved for secondary characters. characters were undeveloped, the monsters (plants in this case) left unexplained, and clich'es were dripping all over.<br /><br />the only thing that is mildly effective are some of the bloody/gory scenes, although the gore pales in comparison with movies like high tension or ichi the killer. consistently failed logic (such as why would a character not watching the top of a rope during a second attempt at descending into the ruins when it just snapped and almost killed someone), even if minor, adds up and just continues to anger the audience. the movie could've saved itself by using characters or some kind of story device to reprimand or "redeem" idiot characters who just did something stupid (or at least let the character recognize or regret her own mistakes). but to continue to allow idiocy to preside will certainly cause the audience to abandon all care for the character, in turn taking away the terror of the movie.<br /><br />overall this is a poorly done movie. an example of a well done movie involving pretty twenty-something's getting killed is the texas chainsaw massacre remake (and the prequel too) that certainly instilled fear and had much less character logic flaws. in summary, if you have a lot of time to kill, go watch it if there's nothing else. otherwise, don't waste your time with this sub-par flick and go see something actually scary and highly satisfying like the hills have eyes remake.
