the story of ed gein is interesting, very interesting. this movie, however, interesting only in the fact that it was actually made. kane hodder's portrayal of ed gein is so far off, it's not even the slightest bit funny. ed gein did not behave psychotic in public, he was very calm and collected and always extremely polite to everybody and talked to anybody who would listen, this is one of the major things this movie failed to show the audience. but the biggest mistake of this movie, side from even one frame ever being shot, was that ed never killed anyone without having been told to do so by his dead mother, whom he thought was speaking to him from beyond the grave. he killed only the people who his dead mother said he had to because it was god's will, and he was very remorseful about it, though that didn't stop him from experimenting with cannibalism and wearing people's flesh. i officially gave this movie a rating of "1" simply because "0" wasn't given to me as an option.<br /><br />i highly advise all to stay clear of this movie. if you want to see a movie that accurately depicts ed gein and doesn't try to put in a sub-plot love story between a cop and a fictional woman who never existed, i highly advise you see the original movie, which unfortunately seems to not be on imdb.com though i could be wrong, but i have yet to find it here. the original doesn't stray from the actual events and doesn't try to twist the story. i can understand telling the story from a different perspective, but this movie just tried to straight change the true story itself, something that i find as horrible as if someone made a movie based on 9/11, but gave it a twist that canada was behind it. or a wwii movie saying hitler was a good guy and helped fight the nazi's.
