i saw this movie only because sophie marceau. however, her acting abilities it's no enough to salve this movie. almost all cast don't play their character well, exception for sophie and frederic. the plot could give a rise a better movie if the right pieces was in the right places. i saw several good french movies but this one i don't like.
