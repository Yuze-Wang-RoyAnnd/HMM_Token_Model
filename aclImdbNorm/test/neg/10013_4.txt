here's a decidedly average italian post apocalyptic take on the hunting/killing humans for sport theme ala the most dangerous game, turkey shoot, gymkata and the running man.<br /><br />certainly the film reviewed here is nowhere near as much fun as the other listed entries and is furthermore dragged down by poor voice over work, generally bland action sequences, a number of entirely tasteless scenes such as a prolonged rape sequence and some truly stupid and illogical points throughout.<br /><br />take for example towards the end of the film, when our hero manages to infiltrate the compound of the villains. he initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep. upon discovery of the said corpse, the villains response? (bearing in mind that our hero has come to brutally murder them all)
