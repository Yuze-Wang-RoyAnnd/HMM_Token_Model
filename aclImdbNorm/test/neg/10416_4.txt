whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film-making, it's thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever.<br /><br />if you're depressed already, this film will send you over the edge.<br /><br />if you're feeling somewhat depressed, this film will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter about. you'll feel that it's just your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time.<br /><br />otherwise you might be able to make it through this film unscathed (i didn't, btw), safe in the knowledge that your life is so much better than jim's. then again you might consider that you have been fooling yourself, and that are in fact in a much worse situation than you'd previously realized. you might feel a bit annoyed at jim for bringing this to your attention. you may want to slap him around a bit with a wet fish. <br /><br />the sad truth is, much as i wanted to like this movie... i hated it. it took rather a long miserable road down the path of oblivion and then suddenly, for no reason whatsoever, looked back at itself and then stopped.<br /><br />jim does not have an epiphany, at least not one that is conveyed on screen. jim has a miserable life and a miserable set of options. he discovers nothing that one can relate to and fails to make any significant progress on his journey of self-discovery. <br /><br />of course no-one alive could write a happy ending to this movie. as others have said it's no hollywood tale, it's gritty and it's real. it's well made. life is quite a struggle at times. if anyone were to know "the answer", they do well to shout it from the rooftops.<br /><br />still, i feel cheated because this movie pretends to have something to say. you feel that it's going to say something, that if you just suffer through a little more of it, it'll have something to say. it'll make you stop and think. <br /><br />it doesn't.<br /><br />again, i do submit that this is a well crafted film. and therefore may be of value to a film student with a penchant for e.g. lighting techniques of the use of colour palettes. <br /><br />for the rest of us, it's utterly miss-able.
