from the dire special effects onwards i was absolutely gob smacked at how bad anyone can make a film. lets put it this way, i have absolutely no directing experience whatsoever and for the first time ever when watching a film i thought 'i can do better than that! whilst sat watching this pap. the acting in this film was terrible, i suppose the best actor was the guy from lawnmower man but the french guy from aliens3 was so wooden i wondered how he got the former job in the first place. the storyline was mediocre and i suppose, like most films, if the rest had been done well it would have stood up. i don't usually write reviews here but after seeing a couple of people gave this film a good rating (must be cast/crew) i felt i had to say my piece to save anyone from accidentally hiring it or wasting their money on buying this cack.
