as ben elton once observed, nothing goes quicker out of style than comedy. steve martin's latest offering - 'the pink panther 2' - recently opened to bad reviews and dismal box-office grosses, while mike myers' 'the love guru' seems to have won few admirers.<br /><br />in 1970, it was jerry lewis' turn to feel the pain of rejection ( ironically, his character in this film experiences a funny turn whenever anyone uses that word in his presence ) when 'which way to the front?' effectively drove him off the big screen for almost a decade.<br /><br />in this world war two comedy, he plays 'brendan byers 111', the richest man in the world, who wants to join the army to do his patriotic duty ( and also because he is bored with being successful ) but is rejected as he is medically unfit. he then decides to start his own privately funded army, recruiting other 4-f's.<br /><br />decked out with ludicrous uniforms that look like those worn by 'international rescue' in 'thunderbirds', they go into training. some good visual gags here. when they fire rocket launchers, they look pleased with themselves, until they learn they have just destroyed a texaco oil station! wishing to learn german, brendan plays a long-playing record called 'songs to mein kampf by'. when this army sits down to eat, instead of being in a draughty mess hall, they are in an opulent room decked out with a chandelier.<br /><br />john wood is very funny as 'finkel', byers' ever-so english butler. his best scene is when he blackmails a mafia-type gangster into teaching byers' brigade to kill.<br /><br />the script was not by jerry himself, but by gerald gardiner and dee caruso, author of a number of episodes of 'the monkees'. 'front' often has the look and feel of a television sitcom, indeed at times you almost expect to hear a laugh-track.<br /><br />where it goes badly wrong is in the last thirty minutes when byers replaces a top nazi commander and, after ordering the germans to withdraw from the front, gets involved in the plot to kill hitler ( and tom cruise is nowhere in sight! ). as the commander, jerry delivers a performance of such mind-numbing ineptitude as to defy description. he gives brian blessed a run for his money in the 'loudest man alive' stakes. it comes as a relief when the end credits appear.<br /><br />perhaps the timing was just wrong - bringing out a war comedy when the vietnam conflict was raging was not a good idea. or the public simply had had enough of jerry ( that beard probably did not help! ). what he needed here was a good producer, someone to take him in hand and say: "that gag stinks. throw it out!". 'don't raise the bridge, lower the river' is a masterpiece by comparison with this picture.<br /><br />as the '70's got underway, the new comedy icons would be woody allen, mel brooks, and monty python - fresher, more biting and in allen's case, more human styles of comedy replaced jerry's brand of slapstick. it would not be until 1982 that he would make anything like a successful comeback - as the conceited talk-show host 'jerry langford' in martin scorcese's brilliant 'the king of comedy'.
