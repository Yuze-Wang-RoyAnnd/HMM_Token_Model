wow! what a horrible, hideous waste of time this celluloid atrocity turned out to be. i remember seeing it years ago and thinking it was fun but now...it's just plain silly. not to mention the fact that it is a blatant rip-off of "the exorcist" to the point where it was re-released at one point under the title "the sex-orcist". the only real difference is that the producers have the gall to further discredit themselves by slapping on the claim that the events in the film are real! who in their right mind would actually believe such a bold faced lie? to make matters even worse, there was a video release in circulation with cover art that blatantly tried to cash in on the "rocky horror picture show" by throwing a pair of lips on the cover! how low could one possibly sink? do not be fooled by the false claims, blatant lies or title rip-off because you will be sorely disappointed if you do!
