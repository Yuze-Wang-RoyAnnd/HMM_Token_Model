( hr is what himesh is called in the movie, i think he likes it too. ) it's amazing how intelligent people, talented even fall in to the same trap.<br /><br />i really like reshamiya. it's amazing what he has done. no one in recent years has come back from the wilderness and made a mark for himself.<br /><br />and i truly expected a great film ( what with the budget of 50 cr and the cute actress ). as intense as reshamiya is i thought, he would excel at a sentimental and an emotional role. ironically he is depicted the same but for what care? sheer incompetence, carelessness, awful acting, banal background music, insensitive direction make it a real pain.<br /><br />blunders rule. ( ex. how can german police issue public instructions on a loud speaker in english? they communicate among themselves in english!) unfortunately this incompetence has become the standard in main line bollywood. there are some excellent directors but many a bad ones too. the worse thing is that the majority just doesn't care.<br /><br />songs are the only saving grace...<br /><br />please don't repeat this hr and find yourself a good director ( low budget.. no problem).<br /><br />the villain should really have shaved his head instead of the wig you know... after all it's a 50cr movie.
