this film is a good companion to blair witch, because it does so much wrong that bw did right. like bw, this one pretends to be a documentary of ghostly events, with each member of the team manning his/her own camera. <br /><br />the sense of reality is never there, however. the participants are poorly written clich'ed characters and the events that take place are equally clich'ed (the cat jumping out of a closet, falling chandelier, etc). also the stilted dialog and inept improv work by the overly-attractive cast detracts from the docu feel. and, worst of all, the supposedly participant-held cameras record too many events too perfectly to be even remotely believable. actually, with some re-editing, this thing could have been a blair witch parody. in fact, there is a scene in which the blond historian is eating a sandwich with a huge roach on it that is actually pretty funny as is, reminding me of a similar gross out scene from "austin powers: the spy who shagged me." but in the end the event is played straight, with no punchline. it's hard to tell what the intent was with the st francisville experiment other than to glom a few stray bw bucks. but it's pretty sad when the only real interest i could find in it was whether the blond historian was going to have her t-shirt tied up off her belly in a particular shot or not.
