if you want to see how to ruin a film, study this one very closely. in fact, it is so bad that people should buy it for that reason alone. especially note how most of the scenes look as if they were knocked up in about 5 minutes. realism escapes this movie on every level. the overall impression is that someone was given a below average script, wannabe actors, an average director and absolutely no budget whatsoever. with a formula like that, it just had to be doomed.<br /><br />i rented this once, and i swear i got stupider watching it. if you are a humanitarian, buy this horrible, horrible movie, and burn it-unwatched- as a favor to the world. it has no discernible plot, bad acting, and then tosses in something about evil ugly women just to really cap the whole thing off. i would suggest watching paint dry before this stupid waste of a tape! seriously. the paint would be better. i wish i could give this negative 10 stars.
