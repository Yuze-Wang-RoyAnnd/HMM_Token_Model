how is it possible to make such a bad movie with such actors? were they forced into it? the plot has nothing to do with an idea of how things would turn out if a comedian ran for president. they don't even try to give an impression of that. just when you thought you were watching a comment from famous liberals on dc politics (the first five minutes), the movie runs off the road and into b-film drama about 1) a computer voting error, 2) the regular evil corporate suits who wants to cover it up with the most unoriginal lines in history, and 3) a neurotic but extremely pretty female programmer who tries to tell the coming president about this. she's soon the victim of the evil x-files master-lords of the computer company, who - instead of killing her - drug her to make her seem untrustworthy. but, when she gets to dc, she doesn't tell him. in fact, the movie then changes from b-film drama, to idiotic b-film-love-drama. up to now, we are so far off the original starting point of the movie, that most people turn it off. i almost did. if it just could've been intelligent love drama, but no! it's not! it's the kind of "oops i'm so nervous i'm being stupid all the time, so please love me for it"-kind of love drama. all with a slow, slow pace, that has nothing to do with either the political plot of the movie, the x-files plot of the movie, or the comedy plot of the movie. all plots fail on all levels, which every annoying bit of meaningless dialog reminds you of. the love part has to be the result of deciding during a drinking binge "hey, there has to be a dynamic of love between the president candidate and the extremely pretty female programmer, yeah, that'll work! stick it in there!"<br /><br />meanwhile, lewis black is castrated and put into a role where he doesn't come up with one single lewis black line. the lewis black anger is replaced by a hope for it to surface sometime in the film, which it never does. and christopher walken is thrown into a hospital with heart trouble, to duplicate the dramatic effect of the heart attack of the president's closest aid in westwing. watching christopher walken being castrated like lewis black in roles that constantly struggles uphill to sound casual and westwing-ish, but fail like titanic every time, is like watching a great blue whale dying on a beach. heartbreaking.<br /><br />and then, enter the low point of the whole movie: it raises the mindbogglingly, enormously difficult ethical question: should robin williams go on to be president, knowing that he got elected because of a computer glitch? the american dream and all good prevails as he turns down the presidency on live tv, like lassie the dog would. with the usual patriotic glamor of the presidency and the we're-so-smart-that-we're-making-history-atmosphere that westwing cultivated in sickening abundance for the next million years.<br /><br />the director and screen writer, barry levinson, is now on my personal list of writers and directors i'm staying away from forever. this film must be seen as a symptom of a faulty production process, where people (inlcuding barry levinson) got to spend production money due to their personal relationships, and not their skills. this is a project made to satisfy poorly skilled people's wish for career success, and the formerly mentioned great actors were tricked into participating in it. that's the only explanation there can be. <br /><br />ps: the voting error in the computers was due to the double letters in dobbs, kellogs and mills. of course it was, what else could it be when you write a script and can't tell a computer from a dish-washing machine.
