tu pa tam is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. but on the other hand is better then most of the movies from slovenia, who are filled with depressing characters and story without any bright ideas. tu pa tam is bright, optimistic and without any artistic moments. in many interviews director mitja okorn tried to tell us that his movie is top quality just because it didn't cost a lot of money. but thinking that way is wrong. tu pa tam is for me very bad movie. the dialogs are really bad written (90% of the script is consisted of cursing), the characters are stereotypical morons, the story and its twists are very predictable and the action sequences (this movie supposed to be an action comedy) are filmed very very bad and without any style. okorn is just thinking he's even bigger than quentin tarantino, so he's copying his style over all 90 minutes. the humor in the movie is very cheap and primitive (okorn probably thinks that constant cursing is funny). in my opinion is tu pa tam very cheap (not only by budget)movie with stupid story and very very bad acting.
