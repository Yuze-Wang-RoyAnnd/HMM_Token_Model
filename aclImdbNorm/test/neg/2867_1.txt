i couldn't stand to watch very much of this crap. this is your standard junk that certain annoying women love- old english era drama with lots of costumes and clich'e characters that seem to be plucked from either directly from oliver twist or some other dickens novel. this uses the usual clich'es from the victorian era. certain idiotic people really think that the whole emotional torture of that culture being so bloody repressed is somehow fascinating and romantic. this is sap, pure and utter junk and boring as watching grass grow. as such it is perfect for women who crave some sort of english countryside snoozer romantic drama in a victorian setting but for this man this movie is nothing but torture and cruel and unusual punishment to watch a bunch of drab boring scenes with unoriginal characters speaking in that wretched forced and fake english accent.
