someone commented that charlie sheen's character should be court martialed for doing whatever he wanted. you may be right, but that is how seal's truly are. i served for several months with a seal team out of norfolk, va. actually, i should say they used our ship to deploy themselves around europe for a couple of months. i was the postal clerk on board and everyday these guys would try to get their mail. since only one person was allowed to pick up the mail each day we issued one pass to one person. each day a different seal would come up pretending to be someone else. well, after the third time i said no to them until i had proof who they were. they went nuts!!! i thought they were gonna bust through my cage, gag me, and then steal the mail. luckily i had not only the president on my side (the navy), but the federal government (us mail). that was the only time i saw the seals stopped from having whatever they wanted. they were allowed unlimited shore leave, where we had to be back on ship at a certain time. they killed and tortured a woman in france and the two seal's only got a 1 week detention on ship, whereas a seamen was caught stealing a bottle of wine from a french wine shop and he got a court martial. is it any wonder why the seal's retention rate is over 85%? as a seal you are god. so this movie does a pretty accurate job of portraying how a seal acts and thinks... unfortunately it is so unbelievable to normal people that it comes off as being fake.
