i have waited a long time to see this movie. ifc finally ran it one night. i thought it would be something like "barfly" from barbet schroeder. wrong. this film doesn't recreate that underworld of chintzy, dirty, smoke filled, character filled bars you associate with his stories. it also fails to capture that bukowski attitude that mickey rourke did so well in the above mentioned film. that natural smart-ass attitude. fans of charles bukowski will enjoy seeing scenes from his books on screen but those unfamiliar with his books could get the wrong impression about his works. this film looks like just another 'movie of the week" about a drunk and his relationships. if you want to get a better idea about charles bukowski's world watch "barfly".
