time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent. the plot has a gangster falling for a socialite who wants to help the down on his luck violinist she loves. there are of course complications. the problem with the film for me is that it hasn't aged well. performances are all over the place with some emotional scenes seeming so over the top as to be laughable. one late exchange where carol lombard throws someone out of her room had me howling with its sing song delivery. there are other times when the film becomes static, a sign of the limitations of the microphones. its not a bad film, its just that the technical limitations of the film get in the way of real enjoyment. normally i'm forgiving, but this time out i just couldn't go with the flow (then again the copy i saw was absolutely horrible). worth a shot in a forgiving mood (and to be reminded that robert armstrong actually did more than play carl denham in king kong)
