the comments already left for this show are way more funny than the show itself and they are all accurate. i feel exactly the same way, that i am very disappointed at how far rick mercer has fallen when he used to do some really great things on this hour has 22 minutes but now he is just clowning around, going places and talking to people. he does some bits in the studio about things going on in the news but they are never funny at all, just really sad and predictable jokes about headlines. most of his show is him going somewhere to talk to people, for example this week he is going to a rodeo and the video pieces are all of him making funny faces and acting scared of the wild horses, etc. he used to be funny but has gotten way less funny since leaving this hour has 22 minutes and that show is also not funny at all any more. now that air farce is off the air (finally thank goodness!) mercer and this hour has 22 minutes have got to be next in line for the axe, just old tired predictable comedy that almost nobody finds funny any more. it's sad really considering rick mercer used to be the funniest man on canadian tv!
