as someone who loves baseball history, especially the early 20th century in which cobb was a main figure, along with a ton of colorful characters, i was looking forward to seeing this baseball film. well, it wasn't a baseball film, which was disappointing. no, it was just a sportswriter's account of being with cobb in the ballplayer's later years while the two collaborated on a book. even at that, this could have been a more appealing movie than they made it.<br /><br />granted cobb was anything but a nice guy, an extremely talented player but brutal in that he would do anything to beat you....and he was viscous, intimidating and had a lot of demons to fight. he was so hated his own teammates tried to hinder his chances of winning a batting title one year. nonetheless, this an over-the-top portrayal of the man. it makes him into something almost cartoon-like. <br /><br />watching and listening to an old man rant, rave and profane for two hours is entertainment? no, it isn't. some day, i'd love to see a real biopic of cobb showing him in his ballplaying days and if they want to portray him as an evil guy, so be it, but the way they did it here with just a bitter, blasphemous old man making an ass of himself in front of a reporter is not fun to watch.
