oh wow, the character shares my name first name! nick! this movie as bad as the first one, if not worse. well, at least there's an actual octopus in this movie. an actual octopus that makes a better appearance in this film. by better, i mean, "longer" the acting is pretty dry and it's hard to sit through. just to let you know, when this ninety minute film ends not only are you freed from your couch but you get your ability to breathe back. not only that, but you realise how stupid you are and then commit suicide, realising how horrible life is after watching this film. really, it shows how desperate horror movies are today, more crap like this is being realised and where the hell have the real masters of horror been lately? this film should have been the final straw, so we can bring back cinematic geniuses in horror cinema, that could make some actually good modern horror films, this movie bites.
