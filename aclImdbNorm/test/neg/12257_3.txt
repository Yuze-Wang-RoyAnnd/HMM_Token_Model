a genuinely odd, surreal jumble of visual ideas which probably looked extremely puzzling on the printed page; just what drew robert redford to the project, one may never know. sidney j. furie directs this knockabout journey of an egotistical motorcycle racer taking a milquetoast juvenile under his wing; the kid looks up to this anti-hero, and eventually begins to ape his amorality. disjointed and off-putting--though for some, the sight of redford disrobing, about to disrobe, or having been disrobed might be enough to warrant attention. lauren hutton gets naked too, however all the sexy flashes are just teasers for the prurient-minded; there simply is no story. perhaps furie was making an esoteric comment about feckless wheelers and their flock circa 1970. if true, then this pre-blank generation approach backfired, as the film was not a success. *1/2 from ****
