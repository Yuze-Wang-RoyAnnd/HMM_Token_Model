donald pleasance and peter cushing united in one horror film; that always sounds like a terrific plan. two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation, who previously already starred together in terrific genre outings like "the flesh and the fiends" and "from beyond the grave", pairing up in a mid-70's satanic themed exploitation flick. how can this possibly go wrong? well, unfortunately, it can. to my deepest regret "land of the minotaur" can hardly even be called mediocre, and that in spite of the cast, the exotic setting, the appealing title and the potentially great sounding premise. in a remote little area in greece, more particularly near an archaeological site, multiple tourists vanish because baron peter cushing and his docile followers keep feeding them to a fire-breathing minotaur statue. cushing, who never looked more bored and uninterested in any role he played before, owns a giant medieval castle and apparently in greek this means you also own the complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caverns. that is of course quite handy if your hobby is the kidnapping of random campers and amateur archaeologists. when three of his young friends also mysteriously disappear in the same area, father roch - the priest of a couple of towns before) - decides to investigate. "land of the minotaur" is a boring and extremely slow-paced horror effort that never really undertakes any major attempts to generate a satanic atmosphere and doesn't bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating elements and pagan trivia details. the titular minotaur, for example, is an intriguing creature of greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person, but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepens out the significance. instead, the film focuses on tedious and overly talkative sequences and loud inappropriate music altered with experimental noises. the only reason to even consider giving this major disappointment of a film a chance is because of donald pleasance. his portrayal of rude, bossy and old-fashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is powerful and reliable as always.
