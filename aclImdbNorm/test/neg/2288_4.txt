sad in every aspect, this poor excuse for a career boost for connery was neither that nor the hit warners wanted it to be. overlong by 20 minutes and filled with embarrassing moments for everyone involved, this film and "robocop 2" are proof that irvin kershner did not have any real control over "the empire strikes back." connery hadn't been in a hit since he bowed out from bond in 1971, but this didn't bring him back at all. "octopussy" was released several months before this film, and easily outgrossed it. imagine that - a roger moore bond not only better than a simultaneous connery release, but outgrossing it (and compared to "never...," "octopussy" is on par with "2001."<br /><br />the worst bond theme song, even worse than "the man with the golden gun," pointless scenes that drag on pointlessly (with the worst example being that ridiculous video game sequence - my god - who cares?!), and the most atrocious collection of non-talent as far as the fabled "bond girls" go. does anybody seriously think kim basinger is attractive in this movie? there were girls in my high school who could never get dates who looked better than she does in this. and barbara carrera - just plain stupid - but the way kershner has directed her to prance around all the time didn't help her out any. she is the seedling that would become the very impressive "onatop," which was about the best feature of "goldeneye," but that doesn't mean anything as you laboriously struggle through this film.<br /><br />casting leiter as a black agent was an excellent idea, but the buddy-loke interaction connery and he are supposed to have is awfully bad. two actors never appeared so clumsily linked together - witness the scene where, to escape local authorities, they strip to their boxers and pretend to be out exercising - i can not imagine another scene in any movie that tried so hard so fruitlessly to get a laugh.
