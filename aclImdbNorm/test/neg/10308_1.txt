wow, there are no words to describe how bad this movie truly is. i usually pride myself on being able to enjoy any movie no matter how bad, but this was just too much. i would only suggest watching this movie as a torture device. if you can get past the terrible plot and dialogue by watching it on mute, the even more terrible camera work and shoddy special effects make this movie a real horror. if your thinking about watching this because your a sandra bullock fan, don't even bother as she has less than ten minutes of screen time, and her acting is absolutely atrocious. not to mention the rest of the cast, which could be replaced with baboons who would do a better job, at least then we wouldn't have to listen to the terrible dialogue.
