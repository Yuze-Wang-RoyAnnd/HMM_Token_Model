i went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night. i'm 20 years old and this movie was way too much for me. i couldn't imagine taking a teenager, preteen, or (especially) a child to this movie. it was crude and offensive. i was totally misled by its pg-13 rating and the previews that i had seen for it. i had originally seen previews for it on nickelodeon, and i thought that it looked pretty cute (maybe i just don't remember the preview correctly) . plus, drake bell (the movie's main character) stars on a nickelodeon television show that targets preteens and young teenagers. i really didn't think that the movie's content would be as risky as it was. i should have done more research about it before i went. however, i'm hoping that parents will read up on this movie before they take their kids to see it just because it has drake bell in it.<br /><br />seriously, do not take your kids or teenagers to see this movie. the rating should have been r. there are tons of sexual references, drug references, and disturbing events throughout the movie. examples: drake bell gets attacked by sexually charged animals, several scenes that involve men grabbing women's breasts, lots of profanity, drake bell uses a bong to smoke vanilla frosting (or something like that), people get stabbed, hit, and hurt in the movie, and an elderly lady and her dog get shredded. there are tons of other offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the movie. it was really demeaning to women in general. the movie is by the people that made the scary movie series, so that should tell you something right there. please remember that seeing movies like this can give kids and teenagers all kinds of wrong ideas about sex, drugs, and violence. most children and teenagers can't decipher between spoofs or comedy and reality.<br /><br />i do have a sense of humor. i also know that the humor that was in this film is typical of its genre. but i find the possibility of children and teenagers going to see this movie horrifying.<br /><br />as for the overall quality of the movie, i didn't think it was that original or funny. it dragged in parts and some of the humor was just forced and painful. the acting wasn't too bad, considering how bad the script was. if you're an adult or older teen looking for a funny movie, skip this one or rent it.
