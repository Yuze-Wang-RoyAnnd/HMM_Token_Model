*** spoilers***<br /><br />one of the worst films i've seen since last years "the village." an insult to anyone of any intelligence at all. poorly written and astonishingly contrived. nobody, especially in los angeles talks the way these characters do. no subtly at all. if the point of this film is to say that "we all have a little bit of bigotry in us" he does a horrible job of stating the obvious. not only was his point clearly base, but every character in this film was amazingly stupid. the car jacking scene almost made me walk out, along with the rescue and oh lets not forget the white off duty rookie cop picking up a hitchhiking black thug and... i could go on and on. awful, just awful.
