with awful movies like this one being even considered let alone being made, it's very easy to see why hollywood is in such serious trouble with bad plots and worse remakes all the time.<br /><br />i guess the viewer is supposed to be laughing their rear ends off over the 'black' in-jokes, the 'pimped up' look and the 'bling'. it's so incredible 'over the top' and so bad that is even past the 'so bad it's funny again' mark and have plummeted right into 'totally embarrassing for anyone involved'.<br /><br />i'm very, very sorry for every single minute i wasted on this one. i want my time back !<br /><br />save yourself the agony, do not watch this. the only reason for me to give even 1 point in the rating is that 0 wasn't an option.
