i'm sorry, but they did leave the impression that these commandos fought zombies before. but they sure didn't act like they even seen a zombie before. jumping and turning their backs on them like amateurs. second, the characters are pretty badly written. the actors did the best they could with what was given, i blame bad writing and bad directing. lastly and here is where the spoiler warnings are highest. they loose the sample twice and the girl jennifer holland doesn't know if she's been bit or not. how stupid is that? as much as it hurts to be bitten, one would think you would know, plus gallons of blood leaking from your body is a good clue. dumb, the first movie had it's flaws but it has re-watchablity, unlike this disaster of a movie, which i could barely get through once. i give the house of the dead 2: no guts, all stupidity the crap-o-lantern
