infamous horror films seldom measure up the hype that surrounds them and i have yet to come across a worse offender than wes craven's the hills have eyes. having held back from watching this for years, i was really pleased when i got it for christmas and waited for an evening when my girlfriend was out to settle down and watch it - knowing her extreme dislike for anything genuinely horrifying. i needn't have bothered.<br /><br />after a promising - if familiar - start, that firmly sets the film in the 'desolution usa' world of survival horror, things rapidly go to pieces when the protagonists and antagonists meet in the deserted wasteland.<br /><br />looking like it was shot on a budget of $5, with the cannibal clan's costumes hired from a dodgy fancy dress shop that specialises in faux caveman and red indian attire, the story follows an annoying bunch of unsympathetic wasps who take a detour on a road trip to california, to look for a silver mine in a nuclear testing zone (!). when they break down they are set upon by the local family of flesh-eaters and have to fight to survive.<br /><br />while hoping for another deliverance, texas chainsaw massacre, wrong turn or devil's rejects, i actually realised i'd stumbled across something that should have remained dusty and unwatched in a backstreet video store's bargain bin.<br /><br />with gallons of tomato ketchup for blood and a couple of gruesome wound close-ups, i can kind of see how an 18 certificate (in the uk) is justified, but with those close-ups trimmed this wouldn't have looked out of place as a saturday afternoon thriller on itv.<br /><br />the whole silver mine/nuclear test site subplot is just a mcguffin to justify pitching the 'civilised' family against the primitives, but given how easily the savages get their asses whupped it stretches credibility to think that they had survived for a generation preying on passers-by.<br /><br />and then there's the ending ... or lack thereof. the hills have eyes seems to be missing either a third act or, at the very least, a satisfying denouement. instead, i was just left wondering: "yeah, and ... ?"
