i finally rented this video after searching for it for many months. initially i only wanted to see it because i'm an out and out neil pearson fan (patrick, boyfriend of isobel, the lead). however, the movie stands up very well without neil (although he handles himself very well in this movie, he is overshadowed by the three main female characters). it's an eerie, intense movie, the sort the brits do so well - definitely a "chick flick" the house and it's isolated setting giving the movie an almost "wuthering heights" aura. the movie is full of tension and the ending, shocking, yet somehow inevitable. i'm glad i watched it, it was worth the wait
