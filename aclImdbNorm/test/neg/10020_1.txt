sure, most of the slasher films of the 1980's were not worth the<br /><br />celluloid they were filmed on, but this video nightmare may well be<br /><br />the dullest produced.<br /><br />six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping. of course,<br /><br />and you know this already, they begin getting killed one by one by a<br /><br />mysterious stranger. the climax has a hunky forest ranger trying to<br /><br />get to the teens in time before the last cute girl becomes buzzard<br /><br />bait.<br /><br />john carl buechler, my least favorite b-movie guy, did the lousy<br /><br />makeup effects here. the cast features carel struycken, of "the<br /><br />witches of eastwick" and the addams family movies. sadly, he<br /><br />does not pop up until the very end of the film, and is covered in<br /><br />burn makeup, rendering him unrecognizable. steve bond (anyone<br /><br />remember him?) is here in an early role as a victim.<br /><br />brown's direction, and the script he cowrote, both smell like the<br /><br />presents brown bears leave in the woods. he pads the film with<br /><br />so much stock wilderness footage, i thought i accidentally rented a<br /><br />special episode of mutual of omaha's wild kingdom. much of the<br /><br />cast sits around the campfire and eats, then walk, and sit and eat<br /><br />again. the forest ranger is involved in the strangest scene ever put<br /><br />in a slasher film: he tells a joke about a wide mouthed frog to a<br /><br />baby deer. jackie coogan, who must have forgot he once worked<br /><br />with the legends of silent cinema, has two scenes, and is involved<br /><br />in the second strangest scene ever put in a slasher film: he and<br /><br />the hunky forest ranger have a conversation about cucumber and<br /><br />cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread...yeah.<br /><br />there is not one minute of suspense here. the killer, a forest fire<br /><br />survivor looking for a mate, watches the students from behind<br /><br />trees. we know it is the killer because the film makers have<br /><br />dubbed in a heart beat sound effect that helpfully serves to wake<br /><br />the viewer up every few minutes. skip this pile of pine sap and rent<br /><br />"halloween," instead.<br /><br />this is rated (r) for physical violence, mild gun violence, gore,<br /><br />some profanity, brief female nudity, mild sexual content, sexual<br /><br />references, and drug abuse.
