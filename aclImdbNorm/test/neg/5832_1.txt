i come from bangladesh, and here, c.c.costigan is a goddess of awesome sex. all kidding aside, a friend and i were awake in the middle of the night, watching movies on the encore: action channel, when we came across a series of sci-fi-esquire flicks. there was robocop 2 (not bad,...not bad at all) ... then judge dredd, (stalone almost ruins his career) then a movie called lethal target. one would think the title "lethal target" could only be awarded to a really cool, and really cheesy rambo knock-off. but nay, what is delivered is what i would like to call a "semi-softcore, semi-pseudo action, semi-sci-fi film" ... actually, i think i can say that this isn't even a film at all. if it wasn't for the main character's sheer hotness, my friend and i would've turned off the movie as the opening credits rolled.<br /><br />i have a few questions to the people (i wouldn't even dare say "professionals") who made this film. -one, in the future, why are they using the weaponry we used in 1999? oh, wait, i get it, it's all that they could get their hands on,... right???... well then,.. why is the main character wearing what looks like a normal everyday linen shirt and a vest, kinda like what people wore in the late nineties? .... oh ... i get it ... in space, it must have been a fashion statement.... well, then... why,oh, why does the main character pull out a 3.5 floppy disk at one point in the film so that she can upload some bullshit ?! wtf !? ...we've progressed so far that we have space travel, but we still haven't progressed past 1.44megabytes of space..?<br /><br />i guess i'm just asking for too much.<br /><br />question two, let's just say...that yes... this is a softcore porn. then why is there only one real sex scene, and why does it last for 2 minutes?<br /><br />i mean, you're taking the reason people are staying up in the middle of the night to see this crap (dare i say 'movie' anymore?) ... and whittling it down to 2 minutes. hell, they should've just taken that sex scene and sold it to another porn movie, and they would've still made more money off of this "crap" than they did.<br /><br />c.c.cortigan is hot. and no offense to the actress, but she acts about as well as i do. and i'm mentally retarded, and only have one testicle... (c.c. cortigan,...e-mail me ...we'll have lunch) i would write more, but i've run out of space.
