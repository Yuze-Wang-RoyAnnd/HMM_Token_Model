the plot of this boils down to ah-nuld versus satan, and what i remember most about the movie is a lot of explosions, gunfire, blood, noise, and let's not forget that flammable satanic urine. the story is nonsensical, utterly predictable, and so full of holes i couldn't take a bit of it seriously. stick to "rosemary's baby" or "the exorcist" if you want to see a really good devil movie and....um, well, i can't think of any good "action" movies at the moment (probably because they're so far-and-few-between), so you're on your own in that category. this flick does get a 3 out of 10 rating from me for its camp value, and for a pretty-good performance by gabriel byrne as that old debbil satan!
