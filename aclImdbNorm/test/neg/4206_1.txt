ok with this film there are a number of ingredients at work:<br /><br />first put in loads of hillbilly truckers--good ole boys who have secret desire to take law into own hands. second put in evil hillbilly cops controlled by a texas bred outlaw. third put in karate fighting trucker played by chuck norris. fourth put in a chump teenager as norris's nephew captured by evil hillbilly cops. fifth show chuck norris fighting in slow motion.<br /><br />now mix all together and what have you got?<br /><br />you guessed it...one very mediocre movie!
