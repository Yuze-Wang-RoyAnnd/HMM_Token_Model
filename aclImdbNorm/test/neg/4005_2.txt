i think this movie had really bad production value. the lack of acting makes me think they should mark it as an early docudrama. it may have had no money available for its making. i feel bad that it was a ruff ride into the major league for jackie robinson.<br /><br />i believe he was much better than many of the white players of his day. he had to be really great to break the color barrier of the time. no getting around that this was a really bad movie.<br /><br />wish there was more info about its makers. they may have been limited by the quality of actors that were willing to take on the project. maybe no money to get good people.
