matt cvetic is a loyal communist in a pittsburgh steel mill who works to recruit workers into the party, even though this isolates himself from his son, family, and neighbors. what makes this even more difficult is that cvetic is actually an fbi agent posing as a communist in order to obtain information about party activities. the party is trying to create a strike at the mill, whereby the pro-strike movement will lead the workers into a wave of propaganda. cvetic also has to contend with beautiful eve merrick, a party member and teacher at his son's school who finds the fact that cvetic is a double agent. when eve learns the ugly truth about the party's real motives, the reds decide she must be liquidated and cvetic must aid her without endangering himself. the film should have plenty of suspense and double crossing but there is very little in this film but (by today's standards) very cheesy propaganda and little action or thrills. lovejoy is very good in the main role, but even he and the rest of the cast seem listless. few surprises here and how did this film receive a oscar nod for best documentary? rating, 4.
