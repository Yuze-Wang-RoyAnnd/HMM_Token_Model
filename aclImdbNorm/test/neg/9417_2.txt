solo is a poor film - that cannot be ignored. the acting for the most part is very wooden (the only exception is adrien brody's performance as solo's creator bill) and the story is slight enough that you would probably forget it whilst you where watching the film. that said, such films are more about the action than the plot/acting and, as such, live or die by the action set pieces - that after all is the point of such films - to give 14 year-olds something to smile at whilst the adults watch films of actual substance. and even on this solo fails to deliver - what little action there is is poorly done, dull and uninspired. after seeing the trailer for this on television i was hoping for something along the lines of predator with a robot replacing the predaot. instead i got a fairly lifeless action film with a poorly constructed attempt at depth by taking on message that robots can feel too. watch terminator ii or predator instead.. both classics that this film desperately wants to be except it lacks the inspiration or, to be fair, the budget.
