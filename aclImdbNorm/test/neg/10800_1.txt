this crock of doodoo won a award? they must have been desperate for giving out an award for something. this movie reeks of teeny bopper stuff and it made me sick. thankfully i watched it alongside mst3k's mike and the bots so it made it bearable. horrid acting, unsettling mother/daughter moment, silly premise, if you want a bad movie here it is. be warned though watch it with mike and the bots or you will suffer.<br /><br />1 out of 10. i still can't believe it won an award, and the director is defending this *&&^$$#$^&& piece of ^%^%$^$#%@$#@ movie!
