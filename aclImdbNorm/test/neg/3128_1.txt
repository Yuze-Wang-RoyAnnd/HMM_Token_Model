this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen.<br /><br />we are supposed to like and be rooting for an arrogant, know-it-all, trashy bank robber, played by dale robertson, and a coy tease played by the extra-ordinarily beautiful linda darnell in a fire engine red dress. she must have been sewed into that bodice! <br /><br />a senator in the film thinks native americans and whites should try to come to an understanding, the bigots, however, win the day. i could barely sit through the endless dialog of bigotry that issued from the other characters mouths.<br /><br />except for wounded knee and dances with wolves there are few films that give a positive portrayal of american indians, and very few old westerns do. this one is exceptionally bad in that regard.<br /><br />the romance between robertson and darnell set my teeth on edge, as he came swaggering in, forcing a kiss on her, while she plays the old hard to get game.<br /><br />there are scenes that are unintentionally humorous, such as the characters obviously not really riding in or on a stagecoach in several shots.<br /><br />a puzzlingly humorous incident in the storyline is linda darnell's character going to great lengths to purchase tickets for the stagecoach, only to then demand a horse to ride, minutes later, for no apparent reason.<br /><br />another humorous scene is when the stagecoach comes to a screeching halt at the sight of a cowboy hat lying beside the road, and not only that, but then all the passengers pile out for a look-see.<br /><br />1 star.
