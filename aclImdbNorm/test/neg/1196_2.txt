this film was okay, but like most tv series it would of been better if it just made for television. the best and most loved characters only had five minute roles, whilst the three mediocre characters were all the way through the film.<br /><br />unlike most british movies that are based on television series, this film does kick off and it seems to be on to a winner, but the pace suddenly stops when the three mediocre characters are in the real world waiting to capture the three comedians.<br /><br />the film then doesn't go anywhere when hillary in a room with the captured steve, lipp masquerading as steve, and geoff somehow writing himself in to the medieval times. which made me think 'hang on? how come he doesn't need a key to enter in to that world unlike the royston vasey characters? the medieval scene was okay but monty python did it a lot better and of course funnier, with cameos from peter kay and simon pegg, both didn't say anything funny, kay had a line and pegg just sat up on wall looking bored.<br /><br />what also grated me was that they seem to forget what happened in the previous episodes such as hillary escaped to the caribbean in the television in series 2, but in the film he's escaped from prison, and also lipp is a paedophile vampire which wasn't mentioned at all in the movie, which was also quite disturbing when he's left alone looking after the children.<br /><br />there were lots of plot holes and unexplained situations such as how did geoff and the dark one escape from the medieval times back in to royston vasey? like series 3 it started of good but as the film progressed, it slowly went downhill and had a very weak predictable ending.<br /><br />they would of been better off doing what monty python did and remade all their best and classic sketches from series 1-3 and the christmas special, and turned that in to a film which would of re-introduced the characters to a whole new audience, who can't be asked to watch the series or to tight to buy the dvds.<br /><br />best advice is save your money and wait till it's on television..... where it belongs.
