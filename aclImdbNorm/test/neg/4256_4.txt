the production year says it all. the movie is a marauding mess of politically correct leftwing feministic selfappreciating drivel, of a so heavyhanded symbolic variety that comes across as ridiculous today. every scene has the purpose of shedding light on one of the burning issues of society, mainly the role of females in the working community, the role of women vs men, women as sex objects, consumerism, politics, war, etc. every scene is commented upon by the inner dialogue of one of the main actresses, or by turning the scene into a surrealistic joke. i have no reminiscence of any plot, or who the main characters actually were. it is the sort of movie, where consumerism is mocked by having a couple make love in a furniture store sales window while the sales agent delivers his speech, or where a revealing interview of a stage actress turns into a fullblown striptease act, for "of course" the offensive gentlemen of the press is the equal to a raunchy club audience. then we move swiftly on, as we need to see war erupt in a peaceful forest, we need to see multiple inflammatory feministic public speeches being drowned in the (male) blowing of cars horns or rioting crowds, and of course we need to see cinema newsreels of stalin and all the other usual suspects. you get the idea. but all this does not matter at all. the movie is an unsurpassed piece of eyecandy for any (male) ingmar bergman aficionado. a movie boasting leads bibi andersson, harriet andersson and gunnel lindblom at the height of their beauty makes this reviewer surrender completely and just drivel
