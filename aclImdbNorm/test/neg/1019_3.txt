this movie is really bad, there is nothing appealing or worth of commentary in it except for the beautiful settings: chilean landscape. i know i must supply four lines as a commentary for this movie, but the thing is that it is such a bad movie, that i can only say that is actually bad. michael ironside is the only one who saves the money in the film.
