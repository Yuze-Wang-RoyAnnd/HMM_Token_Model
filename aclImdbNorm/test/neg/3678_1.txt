i can't remember the worst film i have watched.total waste of actors and audience time.if you prefer sitting by your tv and think when will be this film over,then this is the right film for you.maybe this film is recorded to make people believe that moscow has some mystique past. but i must say i have not expect anything else from rade serbedzija,but i have expected more from vincent gallo.the film lacks a plot, character,development,denouement.entire movie is about underground tunnels and how they are mystique.i must be fair there is some camera effect but even that is too poor.over and over are the same pictures.total waste of time.
