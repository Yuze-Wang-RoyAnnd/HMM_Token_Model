i saw this film at the new festival in new york. it was by far the worst film there. it's use of uncircumcised full frontal nudity and a wishy-washy script and direction that neither commits to a re-make of 'maurice' nor decides it's a neil labute flick, left me feeling 'why would anyone ruin a perfectly good cast like this?'. it lacks irony and fills the vacuum with sentiment, which causes the times when the movie turns on itself to make you want to wipe your face as your mind and heart search for what could be going on in the film but isn't. i wish the director and editor had re-edited the film because maybe there's more story there that could be released from an otherwise unpleasant experience.
