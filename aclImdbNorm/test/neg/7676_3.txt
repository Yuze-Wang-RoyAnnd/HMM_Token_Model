the real star of the last of the airport films is that big supersonic carrier the french created called the concorde. if you bear in mind that the whole film is dedicated to showing what that needle nosed plane could do in the sky, than the whole film kind of makes sense.<br /><br />but if you're expecting some serious drama here, than by all means take some of the evasive action the concorde shows here when some nasty folks try to shoot her down.<br /><br />susan blakely plays a television news reporter who also happens to be the mistress of military industrial tycoon robert wagner. one of wagner's aides just happens to bring her information on some of wagner's dirty business dealings, selling arms to folks not friendly to the usa. when the source, macon mccalman, is killed in front of her and she's nearly done in by a hit-man whom she escapes from of course she confronts wagner with the information. and of course he denies it. but right before blakely boards the concorde, mccalman's widow kathleen maguire hands her the necessary documents. <br /><br />but on the way to moscow with a stop in paris, wagner and his minions try to put the big bird down. but the fearless crew of alain delon, david warner, and george kennedy is up to all their tricks. it's quite a bag full as you'll see if you want to watch the film.<br /><br />if you're an aviation enthusiast, you absolutely won't care about the plot. it's like the film le mans with steve mcqueen which has a legion of auto racing fans who have made it a cult item. maybe le mans is better at that because they just didn't bother with any kind of story.<br /><br />among the passengers is a pot smoking saxophonist played by jimmie walker, a distraught mother accompanying a new heart for her child, played by cicely tyson and martha raye a woman with a weak bladder who spends the entire trip from washington to paris in the loo. she's actually the best one here.<br /><br />robert wagner must have been psychic though because i'm sure on the strength of this film he got the part of doctor evil's number two in the austin powers series.<br /><br />i'm sure all concerned got a big pay day out of this film, but it seems to have killed the airport saga of movies.
