it's difficult to make it through this movie without choking on your own vomit, to be honest. the shoddy animation doesn't help, as it makes this look like a decades-old video you'd find in morrisons's 99p bin. still, it's better than the abysmal screenplay, which spends about a third of its length on superfluous extras like belle's present day problems, stuff about scrooge's dad, and plenty of charmless fannying around with - choke - two anthropomorphic mice. these bizarre additions eat up screen time at the expense of elements you'd think would be quite important, like dickens's dialogue and key chunks of his plot - the movie buggers up the game of twenty questions, for example, and at times fails to put scenes in the right order. absolutely hopeless.
