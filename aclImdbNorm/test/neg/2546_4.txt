may be spoilers so do not read if you do not want to just like watching the tv news , everything is already happened, a great tsunami looms over a city bay and cut , no more to see, tokay suffers a large earthquake , did anyone see more than the 5 seconds i saw? if you want to make a love story , make a love story but if you want to use a disaster movie title , do please be kind enough to show me the disaster , pd after watching this movie watch jishin retto or any godzilla film to satisfy the part that was willing to see people screaming and buildings collapsing that did not get a chance to do in this movie. don t take me wrong i love disaster movies and i love the original nihon chimbotsu and jishin retto, i even like the latest poseidon , not to much of a story there but a very good and graphic disaster sequence , new nihon chimbotsu looses the point as many times as pearl harbour or the day after tomorrow but at least this two movies do show good disaster sequences, and also enough with the expensive fx that did not show anything , give me fake buildings if you like as long as you do destroy them properly , i know i must sound like a sadistic freak, however i did go to see love actually when i felt like going to see a romantic film , grrrrrrr even kimpachi sensei makes me cry and this movie didn:t . there is also a tv series called napping chimbotsu made in 1975, i have on dvd and it is much better
