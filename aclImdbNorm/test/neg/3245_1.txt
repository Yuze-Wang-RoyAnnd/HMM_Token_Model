if you have seen this movie, then you will know that it is one of the worst bollywood movies ever made. bollywood is known to copy hollywood movies. who would of known that they will copy terminator 2. the difference between both film industries are hollywood spends millions and bollywood spends 100 thousands (average). thats the problem with this film, if you want to make a t2 style movie, then do it properly. the director added a bogus fantasy storyline about a reincarnated snake who finds his long lost girl (in the previous birth) dead by 2 guys, but the blame goes to 10 people. she suddenly reincarnates into a ghost and together they want to kill the 10 people they blame for her death. not to mention, the reincarnated snake guy or villain has some kind of super powers. he can transform into anything, he can fly, disappear, fire power, wind power, you name it, he has it. he even gets bazookered and survives the t1000 style. you are probably wondering how he survives. its best not to ask, and its best not to waste time and money on this movie. its best just to forget this film even came out. i think its a shame to use a big starcast for this outrageous movie with a nonsense storyline.
