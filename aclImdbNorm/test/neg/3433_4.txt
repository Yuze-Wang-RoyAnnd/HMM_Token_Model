i found this movie to be okay.<br /><br />on paper, this movie has everything a person may want! romance, comedy, drama. a bank robbery, a unique cast, great music and storytelling!<br /><br />in reality, this movie ended up being mostly garbage, and i'll tell you why.<br /><br />a) this is my biggest problem: the editing. this movie has by far the worst editing i've ever seen short of local-car-dealership commercials. the editing could've been done better by a deaf parkinson's patient tapping away at imovie with a a dead cat. there are scenes where two characters are talking to each other and you can see their lips moving and the audio/video isn't in sync because its clearly dubbed. why was it dubbed? i don't know! its english dubbing english! the voices were done in a studio elsewhere in certain scenes! could they not find a boom-mic?! they're not expensive; jesus, even i own one! and i don't make films!<br /><br />b) andrew keegan's performance lacked. it really didn't seem like he wanted to be a part of this project, and his acting was the equivalent of a skit performed by d.a.r.e. for schoolchildren. at least john krasinksi showed some enthusiasm.<br /><br />yes, john krasinski is the only reason i rented this flick, and its the only real reason worth watching. he's did a good, witty performance and he was the most three-dimensional character. dean edwards' character was quite thin, as was whats-her-face.<br /><br />final word? if you're a fan of john krasinski, this is worth your time. if not, don't even bother. the editing
