the action was episodic and there was no narrative thread to tie the episodes together and move the story forward. the plot plods along. with few exceptions (e.g., graham greene) the acting was uninspired, and pedestrian at best. the actors seemed to have something on their minds, other than the scene they were in. it is boring to observe a man driving a car through the semi- desert country of this movie's setting, whether he drives poorly or well. such scenes are typical of the level of tension in the video. so there was nothing about this video to engage or draw the observer in, to make him or her care about the characters and the out comes. i am doubly disappointed because i rented this movie based on the reputations of the executive producer (redford) and the writer of the novel on which it was based (hillerman). i note that the jewel box reports that funding is provided by pbs and the corporation for public broadcasting, as well as carlton international. i would hope that this video was as disappointing to them as it was to me and my wife, to the point that they will not fund any more disasters coming from the same source.
