well ok, i've seen wrath of the ninja.<br /><br />it isn't something that i would recommend to people who aren't seriously into japanese fighting movies. this is a sort of japanese fighting ninja movie, with a complex plot. it's about these 3 old ninja schools that had these 3 "swords of sorcery". i saw the subtitled version (not recommended by the way, it's easy to miss something) and i didn't really keep up with it all. it had some good scenes tough, but in general, it wasn't much to my liking.
