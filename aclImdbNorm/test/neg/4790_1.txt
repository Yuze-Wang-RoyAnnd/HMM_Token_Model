other than cop rock and that show where the kid dies from eating a spoiled hamburger he found under the bed, this has consistently been the worst and dumbest show to survive prime time. if not for jason lee's unjustifiable success in film, this show would have never made it out of conception if pitched with a relatively unknown as the lead. <br /><br />the concept is terrible. moron redneck hick spends his lottery winnings to redeem himself with the white trash of his past. is it funny? periodically but not consistently. is it stupid? each and every single episode. <br /><br />i've seen a lot of great shows come then go before their time yet this blunder has survived longer than i ever could have imagined. the dialog is incredibly unfunny as are the episode themes. every episode for someone with an iq over 100 is an absolute struggle. and the icing on the cake? jason lee's annoying voice narrating each episode. if it weren't for the state's southern culture and rednecks of the south, this show wouldn't have an audience.<br /><br />if you're a moron and need a show completely lacking humor yet overflowing with bad taste, bad dialog and dimwit characters failing at life...well then you're probably an actor on this show.
