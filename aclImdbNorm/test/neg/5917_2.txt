in the 1930s, hal roach studios was on top of the comedy world with such stars as laurel and hardy, charley chase and the little rascals. most of these films are exceptional and have withstood the passing of time. however, a lesser-known roach product was the pairing of thelma todd and zasu pitts (later, todd was paired with the equally untalented patsy kelly). try as i might, i just can't stand these pictures--they just aren't funny. plus, unlike laurel and hardy, there was not an ounce of chemistry between todd and her two co-stars. before you just think i am a crank, understand that i have seen and reviewed several hundred roach films as well as many other early comedies, so i am well acquainted with the genre and within the genre, this team is among the worst. part of the reason i think i am right about the team is that as a lower-tier team at roach, they were given all the scripts no one else wanted. if stan or ollie hated a given plot idea, it was often given to todd and pitts/kelly--and usually it showed.<br /><br />in this film, however, the team is at their absolute lowest. it's hard to imagine a comedy with less laughs and a more contrived plot. the film begins with zasu in the jury and thelma as a defense lawyer. as for zasu, she's a completely annoying moron. not the lovable type moron (like stan laurel or lou costello), but just a totally annoying and grating person who is pushy and obnoxious. as for thelma, as usual, she's the rather bland "straight man" and as such has little to do but react to zasu's boorish behavior.<br /><br />the plot involves thelma defending a client who is accused of selling exploding diet pills. considering that the pills are highly dangerous, when the attorney asks zasu to try swallowing one it just seems dumb. and, while they were called "pills", they were more like giant black blobs that were larger than golf balls. swallowing them only seemed contrived and made no sense--even for a low-brow comedy. when they find she has swallowed the pill and it really is explosive, everyone panics and runs about like idiots until the film ends.<br /><br />as i said, i am not a fan of this team. however, even for those who want to like the film, there isn't one legitimate laugh in the entire short! when i talked over this review with my wife (who also saw the movie with me), she thought my score of 2 was overly generous!!
