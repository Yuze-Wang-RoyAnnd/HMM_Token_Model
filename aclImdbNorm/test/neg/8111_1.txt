having loved stephen king's novels and short stories for many years, i, like most reviewers, have been consistently disappointed in the adaptations to film from his printed works. a few notable exceptions are "stand by me" from "the body", "carrie" from the novel of the same name, and "the shawshank redemption" from "rita heyworth and shawshank redemption". this movie is by far the worst thing that has ever been produced with stephen king's name attached to it in any way. it is no surprise that mr. king has pretty much disavowed any connection with it. i feel the thing that most offended me about this poorly acted, cheaply filmed, hideously directed piece of garbage is that they had the audacity to completely change the ending don't waste your time or money on this amazing bow-wow of a movie!!
