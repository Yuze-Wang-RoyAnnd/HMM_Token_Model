now really can u call that a movie. i knew some of the movies that japanese people do are good for nothing but this bad? i mean com'om i fell a sleep three times at this movie. no horror at all, some tiny percent (0.2-0.5) comedy. action let's just admit that it has some but the scenes are poorly filmed, the actors are pathetic. none of the actors did a good job in it's own role. the were not convincing. the script is also awful. i mean this movie may be great, really, but for the 60's(in not 100% sure.) i recommend not to see it, unless you want to get so bored as i did. i can't quite figure hot this movie got it's rating. it's over, over, over rated!!!. this is a personal opinion of course. i don want to offend anyone but who could like this crap? so i hope this helps someone not to loose some time "enjoying" this movie. nevertheless it's your choice!
