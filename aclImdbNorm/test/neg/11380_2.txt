first of all, i personally adore demons and demons 2, i saw them although it was hard to find good horrors without good official movie distributing here in russia when i was a kid, and that is an unchangeable part of my boyhood. then i heard nothing about mr bava. then i saw his ghost son. well, it is certainly not a good coming back! why was the leading character, whom we never really knew to at least like him, in accident in the middle of an empty road? why do african servants say so dumb and stupid things about human soul? why is the plot so primitive? haven't we seen enough ghosts for 100 years of movie production? it is clear that lamberto bava has nothing to show us so far. it is a shame.
