you the living? ok i think i am an intelligent, educated, liberal and really into films. i really like and have a great sense of humour. i was under the impression this was a bleakly painful comedy. they got paid for making this, petrol was used, electricity burnt, food was consumed, sets built........why? i blame the current state of the world on this film and all those people associated with it, i will even include us the viewing public. we are all to blame and deserve whatever coming. its not funny, not much happens, everyone it seems is bored or boring. there are no conversations, communication is minimal. there is no plot as far as i am aware. i have in fact just lost 89 point something minutes of my life. i will never ever get that time back. the only message i have come away with is perhaps life is too short to sit around watching movies of people doing not much......and then you die!
