jessica is a young, virginal and very innocent girl who lives with her aunt on a remote ranch. jessica is also a powerful psychic, capable of dowsing, retro-cognition, precognition and esp. when young and handsome gordon hawthorne comes to visit, he is instantly skeptical of jessica's powers...until her skills uncover a lost wristwatch and unearth an ancient treasure chest. however, the treasure chest holds the severed head of a centuries dead satanist named gideon drew, whose powers are far stronger than jessica's. despite her warnings of the evil in their midst, drew manages to mentally enslave everyone unfortunate to make eye contact with him. but drew wants jessica most of all. he needs her dowsing skills to unearth his body, so that he can rise from the dead and rule over the human race. will jessica's powerful fleur de lis, combined with gordon's love, ward the ancient evil off before it can destroy them all?<br /><br />this isn't a very interesting movie. it certainly could have been - the basic story is interesting and imaginative, but the acting is leaden and the whole thing moves much too slowly to hold interest. jessica is also too innocent - almost annoyingly so, and gordon, her love interest, is wooden, stiff and totally emotionless. none of the characters are very likable, and the low budget is painfully obvious. a rushed ending also doesn't help matters. avoid, unless it's the mst3k version.
