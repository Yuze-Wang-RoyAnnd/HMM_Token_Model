reba is a very dumb show. you can predict pretty much anything that's about to happen. barbra jean is just too stupid. it's like she's not even a character. a show like this should at least have someone who resembles a real-life person. i guess barbra jean represents a retarded person. keira or whatever her name is, reba, brock, they're all stupid! keira is like the smartest person on the show, and she's still stupid. everyone is stupid! that's my opinion on reba. since i have said all i can say about this show, i'll just take up the next few lines of text by saying what i am currently saying right now and do it until there's 10 lines. there. reba gets 2/10.
