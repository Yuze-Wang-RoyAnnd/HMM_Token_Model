the midnight hour aka: tell me no lies (as found in some video stores) can be judged in two different ways. one by it's merritt as a movie, complete with a plot (no holes), good story and believable conclusion and the other is by the skin flick it is trying to be. this is certainly no more than a b-movie skin flick, whose sole purpose is to show every girl in the movie in an overly long sex scene at least once.<br /><br />if you try to rate this as a regular movie, then this is bottom of the line drivel. huge plot holes ruin whatever storyline it has going for it. for instance, if a co-worker is killed, would you call the police or head home and hit the hot tub? judging this movie by it's skin content, it's watchable... barely. the girls, for the most part, are all beautiful but quite obviously enhanced. the sex scenes were all long and overdone, though, and that made it's only redeeming quality a little boring.<br /><br />amber smith could probably be a decent actress if she wanted. she was not as horrible as you could imagine or maybe next to the rest of the cast, she seemed a lot better than she was.<br /><br />zoe anderson, who played detective arraya, should not even be watching a movie, much less acting in one. she looked good though, so we know why she was there.<br /><br />overall, i would not really recommend this to anyone. even if you're looking for a good skin flick, there are much better one's out there. i rate this 4 out of 10
