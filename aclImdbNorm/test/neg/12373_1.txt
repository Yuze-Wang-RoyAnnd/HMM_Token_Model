this is a truly terrible sci-fi/horror film from 1957. in fact, despite ed wood, jr.and his dreadful films getting a lot of publicity, this turkey is every bit as bad as the worst of wood. now the acting is a bit better than you'd find in the wood epics (such as plan 9 and bride of the monster), but the special effects managed to be significantly worse than wood's! however, bad movie aficionados will be happy to hear that it's so bad that it's still excellent viewing. like a wood film, it's great to watch this crap-fest and laugh along with your friends.<br /><br />the film begins with a scientist flying about doing some testing in his jet. however, out of nowhere, a ufo streaks by and his report of this over the radio triggers a panic by the air force. however, later, they realized that the ufo didn't appear on the radio and they think the scientist is a nut! but, when soon after this planes start disappearing all over, they realize there must be something to his sighting.<br /><br />so far, the film isn't great but it's watchable. however, by the time the horrible flying monster appears, you know you're watching a turkey. first, through horrid use of stock film and crappy models, airplanes keep changing mid-flight. some may not be bothered by this, but with airplane lovers like me, seeing an f-80 turning into an f-86 to an f-102 fighter plane made me crazy--especially since the planes look nothing like each other. second, through "clever" cinematography, all you really see of the monster is a ball of fuzz for half the film! this is frustrating and you hope that when you finally do see it clearly, it will be worth the wait. well, no such luck!! the "monster" looks less realistic or scary than the duck from groucho's "you bet your life" tv show!! in fact, it's significantly less realistic than any of the japanese giant monsters!! in fact, big bird from "sesame street" is even a bit scarier and realistic!!! it's just god-awful in every way and might just be the dumbest movie monster in history--about as bad (or worse) as the monsters in robot monster or teenagers from outer space!!! the bottom line is that this is an absolutely dreadful film that sane people won't like. bad film fans like me (who are a crazy bunch) will probably love it! all others...be afraid,....be very afraid!!<br /><br />fyi--you might notice that some clips in this film are from other sci-fi movies!! i am positive the crashing washington monument scene was stolen from earth vs. the flying saucers but i also saw a couple other scenes that i swear are from other films. what a hack job!
