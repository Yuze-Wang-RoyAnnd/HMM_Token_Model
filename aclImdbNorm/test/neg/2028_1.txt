the wind. easily one of the worst films ever made. the only good that comes from this kind of pointless drivel, is the fact that seeing films like this get distribution makes indy horror filmmakers like me confident that my upcoming feature will make the cut too. i mean, if this represents the market for indy horror, i could make a fortune videotaping myself taking out the garbage for 83 minutes. <br /><br />a complete list of what this film lacks would take way too long to write out. but, the highlites are: no story, terrible acting, awful cinematography, and virtually no editing. that last one bothered me the most. as an editor myself, this film drove me absolutely crazy because it had almost no editing at all. every scene was shot in a master. they had absolutely no coverage at all. for anyone who doesn't know..."coverage" is shooting a scene from multiple angles to have cutting options when editing to make for a desirable viewing experience. yeah, this movie had none of that. i'm talking about even the simplest of scenes. example: an ordinary conversation scene between two people sitting at a table would typically start out with a master establishing who's in the scene and where they are. then, as the conversation goes on, you would cut back and forth to over-the-shoulder shots as the conversation continues. you may even throw in a cutaway shot or two of something on the table, or in someone's hand. anything. this is "film 101" stuff guys. it seems as though these people had no idea this is how films work. every shot was a camera lock-down. no movement, no cutting, no nothing. if i was teaching a course in filmmaking, this would be the visual aid for my "what not to do" lesson.<br /><br />in closing, don't waste your time folks. the only amazing this about this film is that it ever scored distribution at all.<br /><br /> <br /><br />
