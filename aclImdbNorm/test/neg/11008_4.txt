although i found the acting excellent, and the cinematography beautiful, i was extremely disappointed with the adaptation.<br /><br />one of the significant portions of the novella is the fact that ethan and mattie decide to kill themselves, rather than go on. this is never presented in the movie, they show it as if it were a sledding accident.<br /><br />the character changes in mattie and zenna are almost non-existent. while in the novella they almost change places, at the end of this adaptation it appears as if they are both invalids.<br /><br />lastly that mattie and ethan consummate their relationship fully nearly destroys the power and poignancy of the finale.<br /><br />the change of the narrator being a preacher was one effective change.<br /><br />neeson and arquette are superb in their portrayals. joan allen was also wonderful, however her character was much watered down from whartons novella.<br /><br />i do not expect films to faithfully portray novels, but this one went to far and in the process nearly destroyed the story.<br /><br />overall, i would not recommend watching this film unless you have read the book as you will come away confused and disappointed.
