this straight to video cheap flick is based on a true story. i don't doubt it. doesn't mean it's particularly interesting (unless you are one of the main characters who actually lived though this experience). a young woman named angela buys a great, big old country home really really cheap. well, as we all know from watching horror movies, when you buy a big house cheap it usually means it's haunted in some way, shape or form. in fact, the second the house is being handed over to angela the wise guy kid who lived in the house up to now takes a moment to "introduce" angela to one of the ghosts! nice guy, huh? angela gets in touch with a psychic and a paranormal expert and tells them that her house is haunted and invites them to come over and see the ghosts for themselves. they come to a party and sure enough there are ghosts walking around, sitting on the couch, hanging in the garage and trying to seduce people in the bathroom. a few friends sleep over the night of the party, see the ghosts and vow never to come back in the house again. (check out the girl who deadpans "i'm so scared. i'm so scared." totally emotionless. if she was so scared why didn't she get up, turn the knob and leave?!) the ghosts don't really do anything menacing aside from show up (and there is no blurriness or aura about them. they look just like regular people). they steal celery from the kitchen, move chairs around a la poltergeist and one bisexual female ghost seduces angela, who, get this, doesn't seem to mind! this scene plays like the kind of soft-core porn you see on the spice channel. (ummm...not that i'd know! hahaha). the actresses aren't your typical porn stars though. they should hit the beach and the gym more. when angela'ss not making love to the dead she gets mad at them and stands alone in a room screaming "why won't you leave?! this is my house! get out!" they don't leave. i couldn't help but think of all the times i've heard psychic sylvia brown on tv saying that if you have a ghost in your house you should calmly rationalize with the ghost and say "look, you're dead. it's time to cross over to the other side. in other words, get out!" according to sylvia brown, as long as your not hostile and nasty about it, they'll leave! this movie looks like it cost about $50 to make. it has a really cheap feel, and bad acting. i could have made this movie with 5 friends and a camcorder.
