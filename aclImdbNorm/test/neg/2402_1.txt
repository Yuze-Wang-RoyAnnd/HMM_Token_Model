spoiler - this film gives away plot points and discusses the ending. i hated this film - mostly for political reasons, but also for moral and aesthetic reasons. politically, this film glorified war and military technology - blowing things up real good. we are led to cheer as the music swells and the afghans use our weapons to blow the ruskies to bits. and no u.s. soldiers put their lives on the line - so it's a fun war. aesthetically, there isn't a touch of real human emotion in the film, just smug, privileged people being sarcastic, feeling superior, and doing whatever they want regardless of the consequences. and speaking of consequences, the film only makes a few small hits at what the arming of the afghans actually led to. i had read an earlier draft of this script, and it ended on 9/11 - with charlie wilson realizing that things had gone horribly wrong. but that wouldn't leave the audience feeling good. this is a feel good movie about killing ruskies. and it made me sick.
