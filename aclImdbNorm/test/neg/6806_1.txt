in order to enjoy 'fur - an imaginary portrait of diane arbus,' stephen shainberg needs the viewer to suspend all reality and prior knowledge of the american photographer, diane arbus. paradoxically, it's the very use of diane arbus' name and knowledge to her life and work, that sets this film up to fail on a grand scale.<br /><br />what becomes apparent quite early on with the casting of the beautiful waspish and glamorous nicole kidman as the anti-glamorous jewish diane arbus, is that shainberg didn't get arbus or what her work was about (unsentimental realism) and seems only attracted to arbus on a superficial level through her photographs of circus freaks.<br /><br />what follows is a kind of pretty and trivial beauty & the beast fantasy biopic with robert downey jr as kidman's hairy fictional love interest. however, it's not the banality of the story that is the main flaw in this film, but the director's misogynistic stance that diane arbus, one of the art world's most singular and original woman photographers, was incapable of forming her own ideas about her work. while his previous film 'secretary' was a study of female masochism, his continued portrayal of the female as submissive spoils this film completely - and flys in the face of the real life diane arbus' courage, tenacity and fearlessness in single-handedly exploring the often shady world of outsiders.<br /><br />imagine an imaginary biopic on pop star madonna's life with guy richie as her svengali, the man behind her career, and you'll get a feel of how seriously flawed and imaginary this film is: it can only work if you have absolutely no knowledge of the subject, or just choose to ignore all the facts.<br /><br />it's a shame because once you remove all reference to diane arbus, this film could have stood up on its own as an interesting study on fetishism and a good companion piece to secretary. 4/10
