i am finding that i get less and less excited about disney's sequels to movies. yes, i do understand that the budget for the direct to video movies are not the same, but these movies don't even try. some examples are hunchback ii and tarzan and jane. if anyone has seen the previews for stitch-the movie, you will see my point. but i digress, this movie reaffirms my point. the animation is sloppy, the story lines resemble saturday morning cartoons, and not all of the original voices are there. i was very disappointed not to hear michael j. fox's voice. it was so glaringly obvious that the person doing milo's voice was trying to sound like fox, but didn't come close to succeeding. <br /><br />if it says anything, my children ages 10 and 6 didn't even sit through the whole movie.
