sending the critters to space does seem like an entertaining idea, but was there really any need for a third film much less this fourth one? a film with brad dourif can't be all bad, can it? well, maybe in this case. this cheap sci-fi effort stars returning lovable klutz charlie(the reliable don keith opper) who is about to eradicate the last two remaining eggs of the critters' species when ugh(terrence mann)tells him that he's about to break some sort of trans-galactic endangered species law. so at ugh's request, charlie places the two eggs in special holders inside a space pod. unfortunately for charlie, the damn thing takes off for space and he's trapped inside. the smoke under his feet places him into hibernation stasis and he awakes 53 years later inside a decrepit<br /><br />space station as captain rick, with fat cigar, rude alcoholic malevolence, and greedy to the core is blasting open the space pod trying to see what possible novelties are inside for possible sale or trade. rick, unbeknown-est to him, lets out the two critters who feast on his flesh. you see rick and his crew found the space pod drifting and had intense dollar signs flashing in their eyes so they dock it. ugh reports to them(now in a fine, prominent position as counselor)that money can be made if they dock at a space station under the terracor organization. once the crew dock, they find that this station is in ruin with many corridors in bad condition, but what's worse is the station computer angela. angela is a real thorn in the side to the crew because she has been left unrepaired without proper maintenance for some time. it takes some little tricks to get doors to open and close not to mention the elevators and computers. brad dourif is al bert, pretty much the impresario of computer functions(..and is pretty much the real leader of the group for he is the most level-headed and intelligent). he seems to be a father-figure to ethan(paul witthorne)who just wants to make it to earth to find his father..this story though doesn't necessarily reach it's zenith. bernie(eric dare)is primarily in the film to be a druggie victim for the critters to munch on. in the film, charlie, after one critter enters rick's mouth and eats away at his throat{yuk}, becomes the crew's guide in understanding what they are fighting against. the film has some elements i found rather confusing{or for a better word, ridiculous)..the two critters grow in size quickly, are somehow able to coordinate a ship for earth, not to mention grow themselves to massive size in this laboratory in the space station. the crew are able to tap into a log from a dr. mccormick{anne ramsay, whose badge is found in a coat thrown to the side for which ethan discovers her access card}which shows signs that terracor was looking into creating a species to exterminate worlds and people. knowing this bothers al bert who wishes to leave angela and her bleeding station for greener pastures. things don't work out that way because well-meaning charlie(thanks in part to al bert's "ancient" colt .45)kills a critter which had got on board, but in firing several bullets hits major guidance systems in the ship. so many repairs on in order, but they halt them when ugh and his storm troopers dock at angela and prove they are not what charlie thought they'd be. ugh is a changed man and charlie realizes that he is completely evil and his mission is to preserve the crites for purposes of a cruel nature(representation of corrupt corporate governmental types?). this betrayal is what changes charlie..he has perhaps grown up a bit(a wee bit)and now understands that some people just change for the worse. charlie and ugh will come to a face-off over those critters..will the crew be able to escape a space station which has set auto-destruct? this film really doesn't exploit the critters as much as the other three films. i believe we can clearly see this as the true end to the franchise. the first film was a hoot..a really entertaining romp. but, by the time this sequel cam around, the critters just wore out their welcome. the cast, however, do give the film a boost. the critters do get to feed a bit, but their plans of global domination is under-developed. their role in the film isn't established to the greatest heights. i said to myself,you have this enormous space station with unfortunates trapped on board.. could you not take this idea and run with it? sadly, they don't.
