this movie was trying to something, but failed miserably. all the attempts at suspense were cheap, and there were so many tired gimmicks and plot holes i ended up laughing and making fun of it the whole way through. at least i was entertained. <br /><br />the ghosts are attempting to warn the family, so why do they attack the girl, whose name i didn't care to remember. and what was with the black and white at the beginning? i know what they were trying to do, but they fell far short. and where the heck did that guy (john corbett's character) come from? he just waltzes in from no where in a vast field. and why did he suddenly lose it again when the ravens came? and if the ravens were a manifestation of the spirits of his family, then why did they attack him if it would make him try to kill the family? makes no sense. so many things in this movie just don't make sense, and the acting ain't too pretty on the part of the main girl character. it's not terrible, just a little like her kiddy movie days. <br /><br />so all in all this movie wasn't brilliant, but i had a good time ripping at it, and sometimes that's all a horror movie needs to do. rent for entertainment not quality.
