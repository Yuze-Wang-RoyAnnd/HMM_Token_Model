this is a voice of a person, who just finished watching the second season of rome, almost at one go, and grabbed the opportunity to see "what happened next" - this film conveniently takes off where rome ends. if you find rome an abomination, a foul mouthed screw-fest of little historical accuracy, then you might enjoy imperium: augustus. but, if you feel rome is a good thing, if you enjoy the complicated intrigue, the ambiance of decadence and the work of the actors, then imperium will obviously appear to you as an overly timid, superfluous and tedious soap opera with not many redeeming factors.<br /><br />there are some actors who for my taste look somewhat better than these in rome. i especially disliked rome's image of cleopatra as a drug-soaked sex addict. there must have been a great deal of strength and dignity in that woman, and the actress in imperium suits the part much better. o'toole and rampling are good, and so are some others. but then... if you have come to know - and love - atia as the super cool bitch, you'll find the depiction of her in imperium - as a tear-jerking mother goose in an apron - absolutely ridiculous. there are supposed to be some bitchy characters in imperium, but these actresses rely heavily upon staring at the men and nothing much more. you'll find no interesting female characters in this epic. there's also the painfully comic maecenas, whom we see as a screeching drag queen, even though there is little historical evidence that he was such (he's once referred to as "being effeminate in his pleasures" in the annals).<br /><br />the interiors are rather meager and rely on clich'es upon clich'es. cleopatra's big hall looks like something out of a computer game or a children's play room in an egyptian theme park. there's a looooooooot of really poor 3d graphics, not up to 2003 standards.<br /><br />the action is presented as a series of flashbacks the aged augustus is reliving. so we get a quick look at some historical events, some of which are presented well, whereas some are not. an disproportional amount of time is wasted to show livia as the "eternal flame" of augustus. this affair doesn't sizzle for even a moment, the dialog is superlame and everything is seasoned with tacky tear-inducing musical score. whatever amount of reality the show aims to capture, every last shred of it is destroyed by the dry synchronized dubbing (most of the actors are non english speakers).<br /><br />everything is lukewarm in this epic. true, there are more historical accuracies than in rome, but dramatically speaking, it's plain boring. the characters lack depth and the dialog sharpness. camera-work is often reduced to static shots, and lighting offers nothing to please your eye.<br /><br />there's really no-one to love and no-one to hate in imperium. regardless of whether you liked or disliked rome, there are much better films and miniseries around. ancient rome: the rise and fall of an empire would be one thing i recommend.
