ok, this is one strange film! fans of ed wood jr. will appreciate the "inventive" techniques director george barry utilizes, like stock footage and cheesy voice overs. he can make a crack in the wall into a plot device! there is more humor than horror here, but i found it an uneven blend. you will be laughing and crying, and probably wondering why you got your hands on this. barry explains in the introduction that filming began on this movie in 1972, and was completed in 1977, at a cost of $10,000. that's 59 months and $9,900 too much! if you like your cheese on the campy side, with vintage '70s "gore", you might find this an irresistible and freaky snack.
