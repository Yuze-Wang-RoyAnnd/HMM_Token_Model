highly flawed but just about watchable `comedy' that runs like a farrelly brothers reject. the most criminal thing about it though is the casting. i couldn't for one minute believe jerry o connell and jake busey in the role of superstuds, who could pull any woman at the drop of a hat, nor could i believe (the very beautiful) shannon elizabeth as a streetwise tough cop!. story is predictable but does manage to raise a titter on a few occasions, although, the `gross out', meant to be `shock comic' scenes, (one involving an amputated testicle, and another set in a sperm bank) are just plain awful. if this film is on tv then its probably worth watching if you are extremely bored, but please don't waste your money renting it!!
