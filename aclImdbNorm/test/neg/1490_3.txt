found an old vhs version of this film in my parents house so i thought i'd give it a go. right from the start i wasn't expecting much from this film and i'm glad for that because overall the film was no good.<br /><br />the acting overall was very poor, even for a nicolas cage movie. one scene with a radio controller stands out as being so pitiful that i found it hilarious that this scene wasn't cut. the first 30 minutes of the film had almost no developed plot and i didn't know what was going on.<br /><br />the story itself had the possibility of being decent but either the director was just bad or was trying too hard to put his own unique touch on the style of the film. i managed to watch the whole thing but i won't likely ever see this film again.
