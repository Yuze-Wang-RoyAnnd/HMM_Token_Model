being one of the founding fathers of my regions monkey movie club(this also includes apes/chimps and orangutans) i am reviewing this film from a monkey movie standpoint. afterall it is a whole summer of monkeys, 100+ days for monkeys to do what they do best, cause mischief, shenanigans, hyjinx, solve human problems and teach us about ourselves.<br /><br />the story is simple enough. in short poor boy needs money for stuff he wants. luckily there's a few monkeys(chimpanzees) that have a bounty on their head that would get boba fett or dog's(duane chapman) blood flowing. as the boy tries to catch the monkeys he learns about himself, his family, his grandpa, the local weirdo, flirts with a girl twice his age and learns the beast way to deal with bullies is to have someone point a shotgun at them.<br /><br />there within lies the problem. so much focus is put on the boy that the chimps just don't get the screen time they deserve. the chimps are not as talented as the chimp(s) that play jack from the m_p trilogy or the legendary orangutans that play dunstin or clyde(1 or 2). so don't watch this movie expecting to find the next big thing in the chimp genre. the chimps hit some sweet flips which is what the film needed more of. there is an epic scene of the chimps breaking into the poor families house and destroys all the things they worked so hard for. serious monkey movie enthusiasts will want to rent the film for this scene alone.<br /><br />so in closing this movie is not for the serious monkey movie enthusiast. i wouldn't recommend this movie to families as it encourages a childs rebellion against their parents. i can only recommend this film as a rental for hardcore monkey loving adults and well supervised children.
