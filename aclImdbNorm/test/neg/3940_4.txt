stay alive is a bland horror movie about a video game that kills people the same way they die inside the game. the friends that play this game soon figure this out, and then realise they must defeat the blood countess from the video game or accept their fates. we've had video tapes in the ring, a deadly website in feardotcom. now it's onto video games. stay alive does some things well; the character development is quite a bit deeper than it usually would be in a horror movie. we really see into some of the characters feelings and past and get to know them all quite well, so the audience may gain some emotions for them. the film is also very suspenseful. tense, unnerving moments are frequently played through the film, accompanied by unsettling, creepy music. there are plenty of jumps and jolts for the viewer. this can be ideal once or twice, but these false scares that hollywood seems to enjoy overplaying in horror films nowadays, wears thin in stay alive. the camera will tend to provide sharp angles or quick flashes in order to give viewers a very quick glimpse of a demon or witch, and try to scare them with this sudden burst on the screen. why? the gore is obviously very weak because of the film's certificate. the script to stay alive is very cheesy and quite laughable, and the characters tend to play it too melodramatically and confusingly. also, clich'es come in from every direction, for instance people wandering around on their own in search of a strange noise or if they have spotted a figure in the dark, they will go and investigate it. however the computer graphics used for the video game segments are rather impressive and look colourful and sharp, working well with the other parts of the film. but overall, there is just not enough to hold out on with this film. stretching at just over a hundred minutes, it won't be a battle to stay alive, but rather, stay awake.
