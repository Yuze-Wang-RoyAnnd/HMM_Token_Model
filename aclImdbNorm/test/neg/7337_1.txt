is it just me or the fact that the evil racing team is japanese and that their arrogant star racer is german seem a little over the top? maybe that is how it is on the international racing circuit but if all america had representing them are chumps like cody and his mechanic chris (peter berg, who must have been still learning how to act) then i would be rooting for another country. formula movies can be good but the characters have to be likeable and no one meets that criteria in this movie. to put it succinctly - a very bad movie.
