this movie was so bad if anyone out their who starred in the movie are reading this including the director,i hate you! lol,that blonde woman, who was running away screaming through the forest.at least cry rather than scream and keep doing the dodgy heavy breathing!! and oh dear god, if it was the director who sorted out the cameras on this one, then go back to a normal job. no one wants to be watching some scared woman's chin throughout it.damn, don't even think about renting/buying or even having a copy of this within 100 metre radius of your house since it can be harmful to,people who like good movies...when i got home, i thought id rented a pron movie by the acting and style of the camera.
