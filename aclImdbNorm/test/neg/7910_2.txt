after a humiliating experience on an airplane, nashawn wade (kevin hart) sues the airline and uses the money he wins to start up his own full-service airline. what makes his different is that it has sexy stewardesses, an on board dance club and no less than captain snoop dogg in the cockpit.<br /><br />soul plane is a very racist comedy except it is only occasionally funny. soul plane has been described as an "urban" version of airplane. the problem is that soul plane doesn't even come close to achieving the laughs of airplane. the jokes in soul pane are too offensive and they are mostly unoriginal. i would be lying if i said i didn't laugh since there were some funny moments. however, i was expecting more and i left the theater disappointed.<br /><br />i would compare soul plane to airplane 2. the latter was just a rehash of the first film while the former is just a rehash of outdated, crude jokes. there is really no creativity behind the movie and there are only a few fun spots. however, i don't think soul plane is "bottom 100" bad. right now, the movie is ranked at number 82 and that's a little harsh. i'm not saying this is a good movie but it isn't a terrible on either. the running time is only 86 minutes long so it isn't too much of a pain to watch. for stupid comedies, you can do a lot worse.<br /><br />no one in the cast is very good but they all seem to be having fun and this helps. kevin hart was very annoying as nashawn. he had a few funny lines but he is a very poor leading man. snoop dogg, who was mildly funny in starsky and hutch, completely flunks here. tom arnold was actually tolerable and that was the film's biggest surprise. the most annoying person in the movie was ryan pinkston. he was not funny at all and he will never be funny. the funniest cast members were missi pyle and mo'nique. they gave the best lines and they made me laugh the most. in the end, soul plane may fit the bill if you're looking for a stupid comedy but it would probably be better if you just skip the film. rating 4/10
