i hated the first movie is really boring and we only get see the octopus at the end. <br /><br />the plot dead bodies are being found in the new york harbor. the police have no clues nor suspects until nick and his colleague realize the killer is a giant octopus. everybody, especially the police captain, refuses to believe nick's story, and soon the harbor will be filled with boats for the 4th of july celebrations...<br /><br />in this movie we get to see more of the giant octopus and special effects for this movie are really good for it's time.<br /><br />the acting is this movie not bad but not great too but okay and watch able. <br /><br />the are some really cheese scenes to movie but if can get past that, you should enjoy the rest of movie. <br /><br />5/10
