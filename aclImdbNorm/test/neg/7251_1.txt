although my exposure to world cultures is limited, i do try. this was a film that i tried and hated. worst of all, after hearing so many people decry the shallowness of typical hollywood fare and its stereotypical caricatures, i saw characters too outrageous for "eastenders" being paraded as realistic.<br /><br />clint wants out of the drug life and to do this he aspires to be a waiter. aim high, i always say. brad dorif, or a faxed photo of him, or quite possibly a curly wig on a stick, it was hard to tell, offers to hire clint if he gets a pair of shoes.<br /><br />clint, and a huge entourage, apparently wander the whole of england trying to get him some shoes. eventually, they end up at a suburban home. whose isn't clear. mum helps a girl shoot up. oh, now there's some realism for you! mrs. brady may have been a ridiculous stereotype of american housewives, but she never helped marsha tie off and find a vein. good god! dad comes home and sings some elvis tunes and then chases the kids away.<br /><br />why didn't clint borrow some money and buy shoes at a second hand store? why didn't he go to a church and ask a kindly nun for some help? why didn't he hang out in front of a shoe store and panhandle? i just don't know! none of these things seemed to be beneath him. benevolent groups, like goodwill and the salvation army have stores to help people. i know people who work there! if someone with no money showed up and needed shoes, the staff would give the person some shoes. maybe not prada or gucci, but some form of foot covering. not many of these groups hand out cell phones to the underprivileged, but shoes are usually no problem. what a dumb concept. the world, or at least the western part of it, simply isn't that cruel. in england, maybe it's from "the queen's royal charity" rather than goodwill, but people who need shoes do get them.<br /><br />aside from the quest for shoes, there was no discernable plot to get in the way of the action. not that it made the movie any quicker or more bearable, mind you. despite checking the tape jacket several times, i was not watching the 20-hour extended version, it only seemed that way.<br /><br />did clint get his shoes? did the cardboard cutout of brad dourif hire him at the restaurant? did i ever watch anything else foreign ever again?<br /><br />[spoiler] yes, yes, and yes.<br /><br />as for the fate of this particular film, i decided to end it all. i took out my s&w .45 and shot a half-inch hole through the cassette. blammo! (i made sure to rewind it first.) i put it back in the tape sleeve, returned it to the rental store, and amazingly no one ever called to ask about it!!! meaning, of course, that no one else rented it for at least the remaining three years i lived in that city. others knew something that i didn't. live and learn.<br /><br />btw, if you rent something you've never seen before and someone has actually put a bullet through it, take it as a sign. and if you work at the kroger video department, i'm just kidding.<br /><br />footnote: this classic has yet to see the light of day on dvd, for which we should be eternally thankful to the digital gods.
