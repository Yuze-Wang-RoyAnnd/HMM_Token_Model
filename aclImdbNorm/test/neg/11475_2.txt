this film is not one of those films so bad you get annoyed and mad because it seems to be so up its own arse and yet it completely not funny. it's just that there is nothing of interest in this film. there are no real jokes that make you amused, you just watch for 80 minutes, then turn it off. i bought this on very budget dvd and i'm glad because it's not worth much. this isn't even one of those films that's so bad you can watch it with friends when getting drunk/high and have a good giggle. i didn't hate it like i hate some films, but it is rather boring, and not worth investing any time in.<br /><br />the only people who voted 10 on the votes for this film must have been connected to it somehow because i cannot imagine anyone actually liking this film other than small children passing time
