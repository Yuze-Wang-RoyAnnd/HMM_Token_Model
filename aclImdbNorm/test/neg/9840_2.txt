"nicodemus" is almost a copy of "red" in the odd behavior sense, but this episode focuses on other people in clark kent's unpredictable life. when a poisonous flower finds it's way into smallville jonathan kent is the first to be effected by it. the flower causes people to reverse their behavior and when it effects jonathan, he becomes short tempered and violent, however clark manages to stop him from doing anything rash until his father finally passes out. okay. so far, so good. next up is lana. the episode was good up to that point, for the flower causes her to attempt seducing clark. at the last moment, he refuses her but the damage has already been done. this episode causes the wrong impressions and isn't suitable for people under the age of twenty, due to it's adult content. the first part was good, the last part (focusing on the effect the flower has on pete) was good, but the middle that was all about lana's alternate personality, was most defiantly not, and that ruined what could have been a brilliant episode. i give this episode two.
