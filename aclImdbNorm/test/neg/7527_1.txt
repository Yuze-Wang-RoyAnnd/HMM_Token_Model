the 2002 version of "the time machine" is just the latest in a string of terribly disappointing hollywood remakes that fall flat on their face despite extravagant special effects. <br /><br />what a lousy, uninspired bland story, with no imagination. why so totally rewrite such a wonderful sci-fi classic? are today's movie audiences too hip for the h.g. wells writing largely as is? the 1960 george pal version told a much more endearing story, even with clunky low-budget effects, beach-party looking eloi, and morlocks that looked like smurfs on steroids.<br /><br />the 2002 version must have h.g wells turning in his grave:<br /><br />1. the idea that the time traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a time paradox is an old sci-fi clich'e. this totally distracts from the love affair with mara (what happened to weena?!) that made the 1960 version so endearing. this sets an unfortunate and distractive tone early on that makes the whole movie dour. if guy pearce's character was so brilliant either he or his buddy einstein would have realized the time paradox dilemma
