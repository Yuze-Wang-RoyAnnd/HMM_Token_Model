i found myself getting increasingly angry as this movie progressed.<br /><br />basically, dr. crawford (dennis hopper) has predicted a meteor will hit the earth. the "powers that be" don't believe him so he sets about building a survival shelter inside a mountain for a small collection of people.<br /><br />jake lowe (peter onorati) is a down on his luck reporter for a trashy tabloid who gets a tip from a friend he thought was dead that something is going on in the mountains. he sets out to investigate.<br /><br />while trying to get into the secret survival shelter jake spends a great deal of time shooting people to death or beating them to within an inch of their lives. he spends the rest of his time bitching at dr. crawford about who gave the doc the right to decide which people should get to survive the meteor.<br /><br />i found myself wishing jake would do the future a big favor and turn a gun on himself.<br /><br />don't waste your time on this turkey.
