i rented this type of "soft core" before, but i can honestly say, i wasn't expecting this to be in the same type as "rod steele: you only live until you die"--which was both sexy and funny. it had a good script, a sincere leading man, and a sense of purpose. it also has gabriella hall who is hot. the reason why i didn't expect this movie, was because the box was missing the "must be 18 to rent" sticker. i was looking for more "cheese" and less "cheesecake."<br /><br />first of all, i think movies shouldn't be allowed to start with "actors" rehearsing for a part at a talent agency (or wherever "actors" rehearse). in this movies seeing the "actors" rehearsing highlights the lack of preparation that went into acting out the real characters in the movie.<br /><br />okay, having found out that this was a soft core movie, i didn't necessarily turn it off and demand my money back. but, the dizzying way the extended video "erotic" scenes are added to what was probably a late night pay-cable release are very annoying and easy to fast-forward through without the sustained quality of, say, rod steele. you know they must've had some money, because i think some of it is filmed overseas.<br /><br />i will have to say the main actor trying not to spill the invisibility potion on himself is one of the most baffling acting jobs i've ever seen. and, i've seen torgo from manos! it may actually have been worth the dollar rental fee (that and gabriella hall). still, there are better corny movies to rent with your friends.
