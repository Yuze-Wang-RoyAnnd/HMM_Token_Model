when i first watched this film, i thought that it would be rally good, because it featured my favourite actor of all time. he gives a sterling performance, though it is fairly obvious he didn't have to life more than half a finger to make the r'ole work. he is the only good thing in it, unlesss you're into explosions and american dream-working class hero trash (which i'm not). <br /><br />i don't get it. how can this film get away with being so naf. that bit with the little boy being rescued, i mean, come on! you can't tell me that he would have been rescued without the fire-guy wearing any goggles (i know for a fact that it would have been pitch black in there and you can't see for more than a couple of feet infront of you) and no breathing equipment (he'd have choked after 2 minutes!). this film was just bad, ok?<br /><br />why robert? whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy????!!!!<br /><br />sorry if this is your favourite film.
