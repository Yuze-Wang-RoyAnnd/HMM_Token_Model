construction workers disrupt the native american burial ground of a large, hulking skeletal monster which disintegrates it's victims with it's touch, breath, or bone sword! the head honcho over the resort project, krantz(jim storm)orders his construction crew to keep their skeletal findings secret for much would halt the continuing development if the nearby katona tribe caught wind that remains were being dug up and disturbed. an aging bruce boxleitner, likable as always, stars as half-breed sheriff evans trying to keep peace between the katonas and krantz's crew. the peace was strained, at best, but with that skeletal monster running rampant making it's victims vanish without a trace, soon krantz wants answers to why members of his crew are missing..evans begins losing citizens as well. evans is warned by katona chief storm cloud(michael horse)that an ancient demon, the bone eater, has been loosened and can only be stopped with a sacred war axe(..the axe was removed by a worker who found it's remains with the weapon lunged inside)now in the back seat of his daughter kelly's(clara bryant, who wears tight jeans and shirts to reveal how daddy's girl has grown into quite a striking lady)boyfriend's truck. evans must somehow defeat the demon if the killing will stop..and this must occur before the eclipse or it's power will become too strong for anyone to vanquish.<br /><br />a solid cast, floundering in an embarrassing horror outing. the cgi, isn't very good, although the monster could've been quite threatening if done with a better budget. it rides a horse made from dust chasing after it's prey, for petesake! some cameo appearances include buck rogers gil gerard as evan's deputy big jim, star trek's walter koenig as a coroner, & house's william katt, as a country doctor attending to the wounds of evan's deputy. none of these cameos last longer than one minute or so..sad, really. adoni maropis, impresses in an underwritten role as a brooding katona, johnny black hawk, who wishes to use the bone eater to drive the white man off his tribe's land. jennifer lee wiggins portrays kaya, a tasty dish of a katona female whose against black hawk's hatred for the white man and wishes for evans to follow his indian blood regarding putting an end to the bone eating monster. this might be worth sitting through if just to see boxleitner dressed in war paint and indian garb. i felt for the actor, to be honest, as bruce tries to keep a straight-face in such a terrible movie. in yet another over-worked and tiresome clich'e, bruce's sheriff has an estranged relationship with his daughter, whose 17, hot, and wanting to date the "bad boy"..although this winds up being an underwritten sub-plot as is most of the plot concerning the killing skeleton and many of the poorly developed characters.
