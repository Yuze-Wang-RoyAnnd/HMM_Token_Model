personally i've watched it because of lea thompson's appearance and i didn't really expect to enjoy the movie as such, but surprisingly i kept watching it until the end.<br /><br />let's face it - it just one of the saga-like stories and isn't particularly original or entertaining, but strangely it just keeps you by the tv. my opinion about will of their own would be much better if there wouldn't be one point that i just don't get.<br /><br />there is lovely and really touchy scene in which lea thompson's character is running on the street holding baby in her arms, the snow is falling, she is cold, scared, and has no place to stay, she doesn't know what to do next. and then about 10-12 years later, when things are better for her, she just leaves the same kid without any warning to take up the career she was dreaming about.<br /><br />i just don't get it - i don't see how is it possible that she would do such thing, it was the opposite action to all that she done so far in her life when all that she was doing was aimed on that child survival. after this character flip i just couldn't enjoy rest of the movie.
