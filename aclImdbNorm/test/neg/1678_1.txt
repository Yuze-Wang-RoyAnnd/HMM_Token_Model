okay, i can sit through almost any movie, and i tend to get a real kick out of sci fi originals, but there was a major flaw in this movie that made me have to turn it off half an hour into it.<br /><br />having served in the us army, there are certain expectations in a movie including the military. at least some semblance of attention to proper military rank, uniform, and terminology is necessary if you expect a viewer to actually enjoy the experience. "bats: human harvest" had characters wearing rank that was facing the wrong direction on the lapel and, later in the movie, the time was listed as 11:00 hours, but it was full dark outside. even if the script was perfectly done, and the dialogue spectacular, and the acting oscar-worthy, if the people making the movie don't care enough about the movie to even bother to look up the proper way to display military time, why should anybody bother to attempt to watch it?
