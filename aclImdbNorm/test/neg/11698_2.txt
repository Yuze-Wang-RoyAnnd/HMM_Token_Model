this movie strayed too far from straub's novel for me to enjoy. barely made it to the middle of the film. besides changing don wanderly from edwards nephew into his son, the removed most of the major scenes and a number of characters that gave the novel so much life. what was left was trash. straub's version was far superior to this poorly executed film. i don't think casting did all that great a job on picking the chowder society members either. hopefully someone will come along and actually remake this film correctly in my lifetime. i just hate when hollywood butchers the works of talented authors because they think their version so much better. makes me sick.
