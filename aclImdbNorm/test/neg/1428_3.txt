strangeland is a terrible horror/technological thriller. dee snider plays carleton hendricks, a disgusting computer freak who prays on young girls through the chat rooms. his ridiculous philosophies on pain and suffering are both misguided and totally unfounded. there is no tie to reality with the ideas that are presented in this film, it is more like dee snider sat down and tried to think up the weirdest stuff possible to impress horror fans and maybe some of his old fans, but the end result is just awful.<br /><br />unfortunately for me, as a horror fan, the cover of this movie looks very good and it immediately caught my interest, which is the main reason that i was tricked into watching it. i assure you that this is not a quality horror movie. it is a disturbing yet boring attempt to suggest what might go on in the minds of people who treat themselves the way the carleton hendricks did in this film. the sad part is that no one does this stuff to themselves. marilyn freakin' manson doesn't even go that far, and the fact that he had a song on the soundtrack makes it clear that the film wasn't meant to poke fun at his type of music (that would be a stab at snider himself), it is more like dee snider was trying to raise himself from the career-dead and present himself as a sick-minded individual once more. dee, it seems that the time has come to let it all die...
