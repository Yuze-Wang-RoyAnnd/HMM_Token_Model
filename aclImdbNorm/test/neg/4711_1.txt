terrible acting, terrible script, wholly unrealistic. the bumblebee flies anyway exemplifies the cliches and sentimentalism that movie studios love to cram down viewers' throats. elijah wood is unimaginably bad in the primary role, and the plot points are contrived and sappy. cook's and wood's relationship is laughable at best. but the worst element of bumblebee is the script. this is some of the most mind-numbingly bad dialogue i have ever had the misfortune to hear. bumblebees actually crawling inside my ears and stinging my eardrums would be preferable to hearing elijah wood robotically spit out his pseudo-profound lines. i wish a "bumblebee project" would be performed on me, so i could mercifully have no memories of this stinker.
