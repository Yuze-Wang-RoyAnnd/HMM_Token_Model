this is the first porn i've ever tried to review. it demands a different approach than usual, since the allegory will not reward dissection. "i'm american. i'm a prudish virgin." "we are european. we are cultured and sex-mad." "it is nice when we all screw each other." lots to talk about! well, there kind of is in fact, relative to your average 60s topless volleyball number anyway. and the enervating patina of 'class' at least delivers clean, detailed compositions. but what the hell kind of thing is that to say about a porn? ok then: the only scene i really (rhetorically) got off on was the first time brigitte maier steps in. there are efforts to toss in a nice variety of race and age while letting no two men anywhere near each other; the one black guy suffers a premature bout of editorial coitus interruptus. and multiple takes or not, one perhaps undescribable-on-imdb act does look like it was partially simulated by a surgical hose. still, i stayed awake, and it was eight in the morning...but what does the last shot mean?!
