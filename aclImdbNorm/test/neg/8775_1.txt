whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely. the lone ranger is not camp, but "the" icon for good-doers all over the world. and it's a total violation of the spirit of the character that the only real lone ranger, mr. clayton moore, was forbidden to wear his mask in public appearances when this movie was released.<br /><br />whelp, long story short, the single saving grace of this gross (and poorly done) distortion was that in that year, i had the honor of meeting mr. clayton moore in columbus ohio, as part of a tour resulting from the bad press over mr. moore's treatment. needless to say, mr. moore's character, integrity and presence far outshined the movie.<br /><br />some things cannot be done better. there is only one lone ranger.
