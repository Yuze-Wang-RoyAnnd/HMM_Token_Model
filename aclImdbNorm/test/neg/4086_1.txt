the only redeeming feature of this movie is steve carell. like john wayne, i've never seen steve carell stretch too far as an actor, but it doesn't matter. he always plays his one role perfectly.<br /><br />as marty feldman once said, comedy must have internal consistency. you can have 4 men on stage sitting in garbage cans, and that's fine, but if you bring a fifth man on stage who isn't in a garbage can, you must then explain to the audience why he is not also in a garbage can.<br /><br />why doesn't evan accept his role as a messenger of god? why, when he does accept it, is he so profoundly embarrassed by it? why isn't anyone more impressed with the way that animals follow evan around (they are explained away by the unthinking doubters as "trained animals" possibly from a circus). there's a terrible flood at the end, and most everyone we see hops on the ark and is saved, but surely thousands of people would have been killed by the flood; there is no post-disaster emotional atmosphere at the end. instead, most of congress has finally seen the light and is about to prosecute the lone incorrigibly bad congressman for "profiteering".<br /><br />i gotta admit: i also liked the fish in the aquarium reacting to the presence of evan.
