this movie could have had a lot of potential. certainly with today's technology, one would expect real special effects. but movies are not made with special effects alone, of course acting is needed. this film lacked both!<br /><br />first, let me say to those who are upset with this not following the bible: why can't a movie take artistic license? if you want to know about the story of moses, read the bible. i have seen very few movies that follow a true story fact by fact. look at of movie from its artistic quailities.<br /><br />in viewing this movie, you will inevitably compare it to the 1956 version. it fails miserably in that. heston and brenner had presence. they became their roles. you don't see this here.<br /><br />even if you don't compare, standing on it's own, this movie to too rushed. parts where a scene should be developed, it does not. it becomes boring.<br /><br />my advice: skip this and watch the other. as campy as the other is, it's far and away the better movie.
