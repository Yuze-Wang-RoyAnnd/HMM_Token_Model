this is a known fact, mr. seagal cannot smile, he can act, he can kick butt, there are faint smiles, no real smiles no laughing out loud and no real point of watching this confusing movie. we see an over weight mr. seagal as dr. wesley maclaren, who is in desperate need of a haircut and his real daughter ayako made an appearance as his office assistant. story: okay so wesley lives in another darn outback with his sweet daughter holly. they sit and enjoy their red flower tea and omelettes and on the other end of town some over weight militia leader decides to make the whole town sick by spreading a virus that travels by air and kills in a matter of 2 days thinking he can survive as he had an antidote. problem, there is no antidote and the one that exists only holds back the virus for a while. the cia are contacted and even they can't help and only one person isn't ill, wesley's daughter holly. so she gets hunted thinking the cure is in her blood. wesley manages to grab his daughter and take her to her grandfather, who is a native indian. together with his sister in law ann they go to a base where there is a hidden lab to find a cure but even the soldiers there are dying slowly and so will others if they don't find a cure in time. and to shorten the moment, neither ann or wesley are infected by the virus...hmm. one weak fight scene. terrible movie and all the men in it are in desperate need of a stair master.
