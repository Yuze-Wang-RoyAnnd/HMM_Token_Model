i'm a sucker for mob/gangland movies, so i rented this movie. this movie is a complete train wreck. with all the big name actors in this film, i can not believe how bad it was. it was so bad, that i began laughing hysterically towards the end of the film. the actor better known as zues or the big dude from the ice cube movie "friday" does an incredible overacting job throughout the film. first thing i told blockbuster when i returned the film was to remove this garbage from their shelves. do not rent this movie, unless you want to waste two hours of your life. if they come out with a sequel, i wonder if it will be twice as bad as the first. i will be more cautious when renting so called 'mob/gangland' movies.
