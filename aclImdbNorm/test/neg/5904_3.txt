robin williams is excellent in this movie and it is a pity the material is not enough of a match for him. this may work if you buy into the "u-s-a! number one!" mentality but story wise nothing much happens. quite a shame really since the movie is really trying to say something, and says it sincerely. it just doesn't pack enough emotional punch.
