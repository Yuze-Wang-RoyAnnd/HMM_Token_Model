after huge budget disaster films set in america like the day after tomorrow and deep impact, it was refreshing to see something on a smaller scale like flood.<br /><br />using mainly unknown actors and actresses and actually focusing on england it was a welcome change of pace to seeing the empire state building being demolished.<br /><br />however, this is not a strong film on any basis. whilst being fairly shocking seeing all your favourite london landmarks being demolished by a very fake cgi storm surge, flood doesn't really deliver on anything else.<br /><br />the performances are bland, being saved from the pit of hell by david suchet and his refreshingly calm performance as the deputy priminister. he is perhaps a little too calm for what is going on in the film, all that fake water gushing around london must have made him pretty annoyed.<br /><br />it is understandable that the effects weren't going to be as good as tdat and di, but the cgi was at best, average.<br /><br />bland, disappointing and sometimes even tiresome. watch it if you must, but watch something else straight afterwards.
