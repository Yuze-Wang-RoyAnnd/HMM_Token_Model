i'm not going to say the story of the movie as some people do. i'm pretty sure people who read this will know what the storyline is. i'm also not going to go on and on about everything thats wrong with this movie, because i'll be here for ages if i do. the storyline is typical, and the special effects are below today's standards. this is not a movie you should watch if you are a serious movie buff (as most of us here are) little things will annoy you the whole movie and ruin the experience. if your a casual movie watcher, who likes to have a good time when they are watching a flick, then this movie is perfect for you, lots of fun. it would also be a good movie to take a partner to. just not for us movie buff's.<br /><br /> 5 out of 10
