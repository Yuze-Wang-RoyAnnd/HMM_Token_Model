this movie is bad. i saw the rated and the unrated versions. they are terrible!! now, i know it's suppose to be a low budget, porn spoof of spiderman, but spiderbabe is just not good at being bad-good. it's not funny! not funny at all!! i wanted to laugh. i tried to laugh. but this movie let me down. at least the unrated version has lots of nudity to look forward to. and is it me, because mundae is not a great looking woman. from the waist down she's okay, but on the way up leaves much to be desired. she does look good in that school girl outfit. please, if you must watch this spiderbabe, rent it first. rated or unrated, doesn't really make any difference, they're both bad to me!!
