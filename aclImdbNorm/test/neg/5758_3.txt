this was bad enough. i really hope that there is no sequel. maybe that is giving away part of the plot to let you know that it is open to the possibility, but no, it really isn't.<br /><br />there is really not at all special about this movie. well, the special effect were fairly good, but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />there were some hot babes in her, especially elina madison and alexandra ford, but nothing to see folks. pg-13, definitely not an r. that also tells you the slasher aspects were less than spectacular. the shovel to the head was the only thing that was unusual.<br /><br />tame scare fare.
