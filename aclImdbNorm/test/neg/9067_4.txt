is there anything else on earth to be more enticing than to learn what expects our frail bodies after, um, death. spanish director ignacio cerd`a (a soul-mate of his german colleague j"org buttgereit) provides blow-by-blow answer to our curiosity and invites us to an exciting journey in the world of preparation tables, scalpels, surgical saws, human entrails and warped minds.<br /><br />welcome to the autopsy room!<br /><br />i don't know which facets of the film, apart of its notorious reputation, may have helped it to acquire sufficiently high rating.<br /><br />storywise it's fairly simple and straightforward - a day in the life (actually half an hour) of a troubled coroner (or, perhaps, assistant pathologist or whoever he is) that is fed up with his routine morbid duty and discharges his psychological tension in a non-traditional fashion, right at his workplace. i'm perplexed of what particular message the authors tried to deliver with this one-note plot. i suspect it may be somehow inspired by udo kier's character's quirky demeanor in andy warhol's frankenstein.<br /><br />artistic values of the film are also questionable. it's hard to evaluate the performance of the actors that don't squeeze a single word. their emotions are concealed behind the medical masks. there's also not enough room for great camera-work - basically, the entire action unfolds mostly within four walls.<br /><br />authenticity - effects and makeup are impressive and the setup looks very plausible, but only a handful of medical/forensic experts can judge how truthful and anatomically correct the dissection is carried out here (if anyone cares). honestly, i used to think that the autopsy is done to examine the condition of particular organs and to ascertain the cause of death. now i know that dead bodies are severed, raped and humiliated, intestines are ripped apart, brains are retrieved from the head, stuffed into abdomen and mixed with guts, then the body is stitched back and washed - nothing personal. and what are these poor lads expected to write in their deceitful autopsy reports afterward?<br /><br />shock and disgust factor - it's much unlikely that an unsuspecting viewer would discover, to his horror, that the disc he was intended to watch with his wife and kids beside a christmas tree turns out to be a graphic video manual on vivisection. this obscure item is barely available, sought by people well familiar with the subject and not easily offended. hence it would be pointless to warn anyone to sabotage this film. they are well aware what exactly they are watching and what they want to see.<br /><br />cerd`a is really gifted and stylish director, which is clearly obvious from at least two other parts of his "trilogy" - preceding 'the awakening', amazing black and white short, and 30-minute 'genesis', visually stunning and moody piece with an off-beat and interesting concept. and i'm pretty sure that one day he will conquer the hearts of moviegoers with his new, more mainstream oriented, material. and sooner or later 'aftermath' would become a rarity for the meticulous collectors of his "early" "warm-up" works.<br /><br />but in the meantime, i'm afraid, it may be recommended strictly for medical students or specialists that study mental disorders and sexual deviations.
