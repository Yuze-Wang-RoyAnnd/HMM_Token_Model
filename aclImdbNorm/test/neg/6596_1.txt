okay, first of all, i missed like the first 15 minutes of the movie, so i missed credits and stuff. so when i finally got to it, i was like "who the hell is this dude?". i found out it was flex like hours after watching the movie. <br /><br />flex didn't look like michael jackson. not one bit. he couldn't dance like him, or move like him, the only thing he almost had was the voice. people commented on elizabeth taylor, but i can't really comment on that because i don't know much about her. <br /><br />the whole movie was like just plain wack. the dialogue sucked. the cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked. the soundtrack sucked. the acting sucked. yes even flex...i'm so upset about it though. i didn't want it to suck. i'm so sad that flex got told he can get away with it. but the whole thing looked like dress-up. you know? it's like, nobody looked like they were supposed to except for joseph jackson. <br /><br />the concert sequences just sucked. i'm sorry, but flex just can't dance like michael. i mean, like what the hell was vh1 thinking? the makeup didn't even match like the time of whatever michael was going through. for example, in the movie he was still dark when neverland got raided the first time around. in real life, mj was white as hell. there was some sort of stupid delay in his skin discoloring. <br /><br />the movie wasn't boring, well for me it wasn't. it wasn't really anything. i was just so upset about everything that was wrong with it. i wanted to see how it turned out and if flex could redeem himself. he didn't, really. the only part i found like a bit interesting was the whole lisa marie thing. when they fell in love. that was nice. but i had to turn my face away when they kissed. heh. and only two parts made me collapse with laughter. the first time was when they cut from michael with short hair, you know the thriller era, to michael with long flowing hair from the dangerous era and he was still black! that was funny. the second time i laughed was when they showed all of the posters and memorabilia of michael but they had flex's face instead! it was so funny. <br /><br />overall, this movie was cheap trash. it was simply two hours of dress-up and could have been so much better. but no, vh1 is cheap. watch if you want. but this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it. i came out of it feeling angry. and when i found out it was flex, i just started to feel so bad. so...watch if you want.
