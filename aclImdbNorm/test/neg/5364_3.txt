i am a fan of the paranormal and i love ghost hunters so when this show first came out i decided to give it a try. i could barely sit through one episode. the show is so obviously staged. i mean come on, every single episode involves someone being possessed or involves a demonic force trying to kill the family. another huge flaw is that these guys never debunk anything. when i watch ghost hunters they find evidence and try to disprove it and if they can't then it is evidence. on this show they find a voice or a piece of video evidence and they are very quick to call it a ghost. this completely ruins their credibility unlike taps and ghost hunters who actually know what they're doing. honestly if you're interested in the paranormal and want to watch a show about it watch ghost hunters.
