i don't care what anyone says, this movie was crap. the only thing it had going for it was camera work which was very well done. as for the dialogue i have heard so many people talk about...it sucked too. yes it was honest and true to life, but so what, i can hear anyone talk like that on the street, or in a fast food joint. what made the dialogue good in movies like pulp fiction, and gosford park was the fact that it is written dialogue, that takes time to think through. another thing was that the director should not have put himself in the picture. i believe that the male character could have been a lot stronger, but instead it seemed weak. in fact the movie seemed to revolve around the male character, and then he completely disappears in the last twenty minutes. the girl in the film i found completely repulsive, not in appearance, but in her needy needy ways. saying she is in love with a guy, and actually getting jealous of him the next day, what a crock of crap. final thing: the sound was terrible, and i hope it was only something that plagued my theater instead of actually being on the final cut of the film. there was a constant buzzing sound during several scenes and it was actually taking away from the talking going on. the one good thing again was blood's job as the dp, but the actress that played the main guy's ex girlfriend did a very good job as well. these two things couldn't save an ultimately terrible movie, which i refuse to call a film.<br /><br /> 2/10
