this is the worst film i've seen in a looooong time. it reminded me of a cirque du soleil show i saw in vegas six years ago -- without the athleticisme. by that i mean a few striking, artsy, images appear randomly, without any sustaining framework. the fake sepia tinted film is really tacky. this device is almost never justified and certainly is not in _tuvalu_. with apologies to abe lincoln: you can fool some of the people some of the time.
