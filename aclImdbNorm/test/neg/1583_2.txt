ok, what was this story about again? i am afraid that i never read the book and frankly, this was one of the most confusing movies that i have ever tried to watch in a long time. i get a bit confused on the number of flashbacks between the nurse, the patient and the man with no thumbs. the film didn't even really explain what they were looking for in the desert until they found it; or even how in the world they all knew each other to come together.<br /><br />after recently seeing the "pride and prejudice" movie with colin firth, i have been trying to do a study on his film career by watching other movies of his, and bluntly, other than "what a girl wants" i am not finding much where he played in that was any good. i am definitely not saying that he wasn't good. he is really one of the best actors i have seen in the modern day film, but the content and quality of the films he plays in have a lot to be desired.<br /><br />"the english patient" is another perfect example of where the director, writer, and crew are just too close to their subject matter to see that the viewer is not getting the picture
