this is such a crappy movie i have no idea how it got on the shelves, they must have paid the movie store to make them put it there, seriously! the story makes absolutely no sense unless you are on some seriously heavy drugs, you would definitely have to be on something in order to watch this total piece of garbage, so much so that you would not care what was on the tv because you're almost in a coma. the writing sounds like it was done by a 5-year-old and the acting is worse than grade school plays. the hideous special effects they were trying to do look so stupid, what did they spend a whole $5 to make the entire movie, it looks like it! oh my, that scene with the old woman who has an 80's hairdo and the ugly girls in the rubber suits, me and my friends laughed so hard. did someone actually think it was a good idea to make this into a movie? i find that hard to believe!
