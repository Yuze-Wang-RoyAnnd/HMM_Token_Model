alice dodgson,a new york doctor gets her license suspended when she treats one of her patients with an unapproved drug,resulting in the patient's death.without a job,alice is forced to go to jamaica,where she tends to the brother of a wealthy white landowner.the brother thinks he's a zombie and is deeply involved in the local people's voodoo practices and rituals."ritual" is a mediocre horror flick.the action is pretty dull,the plot twists are silly and there is no suspense.there is a bit of gore as someone is killing off white people with a machete,but not too much.the cinematography is decent,however the acting is truly woeful.definitely one to avoid.4 out of 10.
