this was the worst movie i have ever seen. i have to admit i didn't watch it from beginning to end as cleaning the toilet was more entertaining.<br /><br />the 'star' was the most unpleasant character i've ever seen, neither funny nor attractive, in fact, creepy and obnoxious are far too complimentary.<br /><br />it is painful to watch, there is no acting, especially not from the star who behaves as a doped up mentally deficient take off on one of those loud mouthed black actors.<br /><br />as horrible as it is to watch one of those can't shut up black actors, watching a puerto rican one is even worse. <br /><br />the name of the movie is descriptive, he is the pest. this movie is a must miss.
