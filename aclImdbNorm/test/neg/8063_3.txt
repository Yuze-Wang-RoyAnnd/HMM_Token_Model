i bought this thing used at a video game store's "clearance bin". i wanted to get that guilty feeling from watching something i've been warned is too intense to watch; i wanted the shock value. i wanted to feel guilty and bad about watching a "banned film". i was very disappointed.<br /><br />cannibal ferox does not work because it is so campy and fake. most of the time the camera does not show you the "shocking" stabs, chops, slicing - you just see the aftermath. (they do show a breast hooking in detail). the special effects are just ok. nothing here that tells you any of the violence is real. the "cannibals" are obviously poor people from central / south america who were dressed up as jungle savages and told to act mean. these people were obviously in on the whole picture to get a little money, or food, or both. again...just not convincing.<br /><br />however, like everyone else has said, there is some real killing of animals going on here. that is the extent of the realism. to me, that was more shocking than any gutting, chopping of scalps, or castration, and even then, the animal deaths are not that gory at all - maybe just sad.
