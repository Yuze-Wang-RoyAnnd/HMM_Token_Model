the 3 stars are for phillip seymour hoffman. nothing else and no one else in this movie deserves even a wee smidgen of a star. well, ok, amy adams deserves a wee smidgen, but the smidgenometer doesn't seem to be working, so i'll stick with 3. tom hanks...nothing. julia roberts...nothing. mike nichols...do you see a trend yet? aaron sorkin...omg, not a chance. <br /><br />i could rant on for several paragraphs about the way charlie wilson's war glosses over history, morality, legitimacy and so on, but i don't think any such rant could outweigh the gushing of aaron sorkin fans. the rest of you, beware.spend your movie money elsewhere.<br /><br />still, if you're looking for a pithy comment, here's mine. you can put hot fudge sauce on a pile of garbage, but it changes nothing. garbage is garbage and so is charlie wilson's war.
