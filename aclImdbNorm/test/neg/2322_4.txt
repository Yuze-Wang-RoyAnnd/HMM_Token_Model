i'm not really much of an abbott & costello fan (although i do enjoy "who's on first") and, to be honest, there wasn't much in this movie that would inspire me to watch any more of their work. it wasn't really bad. it had some mildly amusing scenes, and actually a very convincing giant played by buddy baer, but somehow, given the fame of the duo and the esteem in which they're generally held, i have to say i was expecting more. as the story goes, the pair stumble into a babysitting job, and during the reading of jack & the beanstalk as a bedtime story (with the kid reading it to costello), costello's jack falls asleep and dreams himself into the story. there's a "wizard of oz" kind of feel to the story, in that the characters in the dream are all the equivalents of real-life acquaintances of jack, and the movie opens in black & white and shifts to colour during the dream sequence. the fight scenes between jack and the giant and the dance scene between jack and polly (dorothy ford) are among the amusing parts of the movie. polly, of course, also leads to one of the questions of the movie - what happened to her? jack and gang apparently left her behind in the giant's castle! i know - it was just a dream, so who cares. still - i wondered. there were also a couple of cute song and dance routines. my 4 year old giggled a bit during this, so she was able to appreciate some of the humour. i found it to be an acceptable timewaster, but certainly not anything that would convince you of abbott and costello as comic geniuses. 4/10
