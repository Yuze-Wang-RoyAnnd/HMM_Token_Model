this abomination and the sequel one more time (no thanks) and the hideous jerry lewis disasters like don't raise the bridge lower the water (why not just flush instead) drove cinema owners to close their doors rather than be forced to run these films. true: in the 60s block booking of films was still enforced on hapless suburban and country cinemas... this means that in order to get a good film the cinema was forced to run woeful timewasters like these: i remember well in 1974 keen to screen fiddler on the roof or something good like that, i was bailed up in the united artists booking office by some sozzled salesman who waved a sheet of flops before me and squinted, bellowing: "now before we get to that one, lemme see ya date these ones first". which basically means: "book these duds and we will give ya a tired hit". this is how and why so many cinemas closed, forced to screen and annoy their waning audiences with these assembly line failures with lame comedians and bored talent. cinema owners, exhausted with arguing simply closed, sold to a petrol station and saw the cinema demolished. these days the same type of films (eg: i now pronounce you chuck and larry) get banished to the 20 seat cinema 99 in a mega google plex instead. not much has changed. freddy got fingered... anyone?
