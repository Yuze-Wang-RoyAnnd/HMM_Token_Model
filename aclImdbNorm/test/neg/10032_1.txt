i walked into a book store in brentwood, tennessee. i am not going to say the name because i am a dedicated customer. i have been satisfied with every item i purchased there before this one. on display in the front of the store was the bell witch haunting. (might i mention this is the only store i have seen it for sale in.) i had heard about the story somewhere and remembered it was supposed to have really happened for real. i was very excited and couldn't wait to watch it. i had great expectations for it. i couldn't believe what i seen when i viewed it. it didn't look like a real movie. it looked like a home video. i was under the impression it was suppose to be a horror movie. i mean the movie was suppose to be about a witch haunting you know. this is no horror movie. you will not jump out of your seat watching this movie. i gave the movie all the chances in the world to get better as it went along. i swear i did. it never did get any better. there were several scenes of this little kid getting poop and pee thrown on him. i didn't find that entertaining at all. i watched the whole movie with disbelief that the store would actually sell this to me. i guess that is how bad this economy has got. i have this to say to the cast and crew. do not show this film as material to get other film jobs. don't do it. i mean that sincerely. i commend you for trying. for people who have bought this. i say this. don't sell your copy to someone. they could get very upset. have a nice day everyone.
