their purple moment <br /><br />aspect ratio: 1.33:1<br /><br />sound format: silent<br /><br />(black and white - short film)<br /><br />two luckless nightclub revellers (laurel and hardy) are unable to pay their bill, provoking violent retribution from a hot-tempered waiter (tiny sandford).<br /><br />typical l&h scenario, less substantial than some of their best work from this period, but worth a look nonetheless. stan takes center-stage this time round, caught up in a financial dilemma after holding back part of his wages to fund a night on the town, only to find out - too late! - that his aggrieved wife (fay holderness) has replaced his stash with worthless coupons. some of the prolonged closeups of laurel as he slowly becomes aware of the unfolding disaster reveal his genius for characterization and mime. 1920's morality is represented by patsy o'byrne, playing a hatchet-faced busy-body who takes great joy in alerting l&h's respective spouses (holderness and lyle taho) to their husbands' bad behavior. the ending fizzles, but the movie still has much to recommend it. directed by james parrott.
