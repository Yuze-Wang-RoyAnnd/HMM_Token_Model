the problem with this movie is that it is trying to compile a 6+ hours movie into 2 hours. the result is clear. it seems too forced, unclear and too simple minded.<br /><br />the only plus side is the beginning. it explains well why and how hercules was born. the rest of the movie was...just mumbo jumbo that is put together. it has a potential to be a great movie like lotr if only it is not forced into 2 hours.<br /><br />the acting is not very convincing either. ok not all is bad. but most of them are. special effects are stupid and look like it is made ten years earlier (although the 1st monster is pretty good) overall, i give it 4 out of ten for the reasons i described above.
