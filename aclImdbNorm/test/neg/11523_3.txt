i really should have learned more about this movie before renting it. it was one of those movies where you keep watching it figuring it's got to get better. then, when it ends, you feel stupid for having wasted precious time in your life that you can never get back. ice-t did his bad guy thing and, well, that was the highlight of the evening. the pictures of the shuttle looks like it was done with a little toy inside of a box and the spacewalking scenes were funny because you could see the strings attached to the space suits. the script was lacking and the car chase scene with the guy bleeding and going unconscious was incredible because he drove better than i could have on one of my best days. all in all, i have seen worse but this sure isn't one i'd recommend or want to remember.
