"delusion" is what you experience when you watch this flick and then believe you saw something worthwhile. this flick, which tells of a trio of semi-psycho travelers who are up to no good somewhere in the ca desert, is amateurish and just plain stupid. the film suffers from an awful story, a lousy screenplay, and some terrible direction just to mention a few of the deficits. if the flick has anything at all going for it, it's b-movie diva rubin's even performance. don't waste your time on this turkey.
