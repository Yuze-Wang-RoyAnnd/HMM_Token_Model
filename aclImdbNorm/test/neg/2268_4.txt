shwaas may have a good story, but the director is utterly devoid of talent. he does not know when to stop. when the story calls for people to act confused, there are ten minute scenes of people miming the act of confusion. when the story calls for a little background history, there are ten minute scenes of konkan's greenery. when the story calls for a kid throwing tantrums... you get the idea. <br /><br />not to mention the extreme closeups so that you can count people's nose hair. there are movies that should be seen on a big screen, this movie should be seen on a 13" tv. also amruta subhash who plays asavari is the worst actress i've seen in quite a long time. a normal human being would need to practise overacting for years to achieve what she does so effortlessly.<br /><br />i give it 4/10 solely because the subject matter is different, and the story is not bad. the fact that a movie like shwaas gets to be india's entry to the oscars tells volumes not about the state of indian cinema but the state of indian judging committees. a movie is not good just because its subject matter is arty.
