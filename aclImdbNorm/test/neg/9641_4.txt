my mistake for thinking this was a serious war-is-hell movie prior to seeing it. that all ended seconds into the film when the "mtv" logo appeared. it might as well been called "national lampoon's sexy-n-loose." and it did play to the "mtv" crowd; the movie that followed those comical first few seconds played like the music videos they used to play 40+ years ago. at least disney was smart enough to ship its rated r stuff over to touchtone and allowed us to take it seriously. okay, i'm being harsh; it wasn't that bad of a film. however, it definitely has its share of overacting and the film is extremely biased/one-sided. admittedly, i'm not a war movie buff. i can't watch 'platoon,' 'full metal jacket' or 'saving private ryan' more than once. sure they were good movies, but they're not my forte and they all seem to blend in after awhile to where i wouldn't be able to distinguish one from the next. following a tour in iraq, phillippe plans life after the war but is drawn back in due to a clause in his contract. or, at least, that's the military's plan until he goes awol and the characters speed cross-country on a few bucks amazingly never caught. no, i haven't been in any war, nor to iraq, nor do i agree with it. i also don't have all the knowledge when it comes to recruitment or signing their contracts. i can say this: though i am sorry they're drawn back into this conflict, i can't feel too much for someone so dumb not to read the fine print. it's like someone on their deathbed leaning over to finally read the surgeon general's warning on their box of cigarettes and say, "oh, they're what? deadly? i'll sue them!"
