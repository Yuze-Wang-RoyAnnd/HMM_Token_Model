kathy ireland: the body of a goddess, the face of an angel, the voice of a smurf.<br /><br />and the acting talent of a shovel full of calcite. if you don't believe me, check this out: "alien from l.a." actually depends on her to act throughout 9/10 of the movie! sure, she ends up in a nice red bikini top and a wrap-around skirt near the end, but that's too little (so to speak) too late. <br /><br />seems ireland plays the daughter of a renowned scientist who falls down into the center of the earth to find him. along the way, she falls for a guy named charmin (yes, like the toilet paper - make your own jokes) and finds out how "mad max" rejects live. did you know that people that live down deep in the earth have austrailian accents? neither did i.<br /><br />it's bad (it was mst'd, after all) and also a golan-globus production but after all is said and done, ireland just basically looks lost, like she's trying to find where the photographers are so she can do a photo shoot instead.<br /><br />and i don't blame her.<br /><br />one star. and if you insist on watching this, do so with the sound turned off - save your eardrums.
