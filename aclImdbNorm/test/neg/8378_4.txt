a bad quentin tarantino rip off, at least i hope that's what they were going for because at least then i could respect the director for admiring tarantino. one scene a "singing" scene with rose mcgowan is far to well done and genius for this film and could have only been stumbled on by mistake by this director. so besides his quinton inspiration and rose mcgowan and her one good scene this film sucked. some of the crappiest dialogue i have ever heard, i'm willing to bet why mcgowan doesn't speak much is because of how crappy her dialogue would have been. tries to be funny, never is, tries to be dark and isn't, tries to be stylish and is just bland. who dishes out the money to make movies like this, i'm hoping it was all the directors so no one else's money was wasted. if not for mcgowan the whole cast is awful and when mcgowan is your best hmmm, i gotta wonder.
