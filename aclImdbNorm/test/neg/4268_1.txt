keep away from this one. the worst thing is the appalling story. there seems to be an intent to convey some subtle spiritual/love/friendship message but it is so pathetically devoid of any substance you can't help but cringe. in addition, the majority of screen time is a far below standard story of thieves, criminals and our hero(es) dealing with some alien time travel artifacts. i know you are asking for trouble when dealing with time but the story is more full of holes than usual. also you have: cheap sets, bad acting and some of the worst music arrangements in the history of the moving picture, overpowering, cheap, abrupt and disjointed. all i can say is "man alive ! this film is bad !"
