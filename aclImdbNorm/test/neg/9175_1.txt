what is night vision? well according to the star (williamson) let's see...one package store owner says to him 'it's getting dark outside' to which he replies 'it makes for better.........'night vision.' what in the hell does that mean? in fact what in the hell is this movie trying to say? it has plot holes that you could drive the killer's van through. not to mention a cop on duty drinking, robert forster sleepwalking through this bizarre attempt at cashing in on the serial killer craze, and a killer who videos his murders. that's actually all i remember.<br /><br />the film took place in texas, had a few car chases, and a clich'ed ending. perhaps if one watches this film with their eyes closed - it might be good? after all, without being able to see it....it would make for better.....night vision. did that make sense? nope. and neither does this film.
