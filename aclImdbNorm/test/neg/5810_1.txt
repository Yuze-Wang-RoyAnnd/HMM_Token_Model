it's hard to know exactly what to say about this ever so bland and dull little film. the story is predictable when not completely laughable. it's all a matter of "dutiful gestures" which, as presented here, carry absolutely no conviction. yes, the mgm "production values" are gorgeous, and yes, ms. lamarr was exquisitely beautiful, but she and the great spencer tracy have absolutely no "chemistry" together - and that's the only thing that would have made this parade of cliches at all effective... it's my understanding that this movie received poor reviews when it was originally released; the passage of time has not improved it.
