really? is this necessary? how can somebody make such a film? disgusting!!! seteven seagal with funny hair and fat like an elephant. stunts all the time, cars persecutions with an annoying soundtrack. not to mention the ending. completely nonsense with the presence of the little girl.<br /><br />steven seagal wants to be robin hood!!! well, at the beginning a fortune teller answers something, nobody has asked. seagal's wife has nightmares and she can see the future. they must be kidding. steven segal passes out after a car persecution, and i know he can't act. it was terrible. nothing can save that film.<br /><br />i lost 90 minutes of my life! see you
