... and boy is it soft <br /><br />i saw this on cable channel bravo one saturday night and here in britain we often have these dire " erotic " soft core movies turning up late at night on bravo . this one follows a weird science type plot of a couple of college geeks building a virtual reality headset that makes you have sexual fantasies . <br /><br />when you`ve seen one of these movies you`ve seen them all with a bunch of bimbos looking like they`re advertising silicone implants . come on i`ve actually seen breasts in real life ( i`m sure some other of us have too ) and they wobble around unlike here where they defy the laws of , if not physics than at least gravity . the sex scenes are these tedious affairs where a well buffed geezer rubs himself against his co-star without any dialogue or sound apart from some muzak and when they climax it looks like they`re both having a bad attack of constipation . the girls themselves are very pretty especially brandy davis and nikki fritz but they`re wasted in these type of soft core movies <br /><br />and if it`s fantasy you`re after i recommend the lord of the rings trilogy
