this one is a real stinker.<br /><br />the story just isn't up to par with most other tz episodes. it's pretty boring, though seeing peter falk made up as a fidel castro lookalike is kind of amusing.<br /><br />whenever twilight zone would be aired at an unannounced hour in my hometown, i'd grab a sandwich and a drink and settle in for some quality entertainment. 9 times out of 10, it wound up being this episode! strange thing? this often happened to my mom (another tz fan like me) as well. there were so many times that one of us would say to the other, "i was all set to watch _the twilight zone_ and guess which episode was on? the cuban dictator episode!" obviously some people like this episode, as it gets a 6.7 rating ... how that happened, i have no idea - but that in and of itself would make a great twilight zone plot!
