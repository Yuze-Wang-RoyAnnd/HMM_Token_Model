if you are home on a weekend, very bored and lack the will to move, with absolutely nothing better to do with your life for the next couple of hours you could enjoy making fun of this movie. the acting and script and general movie making of this film isn't actually all that bad, which is why it makes it possible to actually sit through this. this is defitnly a movie they would show in high school health class to teach the dangers of pre-marital sex. or they could also show it to teach the dangers of very lame music - that 'rock' band brian austin green is in is really terrible, i think thats a much greater threat to society than unwed parents.
