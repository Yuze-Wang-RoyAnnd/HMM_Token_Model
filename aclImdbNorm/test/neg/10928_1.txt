it looks like people involved with this movie are stuffing the ballot box to boost its ratings. the good news that apparently only 18 people have seen it. i suppose that makes me the 19th. i have no involvement with the flick and don't know anyone who did and i'm a long-time imdb user (check my vote record and reviews over the past seven years), so i promise i'm giving an honest and unbiased opinion. it's coming to you from a 30-year horror fan who has also appeared in a couple of low-budget flicks himself.<br /><br />aside from a couple of interesting video effects, "frankensteins bloody nightmare" is incoherent, boring, and technically flawed beyond all reason. it was apparently shot on silent stock and the audio then dubbed in; most of it sounds like it was recorded with a tin can and a piece of string, anyhow. more than three quarters of the dialog is inaudible.<br /><br />i watched this from beginning to end and have no idea of what the story was, or even if there was one. it seems like the director is mostly impressing himself with long, panning shots of the corners of table and dead black spaces that do nothing but pad the film out. that would be a problem if one were actually developing a plot and making a film that had some sense of pacing. in this case, though, the rule doesn't apply. it doesn't matter how scenes are shot because they don't add up to a story.<br /><br />watching this video is an exercise in futility at every level. whatever people who worked on it are writing and however they're trying to influence the ratings here on imdb, this is just bad, tedious stuff.<br /><br />that's the honest truth. if you're thinking of spending your money or time on this one, think again. it's easy to find something better because you won't find much worse.<br /><br />and that's the unbiased, unvarnished truth.
