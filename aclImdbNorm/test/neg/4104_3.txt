i don't want to seem too much of a nitpicky spoilsport, but if the accidental death of a butterfly by a time traveler caused such an enormous change in the timeline, how could that be since the butterfly would have been incinerated by the pyroclastic blast of the erupting volcano anyway? and, how could time travelers keep going back to the same moments and not keep meeting up with their prior and later selves who were also at those same few minutes in the timeline? it seems there would have been quite a large crowd standing in front of that dinosaur charging.<br /><br />while i can accept the idea of a time wave, i seriously doubt the wave would have caused only a few changes. as the wave passed, all changes that would have happened, would have happened at once during the passage of that wave. so, scratch the idea of the city starting to become overgrown with jungle. and why jungle at all? the location of the city would have still been at the latitude and longitude it was before and would have had vegetation appropriate to its geographic place on earth.<br /><br />and an endless list of other illogical inanities.<br /><br />bwahahaha! this flick is a weird combination of some fairly decent production values and totally ridiculous plot holes and factual errors.<br /><br />too bad. a terrific story idea that was botched up with silly science.<br /><br />sigh... why, why, why, why? why spend all that money on production and not even bother to proofread the screenplay to see if it made some sort of actual sense?
