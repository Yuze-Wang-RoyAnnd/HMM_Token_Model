i think we are supposed to think what wonderful salt-of-the-earth characters. unfortunately, this is lame and laboured.<br /><br />as always with any production set in newcastle, there are numerous shots of the tyne bridge and frequent attempts to show what great 'characters' geordies are. the viewer is never allowed to forget where the film is set, as though the rest of the world cared about newcastle and its inhabitants.<br /><br />if you like well observed, literate and original work stay well clear.
