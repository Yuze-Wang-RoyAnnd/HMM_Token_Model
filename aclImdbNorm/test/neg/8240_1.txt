this season lacked real oomf, but, as far as setting up stories to get us in the mood again, season 6 is without highlights and spontaneity.<br /><br />this season lacked its usual sopranos style, and if you cut out all the garbage that was filled in each and every episode this season, you probably would have had 6 episodes worth of real stories.<br /><br />side stories like pauly's mom, is she or isn't she? was boring and had no purpose other than further exploration of his character. i would have like to have seen bobby express his anger more at pauly in that carnival episode, but to no avail.<br /><br />and that's just it! these side stories had no real purpose, and lack finishing. if they are going to finish off these stories in the next 6 episodes, i'd rather not watch it, because, its not really worth seeing.<br /><br />disappointing is to nice a word to say about this season and its finale.
