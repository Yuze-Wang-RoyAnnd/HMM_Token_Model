"inuyasha " was awful . this show was incredibly over -hyped but this is nothing but a tedious bunch of anime clich'es. the characters are annoying and lifeless ,the story line is boring and endless .i think that it could have be something interesting if it have a better writing, but it seems that the writers of the show have more intentions in show inuyasha and his stupid friends fighting with some monsters and then crying for his tragic love triangle with kikyou and kagome and a lot of circles around the same thing again and again . the script is cheesy and dumb and the animation is poor .the character design it 's very ugly ,i don't know why everyone love it ,all have the same face ! : big eyes , tiny noses , a line as the mouth and the typical anime haircuts . i find "inuyasha " incredibly boring and dumb . this have to be one of the most over -rated animated shows ever made .
