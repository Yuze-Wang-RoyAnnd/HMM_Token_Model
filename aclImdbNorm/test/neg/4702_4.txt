five years after the us civil war, western folk are more concerned with the age old war between homesteaders and cattle ranchers. the cattlemen herd their wares, from texas to the trail town of abilene, kansas. there, the cowboys find not only big money, but also big confrontation, with homesteaders. tall in the saddle marshal randolph scott (as dan mitchell) tries to keep peace in the town. mr. scott has experience mediating between trail hands and saloon patrons. he also juggles the town's finest looking women: sexy saloon singer ann dvorak (as rita) and pretty church lady rhonda fleming (as sherry). boozy county sheriff edgar buchanan (as bravo trimble) offers more comic relief than sharp-shooting assistance.<br /><br />"abilene town" begins with some promising symbolism and contrast: gunshots interrupt scott and ms. fleming singing a hymn in church; then, the camera switches to ms. dvorak sexily singing her saloon number, which causes a man to fire his gun in pleasure. after that, it really becomes quite a standard western; it is somehow duller than it should be, but not quite awful. young lloyd bridges appears as one of the homesteaders. dvorak's leggy costume is the film's greatest asset; in it, she is a real mover. <br /><br />**** abilene town (1/11/46) edwin l. marin ~ randolph scott, ann dvorak, edgar buchanan
