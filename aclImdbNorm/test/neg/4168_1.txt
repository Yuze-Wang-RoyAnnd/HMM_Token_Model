interesting concept that just doesn't make it. i watched the whole movie, but had to read imdb comments to find out what code 46 meant. if/when it was explained in the film, i must have been in a coma, or possibly brain-dead by then. i only watched it for tim robbins. the fact that i did not know any of the other actors should have been a tip-off. we all have to start somewhere, but this film should not be it. as to the 'anti empathy virus virus'-holy utility belt, batman! where were the joker, the riddler, etc? also, why are the women all so damned ugly? if i want to see less-than-plain stick-figures, i'll just walk down the street. the best part of the film was the car crash. it was totally believable, and not over-the-top like most movie crashes.
