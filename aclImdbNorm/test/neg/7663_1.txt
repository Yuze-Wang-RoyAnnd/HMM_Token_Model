i just saw this movie on tnt and let me tell you, this movie was downright corny and cheezy. but after a certain point, i began to laugh my socks off and to tell you the truth, they should classify this movie as comedy rather than action/adventure. the absolutely most hilarious scene comes when the delon and kennedy are making loop the loop 360's to avoid the french missiles that wagner ordered to destroy the concorde. our fearless leader, kennedy, decides to shoot flares out the window to stop the heat seeking missiles????? dumb yet funny---the kicker comes here though---after one shot, the flare gun malfunctions and kennedy tries to fix it in the cockpit and well...if you want to know what happens get a hold of this movie. the dumb parts of this movie include the total lack of plot----yeah lets have some action for 25 minutes than land in paris and go one hour with love scenes with prostitutes and flight attendants. now lets switch to the saboteur for ten minutes then a wasted rest of the movie and a plane that is visually breaking apart and the passengers don"t even see it???? its right in front of their eyes!!!!-----final rating for this move--- (1/10) out of 4 stars if it were action 2 out of 4 stars if it were a comedy
