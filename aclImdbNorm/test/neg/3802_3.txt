maybe here in sydney we are all poop side down and as a result we get to lap up floaters like this s-eek!-uel in classy theaters. released here in 1980 this hilarious all-tar drama was greeted with howls of delight at the session i attended. in fact the audience were so into the ludicrous antics on screen it played like a rocky horror session. within 5 minutes we all knew it was a real disaster: the tug boat scene where you can see the buckets of water tossed in from off-set. after that it was every patron for himself and the cinema rang with advice, cheering for bad acting and oo-waah reactions. the gunfight in the hold among the crates is especially idiotic and allows drunken viewers with friends in altered states also watching to contribute appropriately. i call these films with michael caine his holiday house films as i always reckon he agrees to do them because he has seen a house he likes and doesn't want to spend his savings. like jaws 3 or 4 or whatever it was called.
