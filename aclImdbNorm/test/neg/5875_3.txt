a conversation about how jan-michael vincent is a lush led me to foolishly re-visit this mid-90s dtv entry. a kid is traumatized when he sees an ice cream man gunned down in the 1950s and he grows up to be a psycho ice cream man (clint howard). something happens and people disappear and end up in the ice cream. blah, blah, blah. <br /><br />director norman apstein (credited as paul norman) made a career of doing porn before this and went right back to it afterward. that is what you get for having all murders happen off screen. and for casting a skinny kid as a fat kid and making him wear a fat suit. just cast a fat kid! also, there is a scene where vincent stoically reacts to a group of escaped loonies surrounding him. he was either totally drunk and was frightened for his life or the filmmakers captured his "have i really sunk this low?" shame full on. despite being low budget trash, this did line up a few good names including david naughton, olivia hussey, david warner and the people court's own doug llewelyn. how you can make a boring slasher with that cast is beyond me.
