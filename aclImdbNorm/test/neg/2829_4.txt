after receiving a dvd of this with a sunday newspaper, i hoped that it was not the usual duff films that are given away because no one would ever buy them. i was wrong. sheens acting is on par with that of a ten year old in a school pantomime production and the same goes for the majority of the cast. neill is satisfactory, but plays a russian and isn't helped by his hybrid northern irish/new zealand accent, and nor are the rest of the kgb characters, all of whom sound like they're in a cambridge footlights reunion. in fact, the only people with genuine accents are extras who supply an odd word here and there, helpfully letting us know at least where the hell everything is going on in what is otherwise a complete mash. the "espionage" factor is unimpressive for the most part and primarily consists of sheen faffing about in various ridiculous disguises whilst trying to blend into the background, quickly becoming not only boring but laughable. the plot has potential but is completely murdered by the rest of the confusing production elements. this could have been so much better.
