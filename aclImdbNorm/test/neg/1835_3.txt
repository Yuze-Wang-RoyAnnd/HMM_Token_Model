this movie had such a good premise to start with. suspense, slashers, a secret society, and you really couldn't figure out who the bad guys were until the last quarter of the movie.<br /><br />but it contained so many dumb clich'es from the worst of the old american slasher/horror movies. now, i love slasher/horror movies, but there are all the old clich'es that have long disappeared from american cinema. for example, the old "i hear noises in the basement and i'm home all alone and the basement light doesn't work, so i'll go down to investigate" clich'e.<br /><br />three examples of these clich'es just really irked me to no end: <br /><br />1) when potente finds out that there may be a secret society at work at the medical school carving up live bodies, she proceeds to ask questions and tell everyone -- very publicly. in essence, she is saying, "i found you out. come kill me because i am telling everyone your secret." and then she wonders why she finds blood smeared all over her bed and is brought her roommate's severed finger in a towel.<br /><br />2) even after one guy she met two weeks ago ends up on the dissection table and she finds out about this secret society disemboweling live people, she goes to the lab where all the dead bodies are stored 2-3 more times by herself at night to investigate.<br /><br />3) her roommate gets killed. she gets chased by the killer, whom she knows, doesn't report him to the university or the police, then leaves the school to go home to visit her parents. then she returns to school, apparently thinking that this guy who tried to kill her will let bygones be bygones and not try to kill her, even though she knows his secret. she was, of course, wrong.<br /><br />for someone who was supposed to be so smart (she was studying to be a doctor in the best school in germany), she acted like the clich'e bimbo in a horror movie.<br /><br />these things just made a potentially good movie very frustrating, and made me wish the ending would come even sooner. halfway through the movie, i stopped routing for her and wished that she would end up on the dissection table, too.
