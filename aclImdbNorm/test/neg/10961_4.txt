well, here we have a zombie movie that perhaps isn't even being much of a zombie movie. the entire movie is set in a zombie-plagued near future but yet the movie does very little with this concept. instead it focuses on a zombie hunter who is trying to get revenge and his money back from a group of other bounty hunters. what good is money anyway when almost the entire world has gone to hell and towns are mostly desolate. and why pay money to people for killing zombies in the first place. as if people would not go on to kill this dangerous threatening monsters when they are not getting paid.<br /><br />needless to say that the story for "the quick and the undead" is far from a tight one. it of course also isn't being filled with the most logical and interesting moments, characters or dialog.<br /><br />still it's not a completely horrible movie. it certainly ain't as bad as some people try to make you believe it is. it's a rather good looking one, or rather said the movie at least doesn't have a cheap look over it. it's effects may be a bit overused but nevertheless they are quite good looking, as are the make-up effects as well.<br /><br />still the movie was not what i hoped of it. its title might suggest that the movie is set in the wild, wild west, during the days of the cowboys but its title is just a misleading one, no doubt picked to cash in on it. i fell for it, expecting this movie to be a combination of a western and a gory zombie-horror-flick.<br /><br />for the fans of the zombie movies this movie will mostly be a disappointment to watch. it of course adds nothing new to the genre but it also doesn't has enough of the genre itself in it to be considered a good one to watch.<br /><br />not totally unwatchable but also far from a recommendable one.<br /><br />4/10
