'this life' is truly as bad as it gets. its cast of mercenary, lascivious, ruthless, duplicitous, shallow characters are intended as a reflection on its post-eighties setting and i have to admit in this regard it is an accurate creation. unfortunately, it leaves me nothing to sympathise with or care about and i regard it as just another step toward the television premium-rate phone in scams; astonishingly bad, cheap, reality and 'celebrity' saturated television; and other cut and run attitudes that have destroyed this medium and, indeed, much of british society. sounds exaggerated? i don't think it is. in this regard programs such as 'this life' have indeed been as influential as they are often called.
