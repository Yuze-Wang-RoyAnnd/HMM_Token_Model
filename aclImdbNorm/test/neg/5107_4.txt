when i first heared that there was going to be the world is not enough video game for the nintendo 64, i was so excited. when it finally came out, i was one of the first ones to rent it. i rented it for 7 days, and i got through the whole game!!! the game was to easy and gave out too much hints. a majour dissapointing sequel to goldeneye. take my advice and do not rent this game.<br /><br />sure the guns and gadgets are cool, but one gets tired of a watch lazer that looks like it was taken right from goldeneye with the exception of being a red color instead of a blue color, a poor excuse for a dart gun, horrible stunner and a stupid grapple hook that can only attach itself to things that are yellow and black.<br /><br />i think that rare should of made this game instead of ea who should stick to games there good at making, like sport games and should stear clear of first person shooters and let the masters do the work.
