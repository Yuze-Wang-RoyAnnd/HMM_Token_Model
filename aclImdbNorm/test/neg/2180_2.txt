this is supposed to be charlie's masterpiece, but i will contend that it is actually one of his weaker films. first of all, it's not funny. not one thing in this movie made me laugh. okay, there's a quick jump into a box that was a giggle, but that was one of desperation. the tramp's first - and only - talkie where he speaks (he sings in an earlier film), but his flat dialogue shows us exactly why he was such a joy to watch in "modern times" and "gold rush" - two films that are at least ten times better than this film. there's literally only one good scene in this film, the one where hitler plays with the globe like a beach ball. that's it.<br /><br />okay, so it gets a lot of praise for being the first film to wage war, even long before we entered the war. nope. not true. simply not true, so that praise can be turned down a bit. the three stooges did it on january 19, 1940 with "you natzy spy" - ten months earlier than the october release of chaplin's film - and that movie was actually funny! if you want to watch chaplin's greatest film, watch this only for reference. and then pop in "modern times", "gold rush", "city lights", "limelight", "the kid", or even "tillie's punctured romance".
