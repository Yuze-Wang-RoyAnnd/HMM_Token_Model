i think the "bone snatcher" should go after anyone associated with this movie. watching this will seem like the longest 90 minutes or so of your entire life. the plot is boring and stupid. there were no scenes that were horrifying, even remotely. if you manage to endure this fine piece of cinema art all the way to the end, you're either going to be highly disappointed or die laughing hysterically. i bought this movie based on some other reviews i'd read. i wish i had my money back. what a skunker. if you're looking for a horror movie that will hold your interest, watch "u turn". it may be based on a kooky plot, but it's full of those creepy scenes that keep you jumping from beginning to end.
