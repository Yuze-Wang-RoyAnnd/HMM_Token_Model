this is one of those road movies that would like to tell you a lotta things about women,the universe,the better life,the terrible solitude of the brilliant architect from manhattan who severs all links with everyone,including his three years old child -which may seem irresponsible to some-actually the hero wins hands down when it comes to selfishness and the scene with his old school pal ,which begins as some kind of good old days conversation and ends on a threatening note is the oasis in a desert movie.<br /><br />the scene with-the-father-who-left-home-when -i-was-a child has been told and told and told.of course it did not prevent the offspring from making his way of life.and when you see the hero's wife's attitude ,you may think she must never have heard about woman's lib.<br /><br />the best is the soundtrack which includes superb songs by willie nelson,tom waits or bonnie raitt...but you can enjoy them without this tedious pretentious work.
