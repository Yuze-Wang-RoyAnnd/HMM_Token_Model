this movie has too many things going on. another reviewer comments on the disjointed, episodic nature of the film as reflecting the director's memories - that's fine, if that is how it was written and performed. instead, what we get is straight-forward narrative - some of the time - that jumps around, under and over, leaves us dangling in some instances, interrupts the flow with unnecessary digressions in other instances, and otherwise simply doesn't work. <br /><br />there are also some plot details that just don't work. for example, why drag a body onto a beach in an urban area in broad daylight, as opposed to night time? why leave your flat sheet on the body? why would an artist who knew the joe character for a brief time decide to leave him "everything" (even if it wasn't much)? this sub-plot was poorly developed to make that point work. for that matter, why even have the man be an invalid or an artist other than to provide the money and the gratuitous nude posing scenes? he could just as easily have been a photographer, or a opera composer? for that matter, how does someone rate an apartment in an opera house - particularly without some clear connection to the opera? the coincidences are also both too obvious and to unclear and unexplained. why would the guys take everything in the warehouse and "disappear." if tim was a 10 year old school mate in a town as small as bangor, how could joe lose track of him for 8 years, especially if they knew each other well enough that one would recommend the other for a job. <br /><br />some of the other subplots (like the mother and her boyfriend(s) and the sister wanting to escape felt like padding. there's some good ideas that might have made a feature with full development or could have been interesting shorts. as completed, this movie made little sense and offers even less.
