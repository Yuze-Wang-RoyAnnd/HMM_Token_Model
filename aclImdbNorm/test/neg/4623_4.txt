wow! that james purefoy looks exactly like thomas jane!<br /><br />that's the most profound thought i took with me after having seen the rather underwhelming george and the dragon. for a fantasy comedy, the story was very dull and the effects unspectacular.<br /><br />the problem wasn't the acting. james purefoy makes a good knight, and his various side-kicks are not bad characters. i even thought patrick swayze in this role was a pretty good idea, too. flat-chested piper perabo also had some nice potential. i even liked the kid.<br /><br />but the story and everything that happens, and the *way* it happens, was just "eh". not interesting. compared to another recent fantasy comedy, ella enchanted, which was actually funny, this movie comes up terribly short. i'm sorry for the decent actors who were in this yawn-inducing trudgery.<br /><br />4 out of 10.
