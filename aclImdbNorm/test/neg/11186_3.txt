ok, it's a piece of historical film making that caused an uproar, shocked people, and was banned. i'll give it that, which is why i gave it a 3 rather than a 1. it may have been ahead of the times, but it's certainly way behind the times now. i am a big fan of salvador dali and i loved un chien andalou. that short was captivating with one creative scene after another. l'age d'or was way too long and dull - just a self-indulgent piece of pompous film making created simply as a feeble attempt to try to out-do un chien andalou by creating a full- length movie (and shamelessly leverage dali's name and fame even though he had little to do with it). total junk except for a (very) few shots of "shocking scenes" separated by long stretches of boring non-action. a waste of time and money. both of my thumbs are down, way down. it'll go onto my shelf never to be watched again.
