... a recommendation! gloria grahame runs the kind of orphanage where discipline is imparted with a meat cleaver, orphans are hung on meat hooks to punish them and the bodies are kept in the deep freeze so that they can be brought out for when social services call. that the orphanage is strapped for cash we know because gloria puts all the orphans to work, and also because there don't seem to be enough clothes to go round - especially for the older nubile female orphans (age range appears to be 12 - 30 ish). the new arrival, however, turns out to be more than a match for gloria - and has indeed just taken out her own mother & mother's lover (in a witty claw hammer and arson opening scene). predictably, gloria ends up on a meat hook herself. this one was made for about tuppence but was/is a huge huge huge hit on the grindhouse circuit. my dvd cover promised "disturbing and politically incorrect scenes", and it sure wasn't lying. i believe it is regarded as the citizen kane of orphanage set torture porn movies. 4/10
