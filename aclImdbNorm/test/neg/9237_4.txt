this for one has nothing to do with the absolutely fantastic first flick. and of course us americans just have to remake everything successful into english, because man reading subtitles is sooooo hard isn't it! from what i've see in the new trailers with the adorable now pregnant jessica alba (well that sure ruins every teenage boys fantasy everywhere doesn't it!) it looks exactly the same but probably w/double the budget. i thought the original was one of the best horror/suspense/mystery flicks i have seen in any language in quite a long while. i would recommend watching that one and skipping this one all together, there is no reason to watch this as there is no reason this even called "the eye 2" except to capitalize on the excellence that was the first flick. do yourself a favor watch "the eye" with the volume turned up and get ready for some probable jumping. i watched it w/headphones on and was pleasantly surprised on the excellence that was the direction of the pang brothers. if "the eye" remake does well which i'm hoping it does for the sake of the pang brothers movie careers, but at the same time it seems a shame that people won't/can't see the original, because very often/almost always the remake isn't as good as the original. watch this one if one wants to be mildly kinda of boring flick, but the original is no comparison to this sequel in name only flick.
