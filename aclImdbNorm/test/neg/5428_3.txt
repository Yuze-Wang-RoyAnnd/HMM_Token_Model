oh god. why is it that nickelodeon has such a hard time producing even a half-decent movie? i mean, this movie might have been good, but it was:<br /><br />a. too short b. rather superficial, stereotypical, and insulting to some c. ultimately pointless<br /><br />first of all, the "dress up the nerd to look cool" thing was very consumerist, very superficial, very pointless, and very insulting. it has the stereotypical nerds-stupid faces, glasses, never kissed, vacations with his mom, etc. well maybe the reason that guy has never kissed a girl is because he's gay! does that mean that all gays are nerds? and what's wrong with being friends with your mother?<br /><br />the worst part, by far, was the ending. the whole drama of the movie revolved around zoey finding out chase loved her, and blah blah blah, and then, when chase finally decided to tell her, <br /><br />a. he didn't tell her in person because right as he was about to the typical distraction came along b. he tried to text message her, but her pda fell into a fountain and died before she got the message.<br /><br />the end.<br /><br />how lame is that????? i mean, why is it that cartoonists just can't change anything in the series? so many of us would like to see these two get together. why can't we see it? i mean, are the producers really that uncreative, that they can't think up new problems to go with changes in the series? so they have to stick with the same plot and outlines, and make as many episodes as they can just using those? after a while, it gets dull and frustrating.<br /><br />i wanted to see some actual romance in here, darn it!<br /><br />okay. i'm done with my rant.
