the story isn't very strong. don't expect a "bourne identity" kind of movie. it started of strong, tara speaking russian and it even sounded credible. (not that i'm the russian language expert.) moscow had that darkish depressing look what gave this movie potential, i still believed in it. to bad it only took about half an hour to see they really missed the spot with this one. acting was poor, maybe because the story itself was not very strong. there is this part in the movie where gordon patrick (nick moran) is having a conversation on the phone with the c.i.a., like you're listening to a chinese synchronizer. w.t.f!? too bad, the writer didn't even take little effort to give the main characters depth. also, bit of a cheap and easy ending.<br /><br />plus point is almost every scene where tara reid is in. not that she's acting that well, in fact, she doesn't. but she really looks great in this movie. overall, it was a bit of a disappointment. rental material
