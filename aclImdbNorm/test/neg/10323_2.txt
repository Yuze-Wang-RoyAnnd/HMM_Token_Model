wait until you've watched most of all other films ever released, wait a year, then watch this when you're ready for something with such low production values it that will not challenge anybody's imagination.<br /><br />i agree that whoever rated this movie as a ten-star production has to be doing it to skew the data. anything above 8 would be odd.<br /><br />nice to see the very young sandy bullock in her poofy hair for the short time she was featured, though she overdid the new yorker accent but other times her southern (virginia & nc) accent did sneak through. ancient history for this accomplished actress who has grown so much since this film.<br /><br />the dvd i rented had two bonus features, a mini-bio section that only featured sandra's bio - taken verbatim from imdb. it also had a trivia quiz as a bonus - 3 questions. hope you get them all right!
