as someone has already mentioned on this board, it's very difficult to make a fake documentary. it requires tremendous skill, pacing, patience, directorial 'distance,' a plausible premise, a narrative 'flow,' and really believable acting (aka great acting). <br /><br />such is not the case with 'love machine'. it starts to show its faux hand about the 20-minute mark (with 60 minutes left to watch), and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in. it's downhill from there.<br /><br />director gordon eriksen simply peaked too soon. but to be fair to eriksen, his problems started early: as he explains in the extras, he began wanting to do a real doc, couldn't get funding, and settled for a cheaper way of making his film.<br /><br />the premise -- people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn website -- was perhaps more interesting in 1997-98, when the film was made. eriksen does a lot of tricky stuff -- a pushy 'host,' hand-held cameras, zooms, grainy blacks and whites -- all, i guess, to elicit a sense of authenticity, but it just doesn't work. the film is confusing and forced, but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue.
