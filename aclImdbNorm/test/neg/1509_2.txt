truly awful nonsensical garbage. this movie does everything wrong except make the running time under an hour. the gore fx defy gravity & logic. there are no scares. the acting is abysmal, with everyone appearing to be reading their lines. there's a surprise ending that's just silly where we find out that things we saw happen didn't even happen. boy do i hate cop out endings! they pad this thing out with long drawn-out shots of people doing nothing interesting(like putting on make-up or talking for what seems like forever). they have to pad out a movie that's under an hour long? ridiculous. the story itself is pretty freakin' thin. i mean it's just a variation of the movie april fool's day, if i remember that movie correctly, and that film wasn't all that great either. the only good thing i can say is it seems to have been shot well. too bad nothing happens that's very exciting.
