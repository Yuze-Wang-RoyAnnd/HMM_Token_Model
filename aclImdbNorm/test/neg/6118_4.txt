1993 was a time of change in the wwe but for this wrestlemania they decided to wind back the clock as hulk hogan returned, along with his good friend brutus beefcake, who had been out of wrestling since a paragliding accident in 1990.<br /><br />this was not a great event. only two matches had any real build and the whole thing came off as being rushed. the in ring action wasn't great and the twist at the end, which i'll discuss later, really wasn't the earth shattering moment the wwe hoped it would be.<br /><br />this forgettable night started off with shawn micheals defending his intercontinental championship against the undefeated tatanka. tatanka had beaten michaels a couple of times leading into the fight. michaels had a new manager, luna vachon while tatanka was accompanied by michaels' former manager and future wwe hall of famer sherri martel. tatanka won by dq. michaels kept his title and went straight back into his feud with marty janetty, which had been put on hold just for wrestlemania. why, i have no idea.<br /><br />next up saw the steiner brothers (scott and rick) defeat the headshrinkers (samu and fatu) with scott scoring the pin after hitting samu with the frankensteiner. good match.<br /><br />doink the clown needed help from another clown to win his match against crush. a second doink distracting crush when he was in complete control and allowing doink to get the pin and the victory. doink was an entertaining gimmick character, who got old rather quickly.<br /><br />razor ramon easily defeated the returning bob backlund in the next match.<br /><br />this brings us to the first in our double main event. as the mega maniacs team of hulk hogan and brutus beefcake, with the newly turned good guy jimmy hart in their corner, took on hart's former buddies money inc (ted dibiase and irwin r shyster). this was a fairly sketchy finish. beefcake, as mentioned, had been in a paragliding accident requiring full facial surgery and had wrestled the match with a face mask on. shyster ripped the mask off him and beat beefcake to a pulp. the ref went down, hogan grabbed the face mask and knocked out dibiase and shyster and then hart, who was wearing a referee shirt, counted the three. another ref came down and reversed the decision, declaring money inc winners by dq.<br /><br />next up lex luger or the narcissist as he was also known at the time defeated mr perfect. this match came about because luger was being managed by perfect's old manager bobby heenan. perfect had is feet on the ropes when he was pinned, but the ref missed it.<br /><br />the undertaker picked up a lacklustre dq victory in a pretty poor match against the giant gonzales. the undertaker had earned the ire of gonzales' manager harvey wippleman in 1992 and taker had defeated his big monster kamala at survivor series. wippleman vowed revenge and took it at the royal rumble as gonzales attacked taker, costing him the match. gonzales dominated undertaker in this match, but was dq'd for choking taker out with chloroform. weird finish to a bad match.<br /><br />this bought us to our main event as wwe champion bret hart, seriously challenged as champion for the first time, put his title on the line against mr fuji's unstoppable monster yokozuna. yokozuna controlled the early going, but hart resisted and then took control. he had yokozuna in the sharpshooter, surely he would give in and hart would be established as an heroic hero after taking out the big monster. but fuji had other ideas, throwing salt in hart's face, rendering the canadian helpless as yokozuna got the pin.<br /><br />what a downer ending. but wait here comes hulk hogan. he's checking hart to make sure he's ok. suddenly fuji challenges hogan to a wwe title right then and there. hogan accepts. fuji throws salt towards hogan, but hits yokozuna instead. hogan hits the leg drop and wins the match and the title. what did i just watch? and so, what most fans thought was going to be the night we either saw hart establish himself as a giant killer, or yokozuna establish himself as an unstoppable monster, we instead saw hulk hogan pick up a meaningless title win. a title that he would not defend for three months. as a matter of fact this was the only match hogan wrestled for the wwe before the king of the ring ppv in june 1993.
