the movie is nothing extraordinary. as a matter of fact, it is an insult to the horror genre. nothing about it borders on scary... not even close to the threshold of scary...<br /><br />it's just another case of "another teenage horror movie"-seen one and you've seen em all. first few minutes in the movie and you'll know what will happen next. the worst part is, the script is blunter than the most recent installment of scary movie. would have been better if it's written in spanish. and don't get me started with the inside jokes and punchlines.<br /><br />though i will give a little credit for the special effects. but trust me, like any other hollywood made horror movie, cgi's and special effects has little or no effect to a horror movie's ability to scare. in fact, it makes it worse.<br /><br />between the fresh faced anita briem and the spooky location, there's not much to see in this movie.
