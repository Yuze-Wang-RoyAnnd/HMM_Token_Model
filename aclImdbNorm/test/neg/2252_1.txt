i deliberately did not read any reviews of this movie on imdb before i watched it because i really wanted to see it and make up my own mind. i have been a big fan of qt in the past, i think we can all agree he has made some great movies, but lately he seems to have been overcome by his own mystique and disappeared up his own fundament. this "movie" proves that. it consists of few scenes of the basterds at work. it consists instead mostly of long, tedious, boring stretches of conversation between people that, after a while, you realise you just do not give a stuff about. it's longwinded and lacks any of the great sparkling dialogue that qt has been responsible for in the past. the entire movie is anticlimactic. there is no tension - what is going to happen in every scene is telegraphed so clearly in advance that by the time it happens you just don't care. honestly folks, don't believe the hype. this is a very boring movie and you will be missing nothing if you don't see it.
