first off, i'am a horror fan. but this "tobe hooper" production (come on, the man from the original texas chainsaw and poltergeist !!) was below standards, even for a fan. the acting was not bad at all, some characters were unbelievable, but the leading ladies were ok. the story was something we've seen a hundred times already, without any surprising twist or whatever. never exciting or intense, and do not count on any special effects besides blood splashing up. the scary zombie kids are white paled faces with dark eyes and that is it.. that might have worked in the early 70's but not now. director j.s. cardone didn't do a good job in keeping the suspense, half way thru there is a risk you will fall asleep. my vote is based primarily on the leading acting, but this could have easily have been called children of the corn 8: from the corn fields to the mines... enough said..
