the adventures of sebastian cole is about a boy named sebastian (adrian grenier) who fancies himself becoming a writer at some point, given he actually puts effort into it. this movie is presumably the years where he gets his material for writing, the adventure years, hence the title and the previous quote. in it we experience the very typical coming of age stories and warnings of loves, drugs, and sex...changes. yeah, there's a slight twist here that is very interesting, and that is that sebastian's step dad (clark gregg) very early on makes a rough decision to get a sex-change that has a huge impact on sebastian's family and his relationship with his step-dad.<br /><br />clark gregg plays hank/henrietta, sebastian's step-father and is very good in the part, very believable without being over the top, which is a route this film could've taken rather easily. thankfully they didn't. adrien grenier, who i'm only familiar with from entourage, is also very good in his part as sebastian, and together, he and gregg have a great relationship on screen. it's always quite engaging to watch these guys (?) relationship as it develops and is genuinely heartbreaking at times.<br /><br />and that's the best of what this film has to offer. unfortunately, it brings with it some mediocre camera work, direction, and cinematography. it's not bad, but it's a far cry from being good, or memorable in the slightest. the characters are also thinly written, and it's clear from the get go how most of the arcs will pan out. the only truly fascinating character through and through is clark gregg's hank/henrietta. i've already said grenier did well acting-wise, but the character of sebastian is not only not engaging, but is completely unlikeable. i don't honestly see why anyone in the audience would route for his character in anything he does. he mopes, whines, cheats, lies, and lacks any aspirations other than to be a complete slacker. it'd be different if he was maybe a side-character or comic relief, but to have him as the main focus and to be asked to take the character seriously? come on.<br /><br />and i don't really hold it against this film, but i just want to say...pick a different song in all these films, hollywood! no more "where is my mind" by the pixies, we all know it's a good song, stop using it in every other film!<br /><br />i feel like i could just keep tearing more and more of this film apart, but in all honesty i didn't hate it. i just didn't really care for it, and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone. the adventures of sebastian cole isn't a bad or boring film, it's just not a very good or engaging one either. it's very uneven and the script could've used quite a bit of work. i guess the point of the film is to be a loose sort of look at the life of a writer before he made it, and it worked...if that writer put out pieces of fiction that i wouldn't want to read.
