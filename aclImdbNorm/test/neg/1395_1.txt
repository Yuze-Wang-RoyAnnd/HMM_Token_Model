...so where's my friggin trophy? i seriously expected a banner and confetti to drop from my ceiling for watching a full 30 minutes of that crap. comedy central is truly dropping the ball lately, trying to fill the void left by chappelle with multiple seasons of a retarded man impersonating retarded men. dah duh nah!! if you pay attention to the show, you'll notice that when mencia isn't stuttering over punchlines and laughing at his own skits, he only makes exaggerated observations which seem to lack any sense of humor. you ever notice how people in buick's drive really slow? it's like dah duh nah! not even the midgets and half naked hot chicks manage to distract from mencia's distinct lack of talent. furthermore, mencia isn't even a "wetback" as he constantly and adamantly proclaims he is, which makes him a fraud on top of it all.<br /><br />if anything good could be said about mencia, it's his effort. the man clearly has no talent, but like a wounded antelope in the mouth of a hungry alligator, god knows he's trying.
