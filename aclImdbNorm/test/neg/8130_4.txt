greedy land baron in the tiny western town of prairie city wants all the ranchers off their land, using intimidation tactics and arson to get them to vacate; seems the town is swimming atop oil, and when a swedish farmer refuses to leave, he's mowed down by the baron's hired gun. the farmer's seafaring son soon arrives, slowly realizing what he's up against and attempting to rally the rest of the residents to fight. another lawlessness-in-the-west story, with everybody under the thumb of the villain (who naturally holds all the cards). derivative and uncomfortable at times to watch, with a long wait before our stoic hero finally gets his dander up. sterling hayden's half-hearted swedish accent is a big problem, though he cuts a sturdy, sympathetic presence on the screen and almost makes the picture worth-watching. director joseph h. lewis stages most of the scenes stiffly, like a tv western, and gerald fried's bugle-heavy score is no help, though the rich black-and-white cinematography by ray rennahan is excellent. an independent production released via united artists, the film has a bizarre start (beginning with shots from the finale, followed by shots from the movie's midsection), yet it does have a certain needling power which most assuredly gets the viewer on hayden's side. ** from ****
