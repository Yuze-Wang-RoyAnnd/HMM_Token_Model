this movie was awful, especially considering the work that must have gone into its production. though it's not as bad as ax 'em, it is quite awful. take into account the obvious rip-offs from gladiator and raiders of the lost ark, and what do you get? this smorgasbord of awful make-up and wooden acting.<br /><br />the movie starts as most zombie movies nowadays do. a montage of interesting jump-cuts and a radio broadcast of the outbreak at hand. we see our hero (ryn, quite possibly the worst 'zombie hunter' in modern era; counted about four or five times where he either scratched his head with the barrel of his pistol or looked down the barrel while blowing) cutting off fingers of zombies. we later learn that these fingers are collected for bounties.<br /><br />well, ryn seems to be a rebel in his ways of dispensing of zombies; going so far as to purchase chum *gasp* from his french buddy hans (who isn't really french, speaks with an odd middle-eastern accent). as ryn uses the chum to collect a plentiful bounty from lost hills, all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />and cue the awfulness of the movie. the zombies are put together quite poorly. i've seen comments praising their make-up, but it was quite amateur in my opinion. obvious halloween adhesives were used to make the zombies' faces and there were points at which one girl looked as if she were donning a clown mask instead of a freshly peeled face. oy vey.<br /><br />to sum the next sixty minutes up in a few lines: ryn is back stabbed by hans (who made a deal with some other zombie hunters, blythe being the ringleader), gives him a second chance, gets back stabbed again by hans, then shoots hans and gets to union city where he finds blythe is poisoning the cities for profit.<br /><br />that's it really in regards to plot. when ryn reaches union city all the baddies are gathered around in a house that evidently is so massive it takes ryn hours to reach the top floor. people die, ryn lives, and the movie ends with one of those cynical "is he going to kill himself?" scenes.<br /><br />*end spoilers* i'm going to have to blame most of this mess on nott. the direction was awful. every character featured a scowl other than hans, who was easily the best 'actor' in this group of macbeth rejects. when they reach union city, a hoard of zombies attacks the crew and the zombies were obviously given no tips or ideas about how to walk as if your appendages were rotten. one woman is swaying as if she's swimming in mid-air on a sunday stroll.<br /><br />some movies are awful. this movie is one of them simply on the grounds of how logic seemed to be abandoned in order to keep a story flowing. works occasionally, but in this regard (where the story was already in shambles), it doesn't.<br /><br />avoid it unless you want a decent laugh.
