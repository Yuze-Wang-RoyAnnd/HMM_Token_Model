after watching stop-loss, i find myself against disappointed in hollywood for making such a stinker. gone are the days of glory of the films of the 1940's that made one proud to be an american, fighting the evilness that desires conquest abroad and death at home. what we are left with is dribble frothing at the mouth of rabid anti-bush radicals. the story tells of three young men who return home from the war. one descends into out-of-control madness, culminating in his death. the main protagonist deserts his country at a time of war, and destroys his best friends relationship with his fianc'e at the same time. the third truly is the hero of the story, electing to continue the fight that was brought to our shores nearly eight years ago. what makes this movie bad, is not the acting, but the premise behind it. we are lead to believe that decorated soldiers are in fact haters of our country. desertion is akin to treason in a time of war, and the main protagonist flirts with it throughout the movie. this paradox is designed to weaken the audience's reaction to the central act of the movie. we are not supposed to find fault with king, since he wears medals, but his actions don't just merit it, but cry out for it. he is not an anti-hero. in order to accept the movie, the audience must accept the correctness of desertion because the story paints king as nothing else short of a hero. i cannot accept that, since it is like asking me to call the sky yellow on a clear blue day. furthermore, derision for the real hero is heaped upon, the man who re-enlists and continues to serve his country. i would only recommend this stinker to someone who needs convincing of the decay of hollywood, as it is a clear example of it. no wonder it fared poorly in the box office.
