to start this movie was sick. here your wife is dying and you go strutting around town with this blond chic by your side. then your wife dies and within 2 months you are together with this chic. hank (james brolin) is definitely moving fast throughout this movie. i called him fast hank. fast hank marries this beautiful lady and before you know it she is having sex with his best friends. the part that gets me is when she is "doing it" in the barn with kevin and gets caught by another one of hanks friends. kevin gets up and leaves, she drops her robe and bam!! right into the arms of this other guy and they start "doing it" right then and there. i guess he is finishing up what kevin started. how gross!!!! i am like this is lifetime movie??? its a typical old man young woman movie that says you can have my body if i get your money...
