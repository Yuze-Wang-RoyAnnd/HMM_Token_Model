"you got any beans? beans is good. you just eat them and you go." i couldn't help but laugh at that bit of dialog. beans are the musical fruit, you know. the more you eat them, the more you go toot, toot, toot.<br /><br />hmmmm... ok, i can understand why the actors were in this because they needed paychecks to pay their bills with, but i'm not really too sure what the intentions of the director and the writer were. even after watching the making-of documentary in the dvd extras.<br /><br />mike rooker gave this a performance it really didn't deserve. i've seen him in other movies much better than this one. what would have vastly improved this movie was to throw everything out, keep rooker and instead made another entry into "the substitute" franchise. rooker would have made for a terrific substitute teacher who instructs naughty and morally-impaired youth regarding the error of their ways and how they can become more useful and productive members of society.<br /><br />casper, you really shouldn't be just pushing through the undergrowth like that as you could get poison oak. whoops. never mind. i guess poison oak is the least of your worries now. well, at least this time your croaking wasn't done by the tail of giant python. there are few things more embarrassing than being skewered through the chest by a giant snake. at least the death scene in this movie had a bit more dignity to it. as well as a more liberal smearing of karo syrup and red food dye. nothing says sad and tragic death like the liberal use of karo and red dye!<br /><br />first time i've seen a monster wear a shiny rayon cape with a fur collar ruff. first time for everything, i guess. just to be nitpicky, though, if this was an indian ghost, how come it looked exactly like a monster out of european culture and folklore? wouldn't the monster have been more sort of more indianish?<br /><br />while i did watch this all the way to the end credits, i don't realistically believe that i could in good faith recommend it to others.
