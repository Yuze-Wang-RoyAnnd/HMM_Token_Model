if you are going to make a movie from any book, be sure that the characters are consistant with that book. this movie not only defied the biblical story that has been told for thousands upon thousands of years to children one way or another, but it clearly took liberties that no adaptation would probably ever try. at least the lord of the rings is close enough to the books that people understand the story more if they read the books than this "noah's ark" tried to.
