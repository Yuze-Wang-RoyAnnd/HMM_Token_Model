this movie deviated from the bible and fell so below the bar of the 1956 movie. i hate that they replaced the 2006 movie over the traditionally seen 10 commandments. moses looked like a criminal in this movie, not like the kind looking man charelston heston in the 1956 movie. i will not waste my time again watching this movie. they tried so hard to modernize this movie in order to keep you on the edge that it was more like a soap opera (and not a good one at that). i'm pretty sure that younger ones out there who never paid attention to the original 10 commandments may disagree with me, but to each his own. also, it took them 10 years to make the first 10 commandments, it probably took them 2 months to make this one. the special effects were not as amazing as the first one and after all these years with so much technology, you would have thought they would have done better now.
