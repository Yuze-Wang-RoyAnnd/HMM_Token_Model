this review contains spoilers. i didn't have any expectations about this movie. i pulled it off the video store rack with the movie, "white noise".<br /><br />first, the credits for this stupid movie run about 5 minutes into it. the pacing from start to finish is slooooow. the main heroines don't like to wear a bra and the director appears to enjoy the jiggle effect as anna paquin descends the stairs. if you like movies for boobies, this one has a low level buzz factor.<br /><br />second, it's nice that the movie rips off elements of lovecraft and other horror genre mechanisms, but in better movies, there is at least some rational or consistently irrational behavior. this stinker tries to establish some sense of modernity and reality but then you have situations where no one calls the police even though they've uncovered a treasure trove of potentially incriminating forensic evidence, and otherworldly rituals are nicely spelled out in a comprehensive book on otherworldly rituals like on buffy. i was waiting for miles to show up and give some consultation on how to slay a certain demon type of so and so.<br /><br />the premise is that it is possible to open up an age of darkness where creatures that crawl on the ceiling can cut your throat or turn the meat grinder effect on you. ho hum. to do this you need to have a sacrificial circle and then have seven kids who must have their throat cuts by people who love them. this opens the world to the age of darkness. at least that's what it says in complete detail in the book of ancient occult rituals. which raises the annoying question of, uh, well, how did the ones who wrote the book know, and, if this is what happens, would you really leave this information in a book you can take out from the library, much less get it from a library in a world that is not covered already in darkness, an age brought on by lunatics who could have performed this like much earlier using the "occult practices to bring the world to darkness for dummies, 2nd edition"? it turns out the father in the story is the 7th child, the one that ran away from the ritual 40 years ago; he was released by his father, who is the doctor/grandfather in the movie, who wanted to try the ritual with presumably, other stupid parents, who just wanted to see if dumb sh*t like this opening the world to darkness actually works. the grandpa let the father go because he "didn't really love him". aduh. stupid stupid movie written by a moronic director who appears to think he's some kind of eurofilm auteur. there's also a scene in the movie where the kid appears with big welts on his face and the mother grabs him and has this total lack of reaction. the whole movie is like this. people seeing really weird sh*t going on and not reacting to it in any sort of normal way. must be bad plot and direction.<br /><br />anna paquin does her best to play her character realistically without cracking a smirk, and she does look smashing in a halter top, but at several critical moments in the story, her character doesn't bother to call in for back up. you know, more of the same, "i will walk into a likely demonic evil situation without any knowledge of defense or help from others carrying flashlights or firepower even though i sense impending doom." and even dumber as it may seem, even if you bring on the age of darkness, these creatures who make you bloody can't attack if you have a light source, but they appear as people you know, and tell you to turn off the light source. reminds me of the video game "alone in the dark"; maybe this movie is a rip off of that game's concept.<br /><br />the best actors in the film are the young kid and anna. they both die at the end. the entire family dies. the darkness creatures lead them to their death, but really, the stupidity of the characters in the family was the main cause of death. the other adults could be interchangeable with any other actors from the red shoes diaries series of fine cinema.<br /><br />so to wrap up, the worst things about this movie are the stupidity of the characters in bumping around blindly in an obviously abnormal situation, the really crap plot (there is an old architect in the story who designs a house with a sacrificial altar hidden in it - the architect has suspected from the beginning there would be occult sacrifices in the house but doesn't tell anyone because, well, no real reason, they couldn't find the kids, but he didn't bother to tell authorities about the hidden rooms which he designed into the house but he does like to hang around the house for a 40 year period because he worries about what is going on inside...derrrrh...duuuuh), the hackneyed use of scare mechanisms (more children standing around in the dark or only showing up in photographs, and blood on the wallpaper), and the egotism of the director which when you see him in the dvd features describing his crap work as a new and original rendition, makes you understand where the real horror of this movie lies.<br /><br />is it entertaining? at 2x speed on a dvd player with the subtitles turned on, it can be entertaining, until your reach the end and realize the movie is crap, otherwise it draaaaaaaags on. the cinematic equivalent of a fatty shake; the empty calories are horrid.<br /><br />the movie gives the feeling the director must have seen "the ring" and wanted to attempt to create something similar in mood, which in this respect, the film fails miserably, and so, also, in this respect, jaume balaguer'o, it is my opinion that you suck at what you do.
