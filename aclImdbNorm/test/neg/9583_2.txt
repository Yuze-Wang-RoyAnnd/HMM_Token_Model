seems like a pretty innocent choice at first- the name "employee of the month" might ring bells with "office space," and the show "office clerk." i think not. this isn't even a dark comedy. the director of this movie, whoever the guy's name, was a complete jerk, and has a sick, perverse mind. there is no pleasure in being lured into feeling sorry for a complete loser who cheats on his wife, steals from his top-notch job, and lies through his teeth 24/7. the second i walk in to the room when my family are watching it (and believe me, they were only watching it more because they were praying that there would be at least some relief, perhaps even some fable in the end, sending a warm message of good justice done and when the good guys look good). all the good guys were killed so long ago that they had no time to look good. no memorial was made.<br /><br />this movie has borderline insanity. it disrespects the elderly, the dead and women- and the director tries to make people to like it.<br /><br />i gave this movie a two only because the soundtrack was good. but not even that was all that memorable. if you were lucky enough to not see this in theaters, definitaly my friends- do not do this at home.
