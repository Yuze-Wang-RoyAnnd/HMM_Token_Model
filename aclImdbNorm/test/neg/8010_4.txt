years ago "ma2412" the feature film tried to be some kind of "regional blockbuster" in austria. one thing's for sure: i hope no one outside will ever have to see this one. perhaps if you are familiar with the original sitcom it could be interesting to watch what director sicheritz made of his series. i think he missed his chance and wasted time and money.<br /><br />so far many director's and writers have failed to make a series concept compatible to a 90min movie (consider alf, inspector gadget...). you can see how hard this is by watching "ma 2412". the result of this attempt in my opinion tastes like a never-ending tv-episode (and not a good one). it fails to deliver a plot, the humor tries too hard and the directing seems very unfocused - as holds true for the visual style.<br /><br />so summing up i'd clearly not recommend this one...
