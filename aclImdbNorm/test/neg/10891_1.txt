there are movies that are so bad, they're good. then there's movies like rest stop that should just never have been made because they are just plain dreadful.<br /><br />bad acting, unlikable characters, predictable plot and a supposedly supernatural twist that adds nothing to the story are all key failures. some half decent special effects are about the only thing worthy of note. <br /><br />i can't even bring myself to write a plot outline because all i really want to do here is warn you not to waste your time and money on this movie. do yourself a favour and don't even bother with this film at all. it's 1.5 hours of your life that you will never get back. <br /><br />1/10
