i haven't read the book of this and based on this adaptation, will not bother. i hated every character in this show - miranda was slutty, selfish and mumbled miserably through the appalling dialogue, her sister was a total wimp, and this was the worst depiction of manic-depression i have ever seen. i have a degree in psychology, and this was not accurate. in fact, until it was mentioned, i did not realise troy was supposed to be bipolar - i thought he was a normal, slightly grumpy teenager.<br /><br />the only saving grace in this stupid show was david tennant, whose brilliantly psychotic performance was the only thing that got me to watch the second half. <br /><br />clearly the writers and producers of this show have not done any research - troy's mental problems are not remotely accurate, nor are the forensics involved in the "twist" ending (and if you did not spot that a mile off, you are a big ole dummy!) <br /><br />utter garbage.
