i don't see the sense in going through so much trouble to make a movie like this, and then throw the history book out the window. there wasn't a single accurate detail in that movie other than the fact than richtofen died, which i was grateful for at the end so i didn't have to watch any more. movies like this are an insult to anyone who knows anything about wwi aerial history.<br /><br />i'll skip the obvious, that they were flying fokker dvii's in 1916, because the blue max did that too, or that 209 squadron was flying se-5's, and will attack other parts. for one thing, they call the pfalz d-iii an 'old albatross' at the beginning. for another, they have voss, goring, and wolff all in jasta boelcke. the only one who was in that jasta was voss, and he joined after boelcke died. richtofen wasn't held to blame for boelcke's death...erwin boehme, who collided with boelcke, had swerved to avoid a british plane that richtofen was chasing. when richtofen received his head wound, it was while attacking a fe-2d two-seater, and he did not crash into the trenches and have soldiers fight over him, and no..werner voss did not die that day. he died september 28th in one of the most epic battles in wwi.<br /><br />manfred was short, not like the actor who towered over everyone else. his brother lothar was never in jasta boelcke either, he joined the squadron when manfred was in charge of jasta 11.<br /><br />there's so many other glaring errors in historical fact that i'll let them go except perhaps the worst one, the death scene. in the movie manfred is out-maneuvered by brown and then shot down, making a perfect landing. brown got off one burst at richtofen while richtofen was chasing may, and the facts amassed over the years overwhelmingly show that richtofen was killed by ground fire, not by brown.<br /><br />the only value in this movie was the chance to see the flying scenes themselves, which were as good as 'the blue max', other than that i won't watch it again and i paid $30 for the tape!
