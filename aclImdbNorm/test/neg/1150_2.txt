i had the unlucky experience of stumbling upon a preview for this movie and thought it might be interesting. i am a fan of the two main actors, and i even find meatloaf to be oddly appealing, but that couldn't compensate for the droning plot of this movie. this movie attempts to make social comments and be artfully intelligent. i am sure the audience gets the sociological message clearly, but has to suffer in the process. personally, no matter how bad the movie is, i can't stop it in the middle. something drives me to finish the worst of movies, but i often regret it. this is one of those...
