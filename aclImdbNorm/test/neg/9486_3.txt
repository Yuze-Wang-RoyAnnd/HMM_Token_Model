this movie was alright. mary-kate and ashley play twin sisters (sorry for stating the obvious) who against their will are sent to paris to spend the week with their rich uncle or something like that.<br /><br />right away two french boys (who looked slightly inbred) start talking to them and taking interest. blah blah blah. it's an olsen twin movie - we already know what's going to happen between them. anyway, along with that, the twins meet a fabulous french model because they're in paris, the fashion capital of the world. they make bffs with the model and spend a fun montage of shopping in the city of lights. yep.<br /><br />plotwise, i frankly can't remember what happened. i guess that could say something, but hey, it's an olsen movie. "olsen movie" seems to be synonymous with "light entertainment".<br /><br />overall, this movie was annoying. i mean, can i really identify at all with two girls who are devastated upon hearing that they're going to paris? really? also, the jokes really weren't that funny. however, i watched the whole movie. so it had to be somewhat entertaining. the fact that it was set in paris was what probably kept me watching.
