cybertracker is set in los angeles sometime in the near future where bodyguard eric phillips (co-producer don 'the dragon' wilson) saves senator robert dilly (john aprea) from an assassination attempt by a group known as the uhr, the union of human rights, who are angry at dilly for spearheading the computerised judicial system in which robots called cybertrackers are sent out to determine & dispense justice on the guilty. anyway, eric saves dilly who is very impressed & decides to see if he can trust eric in his shady activities like the cold blooded murder of a traitor, being the fine upstanding guy that he is eric isn't impressed when dilly kills a woman & he is asked to keep it quiet. eric escapes & sets out to bring dilly down, however dilly has lots of powerful friends & he uses his influence to frame eric & have his cybertrackers sent out in pursuit of him...<br /><br />co-produced & directed by richard pepin i think films like cybertracker give films a bad name, i didn't like it that much at all. the script by jacobsen hart is pretty predictable, it doesn't excite, it steals most of it's ideas & theme from other better sci-fi films & the heady mix of martial arts action & sci-fi don't gel that well. there a few fights, some car chases & a couple of shoot outs but it's all rather bland & forgettable. the film lacks imagination considering the film is set in the future & it deals with robots, technology & the way society is run & it's judicial system in particular. speaking of which the fantastic robocop (1987) mixed it's violent action & clever social commentary brilliantly but cybertracker doesn't even try to make any relevant social statement or try to portray any meaningful moral message about law enforcement, the script basically uses the concept to have robots & shoot outs which robocop did as well but also managed to include a good story. there is very little in cybertracker that i can say was entertaining & that's what films are about right?<br /><br />director pepin does ok but nothing stands out, it's all rather forgettable & it's not particularly exciting. the sci-fi elements are nothing more than the robot side of things & as a whole the film doesn't look that futuristic. the action scenes are alright, there's some exploding cars & some shoot outs but nothing spectacular.<br /><br />technically cybertracker is average, for a film supposedly set in the future it already looks dated & the special effects are poor. the acting was bad, i wonder if don 'the dragon' wilson signs cheques with that name?<br /><br />cybertracker was a waste of my time, there is nothing here original or exciting & the action is instantly forgettable. poor & that's all that needs to be said, not recommended.
