for a while when i was in-between jobs i had a habit of watching all the late night talk shows. for a while i had a good selection: conan, leno, letterman, ferguson, kimmel...<br /><br />until i reached the 1:30 a.m. time slot. the time between conan and x- files, on scifi. and the only show on at that time was (and curiously still is) carson daly.<br /><br />his show intrigued me at first. youngish, casually dressed, and with the hip pedigree of an mtv host, i thought carson would bring a younger aesthetic to late night. i couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />he has no comedic timing. his jokes are plainly unfunny, and his monologue a painful affair of self-conscious babbling. i began to think he simply wasn't capable of delivering comedy (and i am right, he isn't), but it became obvious over time that the writers on the show must have had it in for him. the writing was idiotic and much too overreaching and the skits screamingly bad. and towards the end of the show being in-studio, the writers had carson drinking alcohol on the set with gusto on every show, an oblivious carson grinning from emaciated cheek to emaciated cheek as he sloshed his way through interviews.<br /><br />zero interview skills. none. he tries to be friendly/chatty, but ends up being boorish and rude. he talks too much. he cuts off his guests. he asks them rude or embarrassing questions -- if he can find a question to ask them at all. and as someone had already pointed out, the guests literally stare at him or squirm in their seats, clearly uncomfortable.<br /><br />now the show has left the studio and looks as though it were shot on one handy cam. even still, carson refuses to take the hint from nbc. at one point, carson didn't even get a camera man, he had to film himself for an episode! wake up, carson...that handwriting is all over the wall.<br /><br />i see the show is produced by carson. i can only imagine that is the reason it is still on the air, he pays for it himself.
