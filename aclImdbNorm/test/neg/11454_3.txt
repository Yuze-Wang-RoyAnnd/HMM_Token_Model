like a lot of films from the early sounds days, cimarron must be viewed more for historical interest than as compelling entertainment. the hammy acting of lead richard dix, nominated for best actor, can be excused as a relic of the silent-film school of acting. however, even giving benefits of the doubt, cimarron is a badly shaped piece of drama -- a bloated film that moves from unrelated sequence to unrelated sequence with little dramatic impact. offically, the film is two hours and four minutes; it feels like four hours when you're watching it. there is no reason to waste your time on it unless you want to see every best picture winner or have a keen interest in the early sound days. in my opinion, cimarron is the worst choice for best picture in academy history and the award should have gone to city lights or little ceasar. cimarron is barely remembered today, and would have be remembered at all if not for its oscar win.
