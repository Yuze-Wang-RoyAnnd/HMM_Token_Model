weak tale of an evil warlock who is searching for a centuries old satanic bible so that he can do lucifer's bidding by undoing creation. hot in pursuit all the way is a 17th centruy bounty hunter named redfern and his reluctant sidekick kassandra. sound like a load of bunkum? it is.<br /><br />this drivel from writer d.t. twohy gets the superficial treatment it deserves from director steve miner (who helmed that romantic nonsense "forever young"). twohy obviously knows nothing about true evil.<br /><br />julian sands just flies around and cackles, trying to look evil, while richard e. grant succeeds only in wasting his rich talent. lori singer's career also took a nosedive with this one.<br /><br />special effects crew has some fun, and jerry goldsmith provides a score superior to its subject matter.
