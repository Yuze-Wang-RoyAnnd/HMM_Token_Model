this was pretty inevitable. this movie borrows from "the core" and from the film it borrowed from, "armageddon", and the films it borrowed from and so on. except this time there's luke perry too. this films version of the familiar save-the-world plot involves super-earthquakes beginning in the pacific northwest and extending too the whole ring of fire. its soon determined that everybody on earth just might be doomed. so the military and some scientists build one of those high-tech drilling machines to go inside the earth and fix things (it just wouldn't be as much fun if they didn't have to go somewhere like space or inside the planet). there's even a line the tries to make the journey into the earth sound more impressive than the journey into space (like the one in "armageddon"). it's a sci-fi network movie, so the script is paint by numbers disaster movie. there is in-fighting between scientists and military guys, there are rock-melting lasers, people die and sacrifice themselves for the good of all, and above all, there are (weak cgi) special effects. not original and not all that entertaining. this is a movie to watch when you have nothing to do, particularly if you've got beer.
