i watched this episode with high hopes after seeing it on so many people's "favourite episodes" list. i'm not boasting in any way, but from the start, i realised they were in some sort of toybox/can, with the huge eye looking down on them, to the type of characters in there. even though throughout the episode, the questions of "who are we?", "where are we?", "what's outside?" carry the suspense of the episode (which i unfortunately already figured out), i must say that different types of characters and the interaction between them did make the episode interesting enough. although the twist of the story may have been harder to guess if all of them were (toy) soldiers.
