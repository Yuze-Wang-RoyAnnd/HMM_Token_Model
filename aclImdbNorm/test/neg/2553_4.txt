i must say i was disappointed with this film. although it is well acted and directed, the underlying story simply plods along too slowly.<br /><br />granted, in another mood i would have liked it better. i did chuckle a lot, but rarely laughed out loud; and there was actually a sense of suspense to discover who won. but in contrast to another movie that my wife picked up the same day (one neither of us had heard of before) this one paled in comparison.<br /><br />if you see lots of movies, then by all means see this -- it's distinctly better than your average fare. but if you (like me) have limited time and want to watch only the best and most entertaining, save this for later.<br /><br />[rate: 7/10]
