someone should teach the people who made this movie that there is a difference between "presenting multiple twists" and "screwing the audience over". they even use hypnosis as a tool to cover up the plot holes; whenever they can't find their way into or out of a scene, they just say "she is regressing to her past now" or "she's snapping out of it now", and they think that explains everything. this movie is a dishonest cheat and in the last 20 minutes becomes a full-blown fiasco.
