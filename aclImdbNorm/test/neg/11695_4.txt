as far as asian horror goes, i have seen my share of disappointments along with some of the creepiest sh*t imaginable... "acacia" doesn't really qualify for either of those categories. it had a few moments of tension and was interesting to watch, yet i couldn't help think that there should have been a tad more to this story. the film deals with a childless couple who decide to adopt a kid who appears to have a fascination with trees. he develops a bond with the acacia tree in their yard and seems to communicate with it. then, during a fight with his mother involving their new birth child, he storms off after threatening to find his dead mother who is now a tree. when he doesn't come back, the parents send file a report and wait, while the neighbor girl believes he somehow inhabits the acacia tree. the pacing is rather slow and the ending gets a bit weird, but i have to recommend this as a slightly enjoyable effort, though the story feels a little flat. hell, i can't really make up my mind on this...
