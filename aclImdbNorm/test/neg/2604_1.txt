i must admit i did enjoy the earlier episodes, but probably because i was younger and stupid at the time. i was sorta excited about the return of family guy until i saw the "new" crap they were putting out. no surprise, it was exactly like the old crap. all the lame jokes were there including the flash backs, except this time they added a joke about a old creepy pedophile who seems to be in every single episode. this is just one of the annoying gags family guy lives off of, and for some reason people keep watching. its no longer funny, its just annoying. let it die.<br /><br />maybe family guy was funny at a point in time, and the cheap laughs and gags were original and fresh, but now its just not funny anymore. if you actually do find family guy funny than you must be retarded or borderline retarded.
