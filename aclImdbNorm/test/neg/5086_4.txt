**warning - this review may contain spoilers ** <br /><br />the idea behind the character of danny (jet li) is a good one - young boy is taken by hoodlum and raised to behave like a vicious pitbull, controlled mainly by whether his collar is on or off his neck.<br /><br />however, the writer did not know how to deliver this idea within the constraints of believability.<br /><br />he has danny meeting a blind pianist, sam (morgan freeman), who has to be the most trusting fool a man ever was - along with his nit-wit, endlessly babbling, rather unattractive step-daughter, victoria (kerry condon). i was stunned, by the way, when i learned victoria was supposed to be 18 - she looked 25 or 30 to me.<br /><br />amazingly there is no romance between danny and victoria.<br /><br />when danny turns up again, wounded, what does sam do but take him straight home. danny is out for 2 days, but do these nit-wits take him to a hospital? nooooo. i don't know if they even called in a doctor.<br /><br />now danny is obviously not a mentally stable person, this is apparent from the get-go, yet sam takes him into his home, where both he and his step-daughter could have been seriously harmed or even killed by this rather strange, young man.<br /><br />why morgan freeman took this insipid role in this asinine film i can't even begin to guess. surely mr. freeman is not that desperate for a paycheck.<br /><br />then we have bob hoskins as bart, the gangster who "owns" danny - now you talk about a son of a gun that's hard to kill. the car bart is in gets riddled with bullets that would have rivaled bonnie and clyde's demise. we think he's dead, but no.<br /><br />then we have another car accident - and yet again, ol' bart escapes unscathed.<br /><br />in addition to that, we also have danny fighting half a dozen tough guys at a time, plus a scene where danny has decided he doesn't want to fight any more. i don't care how much a person doesn't want to fight, when it is down to the wire of you fight or you die, i think anyone would fight.<br /><br />as i said in the subject heading - this film is about 40 miles outside the boundary of reality as we have come to know it. it's not just a case of suspending belief - it's completely beyond that.<br /><br />furthermore i never did understand why danny's mother who turns out to be a nice lady, rather than the prostitute bart claimed she is, became mixed up with bart and his gang and got shot. maybe that was my fault, i got distracted right about the time that scene came on--but it seemed highly unlikely she and bart would have ever crossed paths.<br /><br />4 stars out of 10 - and that's being generous.
