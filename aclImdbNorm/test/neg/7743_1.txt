and the title says it all: a cheesy sounding title that is a cheesy sounding joke of a film known as "alien from l.a." why not just call it "alien from south africa," as this is the place where this movie was filmed? my advice for watching movies that have been featured on "mystery science theater 3000:" do not watch the original version of the movie at all! period! always watch the movie with the theater shadow at the bottom of the screen, with a man trapped in space with his two funny, wise-cracking robot friends sitting at the lower right hand corner of the screen. it just seems better that way.<br /><br />movie as it was originally seen: awful! movie as it was seen on mst3k: genius!
