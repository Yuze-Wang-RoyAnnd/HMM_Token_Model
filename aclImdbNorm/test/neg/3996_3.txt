i was initially interested in this film after reading a synopsis and seeing a few striking screenshots, and the promise was there for a gripping horror film of the dario argento style. admittedly i must say that argento's films have occasionally been rather incoherent, and some feel like a handful of visually impacting set pieces loosely strung together with a vague connecting plot.<br /><br />since argento is credited as writer for this, i have to say, i'm not really surprised. even his masterpiece suspiria, when examined, exhibits the same tendency to string along sometimes unrelated scenes purely for the aesthetic impact. however, suspiria also had the benefit of a singular main character and clear antagonists, as well as scenes that contributed ultimately to the eventual resolution.<br /><br />the church, on the other hand, has none of these things. it has no main character, no protagonist whatsoever; it furthermore has no real plot to speak of, and no crescendo, no climax, no denouement, and no resolution. it is a completely hollow, incoherent work that views as if argento sat down and thought 'hey, that would make an interesting scene visually...let's do it!' the film is a series of these scenes.<br /><br />initially it might be interesting, and soavi's direction is excellent, i must say. soavi cannot be faulted for the material, as it is made as compelling as possible. however, such good direction calls attention to the horrible failings of the script, and there is absolutely no sense in it. the attempt at a central unifying plot is nothing more than plagiarism of carpenter's film prince of darkness. events happen solely because the script wishes them to, and reactions to those events are completely implausible. the narrative flow is irreparably damaged after a point, simply because there is no ability to suspend disbelief; it's too ludicrous. added to this are numerous factual errors that are so glaringly showcased that it becomes embarrassing.<br /><br />if it had been more overtly artistic and edited down into a different work, it might have been chilling or tense. if it had been fleshed-out into an actual cohesive narrative, it might have been gripping. but it was none of these. the best it managed was confusing and, at times, infuriating. plots are introduced but never followed. characters are forgotten about and altered arbitrarily. no logic is ever applied to any situation. it might have been scary or interesting, but to elicit that sort of feeling takes more effort on the part of a screenwriter...much more.<br /><br />all in all, the church is not worth viewing for anyone but total enthusiasts of italian horror that is more style than substance. this is argento's style at its worst, and it is a strong justification for the usual criticism.
