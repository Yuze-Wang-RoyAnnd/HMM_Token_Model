was this supposed to be a comedy? the black cape and skeleton mask are hilarious. there is like zero plot. the movie starts out with an archaeologist and his assistant. they make a small mention of their dig site being cursed. and then, lo and behold......in drops halloween costume man, dressed in the shiny black cape, with a skeleton mask face, holding an axe. so, he kills off these two people. then we cut to the woods with a bad imitation of predator, only the commandos are being hunted down by halloween costume man who is now riding a horse! more commandos show up, but these people are supposed to be disguised as a hiking group. yeah, production probably ran out of commando costumes. can you say, low budget? anyway, they come upon a lone old indian guy sitting in the woods. he's just too funny. and he starts babbling about something, but you really don't know what he's mumbling about, so they flashback to some indians getting killed. none of it really makes sense. and then we go back to our commandos where more of them get killed. and that's really basically the plot. it's so laughably bad, you just can't really look away because you want to see just how low it sinks. you could make the same movie with a camcorder, a halloween costume and a bunch of your friends with fake guns. don't see this thing if you want a horror movie. if you want a comedy, maybe? or just skip it and get something like the real predator.
