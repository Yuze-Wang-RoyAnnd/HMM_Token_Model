i have just wasted my saturday night watching this crap! i saw the names of chris noth (mr. big, from "sex & the city"), robert patrick (from "x-files"), the decadent elliot gould, colm meaney and mercedes ruehl on the credit; a very reasonable imdb rating (5,6); and many good reviews in imdb. for my total surprise, the film is horrible: the characters are badly constructed; the story tries to be funny, but it is totally silly; the character of mercedes ruehl is amazingly stupid for a professor of princeton. so, i decided to investigate the credibility of the good reviews, and i found that most of them are made by imdb users with only review, therefore relatives or friends of the cast and crew, or people hired to promote this garbage. my vote is three.<br /><br />title (brazil): "sem retorno" ("without return")
