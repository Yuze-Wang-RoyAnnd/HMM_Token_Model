i don't really know why but i watched this with quite a sense of anticipation. unfortunatly it was misplaced. firstly this is not horror, it doesn't scare and (unless it was even worse than i gave it credit for - which is possible) doesn't try to. it's a trashy comedy and the fact i smiled once means i gave it a 2 not a 1. this film ripps of gremlins in a truly special way, i can't claim to have ever seen a film which devotes its self more. very, very bad - avoid.
