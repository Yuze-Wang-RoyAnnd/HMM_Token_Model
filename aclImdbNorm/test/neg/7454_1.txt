this is by far the worst thing i have ever seen on film. my uncle's home movies have more talent in them then this piece of crap.<br /><br />the plot summary is basically that these twin kick boxers are playing some sick survival game with a man and his private army on some island. the man has a very cheap paper mach'e looking hand.<br /><br />the acting is atrocious in this movie. there are scene changes at the drop of the hat. for instance, for at least 30 seconds we see some guy humming a song to himself which adds nothing to the movie. this has the worst dialogue i have ever heard of in my life, i don't think this movie could get any worse then it already is. i would describe it as a want to be chuck norris action film gone wrong. and i hate chuck norris.
