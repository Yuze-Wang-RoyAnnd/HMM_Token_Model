"red sonja" is flawed, weak and lacking. even the camp-ness isn't good.<br /><br />there are only two good things about "red sonja"; the costumes (even though the red sonja costume is ridiculous. it's ironic that a girl who is even afraid to be touched by men, because she was raped, still choose to wear so few little clothes, even when it rains.) and the music by ennio morricone. still the movie is somewhat watchable but certainly not recommendable.<br /><br />the story is extremely simple and they didn't even bother to make it interesting. the story could have been forgotten if there had been some good action sequences and some humor, both are present but are seriously flawed in many ways. the movie takes itself too serious and tries to impress but fails completely.<br /><br />brigitte nielsen is an horrible leading lady. i don't know who's accent is worse; hers or arnie's and on top of that; she can't act. there is also absolutely no chemistry between the two characters which makes the love story totally unbelievable. even worse was sandahl bergman as the main villain who acts more poorly than a paper bag. ronald lacey was somewhat good in his role, but my god he looked horrible, he changed so much since his (only well known) role in "raiders of the lost ark". maybe it had something to do with his illness which claimed his life in 1991? and by the way, what was with all those "raiders of the lost ark" actors in this movie? next to ronald lacey, pat roach, terry richards and tutte lemkow appeared in a role, it seemed like some kind of "raiders of the lost ark" reunion.<br /><br />the only times when the movie gets a bit interesting is during the (sword)fights even though some of them are needless and weak.<br /><br />only really watchable for the fans of the fantasy-genre.<br /><br />4/10
