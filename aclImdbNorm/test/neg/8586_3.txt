i looked forward to seeing this movie, because the trailer made it look so cool. but the fact is that this movie is boring, and totally muddled. there is no plot, and half the movie is fast flashing shots from football games. zoomed in shots, that gives you no overview of the games. i was constantly looking at the timer, to see when the movie was over!<br /><br />there's only one good thing about this movie. the sound!! the soundtrack is awesome! .............don't expect anything from this movie.
