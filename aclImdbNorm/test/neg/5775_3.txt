the monster will look very familiar to you. so will the rest of the film, if you've seen a half-dozen of these teenagers-trapped-in-the-woods movies. okay, so they're not teenagers, this time, but they may as well be. three couples decide it might be a good idea to check out a nearly-abandoned ghost town, in hopes of finding the gold that people were killed over a scant century-and-a-half before. you'd think that with a title like "miner's massacre" some interesting things might happen. they don't. in fact, only about 1/10 of the film actually takes place in the mine. i had envisioned teams of terrified miners scampering for their lives in the cavernous confines of their workplace, praying that black lung disease would get them before the grim reaper exacted his grisly revenge, but instead i got terrestrial twenty-somethings fornicating--and, in one case, defecating--in the woods, a gang of morons with a collective i.q. that would have difficulty pulling a plastic ring out of a box of cracker jacks, much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine. no suspense, no scares, and plenty of embarrassing performances give this turkey a 3 for nudity.
