this film was one of the worst films i have ever seen. this movie drags on and on and i almost turned it off, but i gave it a shot. i wasnt expecting anything great, but i was expecting more than this. good thing i work at a video store and saw this for free, because i would'nt spend one dime on this movie. i gave this movie a 2, only because i have seen worse. if i were you i would stay away from this, very far away.
