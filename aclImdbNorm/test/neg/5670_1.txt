i... no words. no words can describe this. i will try for the sake of those few brave people who stick knives into their toasters... after watching this show.<br /><br />this... cosgrove person... her acting is like watching a female gorilla dance upon the nest of highly agitated insects. perhaps i exaggerate. however, i have a feeling that the description fits a regular day of writing this show.<br /><br />the characters in this repulsive pile of raw sewage are as useless as a small piece of space rock that flies into the sun on any day of the week. though heart attacks have not been experienced while watching them act like fools on the cheaply built sets, i have no doubt that it will happen eventually.<br /><br />the main plot of this *belches loudly into the faces of the actors* is that of a foolish girl who hosts a live weekly web-cast on the creatively titled icarly.com with her brainless friends, one of which owns equipment that the producers of this show probably couldn't afford. her legal guardian is some kind of moron who is apparently her older brother.<br /><br />i haven't watched all of this show for fear of developing cancer, or perhaps a cold, but some of the plot points i have seen involve the brother getting stuck in an elevator, the doorman of the apartment almost dieing, and the world's fattest priest coming for a visit. no, really.<br /><br />avoid this if you are over the age of unborn or if you have a history of joining mysterious cults due to mental trauma. if you do decide to watch it, laugh when the laugh-track tells you to, as this will drown out the repetitive noise that will eventually put you in a coma if you listen to it for too long. <br /><br />the show receives a one star rating because the imdb inexplicably has not adopted the use of negative numbers.
