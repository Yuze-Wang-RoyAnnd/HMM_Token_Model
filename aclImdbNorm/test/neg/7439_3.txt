a pointless cash-in with nothing to contribute except nastiness, this is a definite case of sloppy seconds for robocop. irvin kershner's numbing, plot less and tired mess of a sequel is watchable and even mildly entertaining in a dubious, unpleasantly trashy way, but it has virtually none of the original's flair, emotion, intelligence or excitement. instead we have just another empty spectacle of a blockbuster whose only reason to exist seems to be to nauseate the viewer with relentless violence, which is far more brainlessly gratuitous than anything in the original. omni consumer products, who made the original robocop cyborg, have turned into more of a totalitarian force than ever second time round, what with the suspicious nazi-esquire banners, stormtrooper guards and tanks for hire at the end; as for the anonymous old man (daniel o' herlihy), he's less of a benevolent protector and more of a hideous mr. burns type, surrounding himself with moronic lackeys who genuinely believe that putting the brain of a murderous psychopath into the body of the all-new robocop 2 is a good idea. oh, and the first robocop gets a look in somewhere amidst all of this mess, though you wonder what on earth a fine actor like peter weller saw in the script. the droll tom noonan has nothing to work with as the villain, while nancy allen is badly wasted as robocop's partner. there are some hilarious moments throughout; the opening 'magnavolt' commercial, for instance, but this is a poor follow-up to the truly great original.
