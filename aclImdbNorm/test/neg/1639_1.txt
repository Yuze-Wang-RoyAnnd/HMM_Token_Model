this is about one of the worst movies i'd ever seen. it's not the worst though - manos the hands of fate holds that honor.<br /><br />this movie has a lot of problems. to begin, this whole movie is a cheap rip-off of the conan movies. there's the babe in a skimpy dress wearing a hubcap, the quiet asian warrior, the cookie cutter bad guy, the almost mindless soliders, and so on. there's lots of continuity errors in this film. some of the dumbest errors i've ever seen are in this film.<br /><br />fortunately when i watched this film i seen the mst3k version. joel and the 'bots make the film watchable, otherwise i probably would've turned it off five minutes into the film.
