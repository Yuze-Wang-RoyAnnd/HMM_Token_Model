pepe le moko, played by charles boyer, is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in countries throughout europe, and to stay free he holes himself up in the casbah, a mysterious part of algiers where even the police are reluctant to go, until a senior officer is sent from paris to capture le moko once and for all. for le moko, although the casbah allows him to remain out of police custody, it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time - a place he can't leave, because the moment he does, he knows he'll be arrested.<br /><br />boyer's performance was good, and i can understand why he was nominated for an oscar. he captures the essence of such a character - a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time. the movie itself, unfortunately, was quite a letdown. a number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent, of which i'll mention two. first was the idea that the police wouldn't enter the casbah. that was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander, and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the casbah fairly regularly. so, neither the suggestion by commissioner janvier that the police wouldn't enter, nor the statement by inspector slimane (also a decent performance by joseph calleia) that they could get into the casbah but not out seemed to make much sense. i also found it difficult to believe that le moko - hardened criminal mastermind that he was - could be so quickly swept off his feet by gaby (hedy lamarr) to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the casbah to find her, essentially giving himself up. i understand the irony of the final few scenes, of course, as pepe leaves the freedom of his prison (the casbah) only to find real freedom in his capture (because he's shot and killed by the police.) i just found it impossible to believe that someone like le moko would fall into such a trap.<br /><br />this is worth watching for boyer, and to a lesser extent calleia, but the story is disappointing and inconsistent. 3/10
