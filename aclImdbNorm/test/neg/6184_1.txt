so many people have taken shots at platoon and born on the fourth of july among other calling them "leftist propaganda film." now its my turn to take a political shot at a movie. to me this movie is very imposing on certain religious beliefs and on its political views.<br /><br />the acting and writing was a little to clich'ed for my liking. mel gibson seems to like to play in these unnecessary violent films and proves it once again by teaming up with his partner randall wallace for yet another one. throughout this movie there was this garbage prototypical "just tell my family i love them" or "tell ronny to pray before hoe goes to bed" lines. the was so overloaded with this garbage retread lines that i felt like i had to vomit. how about that scene were gibson's wife goes to do her laundry and this "no colors" applies to what to put in the washing machine. its in the mid-sixties was she some how stuck under a rock not noticing the racism around her. another scene is were gibson's daughter asks him what war is and the scene is shot in such a trivial matter.<br /><br />the directing displayed this all perfectly. the countless scenes of gibson and his family or soldiers praying. i'm fine with showing that once or twice but after a while i wonder if the movie is trying to shove something into my head. how many scenes with the american flag at its finest hour were shot with the melodramatic music on. the director also makes it seem like we won some sort of victory in vietnam. what exactly was won their. the cinematography was the worst of it with the slowed down scenes see the american flag in the distance scenes spread throughout. i love america but movies like this seem to glorify every little thing we do.<br /><br />this may seem like a rant and maybe it is but i cannot stand it when a movie like this makes people who are not religious are not so patriotic that they will agree with anything their country does look bad. this movie to me is narrow minded and limited in so many aspects. to me it says if your not christian your wrong. would god or jesus want people to kill i don't think so. to me this movie was offensive. at first this movie was funny with the countless clich'es and overacted scenes but then when i looked at what this movie was trying to say or not say it was really frustrating to watch. i guess though it is my fault that i chose to watch this movie. i hope no one takes this comment offensively because i am not criticizing religion or patriotism but some of the narrow minded people who are so into both and discount everyone else.<br /><br />if you want a real depiction of the vietnam war watch platoon, born on the fourth of july, apocalypse now, the deer hunter or the killing fields. even full metal jacket which i absolutely hated was a better depiction. i have read a quote that in context says a true patriot does not go with everything the government or country does but questions it when its wrong. a real patriot loves their country too much to see it do bad things.
