an expedition party made up of constantly bickering and obnoxious jerks go trekking into the dangerous african jungle in search of both a fortune in diamonds and a missing young lady named diana (luscious brunette looker katja biernet, clad solely in a skimpy loincloth that shows off a lot of her hot shapely body) who's worshiped as a goddess by a deadly primitive tribe called the mabutos. director/screenwriter jess franco crucially fails to inject any style or vigor into the generally blah and meandering proceedings, allowing the sluggish pace to crawl along at an often agonizingly slow clip and staging the infrequent action scenes with a singular lack of skill and panache. the lousy dubbing, excess amount of grainy "national geographic"-like animal stock footage, groovy, jazzy lounge score, terrible acting, talky, uneventful narrative, tepid soft-core sex scenes, and static photography don't help matters any as well. fortunately, there's plenty of tasty gratuitous nudity on sight to alleviate the tedium to a reasonable extent: besides the delectable biernert, both aline mess as fierce, wicked high priestess noba and mari carmen nieto as the conniving, treacherous lita are likewise real easy on the eyes. the beautiful jungle scenery is very nice, too. but overall this picture sizes up as barely watchable and hence instantly forgettable swill.
