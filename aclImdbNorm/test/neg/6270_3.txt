why does c thomas howell do these movies? cruise (howell's one time co-star) does a huge blockbuster of wotw and howell follows with this lame effort.<br /><br />where do i start here? production values - i'll start with the good stuff. the look and feel of some of the scenes in this movie are not too bad to be honest. the set-ups are okay in spots and the direction not too bad.<br /><br />script - terrible. a series of clunky scenes that could have been put in any order you like permeate throughout the movie. the amount of times the scene faded to black and reemerged a second later in the same room was uncountable. very poor storyline (but so was the cruise wotw) takes some blame but an abysmal screenplay kills it off.<br /><br />special fx - okay, i don't want to be too harsh here as i imagine the budget was smaller than cruise's lunch bill - but in the overall context of the film the effects are badly done. some shots are quite impressive - mainly far off destruction shots of bridges, washington, liner. but in the main the "alien" machines and tentacles themselves are dreadful. also the camera quality is fuzzy on some shots and cuts away entirely on others.<br /><br />acting - i'm a fan of howell but as he has reduced himself to acting in these low-budget flicks - he has succumbed to the "over-acting" bug a long time ago. look at his performance in the hitcher and compare it to this movie. there is no comparison. he overdoes his facial expressions, his flailing arms and legs (where did he get that running style???) and for a final coup-de-gras look at the scene where he loses the photo of his family. hysterical. but after saying all that - he is still the best actor on show here. busey is embarrassing to look at and peter green (zed is truly dead now baby) mumbles incoherently through his one and only scene. i honestly could not understand one word he said - i even went so far as trying to enable the subtitles on that scene - but the dvd did not have subtitles. this seems to be a real keep-it-in-the-family affair too as howell's son, the director's wife and the line producer all make it into the film. none of them are good.<br /><br />direction - not bad but not good either.<br /><br />score - dismal.<br /><br />overall, a lame duck effort that will do nothing for howell in his attempt to make it back to the big time. he should take a look at rourke and try to figure out how he made in back to the a list but if he keeps doing stuff like this, he won't have a career soon enough.<br /><br />3/10.
