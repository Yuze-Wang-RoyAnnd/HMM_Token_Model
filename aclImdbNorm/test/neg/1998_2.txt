i normally like casper in his movies, a real credit to starship troopers. but the box cover on this video ssooooo mi-sleds the renters. at my local video, people rent it expecting a (perhaps) borg like vampire, and instead they get a bad re-make of lon chaney. it had great potential, and fell very flat. ireally think i could have written a better story line and screen play. why is it in every science fiction movie, they (the cast) constantly refers to a solar system as a galaxy? didn't any of these screenwriters or authors stay awake in science class? it is a pet pevee of mine, but a solar system is a single star with planets, a galaxy is a whole bunch of solar systems. it is like referring to a can of coke as a gross of six packs. makes it sound even dumber.
