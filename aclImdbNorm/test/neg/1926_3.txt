to be fair, it has been several years since i watched the bile committed to celluloid known as "here on earth," so forgive me if my memory of the film is a little sketchy. i'll stick with the main points which plague the soul of the unfortunate viewer.<br /><br />scene one: chris klein, after having been thrown out of prep school (because he looks like a seventeen year old--yes, very believable), gives what i assume is his valedictorian speech...to a field. let me repeat that for you--a field. i think we're supposed to be moved by the combination of shame and eloquence he is failing to express. klein has the delivery and facial expressions of a cardboard cutout. he is a decent looking piece of cardboard, but little more.<br /><br />scene two: after some joyriding and teenage pyromaniac hijinks, chris klein and josh hartnett do some damage to the local diner, of which he is forced to rebuild. of course. because who better to help with construction than some random moron who crashed into it/ burned it in the first place. better yet, let's have said random moron move in on josh hartnett's girl, miss sobeski, the girl he fancies for...her equally wooden line delivery? <br /><br />scene three: chris klein's character is making out with leelee sobeski's character and decides to name her various body parts after the states on the eastern seaboard. my soul weeps. really, how can this scenario turn out well? surely you must alienate several million people if you imply their home is equivalent to miss sobeski's more...erm...feminine areas. secondly, naming her breasts after new york and new jersey prompts some confusion as to whether miss sobeski is actually freakishly disproportionate.<br /><br />scene four: leelee is running. she falls down. this gives her...knee cancer. "we always knew it could come back," her father(?) says. right. knee cancer. from tripping. perhaps i missed something. as i said, it's been a few years. surely i missed something. didn't i? for the love of god, please tell me the girl did not contract knee cancer from falling down. <br /><br />that scream you just heard was my soul dying.
