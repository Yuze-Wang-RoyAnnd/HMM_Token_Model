i saw this film purely based on the fact that it was on the dpp video nasty list, and while i'm glad i saw it because it's now 'another video nasty down' - on its own merits, andy milligan's film really isn't worth bothering with. there are, of course, far worse films on the infamous list; but that doesn't make the pain of viewing this one any easier. the film was obviously shot on an extremely low budget, and that has translated into the script; as blood rites works on an idea often seen in horror cinema, and doesn't do anything new with it. basically, the plot centres on three couples who find themselves at a house awaiting the results of a will. it's not long before they start getting picked off...blah blah blah. for most of the film, nothing happens; and then when we finally get down to the scenes that justify the movie being banned, they're so amateurish and silly that they're impossible to take seriously on any level. it's a very good thing that this movie doesn't have a very long running time as otherwise it could have been used as a particularly nasty method of torture. it all boils down to a fittingly tedious ending, which also succeeds in being a non-event of epic proportions. apparently, this movie is still banned here in the uk; but somehow i doubt it's because of its shock value. basically, blood rites isn't worth seeing and i personally can see no reason to recommend it. unless, of course, you've made it your business to see everything on the video nasty list...
