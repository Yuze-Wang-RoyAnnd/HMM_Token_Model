i'm going to be generous here and give it a 3 only because i live in huntsville and it was great to see how well the city was filmed. that said, this movie was pretty bad. it's like they started off with hardly any script and the director just told the actors to stare at each other meaningfully with a lot of music playing over it. and billy d. williams looked like he'd rather be anywhere but in this movie. it's just a mess. i think i could write a script better than the dislodge for this film, and i'm no writer.<br /><br />there is one thing i've seen mentioned throughout the reviews and message boards--everyone is under the impression that the movie begins around world war 2 and actually it seemed more like it was supposed to start out in the late 1950's/early 1960's. while the military was not segregated by then, i'm pretty sure that any troops waiting to board a train would still be segregated in a place like huntsville, al. if the beginning of film was supposed to be the 1940's, then billy d, lesley ann & rae dawn would have to have been in the 70's and 80's instead of their mid 50's or early 60's.<br /><br />don't waste your time unless you really, really like the actors because the story isn't very interesting.
