i have long tried to understand why people like shakespeare so much and every few years i give him another go. i was hoping that this play/film (my 6th different shakespeare play) would unlock the lucky casket and marry me to the riches of this literary demigod. bah, i clearly chose the wrong key.<br /><br />once the phrase "pound of flesh" had been uttered 10 minutes into the film, the main parts of the plot were transparent, which grinds along with a languid script and lifeless acting. at every step, the plot is laid bare two scenes in advance. the concept that a dying aristocrat would persuade his daughter to choose her future husband by means of a lottery is incredulous. it is no surprise who wins the matrimonial jackpot because bassanio's a main protagonist in the play.... and he's the third man to try .... and there are three caskets to choose from ... and his friend risks his life to pay the dowry. the only genuine surprise that i had watching this film is that it did not end immediately after the resolution of the court case. however as soon as the ring treachery began it was immediately apparent what would transpire.<br /><br />ok so i know that millions of you love shakespeare not for the surprise in the well known stories but for the depth and passion of the characters. but i felt nothing for the characters. rather than gripped with suspense and admiration during the court scene i sat there impassionately hoping that it would be over, soon, please.<br /><br />one day, i might just find a shakespeare play that does something other than bore me.
