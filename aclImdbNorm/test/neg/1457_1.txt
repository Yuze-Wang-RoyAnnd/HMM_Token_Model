this is a film that has garnered any interest or praise it has received simply on the merit of being a lesbian interest piece. the performances are mostly emotionless compared to better films in the glbt interest genre. the entirety of the film's watchable value is garnered through modest suspense over whether and when the partners' family members will say something discouraging about their lesbian relationship. the best element of the film is likely the beautiful new england scenery, although much of the film is set inside. it is hard to envision how any viewer watching this film and not seeking affirmation of their glbt lifestyle or wishing to see that of others affirmed, even through poorly realized drama, could appreciate treading water in any significant way. it is a terrible movie.
