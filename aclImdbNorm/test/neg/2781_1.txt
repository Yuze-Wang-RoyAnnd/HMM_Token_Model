another stupid "movie". the quality of image is correct. sound too. music is middle. the guy try make music like in halloween.<br /><br />for one rare time, producer/director choose no-anorexic girls. it is cause this "movie" take one week to do and cost $10,000. does it mean when producer have money they choose all anorexic girls? good question.<br /><br />but girls in this "movie" are physically correct. but they are not good actress. neither guys too. but maybe it's just cause the "story" of this "movie" have no value.<br /><br />i'm sure we give $10,000 to some teen who like movie, and they can create a better movie.<br /><br />don't lose your time to watch this "thing".
