in addition to all the negative reviews: i was amazed to see that at the drop of a hat somewhere, somehow a cctv-camera was summoned at a most unlikely location, to show the 'crisis'-team (''look maaaaa-aaam'') what was going on, notably near the thames-barrier, where the professor is hit at full (wind)force against the head by a heavy object and subsequently lives to tell the story. otherwise i was unable to shake off the image of some actors as portrayed in other films/programs: i said to my wife: 'hey, that's neil, from the young ones' (nigel planer) and 'did they summon hercule poirot for help?' (david suchet). to add to the disgrace of this film (shown in two parts on itv uk recently), itv showed the telephone number of the environment agency after each episode for worried viewers, living in areas 'at risk of flooding'. how low can you as a broadcaster go to treat your audience like that? what must the environment agency have thought?? (''oh no, it's mrs jones from hull again. she says she was right all along, she saw it on itv'').
