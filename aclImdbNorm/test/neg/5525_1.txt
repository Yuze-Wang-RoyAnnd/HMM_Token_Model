this is so poor it's watchable.<br /><br />the plot deals with a grizzled spaceship crew happening upon a drifting, apparently abandoned russian craft.<br /><br />in the empty vastness of space, the two craft accidentally collide (!) - and 'alien'-esque fun ensues as a cyborg from the russian ship menaces our crew.<br /><br />the spacecraft interiors are clearly a dolled-up factory set (metal walkways, boilers, piping). in this entirely unconvincing setting, 'kody', 'snake' and the rest of our hero crew grimace, grunt, run about and continually and repeatedly rack their shotguns without firing them.<br /><br />the continuity gaffes are what define this movie, and they are nothing short of amazing:<br /><br />stuff appears and disappears. the shotguns are racked. a cigar gets longer by being smoked. the shotguns are racked again, just to make sure. content of a bottle increases by being drunk from.<br /><br />the film progresses through the usual clich'es by way of intense ham acting, poxy camera work and ed wood quality props to a showdown climax.
