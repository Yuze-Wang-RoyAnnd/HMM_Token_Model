ah, another movie with motorcycles, hell's angels posse and steve a-lame-o as the not-so-cool car driver. this movie does not rely on story but lots of drinking, pot smoking, and lots of moronic acts. steve's rendition of a dying cat during his "i love what i know" serenade had me vomiting for hours. bike chick linda (rrrr) makes out with everyone! fats did the best acting since he just grunts and makes sounds. i also dare you to try to make out what banjo is saying. "you messin' wit private stock." this is scriptwriting folks.<br /><br />i liked the ending. what better place to have the climax than a lighthouse! you have to see this to detest it.<br /><br />die jeter, die!!!
