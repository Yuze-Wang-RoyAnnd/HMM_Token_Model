star trek v definitely earns the dubious distinction of being the weakest film in the star trek series. despite the good acting efforts by the actors, it suffered from a general lack of funding from paramount pictures. paramount pictures was not enthusiastic about this film at its very onset.<br /><br />the movie begins with the enterprise crew enjoying their extended shore leave as a reword for saving the earth from total ecological disaster. their shore leave is cut short when a disturbance occurs on nimbus iii, the planet of intergalactic peace. captain kirk and the enterprise arrive at nimbus iii only to have their ship hijacked by sybok, spock's half-brother. sybok brainwashes the crew of the enterprise and sets it on a suicide mission to rendezvous with "god" just past the great barrier at the center of our galaxy. captain kirk must then figure out a way to regain control of his ship and to fend off the enterprise's klignon pursuers.<br /><br />the only bright spot in the film is the acting and directing. william shatner, leonard nimoy, deforest kelley, laurence luckinbill, and the rest of the cast all give good performances. william shatner also does a pretty good job directing this film.<br /><br />however, the film suffered from a general lack of enthusiasm and funding. first, the part of sybok was initially offered to sean connery, but he refused. so, laurence luckinbill got the part. second, many of the special effects were severely cut back ... reducing the movies entertaining potential. third, the scene that depicts the arrival at the great barrier left much to be desired. finally, the romance between scotty and uhura in this film did not make much sense at all ... considering that no such romance ever occurred prior to this point in the star trek universe and it was never explained how such a romance could suddenly materialize between star treks iv and v.<br /><br />overall, this is a very weak film. you should probably just skip this film and move on to star trek vi. after all, the cast and crew made star trek vi partly to bail themselves out after their debacle with star trek v.
