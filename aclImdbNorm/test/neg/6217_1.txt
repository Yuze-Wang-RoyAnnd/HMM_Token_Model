i cannot remember a more trivial, mind numbing and shallow film in other words a real chick flick of the worst kind. how can anyone watch this film and recommend it to others ? only if they don't like admitting they made a mistake. it seems to summarise the worst of female aspirations. no real substance to it all happy and shallow. yeah that'll please the masses. well not this member of the masses. what a trivial load of drivel. i wanted to leave the cinema within 5 minutes of the start. and to think i paid lb7 to see this ! i think this does however represent the dumbing down of cinema as with most media these days. so i like a bit of reality in my musicals call me sad or what ?
