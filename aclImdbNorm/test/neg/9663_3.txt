i admit - i was lured to this one from the hype - and i didn't stop to consider the sources. "one of the best indie exploitation flicks of the year (1999)", shocking", and " a must have ".<br /><br />well - i wasted my money. but not all was bad in this movie. they at least got the gore right, as well as some of the most unique methods of murder seen in a long time. there is even a storyline (kinda) and that is about it.<br /><br />but for an exploitation film there is a surprising amount of content - but no exploiting. we get gay sex - sorta. we have 3 inter-racial babes - maybe. we have a psychotic vietnamese hooker - nice back, oral sex (ok that made me wince) and some female version of gene simmons (i don't get that part). we have an honest to goodness capone - rates among the best of the actors in this film - that is not a compliment. and finally we have a government conspiracy thrown in to - i don't know - try to connect the vengeance/random/theme killing by jimmy boy to make the vietnamese psycho seem sane??????? if nothing else this movie proves that the italians and the americans do not have a lock on this type of movie. the latinos can make crap as well as the rest of them. kudos goes to anyone involved in this accomplishment that overcame it and made a career for themselves.
