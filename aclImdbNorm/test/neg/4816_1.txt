this movie is the worst thing ever created by humans. you think manos is the worst movie ever? it doesn't even come close to this garbage. i dont even know where to begin. the "russian" commander and the rebel chic are the worst "actors" ever to appear in a movie. they make the sister in troll 2 look like meryl streep. the goofy faces the chic makes while she's in kung fu training have to be seen to be believed. then there is the oompa music during the prison break, the totally out of place love scene, the stupid song that plays during the out of place love scene, the fake castro, the fact that everybody has either a headband and/or a bandanna on some part of their body, the goofiest rape scene ever filmed, and the worst acting ever put on film. this movie deserves to be more well known among bad movie fans. definitely the worst movie ever made.
