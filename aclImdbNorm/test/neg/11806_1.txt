i think that a lot of friends of people who acted in this thing must've come on and rated it because i'm telling you, its just awful. the acting is worse than soapopera bad, the effects are like something you'd see out of a 1970 episode of doctor who, the story is, well, there is no story. and they keep using the same 2 minute song over and over and over again. and the werewolf? its like the muppets they used in wing commander, the giant cats, remember how bad they looked? the werewolf is that bad. seriously, the guy who directed this thing is terrible and should never get to direct anything else again, except maybe his son's school play, but even then, he should have to pay the audience to see it. ghostwolf is nothing but a bad joke.
