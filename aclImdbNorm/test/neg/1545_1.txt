the worst film ever made, bar none. give yourself a pat on the back if you can possibly sit through every excruciatingly painful minute of it. except for the bit where the hard-luck loser turned deranged psychopath from forced medical experimentation pours his pea soup on the doctor's head and laughs like any good raving lunatic should...that's all.
