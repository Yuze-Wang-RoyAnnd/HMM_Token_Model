i don't see why everyone loves this film so much. true, it does have good intentions and meaning, but you cannot compensate for such a poor script. woody allen is a brilliant filmaker, but i'm afraid this is just a piece of garbage. it's extremely predictable and the subject matter is all too visible. i happen to be a huge woody allan fan and love most of his work, but this i cannot recomend.
