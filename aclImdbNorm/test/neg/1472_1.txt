i usually enjoy underground movies and antiheroes but this is a bad joke. i wonder how this can be called a movie. all these people are loosers and the filmmaker doesn't succeed in making them interesting at all. they are not funny, not tragic just plain stupid and boring.<br /><br />may be i missed something but i won't watch it again to find out what. anybody with a camcorder can do better than that...<br /><br />i give it a 1 for the originality. all the rest is crap.
