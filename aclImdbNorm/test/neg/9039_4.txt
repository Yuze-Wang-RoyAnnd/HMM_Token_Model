you would think that a film that starred three of the biggest male film stars of the post world war ii era would have become a classic. these three who also happen to be three favorites of mine, walk around in a daze, looking like they'd rather be any place, but there.<br /><br />the sad thing is that the way west definitely had some potential to be a classic. in these days of political correctness, a film about american pioneers and the travails of their westward migration is something not done now. it should have been better done back then.<br /><br />kirk douglas is a former united states senator who's heading a wagon train west to build a settlement in oregon's willamette valley. being he's an ex-politician, he rates above the hoi ploi he's leading. the script calls for him to have not only a covered wagon, but a carriage to lead the train.<br /><br />you think that's ludicrous, you ought to see the whipping scene where douglas orders his black servant, played by roy glenn to whip him. i won't spoil it by saying what causes douglas to demand this of glenn, but trust me, it's bad.<br /><br />robert mitchum is the trail guide and of the three stars he looks the most bored. there was supposed to be considerable friction on the set between widmark and douglas, but mitchum just saunters through the film above it all.<br /><br />maybe the friction helped somewhat because the movie calls for douglas, a widower, to have an eye on mrs. widmark, played by lola albright. now she's the best looking thing in the movie.<br /><br />the film billing says introducing sally field. this was made in between her gidget and her flying nun days. she plays a piece of white southern trash with the musical comedy name of mercy mcbee. we first see her in the movie sitting on the back of her parents wagon, legs akimbo and inviting. of course she gets taken up on her invitation.<br /><br />her character is something like what's found in every trailer park in america and then again what was a wagon train, but one large trailer park on the move. <br /><br />despite this film, sally field went on to a two oscar career. what that woman had to overcome.<br /><br />victor mclaglen's son andrew directed this item and together with a lousy script turned this into a turgid mess. shame on andrew mclaglen, he's certainly done better in his career.<br /><br />and so will you, unless you're a stargazer.
