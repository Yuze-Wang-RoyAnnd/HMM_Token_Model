incredibly, "vampire assassin" is significantly worse than such atrocities as "tequila body shots" and "zombie nation" - and those movies are terrible. writer/director/star ron hall is devoid of both charisma and acting ability, and is also clearly incapable of the most basic directorial concepts. possibly the worst camera-work, editing, lighting, sound, visual effects, music and fight choreography i have ever seen in a movie. rarely do two shots cut together, nor can you see much in the beyond-dim lighting. the terrible dialogue is spoken extremely slowly by a supremely untalented cast, stretching the movie to a near-deadly 87 minutes. this is a truly laughable embarrassment for everyone involved. obviously, aficionados of terrible film-making will want to see this, but it's very hard to sit through no matter how experienced a bad-movie viewer you are. the fact that ron hall thought this was actually releasable is astounding. if you are a movie director, and you actually think it's ok for the opening credits of your movie to include a few frames of the words slug before the title appears, left over from your rough edit - and you apparently can't muster the energy to edit those frames out - then your standards are obviously so low as to be insulting. i am astounded that lions gate/maple agreed to release this movie on dvd. in spite of rudy ray moore's very brief cameo, this movie is a work of supreme self-indulgence on ron hall's part - he clearly thinks he is a formidable actor, and must also believe he possesses superior writing and directing skills - but the movie is so unbelievably inept that it's hard to believe he'd actually want people to see it for fear of being brutally excoriated like i'm doing right now. a jaw-dropping, insanely terrible movie. i'm not kidding.
