this movie baffled me. i could not get a grip on it. thought i might be missing something. glad to see that most of you agree with me. this isn't always the case (see my recent review of re: extinction).<br /><br />to expound upon the faults of this film any further would be a glorious waste of time...so i will...<br /><br />they're dressed like cowboys, but it's modern times, right? no? i don't get it??? when i picked up the box, i thought: zombie western! cool! that's how it was presented. haven't seen that yet. hope they did a good job.<br /><br />they didn't! they tried to create an iconic character that would spawn a series. they didn't.<br /><br />they tried to make an aussie indie zombie flick on the caliber (and perhaps riding on the coat tails) of the very well done "undead". they didn't.<br /><br />okay, maybe they just wanted to make a confusing, disjointed, mess of film salad that might ultimately be edited into something watchable. they didn't! this is the new number 2 on my list of worst zombie movies ever. there are really just the two so far, "day of the dead: contagium" being the first (not to be confused with "day of the dead", which is one of my favorite zombie movies of all time). if you're gonna make a zombie movie (and i'm not a zombie movie maker, i'm just a connoisseur) make a good one. flight of the living dead is a good example of decent recent zombie filmaking. fyi.<br /><br />if you're really forgiving, you might think, well, didn't they at least throw in something to make us feel like we didn't want our money back? guess what...they didn't!
