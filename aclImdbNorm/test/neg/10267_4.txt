when the word "presents" finds its way into a title, preceded by a famous name, the work is usually immediately dismissible. for some reason, people who are capable of creating good art don't seem to be able to see it in others. however, i've always been willing to give the second installment of the demons trilogy a try. for one thing, the soundtracks are absolutely to die for. most american directors would have sacrificed small animals to line up the kind of talent on the soundtrack of demons 2. for another, well, two words: asia argento. (of course, she was eleven when this film was made, and a number of years away from her seeming decision that she would style her acting after early helen mirren: steamy looks and little clothing.) as well, lamberto bava comes from one of italy's finest dynasties in that odd horror sub genre known as giallo (he's the son of mario bava, who may well have invented the genre in the sixties). and the original demons is an absolute must-see for fans of eighties b-horror films. so how bad can this be, right? well, bad. the demons continue their assault on italian media, as the movie opens in a modern italian high-rise where many people going about their lives have their televisions on in the background. they're all watching a kind of combination news report/mater video of some investigative reporter types trying to get proof of the events of the first film (which would seem to put the time frame of this one no more than a few days after the first film). through the usual horror-film extra inability to concentrate, the reporters manage to bring a demon back to life, and he comes through the tv screen to start the plague anew.<br /><br />yeah. it's that bad. about the only thing good one can say about the film is that the soundtrack (when you're not being buffeted about by the likes of the smiths, the cult, gene loves jezebel, etc.) is stunning. it comes from the keyboard of simon boswell, who got his start as a part of the argento dynasty and has since gone on to score such films as lord of illusions and hackers.<br /><br />makes a half-decent free rental if you're planning on drinking heavily, but it's certainly nowhere near the fun the original was. cronenberg's wonderfully funny high-rise-nasty-creature romp, shivers (aka they came from within), is a whole lot better.
