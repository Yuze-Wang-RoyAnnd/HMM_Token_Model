just what the world needed-another superficial cookie-cutter mary-kate and ashley olsen movie. this movie gives out horrible messages to girls everywhere, complete with stereotypical "junior high" experience. they make learning anything at all seem completely taboo. i can't stand the fake french accents, or those guys on the mopeds racing around who eventually "fall" for the twins. why am i putting everything in parenthesis? because its all stereotyped. the twins even complain about not having a stereotypical grandfather. they should be happy they even have a grandfather at all. how does this fit the mary-kate/ashley mold? this one has them fixing up a single guy who (gasp!!) isn't their father!!!!! yes, folks, they actually have a mother who appears for all of five seconds. i haven't even sat through thirty minutes of this and i can already tell how it will end up. this movie is so pitiful, it makes miss usa seem like an academic bowl. really.
