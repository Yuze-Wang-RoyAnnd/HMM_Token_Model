this is without a doubt the stupidest movie of all time.<br /><br />i don't know who i'm angrier at--the idiots who made this or my video store for actually carrying this piece of crap!!<br /><br />i can't even begin to name all of the things wrong with this horrible wanna-be movie.<br /><br />all of the dialogue sounds like it was made up on the spot, and the acting is the worst i have ever seen in any movie-ever!!<br /><br />there is nothing about the script that would appeal to any decent person, in fact i don't think they even had a script, they just made up everything as they went along--and you can tell.<br /><br />the "women" (i.e. men dressed up in drag trying to look like women) in the costumes looked so ridiculous, i guess they were trying to be sexy but--not so much!! especially that old woman-disgusting.<br /><br />there is nothing scary about this movie, the only thing scary is that somebody else might actually rent it and have to watch it.<br /><br />no brain required for watching this, you must be a total loser to want to see this movie.<br /><br />don't forget-- i warned you!!!
