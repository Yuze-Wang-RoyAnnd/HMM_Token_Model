i was hoping to like this movie, to settle in for an evening of goofy fun. i like judy davis and juliette lewis, and the premise seemed off the wall enough to be entertaining.<br /><br />unfortunately, i found myself dozing over and over again. judy davis gave a fine performance, but had very little to work with. juliette lewis was fabulous as expected, but had very little to do. the plot was full of "twists" that were just plain silly, and as so often happens in movies of this type, nobody acted the way a real human being would act. and, personally, i thought marcia gay harden was totally miscast.<br /><br />the movie also seemed to shift about midway from a black comedy with touches of farce to a total farce with touches of black comedy. one reviewer here notes that other reviews seem to want this movie to be something different, and therefore decried it. all i can say is that i would have settled for the movie being *something* and sticking with it. this one feels like the director had some grandiose ideas but wasn't able to pull them all off. i give it a 4 out of 10.
