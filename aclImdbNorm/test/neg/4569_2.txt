i'm generally not a fan of high school comedies, they rely heavily on humor in bad taste and rarely stray far from clich'ed story lines and characters and downright dull dialog. however, i've had my share of guilty pleasures, particularly when i was still in high school myself. seeing the oh-so-recognizable teacher figures get their butts kicked always cheered me up and an occasional laugh could also be the case. these movies only work if at least one of the characters is an instantly likable one, this was not the case in 'cheats', especially not the protagonist. of course, it didn't help that the actor in play was one of the most irritating, no-talent, arrogant kids i've ever seen in a comedy.<br /><br />to act in a comedy is no joke, it's hard to be funny: the delivery has to be just right or the material goes to waste. in this case there wasn't much good stuff to begin with and the jokes that were half-funny were screwed up professionally by the cast.<br /><br />this movie felt 3 hours long, the director never heard of pacing obviously. stay away from this one, there are many other enjoyable teen comedies out there such as 10 things i hate about you, who's your daddy and superbad.
