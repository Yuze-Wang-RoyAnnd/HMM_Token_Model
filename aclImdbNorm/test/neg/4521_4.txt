there is the thrill of low-budget film noir. and there is the frustration of meandering, uninteresting movies made on the cheap. this one falls into the second category.<br /><br />the spot is the name of a nightclub. the film is about a policeman whose father has been killed by gangsters. he heads out to track them down.<br /><br />maybe it was the bad print. maybe it's me. but i felt i'd seen this a hundred times, most of those times better than it is here.<br /><br />it has promise, too: the cop is fascinated with a woman who plays records she introduces over juke boxes. they then meet. now, though this was made well before i was born, i have seen that kind of juke box. and it is incredibly fascinating: when i was a teenager, i wandered into a bar that still had such a device. i always liked juke boxes, in bars or diners. but this one was different. you talked to it and a sultry sounding female voice talked back to you! that is addressed here but dropped into the general, uninteresting stew.<br /><br />the movie has one thing going for it: in a small role, it features the very young anne jeffreys. what a beauty she was, and doubtless still is!
