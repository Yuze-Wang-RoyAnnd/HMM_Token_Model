this movie was sooo bad. it wasn't even funny at all. not even the sarcastic scenes were funny. oh man, bad, so bad. thumbs down. spoofed, karate kid, teen wolf, footloose, dirty dancing, some kind of wonderful, soul man, and probably another or two. chris kattan at his very worst as the high school janitor who is a talented dancer, who runs a dance studio in a warehouse. he has a jealous girlfriend, who breaks her ankle and her dance spot goes to the cute blonde newcomer who chris has eyes for. i thought the acting was really bad. i like laugh out loud comedies, this was not one. "not another teen movie" wasn't funny, but had a lot more funny scenes than totally awesome. "scary movie" is suuuper funny. i always laugh when i watch those, super enjoyable. this movie, not funny.
