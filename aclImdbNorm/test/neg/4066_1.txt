you have to see this. i could not stop laughing about the stupidities i saw in this movie even late after the event. there is maybe a million of individual mistakes and stupidities in this movie. the acting is bad. the story is so predictable and flat. the effects are like 50 years old. the supposed thriller is nowhere. you will not enjoy the movie, but you will laugh at it and enjoy laughing at it a long time after it. we had a great time after the movie. truly. me and my friend spent entire 40mins long bus trip home chatting about this movie like we have seen next oscar winner. sadly we were talking about all those bad things we had just seen.
