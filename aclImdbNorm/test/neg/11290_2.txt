i have to admit i was deceived by the title and the summary on the back of the box. so i popped it in the vcr and kept waiting... and waiting... and waiting for something good to happen. but of course, it never does. the makers of this film should be tied to a chair and made to watch "saving private ryan". maybe they would learn something.
