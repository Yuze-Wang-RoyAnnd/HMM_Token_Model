paul telfer, who plays hercules in this tv film, has to be the hottest thing on two legs ever. wow.<br /><br />but this film is a 100% distortion of the hercules story. just like "troy," this film has nothing to do with the original story. zero. what makes it especially insulting is that they actually contrived a gay character just so people could hate him, making him as dastardly and evil as any character in the history of tv or cinema. this is triply insulting since hercules may have had a wife, since that was the expectation of those olden days, but he also had at least a dozen male lovers. so it is ironic that they should create a gay royal adversary character for this film. no, not ironic. evil. the creators of this travesty should hang their heads in shame.
