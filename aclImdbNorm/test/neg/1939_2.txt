viva la bam this "jackass" spin off focuses on the (obviously scripted) adventures of bam margera and his pals (johnny knoxville, brandon dicamillo, etc). this show, while it has its fair share of gross-out comedy and crazy stunts, focuses mainly on bam's torturing of his parents.<br /><br />i'm sorry to say this, bam, but... you're in no way as cool as you think you are. this ego tripped show is not only painfully unfunny (and yes, i liked jackass), but also narcissistic beyond belief. the overly stylized intro ends with bam coolly explaining that he's going to do "whatever the f***" he wants to. how about you do something that is actually funny? i liked "jackass" for what it was worth. the camera-work was horrible - any idiot could have made a better show with a camcorder in their parents' garage - but at least the show moved at a steady pace and never felt boring between the crazy, dangerous or simply disgusting stunts the pals performed.<br /><br />not so with "viva la bam". we follow our hero around as he plays pranks on his friends and tortures his relatives, but never does it feel like anything else than really lame and scripted comedy. the stunts and pranks are mildly entertaining, but presented in such a tedious and dull fashion that they can barely make you smile.<br /><br />"viva la bam" is a poor spin-off of that does little good but feed margera's already too big ego. i don't recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone.
