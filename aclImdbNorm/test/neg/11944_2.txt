i hesitated seeing this movie, having really enjoyed the original, 'mostly martha'. what a disappointment. catherine zeta jones is a good actress but this wasn't her film. the original had poignant moments, perfectly punctuated with an incredible soundtrack. no reservations felt like it never connected. the food, the characters - nothing felt passionate. in mostly martha, the food came alive- every scene was filmed in such a way you could taste it with your eyes - the smells, the textures. the food in 'no reservations' was in the background - rarely did we get a closeup of the preparation; the characters were not real enough to carry the movie without it. it was hard finishing the movie - many of the scenes felt awkward. see the original - it's a truly enjoyable movie; the soundtrack incredible.
