just finished watching this movie as it were playing on tv and i did'nt have anything else to do. went right here to imdb too look on the trivia page and happened to glance at the user comments. and what do i find? every dumb idiot raises this movie to the sky! i would'nt even have written anything but when no one else takes the time to spread the word about this suck-ass movie i thought that i could.<br /><br />the acting sucked from pretty much everyone in the cast. the worst one was the guy playing brian wilson (think i got the name right) as he were overacting, especially when he was high. the rest was'nt as bad as him but no one was good neither. i ain't no expert on the beach boys though so cant really complain on the story that much.... except it sucked though. no motivation for any of the characters decisions most of the time but hey, maybe they were idiots in real life to. and what i found worst was that i thought it were going to be a movie about the beach boys, but you really only got a grip about a few of the characters. i hate when they do that in movies, same thing in the doors, even though i like that movie more. don't have any energy left to write more... it sucked! don't buy or watch it!
