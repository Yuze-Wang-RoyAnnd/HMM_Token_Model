i don't understand the humor in this film. i also found it offensive on how koreans were depicted in that film, despite how it is actually just a caricature of koreans in those areas. first, the actors are japanese, and they make the most rude expressions of koreans in that film. it disgusts me on how these people are expressed. i felt anger just watching that one scene, and how they were so badly made out in the film. the humor lasts just for one laugh, and then you don't understand why it's even funny. it's crude humor with the most disgusting representation of society there. i found it to be an offensive film overall... maybe it was just because i never lived in the "hood" or saw any "hood" movies, but i don't intend to either.
