if you are looking for the feel-good hit of the summer, dark harvest 2 might just be your ticket. the production values of this movie are extremely high (looks as if it were filmed with a sony handicam and edited using imovie), especially the sound effects -- they sound straight off of a "spooky halloween sounds" cd! the scarecrow from the cover, although he doesn't appear in the movie and otherwise has no relevance, is terrifyingly realistic! from beginning to end, you'll watch as a man aimlessly searches for his daughters through a, pun intended, maize! at the climactic ending of the movie you'll see, well...you'll have to watch for yourself.<br /><br />what i'm really trying to say here is, don't come within 1000 yards of this movie. i rented it because i thought it would be a campy sort of "troll 2" funny, but it's not. i cried after i watched this movie, because i realized i had spent money on it (and i found the $4 i spent on renting it). i actually fell asleep for 20 minutes and still knew what was going on.
