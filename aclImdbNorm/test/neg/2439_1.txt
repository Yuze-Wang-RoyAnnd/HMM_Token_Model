laura fraser creates her ideal man on a virtual reality machine and he's suddenly brought to life, of course. oh what jolly japes don't ensue in a britcom flop so day-glo bright yet so dismal it manages to make the execrable 1980s american teen flick weird science look almost decent. the sex-obsessed script is by the sun film critic nick fisher, a former teeny-mag 'agony uncle' who's obviously never watched an episode of smack the pony in his life; shame, because then he might at least have been in with a shout of writing female characters that were recognisably members of the human race. this knicker-twisting lot have all too clearly emerged from the virtual brain of someone who imagines they're amusing. suddenly, the thought of new-wave iranian cinema is somehow attractive.
