that's what me and my friends kept asking each other throughout this entire flick. we couldn't believe how stupid it was! i think somebody shot this on their camcorder at home and snuck it into the movie store and put it on the shelf as a joke to see if anybody would ever pick it up. well, i guess the joke is on us.<br /><br />i guess i should have come to this website first and read all of the reviews it has gotten, every single one says this movie is horrible, stupid, and on and on. and boy are they right! although it did provide some pretty good laughs (me and my friends were pretty drunk) because it is so stupid. we just can't believe somebody was dumb enough to make such a crappy movie! i swear this had to be made in the 70's before they had good technology for movies and stuff because every scene looks really crappy, but when i looked on here it said it was made in 2001? what? it sure doesn't look like a movie that would be made today, but i guess that's what you get when you use a camcorder and shoot home movies using strobe lights and really fake looking lasers, and use real life people from your home town instead of actors or even aspiring actors. btw-some of those chicks (or were they drag queens, we couldn't tell!) were so fugly, even my drunk horny college buddies wouldn't touch them with a 50-foot pole.<br /><br />so there's absolutely no appeal to this movie at all, bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. don't waste your time or money on this one, you'll be completely disappointed!
