if you are a christian or a jew hoping to see an accurate biblical (or torah) portrayal of the events in exodus, you will be disappointed by this movie. in typical hollywood fashion people who are not even in the bible have been "created" for supporting characters and play a large role in the movie. jethro's role is changed completely and he becomes nothing but an untrusting father-in-law instead of a shepherd priest who gave moses excellent advise. god is largely removed from the movie, and instead viewers are given the impression that moses had to figure things out for himself. nothing could be further from the truth.<br /><br />this movie is a typical humanistic twist on biblical things and attempts to put most of the responsibility on moses for trying to understand what god wants and what he should do. those who know the book of exodus well will see not only inconsistencies in the movie, but outright glaring changes to events. most importantly, they will see a near total absence of god's dialog with moses, which determines everything moses does after the burning bush. far from being alone as portrayed in the movie, moses is guided by god with detailed and direct communication.<br /><br />even hallmark apparently can't acknowledge god's direct role, and without his spoken words to moses many events make no sense. to compensate, hallmark has actually changed some things. for instance, after the golden calf god plagues the people and they must look upon a symbol of a serpent to live. hallmark creates a civil war instead and the israelites pick sides, then slaughter each other. moses side wins of course.<br /><br />there may be minimal value in this movie to unbelievers since it may cause them to seek answers, but believers should stay away. the twisted events and changes make this a danger to anyone who doesn't know their bible. read exodus for yourself, there is no substitute.
