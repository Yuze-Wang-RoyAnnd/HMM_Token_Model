this movie is a window on the world of britain in 1973 - a world of holiday camps, fags and birds. i was actually at pontins prestatyn while this was being filmed, so it's fascinating to see where i holidayed as a kid, and what a world we have left behind. the 'plot', such as it is, concerns stan and jack's attempts to turn a job at a holiday camp(25 quid a week!) into an opportunity for chasing young women and winding up blakey. they are joined by the rest of stan's family and some laughs are to be had from arthur (michael robbins) and olive's (anna karen) persistent chuntering, as well as the sheer oddness of blakey, but the idea that young women would see anything desirable in brilliantined stan (reg varney) or lecherous jack (bob grant) is just risible. harmless enough in its time, now it's just a curio from a bygone age.
