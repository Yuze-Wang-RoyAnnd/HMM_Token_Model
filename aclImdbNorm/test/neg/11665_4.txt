this turned out to be more of a women's romance-soap-suspense film than what i hoped it was....simply a tense thriller. yes, the final 20 minutes were suspenseful but much of the previous 75 bordered on being just plain tedious.<br /><br />ruter hauer was a little too subdued, not playing his normal intense character. natasha richardson sports somewhat of a dumb look most of the time and her character was very unappealing.<br /><br />the story is so-so. it's not as bad as i'm making out, but it sure isn't anything i'd watch again, and the back of the vhs describing this movie was misleading.
