this movie was, unfortunately, terrible.<br /><br />clich'ed, hackneyed, stilted dialogue and acting make it almost unwatchable.<br /><br />the feel-good finale is laughably lame.<br /><br />there is a reason judge reinhold's career has vanished.<br /><br />if you don't live in new york, and aren't jewish, several of the jokes will be inscrutable.<br /><br />i, too, found the need to have the unacknowledged lesbian daughter go straight at the end quite insulting.<br /><br />i simply cannot fathom how this film was so popular at film fests.<br /><br />it is, without a doubt, one of the worst films i have seen in quite some time.
