he seems to be a control freak. i have heard him comment on "losing control of the show" and tell another guest who brought live animals that he had one rule-"no snakes." he needs to hire a comedy writer because his jokes are lame. the only reason i watch him is because he some some great guests and bands. <br /><br />i watched the craig ferguson show for a while but his show is even worse. he likes to bull sh** to burn time.i don't think either man has much of a future in late night talk shows.<br /><br />daily also has the annoying habit of sticking his tongue out to lick his lips. he must do this at least 10 times a show. i do like the joe firstman band. carson daily needs to lighten up before it is too late.
