at last, a film to rival 'el padrino' and 'darkness falls' in terms of sheer and utter dullness. this is actually the first film i've ever given 1 out of 10 for on imdb, and with good reason.<br /><br />for one, the cast is nothing special. that's usually not a problem for me except that the only character that's in anyways interesting or different from all the rest is grand l. bush's harrington. secondly, the production values a substandard - television sci-fi such as 'stargate' has more convincing sets, and all of the underwater scenes not handled by the sfx teams are filmed on dry sets with 'falling particles' that aren't very convincing. this film is literally 'drydocked'. the worst part though is that this film is boring. for the first 45 minutes, i felt as if we were going round and round in circles: "it's a prehistoric shark." "bullsh*t." "no really." "bullsh*t." "i'm not making this up." "bullsh*t." "there it is now!" "i didn't see anything." "let me guess?" "yup. bullsh*t." after then it picks up ever so slightly for about twenty minutes or so. then we're back to the dialog run-around. dialog is not a bad thing, but that's all this film has. characters talking. that too, is not a bad thing, except this film isn't very good at it. the dialog is often contrived and clich'ed, and is not very interesting to listen to. i don't see any point slandering the special effects; this film has worse qualities.<br /><br />the sets are small and unrealistic. the acting is sub-par. the script - oh lord, the script - is worse than a garbage of sci-fi television has to dredge up. it makes you wonder where the budget of this film is or was.<br /><br />yet another awful, awful addition to the 'megaloadon' (there's about four) series of films. bring on steve alten, please...
