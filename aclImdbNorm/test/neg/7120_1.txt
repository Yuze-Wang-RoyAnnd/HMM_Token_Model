all i can say about this movie, is it is absolutely boring. the intro to the movie is quite possibly the worst intro to a horror film i have ever seen, i mean a angry chick hitting a guy in the head with a frying pan isn't at all frightening which is what i assume the director was aiming for, but in fact it was "mildly" funny. <br /><br />the acting in this picture was beyond pathetic; a note to directors, if your making a horror film, please hire some good actors, not some popular teen soap star who has no idea how to act.<br /><br />the death scenes in this movie were beyond boring... no gore, and i'm sorry but horror movies without gore, or good suspense are just cheesy. i mean this girl gets killed by hair wrapped all around her in the middle of tokyo, and not one person sees it happen, they just declare her as "missing", wow thats awesome!<br /><br />in conclusion if you and your friends want to see this movie, make sure u bring some sleeping pills, because i guarantee you won't make it to the end.. me and my friend walked out cause we didn't even care what happened at the end.<br /><br />cheers
