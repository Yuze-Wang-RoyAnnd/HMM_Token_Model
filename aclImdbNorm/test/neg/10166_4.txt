this review is for the uk dvd three-disc box set. disc one is called caught in the act and contains model behavior, chasing jamie and fast and curious. disc two is called bedroom fantasies and contains blue plate special, falling in lust again and love potion no. 10. the final disc is called anything goes and contains chatroom, she's the boss and legally yours. why the other four episodes in the series are not included is a mystery because there is surely enough room on the discs for a lot more material.<br /><br />each episode opens with the hotel manager chloe (lauren hayes) reading a letter from a satisfied customer. we then get to see the story unfolding as the guests check into the hotel. blue plate special is the exception because this story is from a waitress. the writers should be given credit for coming up with a good variety of story lines. for instance, model behavior is about two models vying for the attention of the photo crew; falling in lust again is about a man and woman who parted and rekindle their love when they meet up again at the hotel; she's the boss is about a put-upon male secretary/dogsbody who shows that he is more of a man than his female boss realised - much to her pleasure. all the episodes lead up to lots of nudity and sex.<br /><br />it should come as no surprise that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and handsome hunks. even the geeky secretaries get transformed when they remove their spectacles and let their hair down. the sex action is plentiful but to me seems too frantic and false. the camera work could also have done with a bit of moderation, spending too much time close up and so moving about to capture everything, and as usual we get loud music during the sex action. finally, the end credits mention the palm canopy hotel, singer island, florida although my map of florida shows no singer island. the scenery certainly looks more like florida than utah or las vegas that some people have mentioned. this is quite a good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still awaiting a uk dvd release. 4 stars.
