this is by far one the most boring movies i've ever seen! and if you don't believe me go ahead and watch it for yourself.<br /><br />the movie starts of slow, the storyline makes no sense at all. people fighting doesn't make any sense. i could not make sense of what they were talking during the movie (in most cases i didn't even bother) it does nothing to keep you watching the movie, the only plus point would be the cinematography. new zealand looks awesome. everything else just plain sucks.<br /><br />the actors try their best to keep us awake, but unfortunately you will go to sleep instead.<br /><br />do us all a favor, even if this gets on "on demand", don't watch it!
