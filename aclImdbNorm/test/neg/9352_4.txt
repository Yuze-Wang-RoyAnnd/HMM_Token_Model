awful star wars knock-off with a slightly more comic tinge. robert urich stars as the leader of a group of ice pirates, who steal ice because water is the most valuable substance in the universe now (how all the poor people stay alive is a mystery). he hooks up with mary crosby (bing's daughter, around 25 and a total cutie), a princess looking for her missing father. also in the cast are an embarrassed-looking anjelica huston in some hilarious sci-fi get-ups and a pudgy, short-ish ron perlman (whom i thought was seven feet tall from his other roles!). and john carradine, who looks days from death and hollywood squares funnyman (relative term) bruce vilanch. if you ever wanted to see bruce vilanch get decapitated, here's your film. but, then again, even that's not worth seeing, as it doesn't shut him up at all (think he might have been a robot, but i nodded off a couple of times).
