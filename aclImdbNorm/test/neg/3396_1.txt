this is my opinion of this movie, expressed in its dialogs.<br /><br />to be more serious, i can't say this movie is a bad moment but i didn't enjoy it either. <br /><br />first, i was simply indifferent & couldn't get my mind into the apes world. even though the make-up are very realistic, the constant screaming was irritating. may the film have changed apes for cats and it's a cult movie for me in relation to my fondness of the latter.<br /><br />the second part is more interesting, with the talent and freshness of then newcomers (macdowell & lambert), but i felt alienated: all the story is located in a big british mansion: no matter how luxurious is it, it was like a prison for me.<br /><br />at last, it could be a good adaptation of the burroughs' story of tarzan ? i don't know, having never read the book (or seen the disney): .<br /><br />in conclusion, i don't have any good moments to remember, so one viewing would be enough for me. <br /><br />i should have guessed my boredom after the endless freeze called "overture" at the beginning... what's the meaning? only the director knows it.
