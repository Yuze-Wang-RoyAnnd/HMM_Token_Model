paranoid park is about alex, a 16 year old skater who causes the death even if accidentally of a security guard. as the movie goes on alex deals with little issues like his parent's divorce and the sexual heat of his girlfriend jennifer(played by taylor momsen who you can currently see in gossip girl) while he's consumed by guilt. i had seen just one movie by gus van sant so far,elephant, and i can assure you that he kept all his mannerisms while doing this one.once again he crosses time lines.once again he uses weird filming techniques like the never-ending shots of people walking...maybe you like these filming techniques, i know i don't. the plot feels unsatisfactory to me...its almost to simple to be explored for such a long time. the feeling i get (same with elephant)is that gus van sant tries too hard to make an "artistic" movie which causes the movie itself to loose substance. also gabe nevins was pretty bad as alex, there's a difference between looking alienated or detached and looking like a robot. if you're a fan of mr.van sant then watch this, otherwise skip it.<br /><br />3/10
