hitchcock is a great director. ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch. i admire hitchcok on a purely visual and technical level.<br /><br />first the positives. hitchcock invented the notion of the probing camera. the curious eye that is able to withhold or search for information. it isn't exactly a new visual grammar but it was revolutionary then.<br /><br />secondly, hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie. he has an economical style and is always thinking of the audience. he gives them regular thrills, regular jolts of humour and regular shocks. in short, he anticipates the audience's base needs and plays them like a fiddle.<br /><br />unfortunately, the base needs of a human being are mostly stupid. food, sex, the thrill of danger and a little comedy. hithcock caters for all these needs on screen, with the exception of food, which, judging from his size, he catered to off screen.<br /><br />it's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films. a second downside is that most of hitchcock's camera work and visual grammar are now common place. what keeps his films watchable are the simple economy of his tales, the intelligence of his camera work, and his skill at crafting tense action set pieces.<br /><br />so on to "saboteur". this is a light-hearted romp in the vein of "the 39 steps". it jumps from sequence to sequence, until it concludes at the typical hitchcock final act set piece.<br /><br />on an emotional level, the relationship between the leads is not up to par with robert donat and madeleine caroll in "the 39 steps". hence the whole story lacks a certain energy. the plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes. and new scenes only bring us nearer the end, since it's not clear if the hook is the hero's escape from the police, from the villains or his action to stop the plotted sabotages.<br /><br />there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws. for example, a guy with handcuffs frees himself using a car fan belt etc. (why doesn't he just drive away in the car? surely handcuffs aren't that restrictive? he's able to swim in them, after all!)<br /><br />if you want a better hitchcock wartime propaganda flick from the 40's, i would advise you watch "foreign correspondant". they are both silly chase movies with a catchy finale, but "foreign correspondant" makes great use of umbrellas and tulips, something spielberg rips off nicely in "minority report".<br /><br />7.5/10 - some good set pieces. beyond that, however, there's nothing much to sink your teeth into.
