conclusion: very, but very, very boring, yet i watched till the end, hoping for some upside-down effect, but the end was worse, because it was nothing. the old black&white game didn't helped at all, it usually helps psychological movies, but this was not the case. the script, the plot, etc were linear, had no substance, nothing in-going. when you deal with psychological, you deal with analysis, therefore with details, that unity-diversity formula....there was no essence, no detail. just a story, there are many stories to tell, but something makes them unique and hard to forgive with the tools and creativity of movie-makers...well, this is not the one.
