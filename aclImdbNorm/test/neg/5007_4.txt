what is wrong with curacao ( also known as deadly currents though what the reasonn for the name change is i have no idea ) can probably be summed up where a woman says to her lover :<br /><br />" keep it down baby , i'm trying to sleep " <br /><br />it's not the dialogue that's the problem or the way it's delivered , it's the fact the actress has has a central european accent . nothing wrong with that until it's revealed her character is from philidelphia in the united states ! this what struck me about this thriller while watching it - the way accents don't match their characters . apart from the philly woman with a german accent we see a south african with an english accent , a local police chief who sounds like he's an irishman impersonating a gestapo officer and worst of all george c scott playing someone who's either dutch or british with an accent that sounds like it might be american tinged with south african . you soon give up following what's on screen and end up concentrating on what nationality a character might be due to the strange way they speak . it's interesting to note that this site hasn't given this movie a country of origin . with so many different actors from different countries you do feel that this was produced by the united nations <br /><br />even if you're not curious about accents or dialects you'll probably have to give up following the action anyway because curacao is plot less . things happen like a boat exploding , and a hostage situation and the hero being recruited as an agent for south african intelligence but you're left scratching your head wondering what the heck this is all leading to . i was lost
