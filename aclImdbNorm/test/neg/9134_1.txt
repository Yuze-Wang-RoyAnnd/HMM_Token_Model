koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi are both beautiful films, but this final installment of the trilogy is a major let down. they got too carried away with stock footage and photography, so little content. the executive producer puts his own image in the film... its just pretentious. maybe if they had more than $3 million to spend maybe it would have been something. i actually thought steven soderbergh directed it because it was so bad, but godfrey reggio the director of koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi directed this. i'll have to assume that they just didn't have the budget to make a decent film. you would think that francis ford coppola would have wanted to be a part of this film and help get more money together.
