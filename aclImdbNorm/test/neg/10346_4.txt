i watched this film mistakenly thinking that it was that other radio station zombie flick. the shonky production values and low-rent cast soon gave away that this was another one of the those cheap sci-fi channel style knock offs.<br /><br />the central performance from bill moseley is initially quite engaging as the dubious radio shock jock but as the film goes on becomes less and less convincing as he is actually required to act. the rest of the cast have little to do other than look concerned and have no depth whatsoever.<br /><br />the cinematography is dull, flat and completely uninspired, like so many of these kind of films. it doesn't even manage a decent bit of convincing gore, the zombie make up is literally pathetic apart from one notable exception towards the end of the film.<br /><br />the film tries to inject originality and a message into it's concoction of half baked and ripped off ideas by somehow equating this outbreak with intolerance towards islam and the war on terror. this is woefully handled with all the intellectual clout of a 6 year old. as the characters and seemingly the writers are unable to distinguish the difference between race and religion - describing all people of a certain skin colour as "muslims." most notably one character is revealed to be muslim by skin colour alone. at the same time the "muslim" terrorists who cause the outbreak are the usual psychopathic stereotype. <br /><br />presumably the far far superior pontypool had a similar budget as dead air yet shines everywhere where this film fails miserably.
