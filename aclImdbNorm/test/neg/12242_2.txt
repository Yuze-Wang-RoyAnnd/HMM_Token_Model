the spoof genre, which has lacked creativity and humor for some time already, gets spat upon yet again by hacks with no talent. no point, no fun, no originality; just a few cheap bucks for the film makers. <br /><br />it takes more than just referencing some recent movies and giving characters double-meaning names to be satire; to make people laugh. any clod can pick up a cam-corder, and have some bad-acting buddies in cheap costumes imitate somebody. since the genre being targeted this time is inspirational sports movies, there are a few lame references thrown out to movies of that type: the jokes are so weak the characters actually have to emphasize the references in various ways, to get you to laugh hysterically. it doesn't work.<br /><br />that's not comedy. however, the same old worn out sophomoric "jokes" ripped off from a middle school washroom (done even more blandly than usual) are all here. if that's not enough, there's a running "gag" of a bus running somebody over. so funny, right? also, one pathetically poor scene does more product placement than michael bay; again with the same unfunny results. a musical bit flops miserably. pity carl weathers, once apollo creed in the rocky series, now stuck with roles in swill like this.<br /><br />lousy beyond words. watching a snail run the marathon would be less tedious than watching this film is. probably a lot funnier, too.
