let me say this about edward d. wood jr. he had a passion for his work that i wish more people did have. if we all had the optimism and the commanding hope of ed wood, the world would probably be a much better place. being familiar with ed wood's story and having seen the most wonderful biopic "ed wood" (1994) several times, i admire his boldness and his strives for the job he loved; i still admire his never-say-die attitude. he had a love for directing that i wish more people in modern-day hollywood had.<br /><br />but that doesn't make his movies any more fun to watch. and "glen or glenda," his first and most confessional film, is probably his very worst.<br /><br />"glen or glenda" is a deadening cult movie about a cross-dresser named glen (played by director/writer ed wood himself) who despite his love for his fianc'ee barbara (dolores fuller), cannot seem to conquer his lust for transvestitism, in which he dresses in women's clothing and a wig and thus becomes...glenda! glen/glenda's story is narrated by a doctor and he too is talked and watched over by a mysterious character called "the scientist" played by veteran horror star bela lugosi. oh, and there's also some sub-story about an alan/anne character who becomes a transsexual based on the christine jorgenson story, upon whom this movie originally titled "i changed my sex!" was previously to be based.<br /><br />have i dropped your jaw yet? well, as much as i want to warn you off this picture if you've never seen it, i would never tell a lie about a movie and there is not one word of falsehood in that plot synopsis i just gave you. every thing in it is true. this is a movie about cross-dressers and transsexuals, a topic that does not sound very appealing to begin with and is not done in a very appealing manner. i'm sure that with a good screenplay, and a good director (it had neither) that "glen or glenda," despite the subject matter, could have been a very moving picture. it is a confessional movie on wood's part, as he was a transvestite in real life as well as on screen. but once again, that does not make it a good movie...or a watchable one for that matter. "glen or glenda" is a jumbled, disorganized mess of a movie that sinks into new trenches in the realm of bad cinema. it makes no more sense than does its notoriously silly scene where bela lugosi screams "pull the string!" over inexplicable footage of stampeding bison. the majority of the movie is narrated in a monotonous voice, reminding me of some very bad short informative films i've seen before. it's like one of those really bad short films expanded into a seventy-minute feature and twice as dull. we sit there for ages waiting for the plot that never comes. there is no real attempt to even build energy with the camera being locked down in one position for many grueling minutes and long stretches of time where nothing at all happens. the only moments that are worth anybody's time are those of bela lugosi who manages to bring some light into these dark trenches. i guess lugosi is supposed to be like the deity of the film, but personally, i couldn't care less who or what he's supposed to be. i'll tell you what he was: a gifted actor who wound up making trash. but he and wood were very good friends and liked working with each other, so good for him.<br /><br />i will always admire edward d. wood jr. for his passion for the cinema, but i will never as long as i live admire his movies. a film critic once called ed wood's movies "innocent fun" but i think even that is questionable. innocent? yes. fun? no, sir. and if "citizen kane" is the mount everest of the cinematic world, then "glen or glenda" is probably the mariana trench.
