i still wonder why i sat through this entire thing. it only had about 3 minutes of actual entertainment, the rest of it was just a total bore. the acting isn't that great and the action scenes are soooo cheesy it's not even funny. i kinda wish i could say something good about this film but i can't think of anything right now. there probably was somethings in it some can enjoy but the ending of it is gotta be the dumbest idea ever. what type of person would get a little toy remote controlled helicopter with a burned in machine gun in it to assassinate the president? this idea could have never been done in the first place let alone have anyone dumb enough to try it, i guess the writer must have been to obsessed with the toy car scene in the dead pool but actually tried to make this look serious.
