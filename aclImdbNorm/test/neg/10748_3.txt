there are places for political commentary in film, but "masters of horror" is not one of them. i get enough of this stuff from newsweek and every other editorial in the newspaper. now i've got to watch this in horror movies? c'mon! all i wanted was a good zombie schlock film, not another "bush is bad!" rant. if joe dante wants to express his politics, let him go on air america. and if you must insist on making a "message" film, be a little more sly about it. this had all the insinuation of being slapped in the face with a dead fish.<br /><br />by the way joe, do you really want the left-wing voting block to be associated with brain-dead zombies? might want to think about that before making another political horror movie (god help us).
