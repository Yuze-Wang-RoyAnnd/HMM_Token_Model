michael feifer writes and directs this fictitious story based on the arrest of edward gein in plainfield, wisconsin. gein was responsible for a rash of gruesome murders that sent a shock wave of terror through his rural hometown in the late 1950's. his evil mind and twisted world is suspected to be caused by his domineering zealous lutheran mother. ed was given the nickname "the butcher of plainfield". he would rob corpses from fresh graves of women who resembled his mother and he would have sex with them before 'dressing them like a deer' in his garage. severed heads with bodies hanging upside down being his personal trademark. after his arrest there would be many articles made from human skin found in his home. in this movie, a young deputy bobby mason(shawn hoffman)makes the search for gein(kane hodder)a personal one, when his storekeeper mother(priscilla barnes)goes missing. the acting is a whole lot better than the ridiculously liberal telling of the documented events concerning gein. also in the cast: adrienne frantz, timothy oman, john burke, michael berryman and amy lyndon.
