eaten alive plays out like a bad rehearsal for the following year's cannibal ferox. the characters are universally bland, the locations are criminally under-utilized, there's no attempt to create tension or suspense, the physical effects are either laughably bad or shamelessly stolen from other movies, and the ubiquitous tribal rape scenes are barely worthy of a pg-13. even the scenes of animal 'cruelty' are more tedious than usual. the only mildly shocking scene involves crazy jonas, going a bit goldfinger, wielding a blood soaked dildo; a scene that is just plain bizarre rather than graphic. my beloved wife, she of the 'romeo and juliet collector's edition', watched this movie without so much as a wince of disgust! and it calls itself a cannibal movie! all-in-all, a pretty lame effort that thoroughly betrays the cannibal tradition. cannibal ferox, luci's follow-up, is a far superior example of the genre.
