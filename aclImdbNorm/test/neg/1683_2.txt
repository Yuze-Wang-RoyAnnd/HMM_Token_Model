i jumped for joy to learn this show ended. this show's characters were extremely irritating. none of them had one singing redeeming quality. damon wayans is probably the most standable one. kisha campbell is... kisha campbell. she's just as annoying as she was in martin.<br /><br />the kids are all very annoying as well. the oldest is an idiot, the oldest girl is a stuck up brat, and the youngest is frustrating to listen to.<br /><br />i guess i did like the intelligent little boy. but that's about it.<br /><br />it did the world a favor by ending.<br /><br />let's pray that a wayan never stars in another show... ever.
