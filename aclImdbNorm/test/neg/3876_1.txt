i'm not sure this film could ever match the first one, even if it starred the original seven (notwithstanding the fact that four were killed). it just doesn't have the spark and chemistry. all the actors seem tired and look as if they are just going through the motions to get their paychecks.<br /><br />it's interesting how yul brynner is "magnificent" in the original film but stiff and unconvincing in this sequel. yet when he stars in westworld and futureworld in the 1970s his character (in the same matching black pants, shirt and hat) evokes the same mystery and presence of the 1960 film's chris adams.<br /><br />there's nothing in this 1966 flick to make it worth watching, even on cable.
