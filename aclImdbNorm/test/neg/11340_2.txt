as much as i hated the movie that this series follows i can at least says that zangief was amusing. the animated series is quite possibly one of the worst things ever produced. the animation is quite often inconsistent, although it does stay consistently bad. the shape of a characters face is even capable of drastically changing in the same shot. the script and voice acting also leave something to be desired since most of the cast seems about as talented as the cast of a third grade drama play. characters like cammy and dj are so forced into stereotypes of their nationalities that episodes containing them are almost physically painful to watch, not that the series isn't painful on a regular basis anyway. episode plots seem to strive to reach new levels of lame with every turn and are so full of plot holes it amazes me they had time to show commercials. truthfully, it amazes me anyone wold pay to advertise during the show. in addition to being a bad series it is an even worse adaptation of street fighter. many of the characters maintain the failed adaptations from the movie. examples include ken and ryu being idiot con men (even though ken is supposed to be rich), blanka being guiles friend charlie, and chun li being a reporter. it takes talent to take something as bad as the movie and make it worse.
