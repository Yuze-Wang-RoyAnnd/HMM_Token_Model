going by the good words of my friends, i hired this movie, hoping that it would at least equal the laughs of the similar movie, "house party", but i was very disappointed, and very bored.<br /><br />falling asleep while watching a movie is never a good sign. i don't know whether this didn't appeal to me because i don't live in "da hood", or if i'm not black, but it's probably one of the two.<br /><br />it tries to spoof a few movies, only coming up with a couple of laughs, but in the long run it fails miserably. miss it.
