my mom would not let me watch this film when i was in grade 2, because she said it was too violent. well, years later, and the only reason i remember this film is because of my mom, i stayed up and watch it on pbs. well, maybe the build up after all these year lead to the big disapointment of this film, but i found it lame. it did not age well, and this made the acting choppy, huge unbelievable holes in the script, but there is a few cool scenes like car chases, and a big gun fight. i will not stay up for this film again.
