i actually went into this film with some expectations, not because i thought the film sounded particularly good, but because i'm a fan of italian exploitation flicks and with a cast that sees franco nero and telly savalas starring alongside oliver twist, i figured it had to be interesting at least. well...redneck does have one or two positive things going on, but for the most part; it's a dull, lifeless film that is as ridiculous as it is pointless. the plot simply focuses on two criminals (nero and savalas) who kidnap a young kid (oliver). the twist in the tale is that the kid realises that he'd have more fun if he gets accepted into the 'gang'. telly savalas and franco nero are two actors that have proved they can carry a film on their own on numerous occasions, and they do have some memorable moments in this film - although really for all the wrong reasons. savalas in particular gives a silly portrayal of the 'bad' criminal. the plot doesn't flow badly, but since nothing interesting happens, that's not really a positive point and doesn't save from the film from being mediocre. overall, i can't recommend this film; it may appeal to some for its cult value but it didn't do anything for me.
