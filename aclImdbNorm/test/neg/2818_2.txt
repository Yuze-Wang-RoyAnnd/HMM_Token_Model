could easily have been better. in fact maybe so much so that if the filmmaker hadn't tried even as hard as he did, it might have actually been better.<br /><br />on a good note. the lighting was reasonably okay. but pretty much everything else was lacking. wobbly camera work. (yeah, yeah, i know, that's supposed to be the style now.) poorly recorded audio. and editing that looked like someone watched too many ulli lommel movies (which are some of the worst edited movies.) to sum it up, the movie seemed to be a rationalization for the director/writer/main-character to get some young women naked, put them in fake bondage, and grope them, while saying "menacing" things.
