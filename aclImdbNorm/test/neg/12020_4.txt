and nothing else.<br /><br />one of my friends bought the problem child tantrum pack (contains the first two "problem child"s in one disc), and we decided to watch the sequel because it was "funnier".<br /><br />there were many funny moments in the movie (the vomit scene, that's all i need to say.), nippy the dog after eating chow down, and numerous others. the movie is nothing but toilet humor, but it's hilarious. other than the funny moments, though, this movie has little to offer.<br /><br />john ritter annoys the crap out of me, because it sounds like he's reading out of a book. the man can't act in this one, sorry.<br /><br />although i can't say if i would find the movie funny now...(we were blown when we watched it), it's a perfect movie for a rainy day...but nothing else. don't expect oscar material on this one, guys.
