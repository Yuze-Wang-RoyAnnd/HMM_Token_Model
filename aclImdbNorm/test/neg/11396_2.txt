if you read errol flynn's autobiography, my wicked, wicked ways, you will see that this film is full of poetic licence. not that that makes much of a difference, because errol flynn was pretty generous with poetic licence in the autobiography anyway. no need to worry about spoilers, since there is nothing there to spoil.<br /><br />to me it would seem more sensible to use the story about a fictitious hollywood actor; then you could go out and find a better actor than duncan regehr to play him, and you wouldn't have to worry about the audience saying things like: "but he didn't have a moustaches in captain blood." another failing of this film is that it shows flynn as a two-dimensional character. flynn was an intelligent man, well educated, well read. this film only concentrates on his funster image.<br /><br />regehr is a disaster. the rest of the cast struggle with their scripts. hal linden is ok as warner, and barbara hershey makes a believable damita, although lili damita herself did not think so.<br /><br />the best thing to do with this film is to forget about it and let it gently slip away to oblivion. so what i am writing this for, i can't imagine.
