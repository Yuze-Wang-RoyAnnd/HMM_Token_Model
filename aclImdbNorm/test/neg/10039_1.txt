i am not understanding why people are praising this movie. i didn't like it at all. i watch it with several people. none of them cared for it either. first of all. it is just plain that another low budget studio is trying to cash in on a big name story. the actual filming looks like a live tv interview. the makeup is bad. when you watch the movie along with the dvd extras. you will see there is a lot of enthusiasm from the people who participated in it. there is no talent. there are facts that do appear in the book. the facts are distorted by the invention of comedy and skits added to it. i have read several books and have watched several shows on this story. what i have always caught from all the material on this is that it was a serious horror story. i really wish someone could really do a good film on this one. it has always fascinated me. the bad acting really ruined the story. the little boys situation really hammed it up even more. when you watch this movie. the little boy and his problem is the thing you and your friends will remember and laugh about. it didn't make any sense why his brothers were laughing at what had happened to him. it was like the witch was supposed to be so threatening but it was ok to throw baby brother to her. it is a whopping tale with him and his little problem. i can't still get over the little girl saying "mom said tobacco will rot your teeth." frank fox's statement and facial expression is so bad. the scene out in the yard with him getting food is pretty stupid to. the sound from parts of it seems to be from the movie psycho. also, the girl hovering over the bed and her little "bladder control problem" are from the exorcist. this movie is lacking from the talent of creativity. we put the movie in for a couple of minutes and knew right away it was a bummer. i also noticed that their was defects in the film quality. parts of it looked like what a person might film on a home video camera. i noticed a lot of the people in the credits had many multiple jobs. this is probably how this movie was put together. someone said i like this story. i will get all my friends and make a movie about with a video camera and a computer. doesn't matter if we don't know how to act. as long as we get it on film and say it is good. we got the family together and prepared food. then sat down and watched this failed attempt to make a movie.
