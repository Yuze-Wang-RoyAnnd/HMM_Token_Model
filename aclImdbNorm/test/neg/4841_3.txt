this is said to be the first polish western and is written and directed by piotr uklanski. known in the u.s. as dead man's bounty, this film uses some strange visuals to tell a story that is short on dialog. val kilmer plays a corpse and some scenes are through his dead eyes. some awkward visual situations are actually comical in a sick way. my favorite is a young man building a gallows chops off one of his own fingers and actually hangs himself testing the strength of the rope. a cowboy known only as 'the stranger'(karel roden)finds a dead man(kilmer) that he thinks is a wanted man. he takes him to the nearest town to collect the bounty. he ends up losing the corpse and the potential bounty in a gambling game with the town's drunken sheriff(boguslaw linda)and has the few townsmen turned against him when he has a dalliance with the barmaid(katarzyna figura). he manages to escape sure death and leads the small posse on a dangerous 'wild goose chase'. one scene has the stranger tending to a scalp wound by cauterizing with gunpowder and a match. the corpse rots chained to a hitching post as the sheriff finds out that there is no bounty to be had. this movie also known as summer love has a haunting theme song sung by john davidson. nevertheless this western is like watching a train wreck. there is just something that tells you not to look...but you do.
