"the twins effect" is the worst movie i've seen! not only is the support weak, but the characters as well. i'm sorry to say to you edison fans, but kazaf is by far the weakest vampire i've seen in my life. i'm sorry edison; your role in this movie was disappointing. edison does not fight whatsoever in this movie and i'm sure if they didn't have kazaf in the movie, the plot wouldn't be much different. the main plot in the movie is not explained nearly enough and the entire movie focused too much on helen and kazaf's growing relationship. i mean, who the hell was kazaf and why did they need his blood? yeah, he's the prince right? so what!<br /><br />certain scenes in this movie were just plain stupid. yeah, the action was great but the entire outline of it was stupid. in one scene towards the end, duke dekotes says that kazaf is the strongest of his brothers... yeah it would seem so now that he's full grown. why would you wait until he's grown up to attack? another scene was with jackie chan, one of my personal favorites. in the scene, jackie asked helen who were the creatures that persistently followed them. how can you be so naive as to not know that they are vampires? people are dying around them with bite marks on their necks; surely the news would be on it faster than you can say "vampire."<br /><br />the characters were yet another mistake in the movie. helen, played by charlene choi, is the girlfriend of kazaf. what kind of girl would not be scared of vampires, especially if it is your brother's job to kill them? i can bet you that you would not find such a brave girl as helen if you searched your whole life. helen is annoying, bitchy, and is a total drama queen in the movie. she tries too hard to be different and in the end fails miserably. one of the weirdest and most disturbing characters i've seen in any movie. why would you bite someone's neck especially if you're not a vampire? it's very odd that her reaction to kazaf's confession doesn't turn him off. kazaf, played by edison chen, is another stupid character in the story. how degrading for a young actor as himself to play in a movie with such a poorly constructed role. he does not stand up for himself throughout the movie and does not fight. although i'm a fan of edison, i wouldn't want a man who lies on the ground the whole time. gypsy and reeve are my favorite characters in the movie. their love is pure and sweet. gypsy is gorgeous and does not try too hard like helen. reeve, played by ekin cheng, is wise and seems to be the only person that makes sense in the movie. a plot failure was the death of reeve. the movie had absolutely no substance yet it doomed itself by removing one of the only likable characters. another character was duke dekotes. the story didn't focus much on him and therefore made his desire to obtain kazaf's "rock" seem irrelevant.<br /><br />it's very sad because towards the end of the movie, i was forcing myself to watch because i so desperately wanted to see kazaf fight. the end was so abrupt because the whole time i was expecting so great to happen. kazaf, who's the supposed vampire prince, does nothing for the movie and i'm sure if he were taken out, the movie wouldn't be much different. i highly recommend you to not waste your time on this movie as i have. i was greatly disappointed. if you're in search of a great movie, why not watch "lord of the rings" or "pirates of the caribbean?" likeable characters with a well-written plot.
