i can tell by the other comments that nobody could ever actually enjoy this trifling piece of crap, that's the same way i felt.<br /><br />the whole time i was watching it i was horrified that anyone could make a movie this stupid! what is the world coming to? i guess it is my fault for sitting through the entire movie (ugh!) but it was like a bad car wreck, i couldn't look away.<br /><br />if you are a kid under 8 years of age, you might like this movie. otherwise, stay away from it at all costs. it's the stupidest movie i've ever seen.<br /><br />everything's stupid--the story, script, and especially the acting, everything! while watching the movie you'll either turn the tv off and think "how can a movie be so sadly stupid", or keep on watching from curiosity, to see if things can get more stupid than this (they can't).<br /><br />these movie makers (if you can call them that) need to seriously go back to their day jobs, not one of them has an ounce of talent, and i highly doubt you can make a living churning out such horrible useless garbage that no one in their right minds would ever want to see!<br /><br />just drawn out b.s. don't waste your time.
