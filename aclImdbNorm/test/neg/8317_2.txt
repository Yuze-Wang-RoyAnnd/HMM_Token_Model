i don't know what neighborhoods the folks who wrote the rave reviews for this movie live in, but i'm glad i'm not there if they don't comment on the cartoonish-ness of this thing. okay, we learn to suspend our disbelief in films like the "die hard" series, but seeing little jodie knock off a whole street gang, with a glock, as a novice yet...c'mon. all she needed was a bald head and a ripped t-shirt and she would be bruce willis. <br /><br />apparently, jodie being the executive producer blinded her to what a joke and waste of her money this would be. or she was living out some kind of fantasy where she is the only blonde and everyone else is a brunette black, or hispanic. even the dog is black. little blondie is the only good one and (except for a black police officer) everyone else in town is some nasty minority out to get her. has your fear of your acting talent declined so far that you think the only way you can get noticed is to be the only bright spot (literally) on camera in a dark, morose and somber neighborhood/film/cast? apparently she thought she was in the wrong movie...the dark knight.<br /><br />ridiculous plot holes, furniture chewing acting, gratuitous violence ("look girls! now you can do it, too!")...spend the time with your family instead of watching this drek.
