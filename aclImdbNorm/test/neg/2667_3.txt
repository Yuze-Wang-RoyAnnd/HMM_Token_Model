ok, just what the hell is all this supposed to mean??? halloween 6 (let's just call it that, ok?) is, without a doubt, the most confusing film in the series (and from what i've heard, seeing the original "producers cut" doesn't sound like it makes things any less bewildering than the "official" release). what a mess.<br /><br />this isn't a really bad film, as some have said. it has its scary scenes and some rather intense moments - it just doesn't make any sense! don't tell me that michael was "engineered" from the beginning to be evil and kill and destroy, and blah blah blah. it was bad enough when they turned michael into jamie lee curtis' brother (just so they had an excuse to keep her in the second film) - this is too much.<br /><br />it would seem this is another case of the creators of the film trying to be "too smart" by coming up with a new premise that will shock and impress us all. bad move, guys. we're not looking for an explanation of why michael kills, so please don't try and feed us this crap. show me michael looking menacing and killing a bunch of people. show me dr. loomis trying to track him down and, as always, coming up just short. don't waste (what turned out to be) the last performance of donald pleasance by telling me (in the most confusing way possible) that michael was "created" by some cult from hell and that his "seed" will be passed on to another and... oh, brother.<br /><br />halloween 6 has its moments, don't get me wrong, and we all know there have been far worse sequels than this (hellraiser, anyone?) so get what you can out of it (the scene toward the end of the film with michael charging down a deep red corridor is particularly effective) and try to ignore the screwball plot. hopefully one day we can all see the "producer's cut" and maybe get the chance to make (a bit) more sense out of all of this. till then, this will have to do...<br /><br />-ftm
