now don't get me wrong, i love seeing half naked chicks wiggling around. it's part of the fun of a moroccan restaurant: ogling the belly dancers. but it doesn't make much of a plot.<br /><br />my first major problem is the music. i have the feeling that when ann rice wrote "the vampire lestat", the cure was more the style of the music he would have liked (though i could be wrong). i know relating to current "goth" music might have seemed like a good idea, but they did a horrific job incorporating it. lestat was an actor with presumably a pretty good singing voice. that they chose jonathan davis to be his stage voice is heartbreaking.<br /><br />second, and someone else said it, mashing two very intricate books into one crappy movie is a bad idea. "lestat" could have been a movie in it's own right, and a damn good one if done right. i honestly don't think "queen of the damned" lends itself to a movie very well. though i would love to see a movie that incorporates a creation story, there's too much, how to word this, "inaction" in the book for it to be a very interesting movie. and the retelling they did soiled it pretty badly. now mind you, it's been a long time since i've read it, i always thought "lestat", "tale of the body thief" and "memnoch the devil" were much more action packed and would have made better movies.<br /><br />i know a lot of people (hey, myself included) who like a lot of cheesy vampire crap that thought this was absolutely the worst of the genre to be a major motion picture. i tend to agree with them there. aaliyah had a nice body though.
