"kicked in the head" is all about the corrigan character, a twenty something man on a quest to find himself, and his involvements with a handful of quirky characters. this thin and ambiguous story, which was written by corrigan, has a make-it-up-as-you-go feel and a screenplay which smells like an uninspired low budget indie. in spite of that and some annoying hindenburg scene interjections, the film has an off beat, quirky kind of charm which may appeal, in some small way, to people with a similar sense of humor. not for everyone, not for most, but maybe fun for some.
