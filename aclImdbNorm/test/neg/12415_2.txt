this movie was lacking in a lot of areas. it's about this elvis type guy who races cars and is approached by these bikers from satans angels. one of them is named banjo and they beat up college kids for fun. they want the elvis guy to be their "driver". at times, i wanted the folks from mstk3000 to be quiet because the movie was actually kind of good. sure, there was violence and a lot of cheesy lines, such as "what kind of beer do you want? a cold one". that was cheesy. the dude who plays banjo is a great boxer and i was glad to see him do a few fight scenes. also, the biker named fats had a nazi swastika on his jacket!!! that was pretty bold if i must say so myself.
