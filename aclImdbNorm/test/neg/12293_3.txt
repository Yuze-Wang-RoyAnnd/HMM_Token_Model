this was the first feature film for just about everyone involved, including director teck tan, so they deserve credit for pulling it off. but this film was awkward in its direction, preachy in its style, exaggerated in its acting, and overly politically correct. the plot was all over the place, preventing any aspect of it from developing well. gangsters get involved in the story, though i'm not sure what their presence added to the movie other than making the film even more unrealistic. they could have been completely left out and the film would have been better as a result.<br /><br />the plot is about a young ethnic chinese malaysian who returns to his home country after studying in the west. his studies have brought him back with the skills he thinks he needs to fulfill his dream of managing a rock band and taking them to the top of malaysian charts (a rather juvenile premise). the beginning of the film hints at conflict with his traditional father, but once the gangsters get involved this part of the story is dropped unceremoniously.<br /><br />the film tries to take advantage of malaysia's wondrously diverse ethnic mix, but unfortunately the manner in which these aspects were put to film either seemed terribly contrived or downright preachy. there is a pretty scene of malay women doing a beautiful traditional dance on a beach, but the way the vision is integrated into the plot seems forced and unnatural.<br /><br />the acting came off as somewhat amateurish, and the male lead was particularly unconvincing. the female malay lead was a notable exception leaving the most positive mark. the film also has an openly gay character, and though he is a bit of a caricature, he provides some of the funnier moments in the film. but the movie was just barely a notch above a typical local television soap drama. sadly, this film, which is not in the least offensive, has been banned in malaysia. 3/10
