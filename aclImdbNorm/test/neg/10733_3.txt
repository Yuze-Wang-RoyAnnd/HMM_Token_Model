detective sergent vince de carlo (james luisi) and company are on the case of a vicious serial killer/rapist. can psychologist carol (susan sullivan) help, or will she become the killer's next victim? and what is with the killer's hilarious white dude afro? <br /><br />inspired by the case of serial killer ted bundy, "killer's delight" aka "the dark ride" is a rather dull serial killer tale from 1978 that doesn't offer much. if anything, it's more of a police procedural flick than a horror movie, as much of the violence occurs off camera. sure, we get mutilated bodies, but we don't get a whole lot in the exploitation department-especially considering that they are from the aftermath, and not during the crime. those hoping for the likes of "the toolbox murders" or "maniac" will be very disappointed.<br /><br />fortunately, there is an impressive scene involving a woman trying to escape the killer that get's the tone right, and is quite suspenseful to boot. also, john karlen is quite effective as the killer, though his hilarious hairstyle (white guys with afros are always worth a chuckle) is more than a bit distracting.<br /><br />"the dark ride" is too routine and mediocre to really warrant a recommendation, as it lacks the proper exploitation elements, and is dated even by the standards of the time. those looking for a better example should probably turn to "don't go in the house" and a few others instead, as this just doesn't cut it.
