i don't know why this has gotten any decent reviews as it could be the weakest horror comedy i've ever seen. englund is just in it for a cameo and his performance is as unnecessary as most of the lame attempts at jokes (and scares). the direction is terrible and the acting is worse. it seems like every year producers are trying to make another evil dead but these weak unoriginal attempts are just stepping on the memory of a true horror classic.<br /><br />whether its filmmakers saying,"this isn't a remake but its an 80s throwback (which is just as unoriginal in my opinion - hatchet) or people trying to plug this with other horror classics, its still misleading and wont make up for the lack of scares, horror, comedy, or even a decent movie for that matter.<br /><br />avoid at all costs!!!
