i can't believe how bad this "film" is. for starters, the movie deals with the legend of big foot and a group of people having a close encounter with the creature. the premise is interesting and having lance henriksen in the cast (aliens)gave "the untold" a promising outlook. unfortunately that's as interesting as it gets. this looks like a direct to dvd release...or so i guess. this is basically a production-less affair with probably the worst editing (with a constant "fading to black" in between every scene!!!)i've seen in my life and acting that will sure make you cringe. why lance henriksen picked this is completely fathomless. and the movie takes cues from just about any other genre movie, from "blair witch project" (the video scene) and "predator", to "alive". this is supposedly based on true events, but the only truth to be found herein is just how bad this movie is. i'm usually not a harsh critic and believe me, i did try to enjoy this trash but eventually did not. do yourselves a favor and steer clear from this dvd. <br /><br />i'll try to put it mildly: this movie is pure garbage and it made me want to take my gun and shoot my neighbors... or ask blockbuster for a refund!!!<br /><br />and lance, shame on you! 1* out of 10*
