aghhhhhh! what a disappointment. a perfectly good hunk like antonio sabato jr and nothing but embarrassing drivel coming out of his mouth. i cringed at 95% of the dialog! it would have been better to have made the character a mute! how antonio sabato and michael pare could speak those lines without losing control of some bodily function is beyond me! if michale pare's character prefaced or ended just one more sentence with the word 'men' i think i would have thrown the iron through the tv set (i love to multitask - especially to get through bad movies). must have been a lean year for both of them to sign up for this movie. washing cars for a living would probably look pretty good to them by now. and the bad guy......if he was so bad why didn't he just shoot all those rich college kids instead of promising toilet breaks. even the title was a misnomer. a 'crash landing' means the plane actually crashes and doesn't just land without even a token fire or anyone being injured. instead of landing safely the plane should have crashed and burned just like the script.<br /><br />this movie is a stinker !
