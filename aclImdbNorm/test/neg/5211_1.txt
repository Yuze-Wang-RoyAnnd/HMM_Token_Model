how on earth were these guys given funds to make this movie? the lack of script is one thing, but the cinematography makes you want to weep. a hand held camera can be of great value to the look and feel of a movie but in that case you need a photographer who knows what he is doing. i am well aware that the actors are amateurs but it's of no defence since the director might be the least talented one ever directing in sweden. it would be a shame for the industry if he (or any in the team for that matter) is given money to make a film ever again. this movie simply provides fuel to the argument that too many movies are made in sweden each year.
