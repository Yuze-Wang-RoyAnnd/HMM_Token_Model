thought i just might get a few laughs from this long drawn out film, but was sadly disappointed. this film is all about losers who spend most of their time trying to get a passing grade with out even trying to open a book or accomplish anything. the film also portrayed teachers and the principal, mary tyler moore (mrs. stark),"labor pains",2000 as complete idiots. i know this was suppose to be a comedy, but it never made me laugh and i thought the entire film was a complete waste of time! however, all the actors gave excellent performances and had the hard task of trying to make this film an enjoyable and entertaining film! just plain studying and getting good grades for college is the only way to go!
