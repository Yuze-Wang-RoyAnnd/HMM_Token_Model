i classify this as the worst movie of all time.<br /><br />if there ever was a movie i would wish upon my enemies, this would be it. the plot is ridiculous, there are only 2 characters, and the coincidences between these characters just completely strain belief.<br /><br />these factors combined to make this an extremely boring movie.<br /><br />my wife and mother walked out on the movie about 15 minutes in. i figured that a movie this boring and slow *must* have some cool interesting plot twist, and a was quite disappointed when nothing exciting materialized.<br /><br />i briefly considered sending the filmmakers a bill for my 2 hours of lost life.
