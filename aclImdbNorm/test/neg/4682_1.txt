as i write this user-comment, tim burton's interpretation of the sweeney todd tale is making big money at the box office and the film even earned a couple of oscar nominations if i'm not mistaken. i haven't seen it yet, but i sincerely hope burton didn't look for inspiration and/or stylish trademarks in good old andy milligan's "bloodthirsty butchers". yes, even though the title distinctively mentions butchers, the main characters in the plot are a barber (the infamous sweeney todd) and a female baker. together they form a vile alliance where he kills the customers in his shop and she processes the bodies into her famous london meat pies. in other words, an andy milligan premise at his most typical, derivative, delirious and amateurish. i think the imdb rating for this film speaks for itself. although the actual story definitely isn't the worst i've ever seen, milligan somehow inexplicably attracts sheer ineptitude. the production is one gigantic mess, with an incoherent narrative structure, truly hideous photography, poor lighting, lousy acting and directing, laughable gore and zilch tension or atmosphere. more than half of the footage is pure padding and words fail to describe how boring the film is, even with a running time of a mere 80 minutes. ed wood, ted v. mikels and bruno mattei; you guys need not fear as none other than andy milligan is
