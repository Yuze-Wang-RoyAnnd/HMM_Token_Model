this is an emperor's new clothes situation. someone needs to say "that's not a funny and original, (etc., etc.) film; that is an inferior film. don't waste your money on it." the film is trashy, and the people in it are embarrassingly inferior trailer trash. they are all-too-realistically only themselves. they have no lines, they don't act. the american dream is not to create shoddy no-quality films or anything else shoddy and of no-quality; it is to achieve something of quality and, thereby, success. only people who are desperate to praise any film not made in hollywood (it can't have been made in hollywood, can it?) would try to impute any kind of quality to this film. it's worse than "ed woods," another film about a film-maker without standards. these films shouldn't have been made, and you shouldn't go see "american movie."
