set in the near future a dark stranger walks into some southern american city plagued by zombies. settling with a group of friendly face inhabitants our stranger learns the harsh realities of city life. there are two groups of people; the upper classes who dwell safely behind the concrete walls of the city being provided by, at the right price, the state police. then there are our friendly face inhabitants. these lower class folks live along side the zombies. there only means of survival is to trade goods, which they forage for during the day, with the police in exchange for tins of food. our stranger discovers why his world is plague by zombies. a new dietary pill that suppressed the craving for carbohydrates was the foundation. the human race's desire to shed fat caused the down fall of society as we know it. these pills increased the desire for protein i.e. meat, even the pet poodle. however, there was one more grave side affect, after death people became reanimated with an even stronger craving for protein namely human flesh.<br /><br />with what i feel is an imaginative introduction i felt that this film many realise some inventive material. what better way could explain the cause of the zombie race than by a contemporary idea of people's desire to make any sacrifice to change their body without the hard work of the gym? however, the imagination of this film soon stopped after this exposition. this film falls into the old trap of 'i can not imagine what the world will be like when society collapses'. when you watch this film you do not escape to a different world as you do when you watch planet of the apes (original), alien, mad max or texas chain saw (original). in this film the alternate society is define by people with hair dyed orange and green. face paint and charity shop leather jackets. there is no harshness about life in this alternate society, just healthy faces and over made-up zombies. films should allow you to escape not remind you that you need to clear out your wardrobe and take your old cloths to the charity shop.<br /><br />forget about some of the pitiful acting, or the over made-up zombies. this film fails because it is too polished, too congenial and too predictable. i have watch films like this since the early eighties. if you are going the make a film of this nature i suggest you need to watch again such films as dawn of the dead (original and remake), threads or fulci's zombie to see and experience that feeling of desperation in a devastate society.
