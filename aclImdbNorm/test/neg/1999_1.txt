this was on scifi this past weekend, and i had to check it out. after all... it was science fiction, with vampires and erika eleniak. what could go wrong with this b-movie?<br /><br />a lot.<br /><br />to start with: it can't even be classified as a "b-movie," because that would put it in the same league as roger corman... and this movie doesn't even meet his expectations. the most money they spent was on the contact lenses for the vampires.<br /><br />secondly: the casting was horrible. yes, casting udo kier as the captain of the demeter was a smart move... but the director clearly couldn't even get kier to memorize his lines. casting eleniak, in a vampire movie, is also a smart move because it means a bunch of horny guys are going to buy/rent/record this flick to watch her get seduced by a vampire. but, the director, writer and producer screwed that one, too. granted, they got some money out of the poor, unfortuate souls who enjoy watching vampire movies with hot women in them... but no one is going to remember this movie in another two or three years.<br /><br />thirdly: little things that just emphasize the laziness in this movie. for example, van helsing calls a cross a "crucifix," and, when mina is staked in the coffin, the viewer can clearly see the fact that her "chest" is nothing more than pillows.<br /><br />oh, and one other thing: why did they go for the george hamiltion-type dracula instead of something that would look decently scary? does george hamilton have an overwhelming hold on our future? why didn't everyone who saw dracula just laugh at him for his get-up?<br /><br />a waste of time. even with a tivo remote in your hand.
