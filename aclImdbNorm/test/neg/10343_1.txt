stealing is a crime, and these guys, kenny yakkel and corbin bernsen look like their going to get away with it. i haven't even seen this film, but not only do i know it sucks, but the fact that it steals the story of another film, or 2 films for that matter, is such bull crap (and if imdb would allow profanity much more than just bull crap) that i become filled with rage and feel as though i should just throw myself out the window and just end it all. o.k that's a little much but stealing is worse.<br /><br />ever seen pontypool? it was this awesome little zombie film made in 2008, this radio host goes into work, and then this zombie attack happens. we only see what's going on inside the radio station, and the only guess we have on what's happening on the outside are the occasional calls from their eye in the sky ken loney (easily the funniest moment in the film in my mind) and the bbc calling in for an update on the situation. from all the reviews i've read, and from the conversation i had with my friend (who has seen this film and pontypool) this film was exactly like it in the story, with minor tweaks here and there. so throw originality and creativity out the window. as for the zombies, or the infected, whatever you want to call them. they are the exact same thing, just because they got infected does not change the fact that they walk around mindlessly, and have a never ending quench for flesh. they are zombies. zombies!!<br /><br />zombies!!! okay one to many, but back to this crappy movie. the zombies from what i've heard are a lot like the ones in 28 days later, another better movie, with their insane rage and even more insane quench of flesh. this is where zombie movies define themselves, story does not matter in a zombie movie (as long as your not taking the idea of another film). sure a zombie movie can be enhanced by the story, as is the case with pontypool, but the zombies have to be, in a way, original. 28 days later started the insane raging zombie. pontypool i can't even begin to explain those guys without ruining the film. the evil dead, i think all i have to do is just type the name again because, come on it's the evil dead. romero is the master, and he went through all different types of zombies, from the painted face zombies in dawn of the dead to raging zombies in diary of the dead, and he did each one with his own unique style.<br /><br />so, after talking about other great zombie movies, i think it's about time i explain why i hate this movie without even seeing it. this movie down right steals the original story outline to pontypool which i think is called plagiarism and is illegal in this country and many people get kicked out of school for doing this very thing, yet in hollywood it's allowed, and apparently approved of. this is not the only film that takes the outline of another movie, and just tries to tell it differently. the 90's is like the worst period for movies ever, sure it had some gems but what decade doesn't, and it's because all the movies were the exact same. my favorite, the crime movie with a twist so big that you'll never guess it till the very end. they force feed you one suspect, make it seem impossible that it's not anybody else but him, then, bam, all this time it was this guy, you just had to look at the scenes where he wasn't there and then when he would mysteriously show up out of the blue, say "hey guys, what did i miss?" oh! didn't see that coming did ya! well, i'll leave a clich'e as my closing statement. this is one film you'll surely want to miss.
