awful, awful, awful show. "real world" issues dealt with blatant unoriginality. stereotypes galore. what the hell is going on with the african-american (black!) guys eyebrows? tyrone power! awful, awful, awful, awful, awful show. the fact that it lasted three seasons beggars belief. this show truly is swill for the brain dead accepters of mediocrity. <br /><br />saved by the bell almost seemed humorous compared to this. well, upon hindsight, no. it's of the same banal ilk and therefore equally devoid of intelligence. the only thing that it's missing so far is the jesus is god message. the mentality and deliverance is the same, yet somehow feels evil and soulless. you can almost hear the tv executives sprouting buzz words at each other. in fact i felt so incensed at this shows excremental existence, i felt compelled to comment. <br /><br />awful, awful, awful show.
