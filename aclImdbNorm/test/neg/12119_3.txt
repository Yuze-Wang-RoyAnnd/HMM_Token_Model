i loved so much last bellocchio's movie, the masterpiece "l'ora di religione". it had a great screenplay, great actors (well, have to say castellitto is so much greater than others), a brillant use of lights for a great cinematography.<br /><br />well, buongiorno notte is a different story. ridiculous screenplay erupting tons of morals (and we could speak weeks about politics, you know we are italians...). poor cinematography (it's too simple representing '70s dark years with dark colors and dark lights, do some efforts more peoples!!!!). bad use of music: what's the point of using psychedelia to represent the tragic rationality of brigate rosse?<br /><br />and to all the people who claimed the main prize in venice, i answer:"are you nuts????" maybe the russian film was bad but not as bad as this.<br /><br />i'm down with the p.e. don't believe the hype!!!!
