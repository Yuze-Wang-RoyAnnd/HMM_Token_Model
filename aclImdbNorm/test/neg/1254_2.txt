having just finished reading the book "one of a kind" a week ago, i was thinking "this would make a great movie, especially now, when people know a little about poker and poker players". i was totally shocked to find it while browsing at the video store last night. i had no idea someone had actually turned this into a film. i grabbed it immediately and watched with much anticipation. what a major letdown!<br /><br />all of the intriguing things about stu ungar were skimmed over quickly, and instead i was left with a biopic that could have been about anybody. ungar may have been a burnt-out jerk, but he was also a brilliant thinker that could read people instinctively. that is what made him so fascinating. why not focus on that?<br /><br />and talk about watering down the real truth. this guy was excessive about absolutely everything: drugs, women, gambling, starvation, sleep-deprivation. he gambled on sporting events from dusk to dawn, he would go missing for days while hanging out in crack dens, his body was perpetually emaciated, and yet, if he ever needed money, he could always beat just about anyone at will playing cards. now that's a story!<br /><br />too much time spent on his childhood and personal relationships (although his ties with "vincent" and his daughter were hardly touched on) and hardly anything about his drugs use (which was exorbitant), his insane gambling and his incredible card-playing abilities.<br /><br />probably too late now, but i hope someone remakes this film properly. i had no problem with imperioli. he is excellent. the script just left him with nothing interesting to say.
