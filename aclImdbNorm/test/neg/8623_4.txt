george sluizer's remake of his own - superior - film is a complete waste of time. why was it even attempted? kiefer sutherland plays jeff harriman, whose girlfriend (sandra bullock, who only has a small amount of screen time)is abducted at a service station by barney cousins (jeff bridges). now, barney is portrayed as the kind of guy that no one would trust in a month of sundays - he lopes about like frankenstein's monster but without the sympathy, and bridges' acting is totally awful. sutherland comes across a little better when his character turns detective with the help of new love interest rita baker (nancy travis).<br /><br />a major problem with this version of 'the vanishing' is its obvious need to cater to hollywood audiences by avoiding the bleak ending of the original film. here the ending is happy which seems forced and unbelievable, and completely wrecks the story. however by this time the damage has been done as jeff bridges turns the bad guy into a huge laugh.
