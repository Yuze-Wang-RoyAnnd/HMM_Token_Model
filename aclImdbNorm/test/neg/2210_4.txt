this movie is total dumbness incarnate. yet, i've seen this movie several times already and plan to watch several more times because, despite its sheer dumbness, it's very entertaining. and it has one of my favorite hokey-movie actors, casper van dien, who is here in his full hokey-movie glory. here, casper van dien is fully casper van dien, and ya gotta love him for it. if he hadn't been in this movie, it would have been totally unwatchable dreck, or at least far dreckier than it already is.<br /><br />the (cough cough) "science" used here makes absolutely no sense at all. no one else in the world noticed that big asteroid approaching the earth besides that small group? not even with thousands and thousands and thousands of professional and amateur astronomers constantly searching the skies for just such a thing? an asteroid that big would have made itself completely obvious to anyone who has a pair of eyes even vaguely capable of sight. and a chunk of the asteroid bounced off the atmosphere and no one even noticed it? a rock that big hitting the atmosphere would have caused enormous shockwaves that would have in turned caused an enormous amount of damage to the planet's surface. surely, someone would have noticed such a thing. bwahahaha! the "science" used in this movie is so completely ridiculous, that, somehow it works for making this movie as entertaining as it is.<br /><br />one thing i noticed is that despite the uber heat, all the characters weren't dripping with sweat and their clothes completely soaked with it. at the most, the characters looked like they had been lightly spritzed on occasion by someone off-camera with a water bottle to give a "sweat sheen". authenticity was *not* a goal that this movie assiduously and constantly strived for. which, in a weird and hilarious sort of way, gives this movie its entertainment charm.<br /><br />is this movie actually worth watching? definitely! assuming, of course, you have absolutely *no* expectations of anything that even remotely approaches reality. and, it's your desire to wallow and luxuriate in total hokeyness at the moment.
