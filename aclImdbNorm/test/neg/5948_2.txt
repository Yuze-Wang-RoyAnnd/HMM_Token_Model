in fact, everyone responsible for this dreck ought to be whipped, dragged, and hung! if this is what great eugene o'niell drama is like i never want to be victim to viewing it ever again. there are so many things wrong w/ this feature where does one begin? first, elmer bernstein's bombastic score is present thru out the entire film even in the quiet scenes where background music subtracts from the character's motivations. second, these characters are not pleasant people and while some reviewers might enjoy that i personally disliked every scene in which ives ate up the scenery, but that was the way his characters was written: to be disliked. w/ loren it just never is made clear whether she's good or bad
