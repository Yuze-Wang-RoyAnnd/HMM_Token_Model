maybe it's because i read peter straub's wonderful book before seeing the film, but i was terribly disappointed by this movie. in my opinion, the filmmakers removed everything that made the story interesting and unique, and replaced it with more common hollywood-style elements.<br /><br />it's too bad, too, since this movie has a terrific cast, particularly fred astaire, douglas fairbanks, jr., melvyn douglas, john houseman, and the then-largely-unknown alice krige. they're just not given very much worthwhile to do.<br /><br />in fact, i was all for leaving halfway through, but a friend convinced me to stay to the end, as he was sure it had to get better. he apologised to me during the closing credits.
