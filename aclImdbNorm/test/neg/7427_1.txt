perhaps the worst of the "nemesis" films (and that says a lot!), this mess features so many flashbacks to part 2 that you might as well say that you've seen them both, even if you've only endured this entry. making matters worse are two wisecracking cyborgs who have absolutely no entertainment value. in other words, they are a perfect fit for this endlessly boring cinematic mistake.
