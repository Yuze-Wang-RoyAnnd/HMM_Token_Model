if you want to see someone accidentally eat another man's testicle, or look at a row of pathetically fake hard-ons at a wedding, or listen to a man talk about how good it felt to have sex with a girl while she was throwing up, then this is the movie for you. alternating, in neck breaking fashion, between romantic and gross out comedy, tomcats is certainly interesting. the lovely jaime pressly plays the wife of horatio sanz(tell me another one) who is found in many silhouetted situations with other women, but there is, surprisingly, no nudity. jake busey is thoroughly revolting as a hound dog who you wouldn't want as your friend. shannon elizabeth and jerry o'connell are both good and make a convincing couple, but the movie is far too busy trying to disgust to be any good.
