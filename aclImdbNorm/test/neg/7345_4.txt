the story is shortly about the faith-lacking business man priest, daniel clemens (christian slater), who is looking closer on a case where another priest is suspected for murder. the priest denies he's guilty but at the same time he is not able to discuss the matter due to confidentiality. enter daniel clemens who starts playing cop...<br /><br />while the plot isn't ridiculous, everything else is. let's start with the visual side, the cinematography is dull, it looks more like a tv-series than a movie. the camera angles are boring, in fact, there's not a single memorable camera angle in the entire movie. there's no interesting closeups revealing details. and the scene transitions, well, there's not much to say about those, they aren't smooth at all, there seems to be no connection between the scenes than the actual plot. okay, they did use a transition with music in between two scenes, but there are no interesting visual transitions in the entire movie, the times dissolve was used there was no visual connection between the scenes.<br /><br />the boring visual part could be forgiven if the film would offer anything else. unfortunately the film only offers forced wooden acting and clumsy dialogue with no punch. on top of that the film suffers from audio problems, the sound volume is lowered several times in the movie as if the microphones would be too far.<br /><br />i didn't predict the solution of the film. it could be because the film never gave me the opportunity or it could be due to the presentation, which was so boring i never even tried to figure it out.<br /><br />put two plus two together and it equals a b-movie where 'b' stands for boring.
