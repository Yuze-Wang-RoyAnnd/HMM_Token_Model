bob clampett's 'the hep cat' is a distinctly average cartoon only really notable for the fact that it was the first colour looney tune (previously looney tunes were all black and white while merrie melodies were in colour). the tale of a singing, dancing cat's attempts to woo a lady cat and a dog's attempts to catch the cat, 'the hep cat' lacks the trademark energy and pace of most clampett shorts. to be fair, clampett doesn't have a great deal to work with. warren foster's script is embarrassingly thin and, while he has spun straw into gold with other cartoons, clampett doesn't manage it with 'the hep cat'. it's often said of clampett that you can't mistake his cartoons for anyone else's and it's generally true but 'the hep cat' is an exception. there's flashes of clampett genius, such as the chase scene in which the cat stops to ask the dog "hey, are you following me". when the dog confirms that he is, the cat simply says "oh" and the chase immediately resumes. unfortunately, there's very little of such brilliance on show here. knowing who directed it, 'the hep cat' is a bitter disappointment. we all have off days and this was clearly one of clampett's!
