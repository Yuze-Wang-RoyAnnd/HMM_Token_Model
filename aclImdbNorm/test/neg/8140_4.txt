it is a story as old as man. the jealousy for another man's wife and possessions. there are even commandments against it.<br /><br />in this story, raymond burr ("perry mason", "ironside") is the manager of a runner plantation who lusts after the owners wife and feels that he isn't treated with respect. the wife, the starlet barbara payton, who was trying to make a comeback after a string of sordid affairs, was lusting after burr, who killed her husband, paul cavanagh.<br /><br />but, lurking about was a strange woman, the housekeeper (gisela werbisek) who sees everything, and who was capable of some voodoo to avenge the wronged, which also included another young woman (carol varga) to whom burr also professed love.<br /><br />burr is poisoned and becomes , or thinks he becomes, a gorilla. payton will have to mate with kong if she ever wants her marriage consummated, as he goes into the jungle every night.<br /><br />the end is predictable. but, the stirring question of this film is why payton would ever be afraid. with those sharply pointed missiles jutting out from her chest, no animal could get near her to do harm.
