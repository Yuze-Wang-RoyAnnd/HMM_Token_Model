i enjoy watching robert forster. that was the main reason that i rented this movie. i also wanted to see a story take place out in the middle of nowhere where the characters could work off of each other really well with no distractions. <br /><br />unfortunitaly i found the movie to be dull. i couldn't get interested in the characters. i couldn't get interested in the story which seemed to meander nowhere. <br /><br />after watching this movie for an hour i turned it off. i will rate the movie 4 out of 10. this falls well below the mandatory 7 rating that makes a movie worthwhile to watch.
