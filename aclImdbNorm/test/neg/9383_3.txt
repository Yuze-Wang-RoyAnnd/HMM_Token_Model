when jan svankmajer lets his imagination run wild, get ready. you're in for dark, harrowing films like "alice" and "little otik," or short gems such as "down to the cellar" and "jabberwocky." all of those are excellent films that represent disturbing, surrealistic film-making at its best.<br /><br />on the other hand, when svankmajer attempts to make a political statement of any kind, you're advised to leave the room in a hurry. svankmajer's films in this vein tend to be both adolescent and preachy, presenting straw-man caricatures in repetitious fashion to express his pseudo-brilliant insights.<br /><br />"lunacy," unfortunately, is very much this latter type of movie. cartoonish ideas and characters are stretched paper-thin for an appalling two hours. there are a few moments that briefly hold interest, but these few oases are separated by vast deserts of boredom.<br /><br />if you found svankmajer's dreadful, monotonous short film "et cetera" brilliant and hilarious, you'll probably love "lunacy." if you've never seen a svankmajer film before, please start elsewhere.
