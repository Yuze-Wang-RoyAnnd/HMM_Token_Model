"flashdance" meets "meatballs iii" or maybe it should just be called "meatballs iv". this is my friend wesley's all-time favorite movie, largely because he still has a thing about j.v. cheerleaders. as someone once said: "this is fine-more than fine-but as you get older you need to branch out. whether you want to or not, society demands it".<br /><br />"gimme an f" has cinema's greatest j.v. cheerleader mary ann (played by beth miller), who looks like a sweet-faced alicia silverstone from before her "clueless" days. wesley hates miller's other film, the horrific "teen wolf too" made three years later, where she plays a fickle southern belle much like martha smith's character in "animal house". personally i admire miller's range as the two characters could not be more different and she is convincing as both.<br /><br />anyway, mary ann is a na"ive novice cheerleader from moline (a member of "the lucky ducks" squad) who comes to camp beaverview for cheerleading instruction. she's befriended by jenna (karen lee kelly), the leader of the tough girl squad-appropriately named "the demons". jenna becomes protective of mary ann after her main rival takes an instant dislike to mary ann.<br /><br />later mary ann gets a crush on tommy hamilton, the head instructor. tommy is spending his summer wrestling with the dilemma of having to grow up and move on, which is a problem as his only skills are teaching cheerleading and performing elaborate dance routines in the shower, for the enjoyment of viewers who get off on that sort of thing. phoebe (daphne ashbrook) is tommy's long-suffering girlfriend, she has a well-adjusted attitude and an experienced perspective. she even tolerates tommy's flirtation with mary ann-trusting that tommy will not actually take advantage of young mary ann.<br /><br />while these four characters are solid and their relationships have a nice charm, the supporting cast is almost as weak as the material they have to work with. which is a shame because had they brought some actual comic relief to the production it would have been a decent film. jennifer cooke plays pam, a social climbing and terminally peppy instructor who is carrying on with camp's money-hungry owner bucky. and there is another couple with a thing for the characters from "mad max". since nothing is very funny you are left with only a cute semi-romance and some great dance routines.<br /><br />an attempt is made to create some suspense by slowly leading up a final competition but unless this is your first movie experience the outcome is never in doubt. and there is a back-story about some japanese businessmen bucky wants to get money from, but it goes nowhere dramatically or comically.<br /><br />then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.
