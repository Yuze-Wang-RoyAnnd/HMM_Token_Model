this love story between an american journalist and an eurasian lady doctor does not contain much conflict, since she is largely westernized (having studied in london), nor any fireworks, since she behaves rather restrained. what little interest the story manages to raise is knocked down further by their wooden dialogs. they are supposed to be two cosmopolitan intellectuals, but talk as if the words are put in their mouths by a hollywood hack who is not much of one himself. the movie also suffers from an amazing lack of realism - a completely deserted beach in crowded little hongkong, overrun by a million chinese refugees? and a presumably accomplished american journalist in his 40s who doesn't know what a hysterectomy is? hollywood ideas. finally "the song". after hearing it an estimated twenty times throughout the movie, starting right with the credits, it tends to loose some of its emotional impact, sorry to say.
