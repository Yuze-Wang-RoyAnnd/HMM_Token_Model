when, oh when, will hollyweird write a decent movie based around computers? i cannot believe people actually consider this movie to be a credible story.<br /><br />no computer operating system could ever survive wit that sort of annoying scrolling interface. it may look good on a movie screen but if you actually tried using it for any length of time you would go nuts.<br /><br />as for "tracing" people the way she did it simply cannot be done that way. network security alone would prevent that from happening. the key stroke logging was laughable to say the least.<br /><br />regarding the software that was supposedly being installed, no system administrator would allow such a critical piece of software to be installed on a production system until it has been tested, retested and tested again on a sandbagged system.<br /><br />but probably the worst possible part of the movie was the "virus". there is no way that a virus that works on one operating system will work on any other system. and as for a virus that could take out a mainframe is a couple of seconds, that just beggars belief. there is no way that an open remote connection would have the required superuser access that would allow deletion of system files.<br /><br />i could go on but i can't be bothered.<br /><br />a porno has a better thought out plot that this pile of garbage.
