my guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts, and thus at least a quarter longer, because otherwise how can one explain its confused, abbreviated storyline. i was never completely lost, but i was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation. the movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot.<br /><br />if it were longer, it might make more sense, but it still wouldn't be much good. the movie's most interesting idea is of the war between zeus and hera as being a war between the male and female, but the movie drops the ball on this, making hera's followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what zeus' followers do or believe. the movie is also interesting because you don't see the gods and there's no real certainty that they exist. so it's got a couple of intriguing ideas, but it doesn't do anything useful with them.<br /><br />bad dialog, cardboard characters, and one interesting scene involving hercules and his three antagonistic sons. not unwatchable but also not worth watching.
