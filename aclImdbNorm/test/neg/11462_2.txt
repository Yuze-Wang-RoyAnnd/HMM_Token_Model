is it really possible that so many people in this film believe that the girl is a witch? just because she has dark hair and wears dark make up she is supposed to be a witch? and i got the impression that the film tries to present her as someone who is "different", someone nobody understands... she is just a teenager and some dumb girl in her high school says she is a witch and everyone believes her. besides, brandi is either portrayed very badly or the character itself is made to be so... fake. she didn't convince me that she is not a witch, not that i would believe it in the first place. everyone accuses her of being a witch and she acts like she is not entirely sure whether she is a witch or not. and the way they dressed her for the court - i see old ladies every day who wouldn't wear that even if it was the last outfit in the world! brandi's brother also wasn't very convincing... but, you see, the important thing is, that "she put that bad, bad girl back on to the ground at the end of the film". "she has won the battle, proved to everyone she is different".<br /><br />this is probably one of the worst films i've watched in may life, way too shallow. i only watched it because there was nothing else on the tv at the moment, so i was condemned to this trash. please, do not waste your time watching this film. when i saw the 7-star rating, i nearly fainted... it doesn't deserve it, compared to some other films which are also rated with 7 stars.
