20 years ago dr chopper(yes, he is driving a chopper as well as chopping people up) disappeared when the police found dead bodies at his clinic. since then people have been disappearing around lake tanoka(or something) and dead bodies/parts of bodies has been found all over the place. turns out dr chopper needs body parts to stay alive and has been taking them from strangers, like pair of lesbians and 5 sorority girls on their initiation(you get the picture) traveling through lake tanoka. when a bunch of teenagers decide to go camping they are bound to clash with the doctor.....<br /><br />well, if you wanna waste some time this is the right choice. acting varies from really bad to mediocre with the girls tripping and falling all the time for no apparent reason. every chance of showing skin is taken but without actually showing anything at all. the same goes for the special effects who are pretty pathetic with every slash filmed in an angle so you cant see it but there are a lot of body parts in the movie all drenched in blood(probably to cover up how sad they really look ). the plot is pretty faulty and dialog rather sad. only time i laughed was when dr chopper said: "howdy!" when trying to be scary. don't watch this one if your not a hack'n'slash freak. even then i would recommend you to watch something better.
