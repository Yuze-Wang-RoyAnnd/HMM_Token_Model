this puddle of derivative drivel stole from every soviet film of note and failed miserably. i was left with an experience of everything that is wrong with organized religion in general and the russian orthodox church's particular shortcomings (mind you this comment comes from a person of faith). even the outstanding cinematography left me uninspired. i spent its most beautiful moments very aware of the masterworks that it was poorly imitating. i would not recommend seeing this movie unless you have a deep passion for the russian orthodox church, its monastic traditions, miracles in the face of communism, and saints of the seventies. it is a meaningless film from (and about) a narrow perspective that did absolutely nothing for me.
