firstly, the title has no relevance whatsoever to the movie. it started off fine with good development but got annoying when he couldn't tell his girlfriend what had happened to him. even his attempt to tell the police failed, which just added to the annoyance value. there were too many pregnant pauses in the movie that seemed more like filler than anything worthwhile. the plot never revealed who did this crime to him although a good plot would have allowed disclosure. the ending was nothing short of "hey we've run out of budget let's stop it here now!!"...if i'd written a novel that ended this way i'd top myself. trash trash trash!!
