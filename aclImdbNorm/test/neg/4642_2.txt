okay, granted, i am a fan of low-budget horror, which along with it, does come the occasional piece of garbage that even the most diehard fan of campy flicks can not bare to stand witness to...trancers 6, directed by demonicus's jay woelfel.<br /><br />first of all, the trancers series, started back in the mid-80s by charlie band and his empire pictures, is basically the franchise that it is because of tim thomerson and his excellent portrayal of trancer hunter jack deth. well, low and behold, due to the sinking budgets of full moon features (which, despite what people have said, have actually brought along very high quality features, such as hell asylum and dead & rotting), thomerson did not return for the sixth installment.<br /><br />full moon writer courtney joyner returns once again and delivers another below-average screenplay, which features jack deth (played by thomerson...in flashbacks, which are extremely poorly inserted...he has a different hair style like every time he is shown, and some `shemp' laying on a table) going down the line into his daughter's body. well, from here on out, you have "jo deth" acting like jack...but its a shame that she really doesn't give off the same screen presence as jack deth did.<br /><br />the film, shot on 16mm, is, simply put, an embarrassment to the trancers name...no offense to anyone at young wolf productions. i mean, i respect you guys for actually wanting to jump forth and do a trancers film without tim, but with a little more time (despite it being filmed since december of 2001), it could have been better.<br /><br />however, check out full moon's dvd of it, which is a double feature with the original trancers, and features trailers for the last 10 plus full moon features.<br /><br />overall, i would probably have liked the feature more if it wouldn't have the trancers name, but like anything, you can judge it by someone's opinion and you must check it out for yourself!
