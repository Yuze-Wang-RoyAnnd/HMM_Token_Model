while mind of mencia could be summed up as nothing more than a clone of chappelle's show, it is really worse than that. first of all, carlos mencia is a jacka** that is as funny as he is original, which isn't saying much. the show contains lame spoofs of american television ads and political issues, and mencia's "comedic" insight on politics adds to the low quality of this show. on top of it all, mencia tosses in more lame ethnic jokes and stolen jeff foxworthy lines than i can count on one hand. while every once in a while carlos gets a cheap laugh, the rest of the time he spends insulting everyone in sight, which does include exploiting his own audience members. with the exception of south park, drawn together, and friday night stand-up, this show marks the end of the chappelle's show glory days, which for those of you who haven't heard, was before he went to africa.
