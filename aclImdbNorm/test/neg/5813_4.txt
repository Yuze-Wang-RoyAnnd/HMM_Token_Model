i adore hedy lamarr. i think she was vastly underrated as an actress during the 40s. she was the nastassja kinski of that era, and critics didn't take her seriously. having said all that...this film is a bore. when i watched it for the first time, i was shocked at the lack of continuity, not only in story, but in makeup and costumes. hedy's makeup changes from shot to shot. so does hair length and style. reason: this thing had so many writers and underwent so many stops and starts it's amazing they ever released it at all. her "lady of the tropics" began filming after this one began, yet it was released before "i take this woman." in fact, at the time, it was known in hollywood as "i re-take this woman." that should tell you something. i'm a spencer tracy fan as well, but he is awful here. i've read in various film histories that he absolutely despised hedy lamarr, and that looks perfectly obvious on film. no chemisty whatsoever. the story wanders around for reel after reel and finally just rolls to an end very strangely. i can't recommend this one at all.
