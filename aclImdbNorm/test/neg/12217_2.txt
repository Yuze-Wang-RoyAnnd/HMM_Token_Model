asmali konak has arguably become one of the best tv series to come out of turkey. with its unique cinematography and visual approach to filming, the series has gained a wide following base with rating records continuously broken. personally i do not agree with singers becoming actors (hence, ozcan deniz - the lead actor) but i guess the figures speak for themselves.<br /><br />in relation to the movie, it was disgusting to see how much someone can destroy such a plotline. years in the making, this movie was able to oversee every descent story that existed within the series. not only that, the cultural mistakes were unacceptable, with an idiotic scene involving the family members dancing (greek style) and breaking plates, which does not exists anywhere within the turkish culture.<br /><br />some argue the movie should be taken as a stand alone movie not as a continuation of the tv series but this theory has one major fall, the way the movie was marketed was that it will be picking up where the series left off and will conclude the series once and for all. so with that note in mind, me and everyone i know, would have asked for a refund and accepted to stand outside the theatre to warn other victims.
