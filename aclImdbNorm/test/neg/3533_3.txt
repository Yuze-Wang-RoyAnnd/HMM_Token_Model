a scientific experiment designed to create a superhuman being has gone wrong.the creators become trapped in a remote desert outpost,pursued relentlessly and mercilessly by their own creation.james stockton,the scientist whose research was used despite his protests to create the monster,is called the outpost to help undo the horror that now lurks somewhere within the dark halls.james,together with his son and daughter,soon find themselves trapped inside with the others,trying desperately to survive.and with the outpost sealed from within,there is no way out..."the outpost"/"mind ripper" is highly unoriginal.the sets are pretty claustrophobic and there's a bit of gore.however as a horror it fails miserably on almost all levels.there's zero suspense,the script is weak and filled with big holes and the ending is extremely predictable.so-called master wes craven produced this one-i wonder if he is happy with this trash.joe gayton directs without any style.the acting is horrible,only lance henriksen can act at all.ok,i'm a big horror fan and was bitterly disappointed.avoid it like the plague-it's just the same old boring crap again!
