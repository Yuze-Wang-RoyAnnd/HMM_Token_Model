this film may have been the first puppet master but this sure bored me to death when i saw this stupid movie,i wanted a refund. this was a bad series to the puppet master and i'm sure that i am not the only one that thinks this was terrible. to some it was great but, to others it was a ticket to snores-ville and boy are they right. the puppets didn't even do anything nor did they kill people. it should't be seen by people so i'm warning you not to see it. you will be disappointed even to the fans who love puppet master, it was a waste of their time and it didn't make so much money.nobody even got kill but one or two,very pointless.<br /><br />1/10
