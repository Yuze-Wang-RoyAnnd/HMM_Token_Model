this film is, far and wide and beyond any shadow of a doubt, the single worst and most contemptible film in the history of the universe.<br /><br />it really *is* that bad.<br /><br />personally i have always enjoyed the guilty pleasure of a terrible film, and rented this one thinking it would be one of those. to my immense disappointment, it was not.<br /><br />the script is delivered in a way that sounds as if they're reading the lines directly off placards, the story makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and the actual film looks like it was shot on a home video camera. i couldn't even finish watching it. it is even worse than "witch academy", and that's quite a feat in itself.<br /><br />i cannot even begin to fathom how a director could shoot this film, and then still have the sense to believe it was decent enough to release.<br /><br />painful, awful, horrendous.
