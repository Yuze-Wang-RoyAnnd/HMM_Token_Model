"tank girl" was, i suppose, meant to be the "buckaroo banzai" of the 90's and was marketed as such. the comparison is, admittedly, appropriate; both movies have so many things going on in any given frame of film that, as impossible as the story is to sort out, it certainly isn't boring.<br /><br />"tank girl" is a fun enough ride if you turn your brain off before the movie starts. otherwise you'll end up with a skull-cracking headache like me.
