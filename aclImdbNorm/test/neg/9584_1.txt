this is a crummy film, a pretender to a genre of surprise ending movies. and a genre that has been done so much better before. the plot limps along, with a predictable ending. (yawn) the characters are unlikeable, and some are so unlikeable they are almost unwatchable. matt dillon, a fine, intense actor is totally miscast here and is stiff and mannered. the others are forgettable. much of the dialog is sophomoric, again a pretender trying to be witty. i wouldn't hire the screenwriter to write my grocery list. yes, it's that bad, veering from misogynistic to just plain gross, as in beyond frat-house gross. with so much real talent out there, i'm really surprised this movie ever got made. it shows the total lack of imagination of the office suits...
