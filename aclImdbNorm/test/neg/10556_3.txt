as a fan of c.j.'s earlier movie, latter days, i really wanted to like this film.<br /><br />the nicest thing i can say, however, is that it's not an awful film. there are some good performances, and a few funny scenes. in particular, tori spelling has a couple of great scenes where she's talking to her fianc'e's ex-boyfriend.<br /><br />overall, though, it's pretty week. the script falls back on weird coincidences and clich'ed movie moments way too often. (the main character went to stanford on a golf scholarship, and his high school buddy doesn't even know that he plays the game?) <br /><br />most of the time, this movie had no idea where it was going or what it was trying to say. there are a lot of scenes that are mildly cute, but ultimately turn out to be a waste of time. and you could easily cut half the characters from the film without losing anything.<br /><br />still, for all it's faults, i would have to say that this is one of the better gay films of recent years. which says a lot about how bad most gay films are.<br /><br />i'm hoping c.j.'s next film will be better.
