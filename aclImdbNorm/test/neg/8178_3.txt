what you need in the run up to 'what you need', every episode since 'the lonely' had been a winner to some extent. this episode is the first major failure since 'escape clause'. the serling script is again based on someone else's materiel, a short story by lewis padgett. as with 'and when the sky was opened', serling altered the content significantly, removing a scientist and his machine and inserting an elderly peddler.<br /><br />'what you need' works best when it is being sweet. the opening half, in which the peddler provides customers in a bar with objects they will need in the near future, has a gentle charm about it that may have worn thin throughout an entire episode but works well in the time frame it is allotted. sadly, the main plot which it sets up is full of gaping holes. the minute steve cochran's performance as a two-bit thug becomes the main focus the episode falls apart. cochran's part is an underwritten stereotype and his flat performance highlights this flaw. his exploitation of the old peddler is dull and predictable and the revelation that he will murder the old man is totally unconvincing, making the whole slippery shoes scene seem completely false. ernest truex is good as the peddler, bringing a magical, mysterious but warm edge to the character, but he's not good enough to help the floundering script.<br /><br />to make matters worse, the weak script is also full of inconsistencies. for instance, we learn that the peddler's power to provide people with what they need stems from an ability to see into the future. so how exactly does this allow him to produce a pen that will magically pick winning horses. that seems like it should be a little outside his realms of power. also, for a man who can see the future, the peddler certainly acts surprised to find the thug waiting for him in his flat. there are many more holes that can be picked in 'what you need' but it's hardly worth it when the episode is so thin that you can see through it anyway.
