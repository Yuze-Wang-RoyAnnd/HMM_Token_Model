this is the most frightening film ever made in hollywood. it is a cautionary tale of how to take a european masterpiece and suck the life of of it until it is a dry husk like an insect carcass on the the windowsill. frightening because it reveals how the world of hollywood really works: ignorant money begetting dross. it makes me wonder how many great films could populate the corridors of my memory if the hollywood process had not leveled them to forgettable mediocrity. cry for the murdered children! see spoorloos or read the golden egg, if you dare, because they will come back to you forever in the idle moments of your life: when you're walking along the street and you see a 'missing' poster; in ordinary-looking parking lots; when you hear the tour de france on the radio; and, especially, when you you think "what's the harm?" in wearing a sock with a hole in it on a perfectly ordinary day.<br /><br />if only i could give this a zero.
