brass pictures (movies is not a fitting word for them) really are somewhat brassy. their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class tv commercials. but unfortunately brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours! in this they fail miserably, their undeniable, but rather soft and flabby than steamy, erotic qualities non withstanding.<br /><br />senso '45 is a remake of a film by luchino visconti with the same title and alida valli and farley granger in the lead. the original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around venice during the italian wars of independence. brass moved the action from the 19th into the 20th century, 1945 to be exact, so there are mussolini murals, men in black shirts, german uniforms or the tattered garb of the partisans. but it is just window dressing, the historic context is completely negligible.<br /><br />anna galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls for the amoral ss guy who always puts on too much lipstick. she is an attractive, versatile, well trained italian actress and clearly above the material. her wide range of facial expressions (signalling boredom, loathing, delight, fear, hate ... and ecstasy) are the best reason to watch this picture and worth two stars. she endures this basically trashy stuff with an astonishing amount of dignity. i wish some really good parts come along for her. she really deserves it.
