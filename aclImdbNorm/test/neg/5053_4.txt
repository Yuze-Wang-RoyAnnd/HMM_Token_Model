i made it about halfway through this movie, and at that point realized that i absolutely didn't care how it ended. it is basically a bland teen comedy that i only watched because i like helen mirren, who is in fact very good as an impossibly cruel teacher.<br /><br />the basic idea of the movie (or let's say the first half of the movie, since i don't know - or care - how the second half goes) has been done before, most notably in 9 to 5, and a comparison between the two shows how thoroughly tingle gets it wrong. you need to feel things are spiraling out of control in a way that makes you feel events are inevitable, and you need well-defined, interesting characters who you care about, and you don't have that. not the worst movie i've ever seen, but it never grabbed me for a second.
