here's example number 87,358 of hollywood's anti-biblical bias, so typical of them.<br /><br />early on, ray liotta's wife has did and women are being interviewed for the position of housekeeper. the first interviewee is an old-fashioned-looking (dress, mannerisms, speech) who immediately lays down here strict rules, stating that "there will be two hours of bible study ever day."<br /><br />this is said, of course, to make it sound like reading the bible is the worse punishment you could ever inflict on someone, especially a kid. once again, the bible is equated with stuffy, mean-spirited people. that woman, of course, is dismissed immediately.<br /><br />naturally, the liberal black woman (whoopi goldberg - who else?) is the one who is hired and, voil`a, saves the day! <br /><br />yawn.
