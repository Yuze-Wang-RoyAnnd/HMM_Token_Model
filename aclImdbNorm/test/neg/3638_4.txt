i've seen this programme a few times and the more a see of it, the less i like it. jamie lynn spears was approached to do this because of the fact that she is britney's sister and i'm sorry to say that that in the show is obvious. they've created the character zoey to be everything people want to believe jamie lynn is, clever, original, smart, pretty, popular etc. the characters around her are only there to make her look better, by being smarter then them, more popular than them, more wanted by boys then them. there is nothing original about this and it's poured with money, so every kid there has the coolest of fashions and stuff. i also have to say, for a 13 year old girl (or however old she is, can't be much older) she wears very mature clothing, those short skirts are too short, it makes young people want to wear them, and all that make-up, this adds to the rising problems of why young girls get into so much trouble. the only thing i will say is that the opening credits are sung by jamie lynn and, given her age, isn't bad at all, much better than her sister anyway when it comes to vocal ability. sorry, it's too mature and yet too dumbed down. it's poorly acted with predictable story lines and there is far too much stereotyping going on too.
