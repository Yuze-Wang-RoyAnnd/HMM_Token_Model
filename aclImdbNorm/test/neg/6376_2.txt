first of all, the title "daily" is a lie. <br /><br />every "daily show" program opens with an on-screen visual of the date it was made, followed by a pause and the opening announce. on the many days when they are re-running a daily show, they slip-cue the tape and omit the date and begin with the opening announce giving the false impression that the show is a new one. that's a lie. there is no mention of it being a rebroadcast. and that kind of crap is just a small indicator of how sneaky and deceptive this show is. <br /><br />furthermore, it's only on 4 nights a week. that's not quite "daily" - meaning monday through friday - another shortcoming but one i am grateful for.<br /><br />it's sad to think that many clueless young people use this fake news program as their main, often only, news source. this leaves them woefully ignorant and much worse - badly misinformed.<br /><br />although it leans liberal-left, politically, this show can be amusing at times. however, its veracity is low. facts and information are often cleverly twisted to fit the writers' agendas. it's often hard to tell where the facts leave off and the fiction and comedy writing begin. the result is pre-digested, reinterpreted information designed to persuade and influence. this is called "propaganda".<br /><br />the remote interviews are heavily kluged in editing.<br /><br />it really loses me when it bashes god and christians - which it does all too often. however, you'll never hear anything vaguely anti-semitic.<br /><br />if jon stewart and company attacked anyone but christians, it would be considered an offensive outrage. the names in the credits explain the source.
