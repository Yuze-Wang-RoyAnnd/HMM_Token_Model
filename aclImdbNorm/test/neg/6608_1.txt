brodzki's creation is a great example of how not to make a movie. first there was a book written with a great humor. book that has numerous fans who would be happy to supply help when producers for some reasons decided to employ people who hardly heard of the book in the first place. then came a script as humorless and full of nonsense as possible. at the same time the script was written in a way to allow only those who actually had read the books to understand anything of the plot. not that anything in this movie made much sense anyway(ex. "i'm like an ice shard. you can burn yourself" said yennefer as a word of warning - warning that logic is something this movie seriously lacks). to add to that we have to mention that no matter the amount of money that was supposedly spent on the movie everything looks like an amateur production with two (2) computer effects one of which is a see-through dragon. even the costumes look as if the were borrowed from a really poor theater. that is the better ones look this way. and to add to that we have a few 'naked scenes' put there only so they will be in the film because they have no explanation in what one may mercifully call plot. the movie has only one strength that can hardly make up for the rest - music is not bad. though if i was to choose i'd prefer to have it separately. it sounds better if you don't have to look at this failure of super production.
