******spoilers within******* what a dull, predictable, non-scary snore-fest. the movie had no character development: i felt no empathy towards any of the characters (except may be the small boy), and did not care what happened to any of them. the movie had so many clich'ed bits, or elements stolen from other horror movies.<br /><br />the movie was so predictable. many times i would be saying to myself, "let me guess, {fill in guess} happens next?" yup, i was right. even in the opening scene, i predicted that the "attack" on the family was by some man, probably the father (because only the wife and children were attacked). sure enough, that is what happened (of course, you have to wait 79 minutes to find out for sure). and, of course, another "evil man" scenario. why was he evil and killing his family? because he's a man, duh!<br /><br />as someone else stated, this movie may be scary for someone under 13 years of age, or for a movie from the 1970's, but it is far from being a 'scary' movie by todays standards. and, like so many other crap horror movies, a lot of the scares were "fakes". scary music, scary music, scary music, and.....a crow suddenly flies at the window! wow, scary!<br /><br />how did the old bank guy manage, a few times, to walk across an open lot without the father seeing him? i thought, for sure, that the old man was a ghost. nope, just a crappy movie.<br /><br />i rated this movie a 2 out of 10, because it did keep my attention enough to sit through the whole thing.
