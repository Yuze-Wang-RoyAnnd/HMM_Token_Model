this hbo original is pretty straightforward and pretty dumb. armand assante, once again doing a poor stallone imitation, is ray wellman a ex-con just out on parole. all he wants is his old girlfriend lacy, played by a young marcia gay harden, back. unfortunately for ray, lacy has hooked up with stalwart elliot, played by sam neill. further complicating matters is that ray's old cell buddies want some favors and they kidnap lacy to make sure they happen. ray and elliot team up, despite mutual dislike.<br /><br />what follows is violent and slow, but marcia gay harden shows us why she would win oscar in the future, she's not as polished here, but her raw emotion, sincerity and some rather explicit nude scenes almost make this worth watching. almost.<br /><br />rent "fever" (no the title doesn't fit the film) if your a fan of hers, otherwise skip it and be grateful it's stars went on to better things.<br /><br />note-this is a hard "r" flick for language, violence and nudity.
