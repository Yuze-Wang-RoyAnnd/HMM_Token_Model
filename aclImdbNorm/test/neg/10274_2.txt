we found this movie nearly impossible to watch. with such a super cast, it's a shame that the writing and direction were so awful. the excruciating pace at which the story was told was maddening. the flash-backs were clumsy. the characters were one-dimensional. the heavy-handed metaphors -- the river, the cat -- were repeated way too often. <br /><br />the movie nobody's fool, based on another novel by russo, was infinitely better, probably because it was more tightly written and directed. <br /><br />the photography in empire falls was lovely. too bad it wasn't a travelogue.<br /><br />i read the novel and enjoyed the writing style but had some quibbles with the novel itself. i would give the novel 4 out of 5 stars. perhaps the screenwriters and director were so awed by the novel's reputation they felt they had to include every darn thing in their movie. this was supposed to be a television movie, guys, not books on tape.
