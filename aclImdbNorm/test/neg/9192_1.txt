one of the worst movies ever made. let's start with the superficial: joaquin phoenix is, first of all, too fat to be a rookie fireman. the nyfd does not recruit pillsbury dough boys. john travolta has a bad dye job, and the strange gleam in his eye throughout the movie made me think that he was on some sort of extended scientology bender. the plot hits on all the tropes and clich'es of what the average joe believes life as a firefighter is really like: they all get drunk, get into fights, have a hard time expressing their emotions, their wives all stay at home crying, they all have father issues, everyone has a boston accent, et cetera. an execrable piece of schwarmerei that plays on our lingering cultural hero worship of firefighters after 9-11 -- which was, by the way, valid cultural hero worship. this film unfortunately presents no believable heroes to worship.
