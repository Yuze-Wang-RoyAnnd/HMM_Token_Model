sorry to disagree with you, but i found the dkc series to be quite engaging. so much so that i invested in the snes system and my own copies of the games. this is, mind you, almost ten years after the initial release of dkc 1. the graphics were ground-breaking for their time, the first vector graphics games for home systems. the music and characters are all memorable, and the games brought myself and my girlfriend dozens of hours of entertainment. true, the second game was better than the first, and the third was perhaps lacking the 'edge' of the second installment. but all three offered different play, and i enjoy them to this day. by the way, i'm old enough to remember when there were no video games whatsoever (and tvs were black and white!).
