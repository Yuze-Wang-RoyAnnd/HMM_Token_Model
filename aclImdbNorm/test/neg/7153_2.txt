this is a road movie. at least the movie is in yellow anf i think that suggests a road movie (?). i can't say much positive about the delivery. it's bad acting, certainly their english. camera looks like it is done by a kid, there's a bomb with counter, and suddenly a beetle is falling from the sky. since it was so cliche we actually laught the whole time -- and that was the most fun of the movie. this movie should be released in america, but i'm not sure you should go because that might suggest that is the quality we produce. the explosions look boring. basically everything is over the top. everything is just too much: the yellow quality, the sound, the babe, etc. find all the cliche part in other movies, put them together and you have the delivery.
