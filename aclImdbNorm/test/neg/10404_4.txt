this sickly sweet and laboriously paced 5-reeler is definitely not among harold lloyd's better films. gags are sparse and mostly uninspired. saccharine melodrama is abundant. the setup takes forever, as lloyd, the unconventional, but impossibly kindly, country doctor makes his rounds, bringing a little sunshine into the lives of children, the elderly, and puppies. it's like a 1922 version of patch adams. ugh. 4/10.
