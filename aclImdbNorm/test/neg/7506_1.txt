i live and work in lexington, kentucky, the town where zombie planet was filmed. i'd heard about the film forever ago, from various people who claimed to be a critical part of the production. then, for several years, i heard absolutely nothing. imagine my surprise when i found it sitting all by itself at the local video store, just itching for a rental. so, being the cinephile that i am, i decided to give these local filmmakers a shot.<br /><br />bad idea.<br /><br />zombie planet is overlong, boring, poorly acted, miserably shot -- and that's just the good stuff. i tried my hardest to enjoy it, which included removing my brain and setting it on the table so that it wouldn't get in the way of the horrible storyline. alas, nothing worked. zombie planet is so bad it's pathetic. and the very idea that they're planning a sequel leads me to believe that the director and his henchmen have listened to none of the criticisms i'm sure they've heard. move on, you guys. please. in fact, refrain from film-making altogether. or attend a few classes on pacing, storytelling, and, well, basic direction.<br /><br />otherwise, for the love of god, hang it up.
