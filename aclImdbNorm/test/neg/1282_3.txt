all grown up had a lot to live up to and there was much hype when this show was anounced. now it's easy to explain why it didn't live up to expectations: firstly, this show failed to create a realistic world of pre-teens in the way that rugrats captured the world and the imagination of toddlers. secondly, the show's character's are stereo-types (angelica: white spoilt blond as opposed to suzie: colored girl from modest family,...) or boring (tommy, chuckie) and annoying (dil). finally, there is not one ounce of innovation or an original plot-line. to sum up, all grown up is a waste of time and a bad idea for a sequel series to a show such as rugrats. it's boring, lacks imagination and it seems that the producers don't even know how 10 to 13 year olds behave. to be accurate, shouldn't angelica and suzie be comparing bra sizes rather than fight over who's better at doing chores?
