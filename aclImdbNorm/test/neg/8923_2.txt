i usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as i do watching the film, but with today you die, i feel that doing so would be a criminal waste of my time.<br /><br />so here is a five minute rant about how bad this film is.<br /><br />there was a time in the mid-80s when a single look from steven seagal was enough to crack your ribs; a full on scowl could knock you off your feet. if he actually got a hold of you, he would snap you like a twig.<br /><br />these days, although he is still capable of doing considerable damage, he no longer looks the part. he's gone to seed and just doesn't know when to call it quits. he walks like he's dumped in his pants yet somehow still manages to look constipated, and he has put on weight. his trademark long ponytail has gone, but his hair still looks stupid. how this man keeps on working in the movie industry is beyond me.<br /><br />today you die is the usual seagal mix of bone crunching fights, car crashes, gun battles and pyrotechnics. seagal mumbles his way through the dull script, delivering his lines with zero enthusiasm or believability. in this third-rate action flick, he plays harlan banks a thief trying to go straight, who is conned into partaking in a $20,000,000 robbery. he gets caught, goes to jail, escapes, and seeks revenge. yawn.<br /><br />there are some pretty good car chases and gun fights which intersperse the boring stuff (of which there is a lot), but reading other comments on imdb has revealed that these were actually borrowed from other better movies. seagal is also body-doubled an awful lot in this one.<br /><br />seagal turns in one of the most dreadful performances of his career
