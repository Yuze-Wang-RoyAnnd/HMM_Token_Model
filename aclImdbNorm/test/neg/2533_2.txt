weird with unnecessary singing and backdrops. randomly much of the action will occur on stage giving the feeling of an opera performance. none of that explains why this is such a bad film.<br /><br />it's the impression that either not enough rehearsal took place or that no experienced choreographer was available. the acting is flat. even the sparkling ziyi zhang looks like she's just waiting for her next movement or line. you may notice the trivia on this site stating that she spent half a month in japan learning to sign and dance. read that again as 2 weeks and things begin to make sense. even worse are the little kids who seem to be looking at their parents at the back of the studio rather than at the camera.<br /><br />the cheap and cheerful sfx are just cheap and cheap. the editing is staccato chops peppered with slices of just nothing that adds to anything except annoyance. just imagine all the silly dance scenes from the recent zatoichi - particularly the closing routine - performed by your local high school drama club with one famous actress who speaks in another language (but you get her in simply because she's so good normally despite being unsuitable), recorded on a cheap camera and then edited into three times its length in no artful order.
