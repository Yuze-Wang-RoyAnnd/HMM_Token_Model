"the quickie" tells of a decadent russian mob family who lives in malibu and...well, frankly, this awful attempt at drama isn't worthy of commentary.<br /><br />jason leigh introduces herself to mr. mob-guy as being from "pacific exterminators" with huge letters in plain sight on her back which say "west coast exterminators". eventually the mob-guys get suspicious because she was exterminating in a bedroom. (duh).<br /><br />in another scene mr. mobguy plays russian roulette giving a hooker $4000 to bet whether he'll live or die. she has 5 chances out of 6 of keeping the money if she bets "live". well, she bets "die". (double duh) later she complains it wasn't fair and wants to play again. (triple duh).<br /><br />the list of flaws just goes on and on while this intelligence insulting film stinks and sinks in a quagmire of lousy music, mediocre camera work, poor direction, boring story, etc. pass on this loser. (d)<br /><br />note - the barebones dvd which i rented had no english same language subtitles or closed captions.
