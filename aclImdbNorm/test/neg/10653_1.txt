not to be confused with michael ritchie's nasty 1975 beauty pageant spoof, this "smile" is a down-turned example of those good intentions paving the road to hell.<br /><br />the film parallels two stories: an impoverished chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to raise a facially-deformed orphan named ling (yi ding), and a tv-spawned malibu family act out "gidget get birth control." katie (mika booram, the third olsen twin) plays a spoiled, self-absorbed high schooler distanced from reality. her teacher (sean astin) paves the way for a school trip to china aimed at showing students how to work with deformed children.<br /><br />the film uses deformity as a means of suspense by treating ling like the frankenstein monster. kramer continually masks her deformity through hats, hoods and camera placement. this approach exploits the freak show quality inherent in the material. she may be uncomfortable with the way society views her and kramer's answer is to cover her up until the big reveal. why disturb your audience with such unpleasantness? we see her face briefly at the end and only minutes before closing-credit snapshots of her after surgery disclose a swan beneath the harelip. it is not good enough to give the girl a reason to live; what is imperative is ling being equally as hot and popular as katie.<br /><br />funding for the film came from a trust established by the late roy rogers and dale evans. they envisioned a heritage of quality family films. give me "son of paleface" any day.
