to judge a movie just for the landscapes,decor,costumes....it is just not right , you are missing the core : the story<br /><br />a movie has to narrate something , to tell a story something that impress you . yes , i was pleased by the sea , cliffs , clear water and all that but ... there is the plot ?<br /><br />they are more interesting movies with mad people , such as : flight over the cuckoo"s nest...etc...etc. this one is about a crazy woman who is more attached to dogs than his children or his husband. just a clear psychiatric case !!!! nothing extraordinary.unfortunately a waste of time . and there is all that rage coming from ? fish smell ? sea ?
