i never read the book. now i don't really want to. i had no clue what this movie was about when i walked into the theatre. i still don't really know what point it was supposed to get across, but i do know that a good two hours was wasted from my life. two precious hours i can never get back.<br /><br />the storyline was so predictable, it's laughable. werewolves...or something...a very romeo and juliet type plot. i predicted the endig within five minutes into the movie. and i was correct.<br /><br />the acting isn't horrible. the only two cool characters in the movie were the british cousin guy and the rambo-graphic-novel duder. the other characters are too...the dialogue is very bland and predictable.<br /><br />the absolute worst part of the movie is the transformations between the "humans" and the "wolves." if you wanted something kick-ass like van helsings, you're gonna be really upset. imagine ballerina's, a bright light, then a wolf. yep...that's about it.<br /><br />just avoid this movie. period. especially if you've read the book, because you'll just wanna punch babies.
