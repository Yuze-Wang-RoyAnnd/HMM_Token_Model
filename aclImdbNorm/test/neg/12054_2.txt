well, what can i say. what the f**k? there really isn't much to say about this, really. the only way you would like this is if u, like me, like bad bad horror to laugh at.<br /><br />acting- very unconvincing! just watch the last scene with the main actresses running! rip-off of texas chainsaw massacre! but in a bad way! just awful!<br /><br />gore- really not believable. in one scene they use one of those knives which have a chunk cut out of them which fit over a body part etc. by using this,with the addition of red ketchup, its supposed 2 look real, although it really doesn't.<br /><br />plot- predictable 'kids get lost in woods on camping weekend' movie ripped off from friday the 13th.<br /><br />killer quality- scary mask if you're scared of clowns, kinda unbelievable that someone would chose this as their costume however. the director obviously realised all the good costumes had been used in all the other horror-camp movies out there.<br /><br />total- 3/10 */***** p.s- stay away from camp blood ii, that one made this look like lord of the rings.
