imagine this: a high school. except it's boarding school, and the kids don't have parents around. oh, and it's in malibu. and the kids are all thin, white, and gorgeous, with the exceptional token minority or fat kid to play the "weird" outcast. and there aren't any reasonable rules, like how they have co-habitation, nuclear weapons in their dorms, coffee stands, a sushi bar, and a complimentary laptop per student.<br /><br />here's the story: a girl, zoey brooks, attends pca, a formerly all-boys school. absolutely perfect in every possible way, she is smart, pretty, thin, athletic, creative, and everything a perfectionist wants to be. almost all the boys in school want her, and every girl wants to be her friend. she's the one everyone comes to for advice, the one who saves the day with a simplistic plan, and is just wonderful. too bad none of this makes her likable.<br /><br />are we supposed to believe that if we don't even come close to zoey's perfection, we're bad people? in the show, nothing's her fault, and if anyone contradicts her, they're portrayed as the bad guy(logan). he may be a jerk, but at least he has some kind of brain that thinks for himself instead of simply agreeing with the princess every time.<br /><br />her loyal group of blind followers are: chase, the average dumb ass that has a secret crush on her, michael, the token black guy (and the only decent actor on the set), lola, a wannabe actress and anorexic, snobby airhead, quinn, the smart but clueless girl when it comes to teen stuff, and logan, the rich jerk who has a soft side. yeah, this show basically spews out stereotypes.<br /><br />what ticks me off, though, is that they all try to pretend they're normal kids. they complain that logan gets too much money while they have to work themselves, even though they already go to a too-good-to-be-true boarding school and have relatively nice things that many teenagers can't afford. they drink coffee and eat sushi on a regular basis, hardly have homework, and suntan almost every day. wow, they have it hard! any other problems? i'm too good-looking, rich, and stress-free! i guess zoey 101 (what's the 101 for, anyway?) is nick's attempt at trying to portray teens realistically. except they caught a glimpse of reality, didn't like it, and decided to give the kids lives like the asses on the hills.<br /><br />but hey, at least the set's pretty.
