having sat and watched this film i can only wonder at the reasons for creating the film. this was without a doubt one of the worst films i've ever seen and had no redeeming features.<br /><br />if it was supposed to be funny then it might have managed to be a very weak comedy but as an action thriller it was dire.<br /><br />slow, no plot, no real action, nothing approaching good dialogue and i've no idea about the characters. what else can i say. avoid.
