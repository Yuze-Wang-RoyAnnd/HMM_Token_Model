my mother told me not to go to see "kadosh" -- but who ever listens to one's mother? <br /><br />i was so turned off by it while i was watching i thought i must have lost my feminist credentials on the way into the theater, so i checked with card-carrying feminists the next day. no, they also thought it was much more an anti-orthodox screed than a pro-feminist statement, painting the orthodox as equal to the taliban.<br /><br />while this israeli movie is careful to show that the sect the story is about is the ultimate ultra-orthodox messianists, it is so nasty as to be unbelievable (plus that the non-fanatic orthodox rock-'n'-roller(!) one of the sisters is in love with is incredibly sexy--even in israel that must be fantasy).<br /><br />the theater was quite crowded, so there's a pent-up curiosity to see israeli movies; too bad this vicious movie is the one getting wide distribution. this was almost enough to drive me back to insipid hollywood romantic movies. <br /><br />(originally written 4/29/2000)
