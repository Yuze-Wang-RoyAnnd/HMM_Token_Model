well!! the movie has catherine zeta jones in it. it's a hallmark television movie. it's from a thomas hardy novel. it has catherine zeta jones in it. she is by far the only one in the movie who acts better than in my high school theater class. oh yes it has clive owen in it. i'm not british so that means almost as much as being a thomas hardy novel. except he was in "the bourne identity", and i liked that. that just about wraps it all up folks. that really all there was. i'm becoming repetitive, but i do like czj, so i stuck it out to the end. the computer is telling me that i don't have 10 lines and i keep counting them. i always count 11, but maybe it just doesn't like my style, but that is my opinion of the movie, too.
