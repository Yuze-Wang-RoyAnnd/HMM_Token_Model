for the most part, i considered this movie unworthy of a comment, but the last 10 minutes prompted me to write one. you see, right then we learn (spoilers...if they can be called that) that the devil's emissary has no chance of properly preparing the domination of the world by his master, because he is not skilled at martial arts! "prosatanos" has been lying in a hole for centuries, waiting for "human greed" to release him, only to be defeated in a simple one-on-one match against 54-year-old former karate champion chuck norris! imagine what would have happened to him if he had taken on jackie chan...
