on the bright side, it ended. that's the only thing this movie has going for it, of course.<br /><br />this is the worst movie i have ever seen, and i've seen some bad ones. this movie is actually so horrible, i went and changed my rating for children of the living dead to a 2 just for not being raptor.<br /><br />official one-liner rating: "come with me to another movie if you want to live."
