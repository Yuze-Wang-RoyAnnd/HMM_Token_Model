proof, if ever proof were needed, that hammer should have left their vampires firmly in the victorian age. after all, vampirism is all about repressed sexuality, so the concept is irrelevant in 1972's london, with its thirty-something thesps pretending to be randy teenagers.<br /><br />remember, by this time, hammer was floundering badly. the public had tired of the drawing room horror of the 1950s and 60s, so the studio was trying everything to bring them back, including ample nudity (lust for a vampire, et al) and updating their characters - neither of which apparently worked as hammer was pretty much resting in it grave just two years later. shame ...<br /><br />but i still have a great fondness for the classic hammer period from 1957-1965.
