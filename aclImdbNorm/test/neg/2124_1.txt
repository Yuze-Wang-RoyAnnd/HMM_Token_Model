there's really not a whole lot to say about this. it's just really, really bad. the acting is bad, the script is bad, and the editing is probably one of the worst jobs ever. it's so sloppy and choppy that it serves only to confuse the audience. there's no real to plot to speak of, mostly it's a really fake looking monster fish attacking europeans trying to pass themselves off as americans. pass on this one.
