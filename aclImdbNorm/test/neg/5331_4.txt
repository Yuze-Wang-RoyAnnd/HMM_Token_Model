this is one of those movies that i watch every time it's on not because i like it, but because it's so bad i can't take my eyes off it (like "battlefield earth" or "3000 miles to graceland"). the first time i watched i kept waiting and waiting and waiting to laugh and didn't get my chance until about 3/4 of the way through the movie when they strip the harassing cops to their undies and handcuff them in the park in a unflattering position. beyond that, the jokes aren't funny, the characters aren't funny, their mishaps and missteps aren't funny...add it up, it's not a very funny movie! not even at a slapstick level! and what's with the reggae soundtrack? it's a movie about two white garbagemen and the music is all reggae. seems out of place, don't it? if you like a good trainwreck, this is for you. if you like a good comedy, look elsewhere.
