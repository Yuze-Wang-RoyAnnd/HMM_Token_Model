if you've ever heard the saying, "the book is always better than the movie," heart of darkness is no exception to the rule. i believe that it was much easier for me to comprehend the details of the novel over the movie because i read the book aloud with my english class. we discussed each paragraph in great detail so i grasped the concept pretty quickly. i couldn't really understand the plot as well while watching the movie. this may be because there were no discussions held in class, but i suppose it is also because i couldn't paint my own pictures in my mind of the events of the novel. if you're the type of person who believes in that well-known saying, then leave watching the heart of darkness movie off your to-do list.
