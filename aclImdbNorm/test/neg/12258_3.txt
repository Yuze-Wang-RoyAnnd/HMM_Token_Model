this appears to be two movies spliced into one. in the first, zasu pitts is a renegade in a small town. she wants to help the romantic life of marjorie woodworth. ok: i'd never heard of her before either. but she and pitts are in both parts of this concoction.<br /><br />before we know it, pitts is no longer miss {polly. she is emmie. i had to rewind to see if i'd fallen asleep somewhere. i hadn't. she no longer in a small town but on her way to the title honeymoon destination.<br /><br />the movie has some cute moments. the first part is better, with roles for what seems to be every third-rate character actress working in hollywood at the time.<br /><br />and what of ms. woolworth? she sounds a little like betty hutton. she sounds a little like marie wilson. she's pretty, certainly. but she's no comedienne.<br /><br />pitts often was used in very small roles. here she has the largest role. she's always fun, though this movie made me wonder if a little of her doesn't go quite a long way. (as a comic. when she was a tragic actress in von stroheim silents -- "the wedding march" and greed" are the two i have seen -- she was brilliant.)
