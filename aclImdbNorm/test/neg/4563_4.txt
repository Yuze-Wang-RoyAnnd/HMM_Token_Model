this is an old-dark-house movie. a young couple creep around a weird mansion said to be run by satan, where they run from and into one after another of an ill-assorted crew: a lady in distress, an ape, an ape-man, a midget, various odd-looking people, and (for some reason) two chinese. they end up in a throne room where the hero is required to play a "price is right" sort of contest involving a climb up seven steps with seven illuminated footprints; hence the title. for my taste it's too much of the same thing. the creeping around fun-house corridors is amusing for a while, then becomes repetitive. by comparison with harold lloyd or buster keaton or laurel and hardy doing the same bit in two reels, it isn't truly funny. it's not frightening either, and apparently wasn't intended to be: the household is too absurd. most films in this genre balance the comedy with a genuine threat, and usually two--one that the characters are led to believe is real, and another for which it's a cover. here the cover isn't to be taken seriously, and neither is what covered. a few moments of fun emerge from the mix, but it's rather heavy fun. the novel on which the film was based was a straight thriller and i think could have been played straight to better effect--and still could be.
