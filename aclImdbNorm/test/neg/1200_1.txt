<br /><br />i still can't belive louis gossett jr. agreed to appear in this film. everything about this move feels artificial, forced, and contrived. the air sequences are flat. the enemy characters seem like puppets. this is just a poor excuse of a movie. at least top gun had air sequences that looked good (the external shots anyway). the songs by queen are cool, though. rent midway instead.
