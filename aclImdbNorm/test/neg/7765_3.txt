all my friends and various other coworkers think this show is soooo great. first i hate this show!!!!!!! i think i might be the only female alive!!! i only watched it because my best friend adores it and fancies herself to be the charlotte character!<br /><br />first the whole plot (if you can call it that) is about four women superslut samantha (kim cattrall)who most likely has every std available and mossy,brown and green genitals considering she is tri sexual( she'll try anything).<br /><br />samantha is not like most 40 something women even in ny, but than the show would not have some kind of entertainment since samantha (along with some good ny scenery) is the only reason to watch and those are not reason enough. <br /><br />charlotte (kristen davis) is a well dressed upper class ny idiot who still believes the pince charming myth! however sweet and pretty she is do not let that fool you, she spreads quite often.<br /><br />miranda (cynthia nixon) now this woman is stereotypical angry, butch feminist. i think in one episode she is thought to be a lesbian, but apparently is not...what a shame she's almost interesting.<br /><br />carrie (sarah jessica parker) the most annoying character. i swear i thought i was watching twisted sister front man dee snider's more manly looking, cross dressing, sissy boy, brother! this is a girl looking for can't live without you love....heard of a puppy?<br /><br />this show is stupid and i love making fun of it because i hear about how it is some kind of new awakening for women. that is just sad if your looking to watch slutty, pathetic, addictive people in way too expensive clothes drinking cosmopolitans and sounding like an annoying 15 yr old on cocaine than there is a show for you............just use protection.
