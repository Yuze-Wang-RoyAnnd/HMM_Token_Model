i went along to this movie with some trepidation; the original is a masterpiece of both writing and acting and unfortunately my fears were realized. this is a humorless piece of work and i sat in the theater waiting for the wit and humor to begin- i'm still waiting, it seems. updating the storyline to the present time just didn't work and the altering of characters an absolute travesty- why did they introduce bette midler's character when she disappeared just as quickly as she arrived; the related character in the 1939 original was an integral part of the plot. the women in the cinema laughed a few times but nothing touched me as being funny with the exception of a line from meg ryan talking to her mother about her situation and telling her that 'it's not like a 1930's movie'- i sorely wished i was viewing the 1930's version. it was all too touchy feely 'sisters stick together' and really needing some of the acerbic wit and clever dialog from the original play- i still watch the original movie and pick up a line that i have never caught before. there is no sense of closure to this new version, and whilst the 1939 movie is politically incorrect by todays standards, each thread was tied up and when the movie ended- it did so strongly. this remake should be labeled with a warning for any viewers- if you know the original, don't bother: i felt cheated by losing part of my life in a cinema watching this unmemorable piece of fluff. bring on the jungle red!!
