my first warning should have been that this dvd was on sale for $5.00. but since it featured sandra bullock, who i generally like, i bought it. my disappointment with the film began almost immediately. the dialogues are slow and stiff. the color is distorted. i kept adjusting the volume to hear the conversations. the acting is amateurish. even the killing scenes are a failure. twice, dead people moved their legs. when my cash-deficient daughter offered me a dollar to turn off the movie, i immediately and joyfully complied. this is an amazingly bad movie. tomorrow i am giving this dvd away at the company white elephant christmas party.
