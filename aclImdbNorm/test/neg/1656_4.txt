i was so looking forward to seeing this film that i can't really understand how i got the impression i would enjoy it. i'm afraid it really is a yawn fest - every single patron in the cinema i attended yawned and fidgeted frequently during the whole film. this is a shame because it is a fantastic story - i'm inclined to think that it would make a better read. it is not helped by the principle character only showing his teeth once - and that was as a result of the camera angle. as the story unfolds it becomes easier to understand the main character's dilemmas. however, the suspense and drama that could have made this a really top rated film have been completely spoilt by the dull treatment. dull as a half-baked documentary!
