ed wood is rolling over in his grave. he could have made a hundred cult classics for the price of this waste-hole. the worst script in memory (it makes "x-men 3" sparkle like "citizen kane"); the most amateur directing; pre-k cinematography; the cheesiest "special effects" (i'm talking about "friday the 13th" sequel territory); and throw in a pointless, revolting, deeply disturbed, maternity ward sequence. the lack of any talent or sensibility that put this garbage on-screen is astounding. that the "industry" might reward anyone involved in this celluloid cess-pool with future projects ought to be cause for serious alarm.
