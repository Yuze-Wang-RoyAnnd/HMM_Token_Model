it's another variation on the oft-told tale of two people getting married and having to share their brood of kids. with six you get egg roll is directed by howard morris (from television) and it shows, because it's the kind of tale that plays like a half-hour situation comedy padded out to feature film length--but with a scarcity of laughs, or to put it differently, only the number of laughs that would have been possible within the half-hour limits of a tv show.<br /><br />doris day decided to call it quits after this film--and it's rather easy to see why. even the presence of some fairly reliable actors in the cast doesn't help. brian keith, barbara hershey, pat carroll and alice ghostley do their best, but the script is the real problem and should have been left untouched for the big screen.<br /><br />nothing much can be said in favor of it. skip it and see miss day in any number of her more worthwhile films.
