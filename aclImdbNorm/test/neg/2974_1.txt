to soccer fans every where -- stay away from this movie. it was so baaaaddd! lame acting, lame script, lame soccer and no directing! i rented this movie during my stint in asia and was appalled that this was considered one of the better singaporean films. it was just nonsensical and thoroughly boring. there are thousands of rich, exciting stories in asia. why write a bad story about over the top and stereotypical singaporeans?
