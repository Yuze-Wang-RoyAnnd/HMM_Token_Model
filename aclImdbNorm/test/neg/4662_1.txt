being an unrelenting non-stop over-the-top explosive melodrama, this movie is one of the worst action flicks ever produced, and utterly unbelievable in every way. the pace is constantly fever-pitched, and all the action and the actors are gripped by total hysteria. it is nigh unwatchable, and a stain - nay, a blotch - on the careers of everyone involved.<br /><br />the wildly exaggerated attempt at excitement undermines itself, resulting in a movie where you just go "come on!" all the time. the setting and the events are impossible to take even remotely seriously. i can only rate this abomination a 1 out of 10.<br /><br />if you want to see a good asteroid movie, see deep impact, which is intense, sensitive and thoroughly engrossing. everything armageddon is not.
