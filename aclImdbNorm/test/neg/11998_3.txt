wow... i suspected this one to be bad... but now i find myself just at a loss for words... honestly, no words of mine can do this movie any justice...<br /><br />i'll try to say something anyway...<br /><br />this truly is one unique gem. one of the worst kind.<br /><br />lash la rue - given his background as an actor - doing a whip-fight with a toltec sorcerer-zombie during the movie's climax...??? a true stroke of genius, without a doubt.<br /><br />it rarely happens that i laugh out loud when watching a movie alone. it happened numerous times with this one.<br /><br />the accents of the actors, man, the accents... and the dialogues i heard them speak... and the acting itself... i just couldn't believe what i was hearing.<br /><br />that fat uncle farting so loudly (when walking up to the house together with his little nephew) for no apparent reason whatsoever...<br /><br />tits! yes, there's titties! and female ass! there's even a naked chick in a bathtub sipping a beer...<br /><br />that one "stretch his mouth over his face"-kill was the bomb! a true highlight.<br /><br />the comedy-aspects were just totally bonkers. i just couldn't believe what i was seeing and hearing. for a while i even thought that they were unintentional, shaking my head in disbelief. but about halfway in the movie, i started to get the bigger picture. guess it took me half a movie to dumb-down half of my brain, to finally get it.<br /><br />i had a really hard time believing this movie... but it's good, really, i think. it had one black chick walking up to a very tiny cupboard, opening it and then saying "wooow, look at all the storage space!". and she said it like she meant it. i mean, that's good dialogue and good acting, right?<br /><br />oh, and perhaps needless to say: lash la rue's whip-skills suck major ass in the dark power. it's really sad and pathetic to behold. that's all part of the comedy, of course. or wait, i might be wrong. no, yes, i'm wrong. lash la rue was amazing with the whip! it was the editor's fault. he messed it up, cutting his lashes together and all. or wait, it might have been the camera operator. he filmed from the wrong angles... then why didn't phil smoot say anything? that's it, it's the director's fault.<br /><br />but it's a good movie.<br /><br />i'm just gonna quit talking about it. i have nothing meaningful to say anyway, except for the fact that i hope my brain will recover from this experience... some time soon.
