so many of these types of movies out these days. this zombie flick falls into the major "cheese" category unlike the far more polished dawn of the dead, and day of the dead. in all fairness those 2 movies were major studio releases with big budgets behind them. but they were also good movies. a low budget movie can still be good if only they would stop accepting and using the worst scripts around. whoever wrote this movie must have been drunk the whole time.<br /><br />this movie had so so special effects and a very un-even plot line. the one major difference from other movies of its type is the time it takes for people to transform into zombies. in this one, it seems to take just seconds for them to die and then turn into a zombie. yet with the ease this "infection" spreads you can have zombie blood all over you and not even seem to be at risk for infection, and believe me the people in this one get covered in blood.<br /><br />the main problem i had is that our 2 main stars at times were walking around dozens of zombies and didn't get bit. when everybody else turns into zombies amazingly quickly these 2 were swarmed by zombies when they were even unarmed and were able to come out of it without a problem. our hot chick star even survived a missile strike on the building she was in. i was laughing out load at that point. unarmed, having like 10 zombies on her and a missile hits the building yet she manages to get out without a scratch? ok sure....<br /><br />also whoever advised these people on how special forces behaves obviously never spent any time in the military. they should have watched a movie like blackhawk down first to get at least an idea of how they behave in combat situations.<br /><br />one soldier was a fat overweight special forces private. lol that was a good one. another kept going up to zombies thinking they were survivors, even putting his weapon down at one point. these guys are in there to fight zombies and they were acting like the soldiers from the movie stripes. special forces, lol...<br /><br />then they get to the point at which they try to explain the zombie girl in the rubber room and the whole thing gets very confusing. the explanation is muddled and does not even follow the first movie. it made no sense at all.<br /><br />the only thing i liked was the anti bush jokes. the military lady at the beginning told them that the order came down from the vice president to the president and at the end it was the vice president from an "undisclosed location" giving the orders. that was the best part of the movie for me.
