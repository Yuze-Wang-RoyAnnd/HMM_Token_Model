i hate a movie that doesn't have an ending. i don't care how good or bad the rest might be, i don't like to be left without a conclusion. such shows should insist upon a disclaimer ... something like: the movie you are about to watch has either no ending or is so ambiguous as to not be conclusive.<br /><br />in the movie the last scene we are left with is dee and dominic having a bit of a row and he says, almost regretfully i thought, that it couldn't be him because the fingers were either that of a girl or a child. then it ends! well sure, the smoking gun, so to say, is in the hands of the dee's son, but what about dominic's daughter? i actually thought we might discover it was her! anyway, unless you like inconclusive movies, then i'd avoid this one. otherwise, i thought the movie generally good.
