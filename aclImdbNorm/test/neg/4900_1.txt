to start, i'm not a person to rate movies that i haven't seen, nor am i a person that rates movies 1's when they don't deserve it. this movie was really that bad. the basic plot was extremely formulaic, and while it wasn't great, the plot deserved about a 5. the part that really bothered me was anything referencing swimming in the film. i compiled a short list of things wrong with the swimming aspects of this film.<br /><br />1. no character development. 2. no sense of time. 3. completely inaccurate swimming scenes, which include: a. a team of six swimmer going to something called both "nationals" and "regional" with no mention of how they qualify. b. this same team going to whatever the hell this meet was without swimming a real meet at any point in the film. c. the rival program goes from being a high school to a club team back to a high school and then a club team again. d. in the scene where ellis is interviewing for a job the banners show high school state wins and placements at nationals, yet the team consists of anywhere from 5 to 12 swimmers depending on which of the 3 meets are happening. e. a team of 5 guys and a girl win nationals/regions whatever. f. said girl wins a men's 100 butterfly event. g. in this race, said girl beats two guys from a team that the previous year was in the top 3 in the nation. h. the announcer changes a race from the 200 breast to the 100 breast back to the 200 again in the span on about 45 seconds. i. in the final relay, the 4x100, which is being swum in a 50 meter long course pool, one swimmer is seen doing two flip turns. j. in this same relay, the teams anchor swimmer freaks out and steps off the blocks, prompting an inspirational pep talk, which lasts for about two and a half minutes, or about 3 times as long as the leg would take at a national caliber meet. k. the movie begins in the month of july or august, assuming that ellis was applying before the school year started, and the pool was to be closed in 3 months, so assuming these things both hold true, the swimmers went from not being able to swim to winning nationals/regional whatever, in less than two, as the pool had to be cleaned and the kids didn't start practicing for a while. l. i'm sure there are a couple hundred more, i'm just trying to block them out of my memory. 4. throughout the film there is not a single mention of a swimmers time. 5. if you're going to have a movie about swimming, it would be a good idea to hire extras that know how to swim well. 6. the scene where the kid is kicked underwater is physically impossible.<br /><br />that being said, all the swimming scenes were way too slow, swimmers had horrible technique, and the idea of being able to qualify for a national meet within three months of learning to swim is just insulting to swimmers everywhere.<br /><br />ok, if you still don't believe me, let me say that this movie is one of the 5 worst films i have ever seen, and this is coming from the guy that owns gigli, soul plane, manos: the hands of fate, skullduggery, and any number of other total piece of crap that have been put on film. please don't go!
