this has got to be the worst movie i have ever seen. the part where they loose there daughter? with the poltergeist overtone rip off? just pushes it over the edge with stupidity. i watched it on showtime so it still had the cheese soft-core porn scenes in it. i have to say it made me laugh my ass off. the 80's 3d effects were very out of place. included an invisible cat and a spinning vortex. wow i wonder if the people who made this actually feel accomplished in life. the actress who plays the wife looks familiar but sucks anyhow. her screaming could be used as a torture device in hell for more than retired nazis. anyways thank you showtime for the super crappy horror movie. i will always enjoy the time i watched the biggest waist of time and money i have ever seen.
