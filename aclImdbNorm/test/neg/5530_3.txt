i'm so glad i only got this movie for $5. anime is expensive, no doubt about that. i've had my eye on this one for awhile and finally i saw it on sale. i grabbed it immediately and took it home only to hang my head in disappointment. this movie sucked. i've heard people talk about how gory and violent this movie is. it's really not that gory or violent. i've watched it three times, and i think i've wasted enough of my life on this. the demons get a point for being unique and kinda cool at times. the sex gets a point since it's almost non-stop. the horny old man gets half-a-point for being horny and still having the sex drive. and the main character (who's name i've erased from my mind) gets half-a-point for the cool design of his gun. i saw major connections between this movie and demon city shinjuku. both have same style animation, that's obvious because of the director, both have lame soundtracks which suck like the antichrist, and both have terrible endings. avoid this movie unless you're into anime sex.
