like its near contemporaries "the great race" and "those magnificent men in their flying machines", i always associate this film with my childhood especially at new year. on new year's day we'd visit my granny and after lunch, while the adults talked, the kids would watch tv where invariably one of these three crazy race films would be on.<br /><br />for that reason alone, i really wanted to mark "monte carlo or bust" well but i fear i can't, the child not being father to the man on this occasion. by which i mean i can see all too clearly its faults and while i was tempted to smile occasionally, in truth i really wanted all the competitors to get to the end of the race long before they actually do.<br /><br />of course it's dated by its stereotyping of nationalities and woman as the weaker sex and i also didn't much care for one or two stray, admittedly mild vulgarities which occasionally surfaced. more than that though, the cast, despite hamming it up outrageously just don't sell the film enough. tony curtis, in a trial run for his "yank abroad" turn in the tv series "the persuaders", seems too old to be playing the young gallant, terry thomas just isn't dastardly enough, eric sykes is unbelievable as a dirty-minded lothario while gert frobe as an overdone teuton, is just weird doing camp comedy when you remember he was bond's best villain goldfinger. if anything the englishers come off best - susan hampshire is at least engaging as a "bright young thing", suitably gamine as a posh flapper and although chained to the leash of the script pete and dud offer the most amusement as stiff upper lip army types, although even then the "carry on" team did this so much better in "carry on up the khyber pass".<br /><br />director annakin tries everything to evoke the "golden silents", with lashings of slapstick, mistaken identity capers, speeded up camera shots, would-be dramatic stunts and some light romance, but there's no real tension for such a famous race and anyway the race-off at the end seems like another swizz.<br /><br />actually i'd have given it another mark if they'd stuck to the alternative title "those magnificent men in their jaunty jalopies" but in truth the animated series "wacky races" did this so much better.
