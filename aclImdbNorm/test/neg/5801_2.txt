alright, how someone can actually think this movie is awesome, is so beyond me... i can't even comprehend how someone can find this movie remotely funny, the only character it has going for it, is the evil super nerd game designer, and that gets old after a while. this movie is so predictable, the punchlines are not funny they're forced, you see better acting at the red light district, and the story sucks it's so predictable, you know exactly what's going to happen. even the characters do not react like they should, try going to the hot chick that is your boss at work and telling her that you're banging 2 crazy chicks that you live with at the same time, her response wouldn't be (smile) "ok let's get back to work". i didn't laugh once during this movie, and i wish i had never seen it or spent 3$ to rent it because that's not even worth it. adam sandler produced this movie, i have lost all respect for him. all his movies are the same, his comedy style got old ever since the waterboy came out, if i knew adam sandler had produced this before i rented it...there's no way i would have wasted my time on it. this movie is as bad as it can possibly get from every aspect... ace ventura wasn't a smart comedy movie, it didn't have a killer plot...but it was original and it was hilarious. i'm not knocking the movie because it has 'low-level' humor, i'm knocking it because it sucks, it's a piece of hollywood crap. if this movie was presented to a production company and din't have "adam sandler" behind it, it would be thrown in the garbage quicker than a used condom. if you want a good movie about pot-culture watch cheech and chong, or whitecastle. if you rent this movie all you will get is a generic comedy that targets 14-17 year olds, with loud rock music at every possible cut, acting that will make your eyes squint and your stomach turn, and comedy that is equivalent to watching your stoned friend eating mcdonalds for an hour and a half. don't do it.... for the love of god...this movie sucks, treat it for what it is and look past all the hollywood glory behind it.....hercules in new york used to be the worst movie i had ever seen, but it's actually so bad it's good. this instead was a very expensive movie that sucked just as much, if not more.
