i was looking forward to seeing this movie, unfortunately i should have listened to my daughters advice. this should have been a spoof, but it took on a realism that corporations had a lot to answer for.<br /><br />jim carrey after all the work he has done is still jim carrey and his comedy does not get any better, his co star was not able to back him up. their son in the movie was invisible.<br /><br />the life of crime was a blink, and that was the missing link of the movie. the film showed 2 or 3 robberies and they were richer than before, that where it lost it for me.<br /><br />i did laugh in some parts butthrough the whole not good enough, alecbaldwin i felt was there to add some weight to the film. his character was not strong enough. there were just too many gaps to make this a smart and tight movie.
