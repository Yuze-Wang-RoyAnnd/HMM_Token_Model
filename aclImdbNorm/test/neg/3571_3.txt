upon writing this review i have difficulty trying to think of what to write about. nothing much happens in this film. the storyline is a south asian woman who falls for an english londoner. the problem is he and his friends have had a racist streak. at the same time her friend at work is unknowingly to her having sexual relations with her brother, and it just escalates from there. the problem is that this movie is very predictable. as soon as all this stuff has happened it's all pretty much standard. it drags slightly even though it's only about 90 minutes long. this is more of a chick flick than anything else. so if you're male i do not recommend this film to you.
