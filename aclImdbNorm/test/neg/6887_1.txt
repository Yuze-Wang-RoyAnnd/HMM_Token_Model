i guess when people say this is beautifully filmed they are talking about the close ups of frogs and the cooking of meals. it certainly doesn't refer to the set which seems to be composed of about 3 rooms with no outside shots at all. also all of it is filmed too close up.<br /><br />i got sick of the little boy who keeps farting at miu or pouring hot wax over ants...also do vietnamese spend all their time sitting on their haunches? kind of gross looking at least the way this movie depicts it--one close up of it would have been plenty not a dozen or more.<br /><br />then finally comes part two... a chick flick for vietnamese girls with the perfect handsome rich man who spends all day playing the piano (he is cultured). the pretty maid steals him like the forbidden green mango fruit. deep.<br /><br />except for a few nice close ups this film is a dud. it is sort of a soap opera with out dialog. it is cloyed. how is it beautiful?? the set looks completely fake.<br /><br />no don't make the mistake i did and rent it because someone recommended it. i was expecting beautiful shots of the coastal mountains of vietnam or something when i heard it was a visual gem.<br /><br />i wanted to like this movie. i like foreign movies even prefer them. but this movie is dumb and dull. it will leave you irritated that something like this won a bunch of prizes.
