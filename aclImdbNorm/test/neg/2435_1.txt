i don't normally write reviews, in fact, i never write reviews. this film was so atrocious it actually inspired me to start. virtual sexuality attempts to be a light hearted and cheeky teenage comedy regarding the usual trappings; virginity, boys etc. except the main character apparently turns into her perfect boy that she has created using the help of a machine at a technology fair. <br /><br />sound interesting? well, it isn't. the acting is the most half-hearted and appalling i have ever seen. the unfortunate thing is they appear to be genuinely supportive of script and movie, which probably explains why i have never seen them in any memorable production since. i have not bothered to learn the actors names, nor their characters. the lading lady does not enrapture or charm you and, thus, you do not care for her whatsoever. the leading lady's male friend raises no sympathy even when the script is vociferously screaming for you to pity him. the only rise he will get out of you is one of extreme anger and sudden violence. the only half decent actor was the blonde leading man, who, despite his miserably weak role, really gave it all he could, which wasn't much in the light of such a horrendous piece of work. i will not even talk about the acting abomination that are the 'bad guys' of the plot. but then again, what plot?<br /><br />i watched this film unfold incredulously, as i had absolutely no idea how anyone would have the foolish audacity to write such a script, nevermind produce, act in, and direct it. i can only wonder. the only reason my companion and i continued to watch such a mangled example of film was the disbelieving laughter it managed to arise out of us as cohesion, logic, class and even impotent storyline were disregarded within half an hour into the film. i have completely no idea why anyone wanted to violate the movie industry by releasing this to the public. this is a joke of a film and is best left to gather dust in warehouses for the rest of eternity. 1/2 out of 10. if that.
