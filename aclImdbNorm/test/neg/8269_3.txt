the tv announcer who introduced this late one saturday night said it should have won oscars. quite a statement for a film i'd never heard of...though why i should have taken any notice of a tv announcer, i don't know. in the event, said announcer was talking tripe.<br /><br />it's a dreary, miserable movie that leaves a bad taste in the mouth. i couldn't get on with hoskins' awful burr-ming-gum accent. can't see any advantage in it being set in the midland's anyway. <br /><br />unresolved threads abound...and i wouldn't normally mind this but half of them make no sense. and what about when hoskins' says he'll pick felicia up from outside her b&b although she never told him where exactly she was staying??? or her buying into the funeral that clearly never took place (and where was she during those days???) clumbsy and ill-thought through bits of business if you ask me.<br /><br />it's a thriller without thrills. it's full of pretentious bits of business. it's depressing... <br /><br />didn't like it. thought it was rubbish. wouldn't recommend it. 'nuff said.
