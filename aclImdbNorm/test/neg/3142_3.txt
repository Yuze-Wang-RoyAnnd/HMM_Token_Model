i rented this movie from a local library without having any prior knowledge of the book it is based on or the movie itself, purely based on the chance that it's one of those rare, overlooked gems that one can discover from time to time and really enjoy.<br /><br />unfortunately this is not one of those movies. i am not sure if this is a movie driven by sentimentality or worse, deliberate agenda, but certain elements of it made it impossible to immerse. it is supposed to portray a struggling immigrant worker community which tries to cope with the difficult realities of their life. that is a fine premise and it could have made for a gripping story, but the execution just made me alternate between getting annoyed and amused at the ridiculousness of it.<br /><br />here we have a community of simple farm workers who migrated to the us in search of employment and who get used and abused repeatedly by evil white men. and when i say evil - i mean evil. all white people in this movie are sinful, racist, sadistic, abusive devils whose sole purpose in life is sexual depravity intertwined with exploiting the poor immigrants. it would be a sad story if it wasn't so unintentionally grotesque and therefore hilarious.<br /><br />the portrayal of the immigrants is also a poster-worthy example of exaggeration except that it goes in the opposite direction. the immigrants are saintly, clean and could serve as ointment for boo-boos and ouies the world over. i couldn't help but laugh when i saw these "field workers" presumably digging in the ditches all day with their notoriously clean clothes and chiseled hair cuts from a top notch hair salon. a little restraint and a more unbiased hand at the helm could have made this a much better movie evoking some intended emotion rather than sarcastic snickers.
