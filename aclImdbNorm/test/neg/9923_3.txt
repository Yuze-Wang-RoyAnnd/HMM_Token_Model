<br /><br />very slow, plodding movie with a confusing story line. the movie's only hope of keeping the audience interested is the gratuitous nudity thrown in at regular intervals. ellen barkin is miscast and her looks do not hold up when she is on screen with the much-younger peta wilson. not sure what this movie was about.
