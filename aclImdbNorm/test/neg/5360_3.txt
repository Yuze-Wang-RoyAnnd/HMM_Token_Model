let me first off say that i am a believer of ghosts, and i do indeed know they exist. i have had enough experiences with them to know they are there.<br /><br />what i hate is the people who bring the bible and religion into all of this. people forget there is more than one "bible", thousands of religions and beliefs, and different ways to interpret what is said in the bible. not everyone believes in god, and not everyone believes in stereo-typical religion. <br /><br />religion does not make everything fact, one of the things i should mention in the bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant bible thumper is breaking the very rules written within....you are supposed to never wear more than one fabric at one time, slavery is ok, and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstances. none of this, "oh that was the old testament, and now we have the new testament." if the bible is the word of god, and cannot be changed..there should be no changes, or versions. religion is full of misinterpretations, mixed facts, and people who so blindly follow it that there, "is no other way." the excuses these said blind followers use are either pathetic, or they themselves cannot explain the discrepancies properly, and instead use excuses handed down to them from either their pastor or teacher. <br /><br />but anyhow, onto the review. i am a decent fan of "ghost hunters" and when i heard this show was coming soon, i was pretty excited and thought it had some potential. as much as i like watching "ghost hunters", i do not like some of their members, and i do not like the way they can dismiss a place as being haunted, yet cannot explain anything that is going on. just because your investigation equipment does not pick it up, does not mean the camera filming the show did not. i am glad they are skeptical, but it's like they do not understand that just because you did not get anything on your recorder and film does not make the place haunted or not. if ghosts were that easy to capture, it would be known as a fact, not a belief. it's more of a "right place at the right time" kind of thing, as well as if there is something there, what makes you think it's going to "perform" for you? this show is kind of silly. it's usually boring, and there is lots of talk, lots of psychics, yet hardly anything happens. the main guy's filtered narration is usually either boring to listen to, or is basically not needed.<br /><br />also, the reliance on psychics is too abundant, as i believe very few of them are actually gifted. silvia brown is one i definitely believe in, but most are sometimes hard to believe.<br /><br />i really wanted to like this show, but of the few i have seen i have yet to be terribly impressed.
