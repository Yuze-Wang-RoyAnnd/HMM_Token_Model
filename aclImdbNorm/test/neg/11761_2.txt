che! is a bad movie and deserves it reputation as an unintentionally funny film. it takes a serious subject and presents it like the cliff notes version or classic comics because there isn't much emotion or a proper narrative--just episodic segments stitched together with mostly stupid "true stories" relayed by a variety of yutzes.<br /><br />this is a deservedly derided film, as it is poorly written and acted. however, what i have found most interesting about the film is its apparent gay subtext. instead of che guevarra and fidel castro working towards a communist cuba, they seem to be more of a gay couple--with che behaving coy and aloof and fidel as the ardent suitor! again and again, the film abounds with great lines such as when fidel implores che "cuba needs you....i need you!!". i am not sure if the studio intended this homosexual undercurrent, but it doesn't take a brain surgeon to recognize it! i am very surprised that the other reviewers didn't point this out. however, if you remember this when you watch the film, it makes viewing much more exciting and even funnier.<br /><br />a final note. in recent years, che has been very chic--even a fashion statement with hoards of brain-dead teens, who have no idea who he was, wearing shirts emblazoned with his face. considering he was a cold-blooded killer and nihilist (an odd combination for a doctor), this new reverence for the man is gross. what will they do next, put hitler or dr. mengele on t-shirts and posters?!!? even communists with consciences should be appalled by the bloodshed guevara was responsible for and i find it ironic that people with computers are championing a man who might likely have killed them given half a chance! <br /><br />considering how stupid and unintentionally funny this movie was, it does nothing to further the message that guevara was no hero. i would love to see a realistic film done of his life--with the good and the bad but also with dialog and a plot that weren't apparently created by chimps!
