wow. i thought, eskimo limon was the most awful and embarrassing first-sex movie ever. but i had forgotten that germany always tries to compete. in this case, the well-known german film producer bernd eichinger was successful in producing even worse crap. harte jungs is stupid, not believable and predictable, and above all: not funny. it's almost a tragedy that so many kids went to see this in germany (and, i'm afraid, also austria).<br /><br />tobias schenke, 19, looks too nice to have no girlfriend and too ripe to be 15, and his character is too dumb to be true. schenke tries real hard to make us believe that he doesn't know anything about sex, but that doesn't help. harte jungs seems to be made by someone who watched al bundy and took him too seriously.<br /><br />the best actors in the movie are sissi perlinger and stefan j"urgens who play schenke's semi-liberal parents. perlinger and j"urgens are stand-up comedians who are not particularly talented in movie acting. still, their performances are the `best' and `funniest' in comparison.<br /><br />a complete failure.
