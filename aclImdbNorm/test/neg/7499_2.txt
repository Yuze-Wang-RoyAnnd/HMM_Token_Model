am i the only one to think that this is a bad movie?<br /><br />i admit that horror movies often lack things like a big story or good acting or even good special effects. but the way these deficiencies come together in this movie is surprisingly pitiful.<br /><br />miserable story: the idea of a raped vagina that takes revenge by turning into a man eater sounds quite funny, but what the writer made out of it is stupid.<br /><br />bad acting: the actors move like marionettes. they play and look like people, who really try hard but completely fail to act.<br /><br />bad fx: especially the explosion of the van looks unspeakably cheap.<br /><br />it is surprising that a director who made some nice movies during his carrier changes over to such messy stuff.
