doug mcclure has starred in a few of these british produced genre adventures and this one has got to be the worst of the lot . i know the land that time forgot has its critics but please at least that movie featured location filming and relatively good production values . that's the problem with this movie - the production values go way beyond " so bad they're good " affectionate territory and become " so bad i think i'll go and see what's on the other channels " <br /><br />one case in point is the first scene featuring the intrepid cushing and mcclure encountering a monster . it's painfully obvious the monster is an average sized man dressed up as a rubber monster being made to look over twenty foot tall via overblown back projection . it becomes even more painfully obvious that our heroes are trying to escape the monster by running on the spot . have i mentioned that this is one of the more convincing set pieces ? no really this looks like it was filmed in somebody's living room with the spare change left over from that year's doctor who budget . even former doctor who peter cushing is bland and what should have been an amusing line " you can't mesmerise me - i'm british " is delivered in a very flat way ( a very similar line is spoken by cushing in horror express ) in a script devoid of characterisation , plotting and memorable dialogue . it's not just the fact that the dialogue is unmemorable it's also infrequent and rare since the monsters don't speak . wouldn't it have been better having the chief bad guys humanoids like in warlords of atlantis so that they could explain the plot . does anyone here know what the plot actually is ? <br /><br />a very tedious british movie that even the twin talents of caroline munro can not save . the whole mood of the movie is summed up by the final sequence featuring two keystone cops
