before i really slag this film off, i just want to say i absolutely loved it. <br /><br />firstly, how many times in the film did the characters use the phrase "you're right."? i'm sure i was counting in the hundreds before i gave up and started watching the film again.<br /><br />secondly, what the hell is with those blue monkey things? ok, so the dansen family led very private lives and had one brown eye one blue eye, but since when does that transform people into subterranean carnivorous blue zombie-creatures?<br /><br />and finally, 'old faithful here will protect me' hahaha :)
