ok, so i gotta start this review by saying i was really expecting to see this flick for months, i use to watch its trailer and think it looked really cool....little did i know that the only cool thing about this clich'e-driven turd was precisely its trailer.<br /><br />at the cinema, i watched the first 3 frames of this movie and though to myself "no way this movie is so bad, don't be an idiot, give it a chance! you've only seen 3 minutes" while i rolled my eyes in shame. all those frames showed....get this....a guy with a poker face (because he feels nothing....that's deep) looking straight at the camera in the middle of the frame. in the second or third one, he stays awake in his perfectly made bed (because he sleeps like a dead guy...cause he feels nothing), and his father calls, and says "john garden state, is me, your father"....oh come on! i've seen a little more than a couple flicks to hate clich'es such as the "is me, your (insert parent)", how the hell am i supposed to react??: "oh, he has a tough relationship with him"....uh....yeah, thats exactly how i'm supposed to react....<br /><br />man, this is a crappy movie...<br /><br />anywho, as the flick goes on, we learn things about his friends, of which everyone is a alternative emo walking indie movie clich'e. for example, one of his acquaintances is a guy who works in a medieval themed restaurant who speaks klingon (bizarre characters + pop culture = your standard american indie flick). then we know natalie portman's character, who is a copy of alissa jones (from a movie that kicks gs's butt, chasing amy), amelie and that chick from eternal sunshine... you know, smart, original (not really), cultured, beautiful and...in touch with her sexuality (!). she listens some '70s band named the shins and gives...what? they're from this damn decade?? then why do they sound like that?? oh, they have no personality, ok.....so she hands her cd player to john garden state and he looks at her with a dumb face(you know, love). as the song played on, i heard its lyrics saying "you will love this soundtrack, it is so alternative and cool, you will love this movie, it will define you and your generation even if it is a ideological photocopy of the breakfast club, ghost world and every other smart teen movie from the last 20 years, you will drink coffee and read books you don't understand"...<br /><br />by now, really unoriginal sh!t starts to happen....he doesn't care if he dies in a airplane crash (because he is already dead....and he feels nothing) and he lets us know in a scene idea taken straight out of an unknown movie called fight club!!!, it is a cool scene but, oh, did i mentioned it appeared in the trailer?.......then in some party, and just when you think this guy is really deep and asexual he makes out with a bimbo....so oh, he's not such a emotional zombie after all....clever character development or just a sh!tty movie?......well, lets analyze that scene, it features him sitting motionless in a couch with everyone else moving in really fast speed......scene idea taken straight out of an unknown movie called requiem from a dream!......so just a sh!tty, sh!tty movie...<br /><br />then they meet more eccentric (clich'e, actually) characters, and finally, one that lives next to a big hole in the ground. john garden state says some crap like "good luck exploring your infinite abyss" and the guy says....and by now i wanted to really choke myself, "you too"..............and then we are gently told that neo is jesus....oh no, wait, thats from another dumb, obvious, repetitive, overestimated and clich'e piece of crap.<br /><br />finally (finally!!!!), some more crap happens and he enters the big warehouse showdown to defuse the bombs: he has to talk to his dad who he hasn't seen in the last zillion years cause he (finally cool spoilers) killed his own mom....(you see, he killed his mom, so he's also dead.......and feels nothing.....that's deep). now i really expected just clever and moving magnolia-like dialogue between a father and a son......but this is garden state, so this is pretty much it: -john garden state: father, i forgive you, you didn't know what you were doing when you drugged me for a zillion years, but i know you love me -crappy director's dad: no!!! no!!!! i'm gonna say some simple stuff cause i'm not really so deep of a character anyway, like this whole movie actually, so no!!!! -john garden state: no dad, we must get along cause we are equal individuals.....i mean different individuals -crappy director's dad: no!!!!! no!!!!............ok, you convinced me. <br /><br />and he gets the girl (cause he's no longer dead, you know) and the movie ends and i go and eat a piece of chicken that makes my day....<br /><br />this made-for-trailer movie sucks
