for the first forty minutes or so, luna is a real pleasure to watch. the characters and their situation are interesting and the photography and locations are beautiful to look at. then jill clayburgh discovers her son matthew barry is using heroin and the movie starts to unravel and then becomes outright laughable in its sickness.<br /><br />clayburgh asks him why and when he started using the drug and she nor the audience ever get a straight answer, which would be a bit helpful. he mentions not caring about anything but that's not right because we see clearly in the amazing early scenes that he has a good deal of interest in his mother's singing, baseball, sex, and apparently cared enough to turn down marijuana. this movie is for people who think junior gets into hard drugs because mom and dad were workaholics who missed his piano recital. i think such a dangerous and emotionally volatile drug like heroin was chosen as some sort of intellectual catalyst for the later scenes of incest. there's a lot of discussion about the mother's love for the son but it's really about bernardo bertolucci being pretentious. luna would have been great as a quaint little family drama.<br /><br />how old was matthew barry in this movie? i was more concerned over the bizarre things he had to do as an actor for this film than for anything his character was going through. ** out of ****
