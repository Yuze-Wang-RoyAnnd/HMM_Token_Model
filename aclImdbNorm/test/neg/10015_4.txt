earth has been destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. well, parts of the earth, because somewhere in italy, a band of purebred survivors--those without radioactive contamination--are holed up in a massive mansion surrounded by lush grounds, waiting for the next opportunity to go hunting for those with polluted blood. the final executioner is the story of one of their would be victims, alan (william mang, who looks, not surprisingly, a lot like kurt russell), and his efforts to take down the legally sanctioned hunters, who are led by edra (marina costa) and erasmus (harrison muller jr. ). alan has been trained to kill by former nypd cop sam (woody strode) who mostly hangs around giving his pupil moral support and mooching for tinned meat. strode is by far the best thing about the film, though he doesn't look at all well and only appears for about a third of the running time. as for the story, it's a blending of elements from better films and stories, including ten little indians, the most dangerous game, and escape from new york. the final executioner moves along at a fair pace and provides reasonable entertainment for less discriminate action fans.
