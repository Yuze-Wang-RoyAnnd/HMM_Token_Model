before "miracle on 34th street," maureen o'hara and john payne made this, this, this film. i was going to describe it, but can't find words for how badly this film turned out. the subject matter of adopting a child and maureen's illness are both very serious and sensitive issues, but that notwithstanding, this could have been done a whole lot better than it was. it was so extreme in its portrayal that it didn't come across as real at all. probably its problem started with a weak script.<br /><br />another example of a screenwriter taking a novel and writing a weak movie. (see my review of "a stranger in my arms.") the beautiful o'hara was often saddled with clunkers like this, another being forbidden street (britannica mews,) which i may review eventually.<br /><br />if you have any emotional ties to this from childhood, you'll be kinder to this rather lifeless, colorless, and lackluster film. but for something along the lines of this, maybe you can find its tv-movie remake. it has to be better. it has to be.
