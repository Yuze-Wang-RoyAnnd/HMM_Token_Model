sadly, this movie did have potential with such a willing cast, but everything was so poorly thought out and poorly executed. i don't think i've ever seen any film where every scene just falls flat with a loud thud, as it did here. also, i don't think i've ever seen a "stoner" sex comedy that didn't provide at least one laugh, but this vortex of pain provided nothing but groans and misery. the last time i was this stunned at how un-funny a comedy can be was with the awful "big momma's house." scene after scene, these movies will turn your brain into jelly. silly and stupid can sometimes be funny, but here, silly and stupid are used as a torture device against the viewer. an absolute, rock-bottom dud.
