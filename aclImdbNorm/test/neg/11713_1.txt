i saw this movie on a show that was showing bad b-movies and trying to get you to buy them. it basically was just a long trailer but gave you a really good idea of what the movie was about. after viewing the trailer, i thought i would rent this movie because it looked stupid and generic, but could still be entertaining in a perverse sense. it's not entertaining in any sense of the word. the film has two (or should i say four) things going for it and it's not the number of deaths, it's the women. they are hot and naked a lot and ms. lovell could be a legit actress, but not in a movie where the emphasis is on t&a and corny dialogs. this isn't even a horror movie or scary, unless you are talking about watching the actors try to act. the production value is pathetic, the acting is worse and the writing is the worst. what was the point in making this movie? to scare people? to rip off "texas chainsaw massacre"? to try and be funny? to show off the women's breasts? to put some guy's head into a retarded outfit, with fake hands and legs? to have a character just say the word "snow" over and over? to not have any real violence but have enough nudity in an attempt to cover up the fact there is no real plot? to be able to make a sequel to a movie no one has seen or will ever watch? i made a mistake in picking up this movie, don't make this mistake too.<br /><br />stay away from this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
