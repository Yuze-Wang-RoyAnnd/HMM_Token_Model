we chose to see this movie as an alternative to the polar express showing at our local imax theater. what a waste of time and money! first, it is not cute. the snowman, at times, looked demonic. other times, he was simply a zombie. he showed no expression or emotions most of the time, and his hollow blue eyes were just creepy.<br /><br />secondly, santa states in the beginning it's a movie about the spirit of giving. santa and a snowman declaring war on each other is a movie about giving? i'm all for a little parody, but this just wasn't funny or entertaining.<br /><br />the idea that the snowman's flute is his voice is different. too bad you never see or hear the snowman play his flute...not even a "thank you" to santa.<br /><br />the only funny parts of the movie were the "outtakes" at the end of the film. too bad they didn't use them in the movie. it would have been better.
