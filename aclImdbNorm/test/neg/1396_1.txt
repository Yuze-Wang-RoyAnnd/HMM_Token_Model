i haven't watched this show in months, but for a while i was forced to watch it every day because i had a roommate that liked it. so maybe it's undergone some vast improvement in all that time, although the commercials and the 4.2 rating on imdb aren't a good sign.<br /><br />it was clearly just a quick replacement for chappelle's show. even mencia says so. and while i wasn't even that big a fan of chappelle's show, his jokes were at least original and clever (and far edgier than mencia has ever been). mencia's jokes are completely unoriginal and stale. if you can't see that, i guess there's just no hope for you. but to be fair, here are some examples: <br /><br />--mencia blatantly rips off chapelle's lil jon skit. just takes it.<br /><br />--"south park" makes an episode about scientology. one week later, mencia has a joke on his show about how offensive he is to scientologists. bear in mind the joke isn't about scientologists, but about how much he's offended them on his show. when up to this point, he has never made a single scientology joke, ever.<br /><br />--after hurricane katrina, two ap photos go around the internet showing a black man "looting" groceries and a white woman "finding" them. weeks later, after millions of people have already seen this, mencia presents it on his show as if he discovered it and it's being shown for the first time (the daily show would have been on something like that in a day). pathetic.<br /><br />even more annoying than the joke-stealing is the way carlos has promoted himself and his show, claiming he's breaking down some sort of pc barrier (whatever) and that if you aren't laughing, you must be a weak prude who can't handle any jokes about race. yes, carlos, it's not because you're not funny, it's because we're all too offended to laugh (if that was really true, then why was chappelle's show so popular?). he constantly berates his audience for "not getting it" if he doesn't get enough laughs, and often repeats and explains his jokes, a technique most comedians stop using by age 14.<br /><br />the worst part is that mencia does not seem to be very intelligent. it's sort of tragic that there are dozens of funnier, more insightful comedians out there trying to make it while this guy is rolling in money. his show is supposedly the third highest rated on comedy central, which is baffling (again, it has a 4.2 rating on this site). where the hell are they getting these numbers?? comedy central tries to bill itself as an "edgy" station, but as long as it tries to appeal to the dumbest audience possible, that will never be the case.
