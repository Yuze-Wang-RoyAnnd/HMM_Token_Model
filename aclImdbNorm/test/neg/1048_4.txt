honestly i am not that impressed by it, it's not a bad movie, but it's not great one either. there's a story to tell, but it's told in a very incoherent way which kinds of makes it loose it's full meaning and ability to intrigue. this movie could of been made in another way with an outstanding result, the story is just so interesting yet somehow i'm not intrigued when watching it. <br /><br />it definitely isn't an amateur movie, rather the opposite and some of the scenes are really emotional. the actors and actresses does quite a good job and so does the director but there's just something so unfinished by the whole movie that i cant quite put my finger on. perhaps if you had gotten to know the characters abit more, all the 'messiness' of the movie could of been better clarified and put more 'action' throughout it cause as it was, it became abit slow from time to time.
