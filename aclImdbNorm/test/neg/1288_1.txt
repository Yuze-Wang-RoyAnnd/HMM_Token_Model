my wife rented this movie and then conveniently never got to see it. if i ever want to torture her i will make her watch this movie. i've watched many movies with my 4 year old and i can take almost anything. barney is refreshing after a shot of quigley. <br /><br />the plot, dialog, cinematography, & acting were one step above (or equal to) a cheap porn film. i feel cheated out of $3.69 that we paid to rent it and then 90 minutes of my life i will never get back. i will say my 4 year old liked it, luckily it was a rental we had to return right away.<br /><br />i just hope that the younger actor's careers are not ruined from being in this movie.
