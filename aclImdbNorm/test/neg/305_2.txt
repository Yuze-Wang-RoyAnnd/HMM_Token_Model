the premise of the film was very promising - sort of a gay napoleon dynamite type of film. and to be fair, there were some funny moments and funny lines but it really wasn't very good overall. the script and dialog felt like a local sketch production, full of clich'es and scenes that were predictable.<br /><br />however, there was enough that was amusing, that i stuck around to see how it finished, since there were hints that something special happens at the end. but it seems that either the film ran out of money or the writer ran out of ideas because the ending is extremely abrupt, almost skipping directly from what looked to be the key conflict in the film to the final credits.<br /><br />overall, it was very disappointing but not completely unwatchable...
