rock hudson's second venture in the science fiction genre after seconds is embryo a film that combines elements of the bride of frankenstein and pygmalion in one rather weird film about for lack of a better word a test tube baby that grows up to be barbara carrera.<br /><br />hudson is scientist experimenting in organic development and gets a chance to first experiment on his own doberman pincher when it is accidentally hit by his car. <br /><br />some pituitary secretions from the female dog are given to a prematurely born puppy and it grows remarkably into an adult. exalted with his success, hudson takes a fetus from a dead accident victim and gives it some of the same stuff.<br /><br />what he gets is barbara carrera. and she develops physically and intellectually at a prodigious rate. what she doesn't do is develop emotionally. still hudson passes her off as his new research assistant to friends and family like sister-in-law diane ladd, son john elerick, and daughter-in-law anne schedeen. <br /><br />embryo doesn't explore some of the real issues in this kind of science, it exploits them instead. the special effects as they are, are pretty second rate. hudson looks like he lost interest in the project about halfway through the film.<br /><br />now what would have really been interesting is if he had gotten boy child and it grew up to be a harlequin novel hero. now that would have been something rock hudson could have sunk his teeth into.
