this fantasy was utter garbage. i thought michael moore cornered the market on ridiculous anti-government movies, but this one was far worse than anything he ever did. no wonder critics of the british media complain it's driven by tabloid journalism. this movie is a left-wing loony's greatest fantasy come to life on the big screen. anyone even slightly to the right of such rabid bush-bashers should be appalled it ever got funding to be made. i'm sure it will do well in syria, iran, pakistan, and north korea, though. it's hard to believe that in these days of insane muslims blowing up innocent commuters there is anyone in the u.k. who thinks britain should surrender in the war on terrorism. i guess it's no longer the country i admired for standing alone against the nazis nearly 70 years ago. all hail neville chamberlain and the pathetic policy of appeasement!
