this movie was the biggest piece of garbage i've seen in a long time.<br /><br />it's marketed as as sci-fi when in fact it's nothing more than a christian recruiting tool.<br /><br />it tells you quite a bit about the state of the christian church, when they have to resort to deception just to get you to listen to their sales pitch. but then again what do you expect from an organization that would go through such great lengths to help protect such an enormous amount of child molesters in their organization.<br /><br />religion is full of nothing but sexual deviants, hypocrites, and war mongers. let's not forget, our bumbling former president actually came out and said that "god told him" to invade iraq. and nobody questioned if he was hearing voices, or seeing things? <br /><br />anyway, going of the subject here. no this movie has nothing to do with ufos whatsoever, it's nothing more than a religious production.
