everyone has their choice for "worst movie they've ever seen." some like to pick on gigli or battlefield earth. some pick on classics like plan 9 from outer space. ever since i was 14 i have been very vocal in saying that to me, it is problem child 2, and 9 years later, i feel the exact same way. it's not "one of the worst," it's not just an expression. it is the actual worst movie i have ever seen.<br /><br />how much farting, pooping, peeing, and puking can you put in a single movie? i don't need to see a dog take a dump that goes up to my waist! why is it that i'm so hard on this filth? i have nothing against bathroom or gross-out humor. heck, i like the american pie movies. having such an excess of it within 90 minutes is a bad idea, but the true tipping point is to do it with kids! having little kids call each other sexual names (imdb won't even let me post that word on here, yet here it is coming out of the mouths of 8 year olds. think of the irony in that!) and urinate and puke on each other just makes the whole thing feel dirtier. worst line in the movie: "i guess i should fart in more people's offices." <br /><br />what other film has: urination into lemonade, dynamite sticks exploding toilets, a little boy filming his babysitter having sex and projecting it on the side of the house, and a little girl joking about scratching testicles? <br /><br />however, my absolute favorite moment has to be when the same little girl is on a carnival ride, says: "i'm gonna puke," opens her mouth, and fake looking puke shoots straight out of her open mouth in a perfect 90 degree angle! the puking scene in scary movie 2 looked more real than that. <br /><br />i suppose the only redeeming element in the movie is gilbert gottfried. you get the impression that he didn't even have a script, but was just being his usual self. too bad he has to act stupid while pizza gets thrown on him.<br /><br />you know what? thinking about the movie this much has just made me have to go to the bathroom. goodbye!
