i enjoyed the beautiful scenery in this movie the first time i saw it when i was 9 . dunderklumpen is kind of cute for kiddies in a corny way. it reminded me of hrpuffinstuff on sat mornings, its swedish backdrops make it easy on the eyes . don't expect older kids to be interested as the live action/animation is way behind the times and most older kids will get bored.this is definitely an under 10 age set movie and a nice bit of memories for those of us who were little kids in 1974.
