i found the movie at my local video store and i was surprised to see it on dvd. i had heard about the explicit sex scenes, gruesome violence, and the notorious debauchery. i sat and watched and i began laughing! the set decorations and art direction was cheap and fake; the nudity was sardonic and incredibly unsexy; the story was poorly written and it was just a parade of incredibly beautiful and talented actors being held hostage to quote the worst dialogue ever written! the incestuous relationship between caligola (malcolm mcdowell) and his serenely beautiful sister drusilla (theresa ann savoy, a vulnerable beauty) can't be taken seriously...it's not even shocking or repulsive! peter o'toole and john geilgud were obviously held hostage during the making of this film luckily they die in the first thirty minutes of the film. the cinematography was a joke and i was even more amused when they used a quote from the bible! the book of mark no less. if you are looking for shock value, this movie will disappoint you. if you are looking for camp cult value, you will be even more disappointed. i know i was. i have seen shocking and this is two hours of your life you will never have back.
