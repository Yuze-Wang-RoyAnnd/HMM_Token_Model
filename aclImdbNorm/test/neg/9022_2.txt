this is probably wayne's poorest movie; at least the poorest in which he had a starring role. it's just incredibly bad. the editing is especially awful; it really appears that the editor (if there was one)literally picked up pieces of film off the floor and pasted them together. the opening has to be seen to be believed. john wayne must have cringed every time it was mentioned! i know there are "b" films - but are there "h" films? if so, this one's an example. and i say this as a devoted jw fan.
