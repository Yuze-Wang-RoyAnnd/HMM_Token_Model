please people! do not bother with this poorly directed joke. the direction was totally wrong from the outset. where is the history of his mothers' emotional interference and the general madness in the original family? why is ed portrayed as this large, overbearing imposing figure full of anger and hate? what is this crap? the writer and director obviously did no research into the history and just wanted to cash in on the infamous gein name. the fools who made this movie took so many liberties with the truth, it's ridiculous. if you want t see a brilliant gein film. go back to the minor classic "deranged" to see how ed really was. there is humor in that film, and ed is portrayed as more of the sad, lonely slight man he was, according-to history. where is the background story here? there is just poorly set-up shocks (that are not shocking) that we've seen before, and more accomplished as well. take the worst texas chainsaw massacre ripoff, and add this one to that list. had to give it one out of ten because rating wouldn't accept zero. i want my money back. if anyone regards this film as 'stunning' is possibly getting a financial kickback to do so.
