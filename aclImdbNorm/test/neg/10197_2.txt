calling this a "sunday school" movie might be generous, because, even as a christian, i found the religious message so one-dimensional that i wouldn't want to see it at my church. the message is, "read your bible, go to church and sign up for fire insurance, so you won't get left behind at the rapture." there was no love. i guess when you get right down to it, i don't believe in the god portrayed in this film. the guy who was supposed to have all of the spiritual answers came across like count dracula.<br /><br />aside from the spiritual/religious element, the script was tedious--saying the same thing over and over. that might have been to make up for some of the acting, which was unable to deliver a convincing line the first time, so they just said the same thing over and over.<br /><br />i did enjoy the final scenes. i thought it made a point without hitting someone over the head or stooping to a sunday school formula. the movie wasn't all bad, just most of it.<br /><br />i am in favor of more clean movies that are well-done and that present truth in a non-preachy way. this wasn't one of those, i am sorry to say. i took my family to this film, wanting to support that kind of movie. now i'd like my money back.
