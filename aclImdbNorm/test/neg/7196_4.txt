at it's core, this is a fairly typical revenge western, heavy on the spaghetti, and if you follow it as such, the protagonist comes through successfully defeating the main villain. however there's so much going on that has no bearing on the story that you have to wonder what the film makers were thinking about. i'm referring to stuff like the way miss rosie's singing number just pops up out of nowhere and the boxing match in the middle of town. ok, they have a loose connection to the influence villain mash flanagan has, but why all of a sudden does he turn up with an alias - mr. donovan.<br /><br />on the flip side, i thought it was pretty innovative how the camera shot showing the wounded wallach's view of the trail might have been filmed by someone with an actual bullet in his shoulder. and wasn't it great the way donovan's girl uses the old headache routine when he gets a little frisky? don't let me forget either the great stunt work by the gravel pit bad guys as wallach guns them down as part of the finale.<br /><br />still, there was one thing unaccounted for, and i kept waiting the entire movie for it. whatever happened to that trio of hoods that flanagan/donovan hires near the start of the picture? you know, the guy martel that a funeral parlor wanted to hire for his gun prowess, the devil's henchman mitchell with the rifle, and the knife thrower lincoln tate. each had a five thousand dollar bounty on his head, and they were supposed to protect donovan from the guy who survived the massacre of the opening scene. they were never heard from again! i like to think that maybe donovan just had them killed and kept the 15k all for himself.
