the film has so much potential which was not developed. mark hamill gives a good performance and so does bill paxton. the scenery is beautiful and the ultralight aircraft are neat. the problem with this film is that the story is way underdeveloped and the plot goes nowhere. the film at certain points almost puts you to sleep. i give it 3 out of 10 stars for the flying scenes.
