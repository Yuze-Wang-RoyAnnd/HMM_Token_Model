i rented this movie for about $1.50 - the most complete waste of money (and time) i have ever spent. it's lame! i couldn't believe how they could come up with something like this.<br /><br />the plot... there is no plot. everything you'd expect to happen, it does, only in a worse way. the acting was horrible. my dog could've done better. the special effects have no effect whatsoever - except inducing complete disbelief. and the cheesy lines.... i mean, why even bother? <br /><br />the only credit i can give this piece of sh*t are the opening scenes. they were actually quite pretty. and one of the reasons why i decided to rent this. the graphics shown there are probably the best and most realistic cg of the entire film.<br /><br />total reality gets 1 out of 10 for not being able to mark it lower.
