what happened to mathew modine's career??? i can still recall when he was considered an a list actor...<br /><br />was it cutthroat island the final nail in the coffin of a once promising career??? wow, this guy must really hate renny harlin's guts...<br /><br />this movie wants badly to be a comedy but fails to deliver any laughs, the characters are caricatures, and badly drawn ones at that ... but still what pains me the most is seeing mr. modine taking up on this kind of roles, next to actors so far away from his caliber, i mean at the time when he was making movies like birdie he could never in his worst nightmares have imagined that in the future he would be acting in movies with a hick humping a cow that just had her anus stapled shut, and maybe whats even worst;next to elizabeth berkley!!!
