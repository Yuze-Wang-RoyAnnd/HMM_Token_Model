i went into this movie with low expectations, knowing uwe boll's legacy as a film director, and screenplay writer, and i was still disappointed. uwe boll finds a way to make each and every movie he is involved in worse and worse. the overall concept wasn't a bad one, a man bored with his life as a stock broker becomes a serial killer. but the problem with the movie is there is no in between, he goes straight from stock broker to serial killer. the film has no-name actors, and i can see why, after watching the movie, i can't see why any actor with a career would want to even be involved in this movie. anyone who turned it down did their careers a favor. and if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and don't.<br /><br />i give sanctimony a 3 out of 10
