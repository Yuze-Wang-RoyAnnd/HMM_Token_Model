is there a fire fighter clich'e that is not used in this film? from the opening line "i'm getting too old for this" through the "antics" of the firemen, to the "worrisome wife" the loss of his best friend in the firehouse, to the final funeral for the fallen brethren, this film looks and sounds like it was written by the marketing department at disney ("our studies show that audiences really like it when..." and then they stuck it in).<br /><br />there is nothing original here. any emotion we feel for these guys is brought in for our admiration and feelings for firemen. <br /><br />go watch rescue me if you want to see real heroes: everyday guys with flaws that think nothing of running into a burning building to save strangers.
