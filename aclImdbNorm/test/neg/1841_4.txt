have to disagree with people saying that this is a lousy horror film with good acting and camera-work - i'd say it's an okay horror flick ruined by shockingly abysmal acting and poor camera-work - watch 'ju-on : the grudge instead of wasting your time with this garbage. the principal idea behind the film is rather an original one, considering the abundance of killer-doll-based scare-fests which have been foist upon us over the years; unfortunately, the story is handled with all the subtlety of the latest michael bay actioner, with a cast of characters which are uniformly unlikable and played with precision-perfect dreadfulness by actors presumably sifted from daytime korean soap operas. it isn't scary and only succeeds in dampening your expectations of the next korean horror movie to come-a-calling. oh well.
