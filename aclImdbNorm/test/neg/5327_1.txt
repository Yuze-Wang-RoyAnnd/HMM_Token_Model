i thought i had seen this film before as the plot summary sounded familiar. however, when i watched it one afternoon (in need of some mindless-but-amusing entertainment), i didn't recognise anything - if i had seen it before, i must have blocked the horror of it from my memory.<br /><br />this film is dreadful, and it shows its age. in fact, it looks older than it is: more like a mid-80s moronic comedy. whilst i am a fan of toilet humour and can see the funny side of many things, this is "comedy" at its most puerile and homophobic. the plot is as thin as a supermodel, which wouldn't bother me if only the film were funny.<br /><br />there is only one amusing line in the whole film, spoken by the character louis: "looks like somebody threw away a perfectly good white boy!" in fact, louis is the only likable character (and that's not saying much). james and carl are the type of irritating, immature men that a sensible woman would run a mile from, their practical jokes about as humorous as the war in iraq; the character of susan wilkins is colourless (looks like julia roberts, but lacks her charisma) and there is zero chemistry between her and carl - though it may be unfair to blame the actress, as i don't know what she could have done with such a poorly written part; and the villain is neither funny nor scary nor memorable.<br /><br />there is good trash and bad trash. this is trash that definitely should not be recycled.
