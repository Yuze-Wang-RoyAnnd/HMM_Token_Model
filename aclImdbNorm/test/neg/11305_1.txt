i know it's rather unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the complete piece - but i am going to anyway! i waited for a laugh, i tried to give it time. i think 20 minutes is long enough to wait in a comedy for a laugh. my laugh never came, so i gave up.<br /><br />it's stupid humour, not so stupid that you have to laugh, though. it isn't anywhere near that high grade. let me correct that, it's just *stupid* - not stupid humour. they may have intended for certain scenes to be funny, but they weren't. i suppose, if you were really bored you could somehow blend the movie with a hallucination and end up with a mildly entertaining experience.<br /><br />a very pathetic effort.
