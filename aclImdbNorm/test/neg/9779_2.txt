i gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just just because i am a polite person. this movie made me loose 90 minutes of my life in which i could have done something useful for the human kind or just me. <br /><br />the dialog is poor, the actors never look scared! even if it's supposed to be a horror movie. for example the scene in which kurt collects the bones of his former colleague. he should be frightened, but he looks quite normal. the chick of the movie is such a clich'e. the one thing i liked about her is the dress she wore in the final scene.and, by the way, the end was extremely predictable with the cocoon blinking pinkly in the box. as a matter of fact, i was thinking more of an ant walking around on the back seat of the car. but it still didn't surprise me.
