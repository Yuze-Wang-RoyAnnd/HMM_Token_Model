the first twenty-five minutes stand out as possibly the worst in modern british film. director/adapter william cartlidge has treated wilde's original with such reverence that he seems to have completely ignored the needs of a cinematic audience. thankfully the quality of the direction and editing improves significantly after the first half hour, but by then the damage has been done. of the actors, prunella scales and robert hardy wipe the floor with the rest of the cast every time they are on screen. the other exceptions are jonathan firth's arthur and karen hayley's mabel, who are given enough latitude to deliver their lines with the true comic sense which wilde intended. the ostensible leads, james wilby and trevyn mcdowell, are in comparison lacklustre and wooden. in an obvious attempt to eke every penny out a meagre budget, the play has been nominally updated to the 1990's, but in conjunction with the original script the effect is more of a badly script 1970s tv drama. true moments of comedy are few and far between, but when they arrive are highly amusing - a sign, maybe, that more judicious pruning of the rest of the play might have led to a better paced, more even film.
