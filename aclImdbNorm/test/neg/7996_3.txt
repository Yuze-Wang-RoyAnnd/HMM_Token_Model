a combat veteran, fresh from completion of ninjutsu training, reunites with an old friend in manila and gets caught up in a power struggle with a ruthless land baron.<br /><br />but, do you really care about that? if you're even reading this page, you must know something of what to expect. it's your typical chop-socky, complete with ridiculous dialouge, mega-corny villains, apocalyptic sound editing, and a camera that begs for your attention. the only reason for being seen in public with this film is the fight sequences, wonderfully choreographed by mike stone and true master sho kosugi. franco nero ain't no slouch either, assuming you can see around the mustache.<br /><br />well, i'm being too harsh. there are some good laughs--enjoy christopher george repeatedly screaming "ninja!" and delivering arguably the goofiest death scene ever captured on film.
