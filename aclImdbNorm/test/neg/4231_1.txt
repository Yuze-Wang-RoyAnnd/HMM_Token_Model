the main character, pharaon, has suffered a loss of his wife and child in the pre-film past. he deals with with by just shutting down emotionally. too long a movie, too much time spent on pharaon's inexpressive face, too much "road time" (one of the banes of tv: filling time with moving cars, trains, etc.) long scenes of him doing trivial - sometimes totally inexplicable, nonsensically trivial - actions with neither reason or emotion. his best friends joseph and domino are not much more, their relationship based on sex (this film perhaps gives new meaning to the phrase "gratuitous sex"); domino and pharaon's mother are the two characters who display some emotion, but not much. it is hard to tell with all the characters in this movie: is it indifferent acting, indifferent writing, or simply indifferent characters portrayed by good writing and good acting. characters in this film talk very little to anyone; it's little wonder their emotionally isolated, which is all the more bizarre because it's clear they live in a neighborhood where the people are friendly and know each other.
