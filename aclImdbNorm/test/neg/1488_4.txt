like many western pennsylvania history buffs, i had been really looking forward to this much-heralded pbs program that was produced by pittsburgh's wqed. however, i must say now that i was somewhat disappointed. on the positive side, i believe that overall this film did a fair job of explaining the main issues and describing the events of the so-called french and indian war. in particular, its presentation of the indians' point of view was somewhat new and quite interesting, although it certainly was at time over-emphasized. also on the positive side, the blend of narrative and action scenes was well done and came across somewhat better than many of these typical documentaries made up of "experts" interviews and picture stills (a la ken burns). on the negative side, many of the battles did have a somewhat "staged" look and many important aspects of the war were overlooked. most of all i was very disappointed and frustrated by how little importance was given to forbes's successful campaign of 1758 against fort duquesne as compared to the earlier failures of 1754 by washington and 1755 by braddock. in particular, i was somewhat incredulous that there was no mention of colonel henry bouquet, the swiss mercenary in the british service who was most responsible for forbes' success. finally i could not believe the complete omission of the 1763 battle of bushy run that started as a re-run of braddock's defeat but ended up as the victory that decided the outcome of pontiac's war thanks to the wiles of the same colonel bouquet who certainly must rank as one of the most successful british commanders of this war.
