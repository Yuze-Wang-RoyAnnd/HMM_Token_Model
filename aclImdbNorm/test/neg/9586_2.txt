if you live in the suburbs, are relatively well off financially, and do not really have much contact with the city life of england, then this is the comedy for you. not something a mass audience would go for, but if you're like these characters they show you'll love it to pieces. overall this is a comedy that the snobs at the bbc will sit back and laugh at for their pleasure and only a select few of the publics. comparing it to bbc comedys like only fools and horses, fawlty towers, black adder, and other classics, this series tends to drift away from the bbc's regular product to the audience and deliver to somewhat of a folk culture.
