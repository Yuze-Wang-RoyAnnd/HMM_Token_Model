talk about false advertising! i wasted an hour and twenty five minutes watching this piece of crap and there was not one leisure suit, not one platform shoe, no pointy-finger dancing, and not a single disco ball. i watched it on a saturday night, and ended up with an awful fever, but it had nothing to do with the music.<br /><br />seriously, with or without john travolta, this movie sucked.<br /><br />from the opening scene, you will be asking yourself the question, "where did that rope come from, and will it please hang me, too?" from its unabashed bias against the driving abilities of the pennsylvania dutch, to the shameless promotion of the apparently everlasting capacities of alienware laptop batteries, to the cheap horror effects lifted directly from japanese cinema, this is the worst film to hit theaters since the grudge.
