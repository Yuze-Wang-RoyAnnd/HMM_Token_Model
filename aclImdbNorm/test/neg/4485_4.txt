i was talked into seeing this by a girlfriend..john was a good guy, sweet, sensitive and looks great with no shirt on!! i thought it was a love story about both of them but it was mainly about his reactions to her letters. savannah was a likable character at the start of the movie but once she dumped him i lost respect for her. she said it tore her apart being away from him and it was hard - he was the one a million miles away, he was killing people and the only contact he got was through her letters!!! she didn't have it hard, she had family & money and he had a tour of duty!! i was so frustrated at the ending when he forgave her - he was too much of a sweetheart. i would have waited the 3 years and welcomed him home with open arms.
