man, did this film stink! it's obvious this film helped spurn hollywood's need to churn out tired sequels to appeal to the masses. first of all, it came out too quickly, and second of all, it just didn't have the same hipness which made the original film so successful. no new ground was broken, and it turned into a rather mundane effort.
