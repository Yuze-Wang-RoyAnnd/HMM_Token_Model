predictable, gory, over-gimmicky, mediocre. don't waste your time - there are many much better movies out there. <br /><br />resurrection starts out ok but the plot quickly becomes repetitive. my interest level fell off steadily. by the end of the movie i was just glad it was finally over. the characters never fully developed. the cinematography is muddy and the quick change pov rotations - while impressive in 1999 perhaps, presently merely serve to label the movie as attempting to substitute gee whiz flash for plot and character substance. the film shooting gimmicks serve some purpose (convey tension and anxiety) but are constantly overused and ultimately become counterproductive. a shame overall - the film/story obviously had potential and the producers/directors and actors obviously have technical skill. a disappointment.
