basically the first two critters movie were already silly ones but in a good and entertaining way. this movie is way more of a b-movie, that is silly but for all of the wrong reasons.<br /><br />this is the first sequel that doesn't really follows the plot of the first two movies. basically all of the characters are new and there are no bounty hunters this time (well, as good as none, since the bounty hunter in this movie shows up far too late) and the budget for this one obviously went down again. to save even more costs, the movie got shot back-to-back with part 4, which i imaging will be just as bad, since it directly follows this movie and got made by the same people involved as with this one.<br /><br />it's just a typical b-genre movie, that doesn't really have any originality in it or brings entertainment. it makes "critters 3" a real redundant sequel, you can easily do without. granted that things could had been way worse for this movie but it just ain't exactly a good one either. the movie just falls flat as a science-fiction/horror/comedy.<br /><br />also kind of strange to notice how the critters has suddenly changed in this one. they are about double their usual size this time, without giving an explanation for that and they are even more gremlins like in this movie than was the case in the previous one.<br /><br />the movie is only made interesting because this was the feature film debut of leonardo dicaprio. he was about 17 in this movie and of course looking baby-faced like he still does now. i like watching this well known actors in their early roles. it's fun to see how they act and if their style has improved and changed over the years. of course dicaprio got only better but he already was kind of delivering his lines in the same way as he does these days.<br /><br />really a too silly and lame movie.<br /><br />4/10
