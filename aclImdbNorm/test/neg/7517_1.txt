this movie is a disgrace. how can you take one of the greatest science fiction stories of all time and turn it into some kind of half-assed love story. the entire beginning of the movie was not in the h.g. wells story and didn't need to be. also the eloi were done completely wrong. they did build houses or form any kind of real society. they didn't care about each other at all. that was an important part of the story. the way they had formed a world that was without hardship or complex emotions. they were barely even aware of the morlocks. i don't know why this movie was made the way it was but some stories should be told as they are or left alone.
