as a spanish tourist in los angeles and a fanatic movie lover i committed a terrible mistake. i went to see "the women" the remake of one of my all time favorites. i've seen the original many many times, in fact i own it. my rushing to see the remake was based on diane english, the woman responsible for "murphy brown" my though was: how bad can it be? she must know what she's doing. well, i don't know what to say. i don't understand what happened. the botoxed women is a rather depressing affair. meg ryan or whoever played mary - she looked a bit like a grotesque version of meg ryan...another actress perhaps wearing a meg ryan mask - she doesn't bring to the character nothing of what norma shearer did in 1939. the new one is a tired, unconvincing prototype of what has become a farce within a farce. the "friends" annette bening, debra messing, jada pinket smith are as disconnected as anything i've ever seen and if this wasn't enough: eva mendes as crystal, the character created by joan crawford in one of her best and funniest performances. eva mendes's casting is really the poster sign for how wrong, how ill conceived this commercial attempt turned up. i didn't give it a 1 out respect for candice bergen and cloris leachman
