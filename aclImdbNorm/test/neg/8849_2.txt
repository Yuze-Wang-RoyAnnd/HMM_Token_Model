i can appreciate movies with subtitles from foreign countries and specially the ones in which the subtitles are weak and don't really seems to follow the story or really make sense, but this movie had too many parts that didn't really make sense.<br /><br />all in all, i can admit to a few scary and freaky parts, but they are repetitive, i felt like i was watching a loop trailer; seems like it was a short film shot with different actors.<br /><br />in the veins of ringu and grudge but not even close the the hype...the excessive length killed the thrill.<br /><br />unless you are a die hard fan of these types of movies (wich i thought i was), don't waste your time on this one.
