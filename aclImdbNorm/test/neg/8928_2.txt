star rating: ***** jodie marsh **** michelle marsh *** kym marsh ** rodney marsh * hackney marsh <br /><br />harlan banks (steven seagal- not quite as bad an actor as kevin costner but.......aaaaahhhh, you get it) is a modern day robin hood (listen close, you can hear brian adams music playing in the background...no, not really), the kind of guy who steals ill-gotten blood money from drug dealers and uses it to keep run-down orphanages open. but now he's been approached to drive a getaway van in a heist from las vegas in one of those last things before retirement type jobs. but, of course, it all goes wrong and he winds up the patsy for the big guys at the top and in jail. here he meets a guy named (although you wouldn't know it from paying attention to the movie) ice cool (treach), who he forms a friendship with and ends up breaking out of jail with. once free, he's out to prove his innocence, locate the missing money and, naturally, get even with those who framed him!<br /><br />of all seagal's recent straight to video films, today you die has that look about it most of all that it belongs in a cinema, even with a rap star as his co-star like his previous cinema films half past dead and exit wounds. yes, it seems when he's not making films about looking after the environment he's pretending to be black and co-starring with rappers. but tyd is not a cinema film and that's a luxury the great one is never going to be enjoying again until under siege 3 materializes (if ever!) <br /><br />the film opens with a slick, polished look that commands attention but it all quickly goes down hill from there. once seagal hits prison, the plot quickly loses it's coherence. indeed treach's character just seems to pop up out of nowhere without any introduction as his sidekick and from there you quickly lose interest in it.<br /><br />that's it. i know i've said it before but i think i mean it this time. i don't think i'm going to be giving any more of these straight to video seagal films any time. i honestly have no enthusiasm to watching shadow man at all. in fact, i can honestly say that i've not really enjoyed any of his stv films up to this point, and today you die is certainly no exception, an apathetic, boring effort all round best avoided by all. *
