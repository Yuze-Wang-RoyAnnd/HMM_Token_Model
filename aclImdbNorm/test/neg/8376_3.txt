let me start by saying i don't recall laughing once during this comedy. from the opening scene, our protagonist solo (giovanni ribisi) shows himself to be a self-absorbed, feeble, and neurotic loser completely unable to cope with the smallest responsibilities such as balancing a checkbook, keeping his word, or forming a coherent thought. i guess we're supposed to be drawn to his fragile vulnerability and cheer him on through the process of clawing his way out of a deep depression. i guess we're supposed to sympathize as he stumbles through a series of misadventures seemingly triggered by his purchase of a dog, but in reality brought on by his own contemptible nature. i didn't get the slightest hint at any point that solo ever possessed any redeeming character, which became disturbingly apparent when he failed to feed his dog for a few days. no spark of humanity or glimmer of conscience gave me hope that he would ever realize his life is so utterly miserable because he's a self- absorbed, self-pitying lowlife. i didn't develop any connection with this character. he didn't seem to care, and so neither did i. i actually wanted him to get his kneecaps busted at one point.<br /><br />the dog was not a character in the film. it was simply a prop to be used, neglected, scorned, abused, coveted and disposed of on a whim. so be warned. even though "dog" is in the title, this film is not a romantic comedy for dog lovers.<br /><br />scott caan's role is amusing and believable as the oversexed best friend/cad. don cheadle is sincere and magnetic - i always want to see more of him on screen. mena suvari was delightfully repellent. lynn collins role of a "stripper with a heart" was well acted, but the character was simultaneously absurd and clich'ed, not to mention there was zero chemistry between her and ribisi.<br /><br />romantic? hardly. comedy? if you say so.
