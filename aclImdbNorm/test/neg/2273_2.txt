oh yes, i have to agree with the others who describe this as appalling. the acting in this four hour feature is uniformly bad, so bad to the point that i find it impossible to believe any of the actors in this production could possibly earn a living as an actor. i still wonder who did the casting. each delivers their lines without appearing to have any kind of engagement or emotional investment with any other character. none appear to have a true relationship, family or otherwise, with another. the direction is also appalling and any action scene is laughable and unconvincing. were the film editors asleep?<br /><br />the costumes appear authentic to the regency period but the fabrics look 20th century and colors (especially the blue colors!) are jarring and i don't believe were available in early 19th century fabric except perhaps in silk. <br /><br />also the hair: the men have obvious 1970s haircuts, and the women have "big hair"---especially the woman playing anne elliot.<br /><br />all the female characters, young and old, are quite lovely but this doesn't make up for the lack of acting abilities. the actress playing "anne" looks as though she is in her forties while anne elliot is supposed to be 27 years old. i mean, where was the makeup and lighting crew if we were to find the woman playing anne believable? she spends much of her time gazing pensively with her eyes at the level of the horizon whether indoors or out. i wonder still what that was suppose to convey. regret perhaps? yes, this production is regrettable!<br /><br />the actress playing louisa was truly appalling. she screams, squeals, giggles, and leaps around like an ill mannered twelve-year-old (my apologies to anyone twelve years of age reading this) that i found myself eagerly awaiting the moment when she knocks herself out. how this behavior is suppose to attract an adult male is beyond me. most would back off when she first opened her mouth to giggle and shriek.<br /><br />the actor playing captain wentworth portrays someone so bland and colorless one wonders why any woman could pine over him for eight years.<br /><br />the rejoining of the pair at the end is not convincingly done or explained. how did they get together again? not because louisa was in a coma; that is certain. no, there has to be more than that and it is not explained in the film. <br /><br />i rate this production two stars: one because it is austens' work, and the other because some of the outdoor scenes were lovely. the only reason i could watch the entire production is that i was off sick with the flu and i got it from the library. <br /><br />if you enjoyed the book see the 1995 version with amanda root and ciaran hinds. i would recommend this film even if you have't read the book.
