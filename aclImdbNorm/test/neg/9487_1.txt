i have seen this movie and i did not care for this movie anyhow. i would not think about going to paris because i do not like this country and its national capital. i do not like to learn french anyhow because i do not understand their language. why would i go to france when i rather go to germany or the united kingdom? germany and the united kingdom are the nations i tolerate. apparently the olsen twins do not understand the french language just like me. therefore i will not bother the france trip no matter what. i might as well stick to the united kingdom and meet single women and play video games if there is a video arcade. that is all.
