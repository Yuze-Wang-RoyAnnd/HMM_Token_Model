i went to see this movie at the theater and paid money thinking it would be at least mildly entertaining. the only thing i enjoyed about it was when robin williams crashes into the car at the bottom of the hill, and the end, when he seems to get killed. glenn close was obnoxious, and she obviously did not seem old enough to be garp's mother. a mother like garp's would have had her kids taken away by the department of children and families. <br /><br />robin williams and his glazed donut look of benign goodness is just too sweet and smarmy for me. he has two roles he can play: funny person or sad, tragic, good-hearted victim. see the fisher king, good morning vietnam, and all of his so-called "dramatic" roles. it is always the same performance. put them all together into one long mini-series. glenn close is always a cold fish. remember fatal attraction? would you have an affair with her even on your worst day and if you were single? did you feel any sparks between her and michael douglas?? have you ever seen glenn close warm up any screen?? john lithgow had the only interesting role. this was back in the day when he used to play serial killers and bad guys, so seeing him as a transsexual was at least funny. garp is made for all those people who love to see movies about sick, abnormal, dysfunctional people and then claim it is beautiful and profound.
