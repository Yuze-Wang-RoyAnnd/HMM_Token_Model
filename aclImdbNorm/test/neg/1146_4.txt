i just watched national lampoon's christmas vacation 2 on dvd, hoping to see something at least close to the original, great holiday comedy, 'christmas vacation'. i saw nothing of the kind. you can tell right from the start that this movie just wasn't going to measure up. it's too bad it has a title that links it to the original christmas vacation. it's really kind of sad. the film can't stand on it's own merits. i think too many people will view this film on the strength of the title and it does not come close to that level of comedy. other than the title, there is very little connecting the movie to the original 'christmas vacation' and even less of a connection to christmas at all. the comedy is very simplistic and the plot poor. children might find some humor here but most adults would only get a chuckle here and there. this movie is a flop. don't waste your time with it.
