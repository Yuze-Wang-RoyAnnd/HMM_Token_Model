spoilers<br /><br />*<br /><br />*<br /><br />*<br /><br />*<br /><br />this is tenchi?<br /><br />this is not tenchi.<br /><br />practically everyone is written horribly out of character ... when it comes to characterization, the only bright spot is the friendship between ayeka and ryoko.<br /><br />also, the villainess is not punished for her actions, which amount to mind-control rape. if a male villain had done to one of the women what haruna does to tenchi, then he would have (rightfully so) painfully bought it at the end of the movie, dying horribly, and the audience would have cheered. but not only does haruna pay no price for her crimes, ryoko actually forgives and understands her actions. no! the real ryoko would have disintegrated her for what haruna had done to her beloved tenchi; the audience i saw this with, myself included, all booed audibly at this scene<br /><br />anime fans, avoid this movie. tenchi fans, avoid this movie even harder.
