astounding that something like this could find its way to be viewed by the public. i knew it was by uwe boll, & i found it in the bargain bin at a store for $2 (still pretty steep, considering) but morbid curiosity led me to view this, and: <br /><br />1). i am fairly sure this is a rip-off of seven, silence of the lambs, and american psycho, all rolled into one, with dialog that may have been written by preteens.<br /><br />2). casper van dien plays the main character, and he's so absolutely bizarre and creepy that just about anyone would know he must be the crazed serial killer.<br /><br />3). jennifer rubin plays the "good cop" that invites a serial killer to her apartment for a home cooked dinner, and what does she get for her trouble? i'll let you guess.<br /><br />4). michael pare plays an "intense" cop, who drives a vw bug, new-style, that is, with a siren on it. a vw bug...that'll strike fear into criminal's hearts when they see that coming.<br /><br />5). van dien breaks up with his fianc'e, but she still has an "not engaged" party, complete with "not a wedding cake". imagine everyone's surprise he shows up (he was, of course, invited) and they all get shot.<br /><br />6). actually, this should have been #1, really. the killer in this is known as "the monkey maker". this is, without a doubt, the stupidest killer name anyone could have come up with in a million years. presumably it has something to do with the "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil" saying, complete with monkeys. it's possible that monkeys had something to do with the script, too.<br /><br />7). oh yeah, and there's a club that van dien visits near the beginning of the film. there's bad disco music, i mean, really bad, and a chain-link fenced cage with, uh, gang members beating the crap out of each other with baseball bats? that's what it looked like. and of course, this is only the tip of the iceberg, the really cool stuff (?!) goes on in the basement, where some questionable "actor" talks some woman into signing a confession before she gets shot, this being, i guess, a snuff movie? not quite sure how this fits in with the rest of the film, and boll probably wasn't either, so if he wasn't worried, then i won't worry.<br /><br />an incredible piece of non-entertainment that will make you feel like you're watching something from a parallel universe. a parallel universe that's kind of like ours, but where things are just enough off where they don't seem right. you have entered "the boll zone". exit as quickly as possible, & don't look back.<br /><br />2 out of 10.
