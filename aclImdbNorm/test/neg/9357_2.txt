i was sorely disappointed in this movie. twice i was temped to walk out because segments of the movie were so demoralizing and depressing. the movie has elements that allude to all the seamy things in life (pornography, murder, suicide, fornication, hatred, gang warfare). the graphic nature of the violence in this movie was particularly disturbing.<br /><br />and richard dutcher does a great disservice to the lds church in portraying missionary attitudes, commitment, spirituality, and obedience as unfocused and lackadaisical.<br /><br />my biggest objection to this movie, however, was that it is the exact opposite of a feel-good movie.<br /><br />dutcher's god's army one was okay. his brigham city was quite good. this movie, in terms of casting, acting, and drama was his best. but in terms of being inspiring or uplifting it was as awful as it could be. in fact, this movie so demoralized me that i am sorry i went. i have lost interest in ever again supporting dutcher in an lds-themed movie with a ticket purchase.
