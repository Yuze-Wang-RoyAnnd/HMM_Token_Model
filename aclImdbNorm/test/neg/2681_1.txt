taste is a subjective thing. two people can watch the same movie with one of them loving it and the other one hating it. as it concerns 'halloween:the curse of michael myers' i fall into the latter category.<br /><br />i'm of the opinion that john carpenter, in 1978, made one of that decade's finest fright films, which despite its flaws, still holds up well into the 21st century. it reused many of the old horror film devices but utilized them in original and effective ways. it had no pretensions that it was anything other than a movie about an escaped mental patient stalking babysitters on halloween night. and yet there were 'ideas' in the film but they were subtly introduced and not hammered into your skull. it juxtaposed the myths of the macabre festival with the reality of what was taking place in the story and it did this with a wonderful ambiguity. <br /><br />the 'filmmakers' of this 'film' probably wouldn't even understand that previous paragraph. that's why we're saddled us with this miserable and inept piece of disposable celluloid. direction, script, acting are of the lowest strata imaginable. this is the type of film that is so mind numbingly dull and nausea inducing as to make you want to crawl back into the womb and die. it is also truly, truly sad to see veteran british actor donald pleasence wasting his acting abilities with this saliva puddle of a movie. he seems drained of all his energy and resigned to the fact that this may be his last film. maybe that's what killed him.
