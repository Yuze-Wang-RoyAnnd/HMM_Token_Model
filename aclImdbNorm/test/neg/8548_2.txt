you belong to me (1941) is a example of the 'screwball comedy' which started in the mid 1930s and ended postwar (wwii). some of these films maintained their status. others have earned undeserved praise when originally were critical and box office flops. like bringing up baby (1938) or mr. & mrs. smith (1941). then there is this one which value just keeps sinking.<br /><br />why can be rooted in the screenplay/story. it strains credibility from the get go, betraying a superior cast. barbara stanwyck is married to millionaire henry fonda who is insanely jealous. he would be content to sit back with his million$ and love her, she wishes to maintain her profession as a doctor. she wants him to become in what her eyes is a useful member of society. this conflict is supposed to amuse us. it cannot be salvaged by either the principals or the supporting cast.<br /><br />the faults in this scenario can clearly be laid at the feet of dalton trumbo. henry fondas' character is written in such broad strokes that any viewer has a instant dislike for him. barbara stanwyck just has nothing to do but react to each idiotic situation of jealousy. trumbo must have been spending to much time outside the studio being a "useful idiot" then being on the job. columbia obviously did not get their moneys worth from him, maybe robert riskin should taken over.
