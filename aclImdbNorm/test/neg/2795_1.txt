may contain spoilers. this movie was the worst movie ever. i couldn't even watch it all it was so bad. this film is actually worse than scarecrow slayer which is saying a whole lot. this was worse than terror toons which at least terror toons was funny at times. not even the gore in the film was good. the shootings were fake and the acting was worse. please do yourself a favor and skip this one. if you see it at the rental store then run the other way. there is nothing good about this film at all. if you want to see a good scarecrow movie then watch night of the scarecrow or pumpkin head. if you want to see an ok new cheesy movie then watch scarecrow. i rate this movie a 0.2 out of 10. that's how horrible this film really is. the worst movie ever.
