am not from america, i usually watch this show on axn channel, i don't know why this respected channel air such sucking program in prime time slot. creation of hollywood's money bank jerry bruckheimer, this time he is spending a big load of cash in the small screen. in each episode a bunch of peoples having two team members travels from on country to another for a great sum of money; where the camera crews shoot their travels. i don't know who the hell gave this stupid idea for the show. it has nothing to watch for, in all episodes we see people ran like beggars, some times shouting, crying, beeping, jerky camera works..huh it's harmful to both eyes and ears. the most disgusting part in the race is the viewers finally knows each of the team members can't enjoy their race/traveling experience. even though, to add up the ratings the producers came up with the ideas of including gays in one shows, sucking american reality show.<br /><br />it's nothing to watch for, better switch to another channels.<br /><br />the amazing race = the disgusting show.
