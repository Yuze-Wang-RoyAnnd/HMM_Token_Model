i've had never been disappointed by a kurosawa film, but this is probably the first. "doppelganger" is the worst i've seen from this director.<br /><br />tartan films is advertising this as "the most frightening film yet from kiyoshi kurosawa". what? the most frightening film from kurosawa is definitely "kairo". and if you think this is horror, your in for a surprise. this can't be classified as horror, or thriller. this is a drama, and a pretty bad one at that. a lot of scenes that were meant to be shocking have turned out being funny, and a lot of the plot is really confusing. and since it's kurosawa, the pacing is slow. but it's so slow that you'll lose interest forty minutes in, and feel like doing something else. the thing that annoyed me the most was the use of cgi. now cgi, if used well, can be really cool. but if executed with little care... it can be a disaster. i think that describes one scene here that has a very minimal use of cgi.<br /><br />the only positive thing i can give "dopppelganger" is that it has really good acting. koji yakusho gives a great performance, along with the rest of the cast. but that's pretty much it...<br /><br />please, do yourself a favor, and go watch "kairo" or "ko-rei" if you want to be scared. this is a bad, bad attempt at a smart drama. which it is intelligent, but... well, there's a lot missing.<br /><br />3/10 for the good acting.
