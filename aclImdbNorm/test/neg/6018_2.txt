mockumentaries are proliferating lately so much that the approach therefore needs an injection of fresh and creative material each time it's used to maintain its vitality. this film does not deliver anything but worn out retreads of similar stories, an aimless script, weak ad-libs, uninspired acting, and unfunny self-gratifying humor. <br /><br />the premise would seem promising enough; the legend of the loch ness monster is made to order for one of these goofy mockumentary misadventures, with a vast array of history and legend waiting to be tapped for outrageous satire. the film makers totally waste this enormous potential, however. we get some fool inserting a fake nessie into the water. gee, that's original. another scene has one obnoxious idiot threatening another obnoxious idiot with a gun. sidesplitting. some gratuitous shots of a pretty girl in a bikini. annette did that 40 years ago (and far better, by the way). throughout the movie, somebody always seems to be yelling: i suppose this is designed to wake up the audience who have nodded off by this point.<br /><br />worst of all, though, is the relentless salvo of those reality show type "interview comments" made by the characters. not only do they nuke you with this tired joke every five seconds, but apparently, the actors also improvised; that's the only explanation for how humorless the jokes are. if lines like, "i've never seen anyone write a book about non-evidence" were actually scripted, then the writer should be shot on sight and fed to nessie.<br /><br />no wonder nessie got violent; it obviously saw this movie.
