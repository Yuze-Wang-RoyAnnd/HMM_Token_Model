one of my favorite "bum" actors, c. tom howell, stars in this tepid remake of wotw. he runs around a lot, while a cgi-generated spider-like machine goes around killing everyone. the budget for this one obviously was pretty low. it also was one of the asylum productions. have you seen any of those? yikes! i am not sure why anyone would have made this while the big-budget spielberg version was slaying them at the box office. and if truth be told, neither version is all that hot. the george pal version from the 1950s remains the best representation of the h.g. wells novel, primitive special effects and all. perhaps because gene barry was much more convincing in the lead than howell or tom cruise.
