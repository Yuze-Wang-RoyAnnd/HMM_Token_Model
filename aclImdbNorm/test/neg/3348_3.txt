some guy named karl rhamarevich learns how to live on even after death through telekinesis. he's interred in a mausoleum. that same night julie (meg tilly) has to spend the night there to get into a group called "the sisters". and karl's "power" is in full bloom.<br /><br />silly movie. i saw it in a theatre when i was 21 and was generally bored. the pg rating should have tipped me off--this is a horror movie for kids. one real stupid scene at the end has a corpse breaking through concrete to hit a young guy! for starters corpses are put in head first making it impossible for the corpse to use his arms and there's no way anybody is going to break through concrete. when you're noticing silly mistakes like that, the movie is not doing its job.<br /><br />it has two good scenes--two of "the sisters" are "attacked" by floating corpses crowding them in. at one point one of the sisters punches a corpse in the stomach--her hand goes in the body and she can't pull it out! that scene has stayed with me every since. and there's a cute little bit involving a corpse and a toothbrush at the end (which had my audience laughing). but the rest of the movie is a dim, dull memory. for kids only--adults will be bored. i give it a 3.
