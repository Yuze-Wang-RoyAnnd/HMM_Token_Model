i found the first 90 minutes of this film to be very interesting, even though a few parts of it were ridiculous (i.e.. philip seymour hoffman's character). the last 60 minutes were distasteful and i began to lose interest in the film. the last hour lasted forever, it seemed.<br /><br />the movie is nicely acted and i can see why rene zellweger won an academy award since her character was so interesting. the movie also is beautifully filmed and the story is an emotional one. however, i found the message to be a bad one: not surprising these days in hollywood. in this story, "inman" (jude law) deserts the confederate army during the civil war. his reason: his girlfriend misses him and wants him home. he's also getting disillusioned with war. (can you imagine if every soldier who was in a similar boat deserted the army in the two world wars??!)<br /><br />yet, in this film of course, all of that is perfectly acceptable. then again, what liberal filmmaker has ever had a nice thing to say about the u.s. military?? to add to their left-wing slant, they portray a vigilante-like posse going after deserters as cold-blooded sick killers. well, in the world of films, as we know: good is portrayed as bad and bad is good.....and only liberals would portray deserters as heroes.
