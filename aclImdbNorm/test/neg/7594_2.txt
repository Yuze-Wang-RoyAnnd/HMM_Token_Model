new year's day. the day after consuming a few too many vodka martinis and cosmopolitans mixed with a bunch of bubbly at midnight, my wife and i discovered the local cable company is offering up the digital specialty channels for free for the month of january. we had a choice - do we make use of the freebie channels or do we start watching the eight seasons of x-files on dvd that we received from our daughter for christmas?<br /><br />we elected for the digital freebie since the dvds are going nowhere and we need something like ten twelve-hour days to watch all the x-files beginning to end. the drive-in channel was offering a horror classic three movie marathon: asylum (1972), house of the damned (1996) and the pit and the pendulum (1961). asylum is well-reviewed here and the pit and the pendulum was on too late for us to watch which meant we could really only be properly critical for house of the damned.<br /><br />to be honest, we tried to be serious about the movie since its stars have reasonably good acting credentials - greg evigan (william shatner's over-written tekwars) and alexandra paul (the only baywatch babe who could act although she has the body of a ten-year-old boy). unfortunately, we soon dissolved to giggles, under the influence of a little hair-of-the-dog, as we each shouted out the names of movies from which this dog borrowed its scenes: poltergeist, the shining, hell house, house on haunted hill, ghost busters!<br /><br />the acting, especially by evigan's real-life daughter, wasn't too bad considering the silly script they had to work with. the cgi, for 1996, was hilarious - at its worst point in the final scene when it should have been the most horrific it was so bad my wife and i dissolved in laughter.<br /><br />overall: acting 4/5, script 2/5, sfx 0/5
