viewers of independent films know that once or twice a year they are going to see stories about dysfunctional families and they have come to expect them and it's becoming more of a challenge to keep them fresh but here despite the good cast it just seems more of the same. story is about the travis family who is trying to recover from the suicide of matt (kip pardue) who was a very promising high school swimmer. ben (jeff daniels) is the father who withdraws from everyone and has never treated his other son tim (emile hirsch) as well as matt but he does communicate (of some sort) to his mother sandy (sigourney weaver) who finds his stash of pot and starts to smoke it.<br /><br />*****spoiler alert***** sandy also starts to flirt with much younger men like the check-out cashier at the grocery store but when she attempts to buy more marijuana she gets busted and hauled off to jail. she doesn't tell anyone what happened but she does discover bruises on tim's body and also that ben has taken a leave of absence from work. after all this happens sandy falls ill and lands in the hospital where her life is in danger which forces ben to realize that he may have to come to terms with losing another part of his family.<br /><br />this film is written and directed by dan harris who has worked with bryan singer on "x2" and also the upcoming superman film and while his script allows these characters to have genuine moments of expressing their pain and confusion the story (for me) just has too many things thrown in. the script touches on so many different areas that you need a scorecard to keep track of them all including drugs, sex, love, infidelity, abuse, neglect, experimentation with homosexuality, and a life threatening illness. if all those scenarios weren't enough for you harris then tacks on a plot twist at the end that's supposed to sum up and explain most of everyone's feelings towards tim. while i did roll my eyes at least 2 or 3 times with the way the script kept unrolling one thing after another i must admit that i didn't hate this film and i have to credit the actors for that. everyone has at least one good scene somewhere in the film but i wish the story would have concentrated more on weaver and her character than hirsch. weaver is exceptional and with a sharper script she could have had a role that maybe would have led to an oscar nomination but instead we get endless scenes of hirsch at parties or his shenanigans with the neighbor next door. harris shows he can be a good writer/director but with this effort he just throws so many different things at the audience that the material just becomes labored and contrived.
