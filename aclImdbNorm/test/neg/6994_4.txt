this harold lloyd short wasn't really much; not one of his funnier efforts. of course, i never see bratty kids as anything hilarious. that's what the bulk of this story is, harold and his wife, mildred davis, babysitting his in-laws two young kids. one is a baby who is constantly crying and the other is a four-year-old terror who does everything but demolish the house. letting the kid create havoc over and over was not entertaining to me.<br /><br />the best part was the last four or five minutes when the couple thinks that this big goon (noah young) is burglarizing their house. half the time it's the pet cat scaring the couple, but overall, that segment is fun with some good sight gags, reminding me of another lloyd short, "haunted spooks."<br /><br />however, the good ending doesn't save the whole picture, which i probably wouldn't watch again. lloyd has done too many other good things to waste even 25 minutes on this one again. it just isn't that funny.
