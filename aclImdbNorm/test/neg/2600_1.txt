words cannot describe how asinine, juvenile,and repetitive this steaming pile of a series is. it relies on 3 things: 1. constant 80s pop culture references 2. the tired "stretch out a joke to the point of awkwardness" bit, and 3. at least 3 or 4 pointless flashbacks per episode. the only reason i can see for this crap fest being as popular as it is for the constant pop culture references which i suppose elicit an "omg lol that's from superfriends!! that is so totally ironic, and i am so edgy and smart for getting it!!" response from the viewer. the writing is beyond lazy, and panders to its viewers, mostly in their 20s and 30s. plus there's the character design, which seems to consist of the same three characters with the same bored expressions drawn over and over again, but with different skin colors and maybe a different hairline occasionally. insulting crap.
