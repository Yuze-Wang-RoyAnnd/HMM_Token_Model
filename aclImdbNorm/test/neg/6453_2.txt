i tried to like this movie. i love kevin spacey and i knew the other guy from his role as "big brain on" brad in pulp fiction. but i just didn't care about the characters at all. kevin spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him, i didn't like him. especially the ending---that made me hate him even more. this was like watching a bad car wreck. spacey played a prick well (he does it all well), but other than that, i don't recommend it.
