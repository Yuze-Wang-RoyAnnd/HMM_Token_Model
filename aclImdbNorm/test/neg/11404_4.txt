from 2002 on dutch cinema finally got better again. this movie is still part- and a schoolbook example of the bad period of dutch cinema.<br /><br />the story is needlessly told in flashback style. all of the 'present' sequences set in france are completely redundant and add nothing to the story, emotions or power. for some reason european filmmakers often find it necessary to tell the story not chronological. i never understood why, or what the appeal of it is.<br /><br />the story self also isn't exactly the greatest. it isn't always clear were the movie is trying to go to and what it tries to tell. the story of a young unexperienced boy falling in love with a wild young girl, who later turns out to be quite psychotic might sound good enough on paper and even shows some parallels to paul verhoeven's "turks fruit", to which this movie often was compared to before and at the time of its release. however the end result is far from comparable. the story fails to capture the right emotions, which is also due to the unimaginative performances from the actors. the way the story is told also makes the movie far from always interesting or compelling. i lost interest for this movie at about 40 minutes through the movie.<br /><br />at the time this movie was made, both antonie kamerling and angela schijf were promising rising stars, with great potential and ambitions but both their careers have pretty much dried up by now. angela schijf seems to give her family more attention than her career (that is not a bad thing of course), while antonie kamerling tried to start a career in hollywood. he never got any further than playing some small bit parts in 2 renny harlin flops. to be honest i'm not surprised. it's not that he is a bad actor and he certainly has got the right looks but his english just isn't good enough, to put it mildly. just listen to him speaking english in the beginning of this movie and you'll understand what i mean. they are really not bad actors but for some reason it doesn't show in this movie. it's probably also due to the poor dialog. i still kind of liked beau van erven dorens. he's been criticized a lot but his acting seems very natural. he always keeps the characters close to who he self is.<br /><br />it by no means is one of the worst movies ever made but it's not exactly one i would recommend either. bad and uninteresting storytelling makes this a bad movie.<br /><br />4/10
