this film is definitely up there with the worst films i've ever seen, probably in my top 5 of worst films. i laughed once and that was when:<br /><br />evan: "im building something" evan's secretary: "i hope its a barber shop"<br /><br />that was literally the only time i laughed in this 'comedy', awful compared to bruce almighty which as a big jim carrey fan...wasn't even that great! <br /><br />this movie lacked the humour of having god's powers and was more about family bonding. id class it solely as a family movie, definitely not a family comedy. <br /><br />seeing a bird poo on someone's shirt is not hilarious, neither is a beard that grows back instant!<br /><br />i didn't even think the special effects were great, the animals looked really stuck on, it was like watching a film which hadn't been 'glued' together properly<br /><br />2/10 film - avoid!
