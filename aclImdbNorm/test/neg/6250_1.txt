before i start, i need to inform you that i love horror films with a passion. love them! i have seen thousands and rarely does one come along that i do not like. i am very forgiving of the horror genre. one of the greatest lines in movie history is in the film "ed wood" where ed wood (johnny depp) freaks out and yells at the overly critical producers after they comment on "plan 9's" cheap sets and continuity problems, "you don't know anything! haven't you ever heard of 'suspension of disbelief?!'" well, i try to bring that "suspension of disbelief" philosophy with me to every horror film i see and it usually works. unfortunately, it didn't work for me during the screening of cheerleader massacre.<br /><br />strike one:<br /><br />the first thing you'll notice about this "film" is that it is shot on video and has that crummy hand-held-home-digital-camera style. the camera work and quality are so bad it makes daytime soaps look breathtaking in comparison. in fact, it makes troma and full moon video releases look good. and, that's bad.<br /><br />strike two:<br /><br />jim wynorski. this "filmmaker" probably fancies himself a chip off the ol' corman, but nothing could be further from the truth. roger corman shot fast, furious and under budget, but was able to deliver a tight original film. though wynorski delivers a cheap film, he cheats his viewers (and perhaps other artists) as he steals entire pieces of james horner's "humanoids from the deep" and "battle beyond the stars" musical scores and inappropriately drops them into cheerleader massacre. on the back of the box art and during the beginning credits the music score is falsely attributed to, dan savio (an extra in wynorski's "deathstalker ii"). you will also notice how cheerleader massacre jumps from video to film and back again as wynorski lifts entire scenes from both "slumber party massacre" and "humanoids from the deep." wynorski utilized this deception, fourteen years earlier, in his horrible version of "not of this earth."<br /><br />strike three (you're out):<br /><br />while cheerleader massacre does have some nudity, (40-year-olds playing teenagers and the grossest set of fake breasts that i have ever seen in a horror film, ugh), the murders are relatively bloodless. what the heck is that all about? the film is titled, cheerleader massacre, but a handful of off-screen killings, in my opinion, does not add up to a massacre. it doesn't even add up to a bad mosquito bite.<br /><br />the "film's" story is fair enough - unseen killer stalks a vanload of cheerleaders (old gals playing teens) until the van runs out of gas and the "girls" are forced to hold up in secluded two-story mountain home. i won't ruin the ending for you but this is one of those "films" where the person who is obviously the killer is not obviously the killer. cheerleader massacre would have been great if it were shot on film, directed by joseph zito and had special effects by tom savini. instead it is an effect-less, shot-on-video travesty by jim wynorski. ouch.<br /><br />i beg of you, please don't buy or rent this abomination. if we keep supporting these clowns, the more of this talentless video garbage they'll produce. go out and rent "the prowler", "the last house on dead end street", "delirium" or "the burning" instead. you'll be glad you did.
