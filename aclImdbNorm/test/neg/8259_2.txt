what a great cast and what a pathetic attempt at a film. the script is full of holes from beginning to end. incoherent, not cohesive...utterly ridiculous. one of the most talented/beautiful actresses in the world (and i'm talking about nastassja kinski) is without a single memorable line here. worse, she supposedly dyes her hair halfway thru the movie, but it's obvious she's just wearing a cheap black wig bought from a drag queen costume shop. the best moments are given to a character actor and his dog in the apartment building that lead actor peter coyote lives in. fairuza balk is photographed poorly, to boot. she looks like an overweight freshman who's pigged out at too many all-you-can-eat-student-cafeteria-buffets. i was so looking forward to this film. i wanted to like it, but i think i'd rather watch nastassja read the phone book, with her own hair.
