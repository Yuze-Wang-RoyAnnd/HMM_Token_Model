what was the aim here...i started to have a look at it but then i realized that it had no aim...poor acting...no action and no story..i ended up listening to it while i was surfing the web reading about david beckham's $250 million dollar us soccer galaxy contract. do not rent this don't borrow this not worth a down load i've seen so many films that i could sense that this was going to be crap from the get go.<br /><br />war films should be accurate and if possible have some artistic merit and actually not feel like christian melodrama...this film pales in comparison to any that i've seen before.i must say that iam truly disappointed at this film..
