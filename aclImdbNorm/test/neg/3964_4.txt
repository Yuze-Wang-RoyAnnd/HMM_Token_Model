beloved tale of hero "benji" ("higgins" the dog) who is many different things to many different people. in his busy day "benji" grabs breakfast at the house of two young children, has a chat with an officer of the law, chases an old lady's cat and reminds an aging caf'e owner to start on the day's special. helper to some, amusement to others, he is companion to all.<br /><br />trouble arises when his young friends are kidnapped and taken to the abandoned mansion that he calls home. from here on we know only "benji" can save the day.<br /><br />plot is routine from writer/producer/director joe camp, and he does tend to over do the slow motion effects. audiences though will find it hard to resist the lovable little pooch, and kids of all ages are sure to adore him. cast were never going to be anything but background to "benji".<br /><br />not what you'd call inspired, but fun family fare. academy award nominee for "benji's" theme, "i feel love".<br /><br />saturday, july 13, 1996 - video
