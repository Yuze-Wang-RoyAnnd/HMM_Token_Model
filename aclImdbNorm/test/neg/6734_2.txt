since i'm from norway (one of the top ten (or so) richest countries in the world), it was much fun to watch how we use trucks from the 50ies and live in cottages from the medieval times. and since we have very strict laws when it comes to handguns, it was fun to see how much guns there actually were in norway during the five minutes of the shooting there. mr. direct-to-video even managed to bring his silencer on short notice, so he must have powerful friends in the customs.<br /><br />please do at least _some_ research before going to an "exotic" country, dudes -- you may hurt the feelings of old fans.<br /><br />sverre -- old fan with hurt feelings.
