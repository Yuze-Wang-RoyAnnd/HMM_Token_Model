i usually don't write reviews for shows unless i've seen them in full. however, there were so many positive views of this show on here i felt it was necessary to balance it out with a bit of realism.<br /><br />this show is hysterically bad. i don't think it was meant to be, but it is. i see that there's lots of praise being showered upon the show, and i honestly can't understand why--- this show is so poorly acted, the dialogue is so awful, and the plots are thin around their holes.<br /><br />i think that this show is interesting in that it is a definite litmus test of your standards. some elements of the show work, and perhaps those elements are just more important to some people than those that don't work, which make the show nearly unwatchable to people like me.<br /><br />if you enjoy making fun of a show as you watch it, anticipating clich'ed lines and such, this can be an enjoyable show to ridicule, if you have that sort of time on your hands.<br /><br />the pilot is a pretty fair example of the whole show. if the nonsense saccharin clich'e ending doesn't leave you in a dumb shock, then this may be a show for you.
