wow, i just got one watching this.<br /><br />how crappy post production is on this movie.<br /><br />i kid you not, i literally could've done a better job myself.<br /><br />all of post production is flawed, all of it. whoever cut this film should be banned from the film industry.<br /><br />that aside, the script was a trainwreck. absolute rubish.<br /><br />not to mention jack bauer and his patchy the pirate in spongebob accent. wtf is his character doing there? but to me, the biggest flaw of all was character development, intereaction, dynamics, dialogue. wow. i cant believe how bad it was.<br /><br />i give this movie a 2 out of 10. 1 for samantha, who is a great actress, too bad the production made everyone look like amateurs out there.<br /><br />the other 1 goes to cinematography, which was indeed good.<br /><br />other then that my friend, this is one bad movie.<br /><br />i don't even feel like making an elaborate post on this, it was just horrible production. poor actors, didn't know what they were getting into...
