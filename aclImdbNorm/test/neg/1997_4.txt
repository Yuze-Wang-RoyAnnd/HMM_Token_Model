my guess is that the producers of this low-budget space/horror film wanted a serious movie but the director had his heart set on a parody. so...this is what we get. set in an abandoned spaceship 1000 years in the future and peopled with characters and props right out of the 90's. the set is some industrial complex, maybe an oil tanker, whatever. they use is as is so the controls consist racks of old tv equipment. one location is obviously the employees lunchroom and sports an old tv and vcr as well as a water cooler with plastic demijohn. tiny lister and coolio get the best lines, arguing throughout the story. the dialog is packed with terms that are pretty dated even now ("a-ok, daddy-o") but then maybe the 30th century is very retro? when the captain declares the ships cargo is a load of coffins from "the transylvania station" you know this is all a put-on. its a bit of alien, part jasonx, shameless rip-off of all the best sci-fi and horror titles. at one point casper vandien even tells his pilot to "make it so" with a straight face. this film would have been better if they had just let everyone run with the satire but they keep attempting to make the story serious....maybe the backers were on the set that day. anyway, not a bad boredom killer if you aren't too picky. fx are as good as the sets are bad.
