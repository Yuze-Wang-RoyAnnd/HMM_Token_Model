it became apparent in the first 25 mins of watching this that the writers really wanted to make a feature length film and they probably certainly enjoyed the whole process, but then seemed to forget the fact that it needed a decent plot! if the best they could do was have 3 of the dullest characters enter the real world and have 'all sorts of amusing capers' then they should have left well alone! i didn't laugh once, and that whole "adventures of baron munchausen/time bandits" thing going on in the middle was very, very poor! convaluted, contrived and very loose. it just seemed like a whistle stop tour of anything they thought 'might' work just to drag it out to a feature.<br /><br />full of holes eg - the royston vasey characters needed the writers to carry on writing in order to save them, yet jeff managed to write himself into the sub-story/time-filling william and mary and era. if he could do this then why didn't they just carry on writing royston themselves - duh?? and herr lipp's audition? what was that for? i mean what was the point? he did it, and we heard nothing else whatsoever about it? <br /><br />my main point is, that while i loved the series, this was an ill thought out, seemingly rushed project. put it this way, the plot was so poor that if we didn't already know the characters (and as a fan i had a certain loyalty to carry on watching), and we relied solely on the the story itself, this would have fallen flat on its face! at best it would have gone straight to video, and at worst would never have been made in the first place! or maybe that should be the other way round?? truly dreadful....
