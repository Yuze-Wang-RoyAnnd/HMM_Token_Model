the sound in this movie is a nightmare. that is the best i can say for this movie. any chance of a good story is lost once this films starts. the premise of the film sounds good. a playboy who comes to terms with the people around him. the plot is predictable and very dull. the wet t-shirt contest may be the worst scene i've ever watched and is almost worth watching in a mystery science type of deal. the sound is at times hard to hear and the main actor seems to not know how to speak clearly. his accent makes him very hard to understand. the only bright sport is the acting of penelope ann miller. her role is underdeveloped but she plays it well. in short, do not waste your time.
