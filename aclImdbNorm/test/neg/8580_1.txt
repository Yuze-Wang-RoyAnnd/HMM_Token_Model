admirable but weak james bond film mainly because both the hero (bond) and villain (blofeld) were seriously miscast. lazenby is too big and innocent looking to play bond. he looks and acts more like the good-natured but dim-witted sidekick in a police action movie. the director and writer try to establish his credibility, but his saying of lines like "royal baluga, north of the ..." just aren't effective in establishing him as this worldly and suave rogue. savalas doesn't do a bad job, but his characterization and behavior is more fitting of a mob gangster. the best portrayed characters of the movie are those of tracy and her father. but the performances by those actors when sharing the screen with lazenby only serve to emphasize his deficiencies as an actor. this movie is too long (140 mins.) for a bond film and doesn't offer any excitement until bond's mountain escape, where it begins to pick up. this film tries very hard, but falls short. many bondian elements are present and the climatic battle is top notch, but i always get a sense of something missing when watching this one.
