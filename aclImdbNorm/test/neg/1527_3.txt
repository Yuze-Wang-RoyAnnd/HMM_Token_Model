the topics presented are very interesting; suburban culture, suburban sprawl, public transportation, oil & gas depletion, energy dependence, alternative energy sources, etc.<br /><br />the problem is that this is a pure and shameless propaganda piece. one viewpoint is presented, then hammered upon the viewer over and over. you see the same handful of 'experts' repeatedly making their case. the supposed 'narrator' starts off sounding like a news reporter, but by the end even he is preaching the film's dogma.<br /><br />the dark side of the film is not so much the gloom and doom message about oil depletion, but the sense that the folks in the film are actually wishful for a post-oil society and all that it entails. they paint this picture of a utopian society where we all return to the self-contained local village model; walk to work, shop locally, grow our own food, and generally live an idyllic 19th century lifestyle. for them, the post-oil society would seem a grand vision of a better world. it would certainly spell the end of globalization, and better still, the end of walmart. i will give them some credit for applying actual math in exposing the weaknesses of several over-touted alternative energy sources, including ethanol and hydrogen.<br /><br />i gave it 3 stars because i appreciated the old footage and the premise.
