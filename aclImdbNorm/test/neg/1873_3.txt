this is not a good film by an standards. it is very poorly written and the acting is just a little above par (some performances are well below par, but swayze and grey do a very good job with little to work with).<br /><br />what was good:<br /><br />the dance sequences were choreographed very well and, as stated above, swayze and grey were high points.<br /><br />what was bad:<br /><br />the script. the "bad" guys were simply too evil to be believable. the best villains are the ones who aren't so obviously evil. these guys (the owner's nephew, the waiter who impregnates the girl) do and say nothing that would leave me to believe they could be real people (perhaps there are guys like them, but i sure don't want to see a movie about it).<br /><br />another scene, the first where grey and swayze meet when the employees at the resort are "dancing". swayze and grey dance together and seem to enjoy themselves. the next time they meet, swayze is hostile towards her. why? what happened in between to make him dislike her so when they danced well together?<br /><br />and some of those lines, i mean come on (i cringed at the end when swayze muttered the line "nobody puts baby in the corner". how did he ever do that with a straight face.)<br /><br />another thing wrong, the setting of the 1960's. everyone looked and dressed like the 1980's! who was in charge of the costumes and hairstyles?<br /><br />the music (original music for the film) was laughable (with the exception of "i had the time of my life" which was a good song).<br /><br />not the worst film i've ever seen, but definitely the most over-rated
