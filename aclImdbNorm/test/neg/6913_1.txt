oh god, why? i am aghast at the sheer ineptitude of this delicious blathering nonsense..as if all that makes sense. well, like this film from bottom rung poverty row of 1940s hollywood, nothing in this door slamming horror - made on three sets - makes much sense...except the horniness of dr markoff (jerkoff?) who lusts uncontrollably after some plonky piano-player's daughter who has big melons and a flouncy hairdoo. it is just terrible ...and even has a gorilla and a big dog for pointless added distractions. more elephantine than elephant man and that is just at 62 minutes!. ....the monster maker is the sort of film kids in 2005 just howl at with disbelief and wonder what the hell their grandparents saw in their youth that made them the lovable movie kooks they are today. i guess you just had to be there. in 1944 or whenever the hell this mad drivel was shown to impressionable 13 year olds in glorious 3000 seat velvet movie palaces on a wet day. somehow. it was made for no reason, by botchville crapshooter movie scammers prc pictures in the war years by escaped german refugees who knew who to make a film since they got out of europe as the nazis advanced on ufa studios...the monster in this film, like the mad scientist is actually a nazi nightmare.
