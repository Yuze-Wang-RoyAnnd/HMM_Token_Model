you know, i was very surprised when watching this movie. it aired during the day once when i was sick, and having nothing else to do, i continued watching. this is by far the worst movie ever! but to my surprise i kept watching. i sat there saying, this is terrible, but yet didn't change the channel because i was so amused at how bad it was. maybe it was the guy that looked like big tom from survivor or the dreadful moustaches and mohawks these characters had, that kept me watching. however, the girls weren't half bad, but if that's what you want, there is far better. oh, and there's "ninjas" and "pajama boys!"<br /><br />so if you like ninja's, bad acting, hilarious(and terrible) dialogue, and two twins who are five feet tall and killing everything in their sight, then this movie is for you. it's so bad it's good. however, i just had to give it a 1 out of ten. i couldn't have put a 10 on it up there with lord of the rings.<br /><br />enjoy!!!!!!!!! :)
