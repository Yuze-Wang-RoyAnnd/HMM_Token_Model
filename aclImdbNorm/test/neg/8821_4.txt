i'd heard a lot of bad things about this film before seeing it, but thought all the negative comments were probably down to the film's low budget and poor acting - both of which i can deal with when it comes to zombie films. however, what i didn't count on is this film being really, really boring; if there's one thing you can count on from low budget zombies, its gore and entertainment - but unfortunately, this film has neither. i'm quite surprised, because the previous two horror films i've seen from director bob clark - deathdream and black christmas - were both highly inventive and entertaining films, but children shouldn't play with dead things just doesn't cut it. the plot line follows a group of young adults that travel to a burial island in order to mess about with rituals to bring the dead back to life. however, they soon learn that playing with things they don't understand is a really stupid idea when their rituals actually bring the dead back to life and the corpses of the island return to feast on their blood!<br /><br />the plots sounds like it could lead to a decent flick, but what i didn't mention is that the interesting parts don't start until the final twenty minutes; and as this is a ninety minute movie, i'm sure you can guess that this isn't a good thing. the opening hour and ten minutes are padded out with poor acting and even worse characters. i can understand setting up a situation so that the horror is more potent once it comes along; but please, if you're going to spend so long on it, you've really got to make it interesting. all of the characters in the film are over the top and annoying, and personally i just wanted the zombies to hurry up and eat them. the film is not without its merits, however, as the atmosphere is a standout. lucio fulci would show seven years later how an isolated island and flesh eating zombies can blend well; but bob clark already did it with this film. the direction isn't bad either, but it's brought down by poor make-up effects and a distinct lack of blood, which isn't likely to please fans of zombie movies. overall, i really can't recommend this film; but if you're a hardcore zombie fanatic, you may get a kick out of it.
