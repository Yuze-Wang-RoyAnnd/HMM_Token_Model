okay wait let me get this street, there are actually some morons on this site who reckon this is one of the better if not the best halloween sequel. i even read someone saying it was just as good as the original. pah what nonsense don't believe them i've watched every halloween and clearly unlike some people knows what makes at the very least a good horror movie and this shower of s is one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen in my life. frankly if i was john carpenter i would sue the person who wrote this either that or go around to his or her place with a hunting rifle. seriously halloween sequels in general are nearly all rubbish, two was crap, three was stupid, four is alright, five is well five, h20 alright, resurrection painful. yet, in many ways i find this to be the worst of a very bad bunch of sequels. why? well let me just embark on some kind of rant not so much a review but a mindless rant on why halloween 6 the cure of michael myers is one of the most abysmal movies i have seen in a very long time. ok where should i start, ah yes the plot oh boy the plot. basically the plot is a heaped together mess containing cults, signs of thor and some other crap. it's just stupid it really is, the film tries to be flashy and intelligent yet, its heaped together in such a horribly made way. why does michael myers got to have a reason for killing people? simple enough explanation micahel likes to kill his relatives that would suffice, but no we have to have a man in black and mysterious cults and signs of thor and utter crap. god its so bad it made me want to cry it really did, the writers have tried to add to the character of myers but have actually managed to do the entire opposite. apart from wearing a mask and a boiler suit < which is a completely different colour by the way, myers just isn't the same guy from the original or even two, heck maybe even four. thats another thing why has myers become a jason voorhes parody? i thought it was meant to be the other way round, yet myers is so similar to jason, all he does is endlessly kill people in gory ways. in the original he teased his victims took his time and as a result the whole thing was far more suspenseful. in this he just walks around hacking people to death. i mean in the space of half an hour we had equalled the amount of kills in the original it was just ridiculous. oh and myers in this seems to have a really big head, i mean its huge and hes put on loads of weight. what else is crap, oh yeah the return of tommy jarvis thats pretty bad, in fact all the characters in this film are crap bar dr loomis of course. i can't stand the little kid, i wish he had got it he's really irritating. our heroin is boring and not interesting. and her whole family are a terrible bunch of actors. the mother is rubbish, the brother is bad and the father i mean was this his first part or something? he was like a cartoon villain for gods sake he was actually more evil than myers < by the way his death is one of the most abysmal i've ever seen i think even friday the 13th wouldn't come up with something so entirely laughable. what else is rubbish oh yeah tommy jarvis, don't know the name of the guy but he really can't act, he tries his best to be serious and all that but i just wanted to laugh at him. i wish he had died in fact if everyone had died it would have been quite good really. there is dr loomis a horribly aged and dieing donald pleasence by all account. despite him being on his last legs pleasance is still the stand out in the brief amount of time he features. its such a pity that such a corner stone of this franchise had to say farewell in garbage like this. what else is rubbish, oh yeah the bit where the radio dj gets it. firstly how the hell did michael manage to get in that van when five minutes ago he was in his house? secondly it was just a pointless kill which may boost the body count but is just another peace of nonsense which adds to the drivel that is this film. its in fact that death which said it all for me in that it was pointless a lot like this film.
