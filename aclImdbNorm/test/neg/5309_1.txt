i rarely give ratings less than 5, but in this instance i must weigh in. elmore leonard is a great writer with many wonderful, complex books, original characters, crisp dialogue, invigorating plot twists. films based on his books go way back to hombre (paul newman), mr. majestyk (bronson), and out of sight (clooney / lopez) among others. even when done so-so the films at least have some measure of story essence coming through. this one, .... it is simply not a worthy addition to the catalog.<br /><br />the acting is bad (i do not know why, because these are very capable people here) and the story is handled with stupidity. the characters are re-arranged, the chemistry is missing, the actors and actresses are mis-cast.<br /><br />since elmore leonard is a really great story teller, i would hope that anyone who does not know his work would be dissuaded from reading his books because they saw this disappointing rendition of one of his stories.<br /><br />the story is a sequel to get shorty. if you have not seen that film, do not watch this. if you have seen get shorty, do not proceed to this.<br /><br />i saw be cool a few years back, and tonight have been re-visiting the vid. the first time must not have made such a negative impression because i had forgotten how dismal this sequel was.<br /><br />fortunately, i think no less of those who appeared in this film for having done so. they probably expected something more. get shorty was original and great fun. travolta i nearly always like, but he is so much better in tarantino's pulp fiction and in the preceding get shorty. he was clearly unable to enjoy whatever was going on here.<br /><br />and i hear freaky deaky,another elmore leonard book, is in pre-production for 2008 release. hopefully they can pull it off.<br /><br />read the books. they are almost all great.
