an excellent cast who do their best with an awful script, inept direction, and some of the worst score that i have ever heard. more tv movie of the week than serious drama. which is sad when one considers that the source material is very serious and very real. the film makers decided that instead of building drama and character, it was better to just show the most graphic and violent bits and hope that the audience would be shocked into sympathy and caring. in my opinion, one the most blatant forms of cut and paste film adapting.
