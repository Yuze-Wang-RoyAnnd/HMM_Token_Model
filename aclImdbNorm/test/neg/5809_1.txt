this movie is on the level with "welcome home roxy carmichael" for biggest pieces of garbage that have ever hit the silver screen. if these guys weren't adam sandler's gay friends, this script would have ended up where it should have: as some big time movie exec's toilet paper. i hate this movie, it makes me want to injure people. i will admit that i have high standards, but honestly i'd rather watch step up 2. the ultra sad part was when i logged onto imdb and read that you pieces of trash actually gave this movie a 6.9 rating. this is a testament to all of the retards in our society that will go watch terrible movies that are just hour and a half long dick, fart, and weed jokes with little to no originality. after seeing this rating, i would like to suggest "tyler perry's house of pain" to all of you guys who enjoyed this film; you'll see some high quality humor there on about the same level of this abhorrent abomination.
