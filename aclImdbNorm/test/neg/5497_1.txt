a movie this dumb should never see the light of day. the acting is lame, the violence is just all over the place, the sneaking ending is just plain stupid.<br /><br />it's all about a lawyer who saw a murder done by the r.i.c.c.o. squad. no one has never seen him, not even the hit men themselves. so he and a beautiful lady are on the run trying to find the leader of this r.i.c.c.o. squad, before they find them.<br /><br />then the movie goes on to a romance, gun shooting, and voodoo. now how in the hell did voodoo come in this. never see this film if your life depends on it. trust me!!!!!!!!
