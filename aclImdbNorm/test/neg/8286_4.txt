next stop on our journey through the calender-slasher scene is... oh yes, "graduation day"! all of those seniors, just brimming with possibility and ready to venture out into the real world and become adults. that is, however, if they can make it to graduation without having to tangle with the campus lunatic who's running around, gouging the life out of students with his fencing sword... yeah, it all stems from a the high school track star who drops dead from a blood clot during a race and a year later, her older sister returns home from the navy for graduation. the track coach holds the blame and broods in his demoted position in shop-class while the girl's boyfriend still mourns her death a year later... all of these characters are prime candidates for "serial slasher of the year" and you just have to sit through this movie until the end to find out who-done-it. "graduation day" is fun, though it isn't spell-bindingly original by any means and there aren't a whole lot of memorable demises, but there is enough going on to keep you mildly entertained. like linnea quigley screwing the music teacher and getting busted with a joint, 30 year-old actors playing teenagers, and of course... rollerdisco! gotta love that crap! you can do a lot worse than "graduation day", kiddies...
