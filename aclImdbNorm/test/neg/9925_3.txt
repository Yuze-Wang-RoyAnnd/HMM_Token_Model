as much as i love ellen barkin (who is really underrated) i have to boo this movie. if you can't tell who did it and why in the first half hour you obviously have never seen a psycho-sexual thriller or have never watched 20/20. it's like the filmmakers and actors didn't care that they way they were shooting it and they way they were playing the characters would be a dead giveaway.<br /><br />overall, this movie serves to turn-on the dirty perverts who like to mix violence and sex. not a fun movie to sit through, although if you like ellen barkin it's nice to see her place a tough lady.
