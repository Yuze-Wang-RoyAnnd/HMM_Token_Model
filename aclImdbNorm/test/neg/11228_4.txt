"crimes of passion" is a film that is disappointing on most counts. where should i start from? the plot? it is despairingly simplistic and full of gaps. the direction? reminds a cheap b-movie. the acting? john laughlin is utterly terrible in his role as "well-intentioned-husband-of-a-frozen-wife" bobby, annie pots is unconvincing as "frozen-wife" amy, and it is only kathleen turner (above average), and antony perkins (excellent) which get passable acting marks. more specifically, antony perkins gives a great performance as the pervert reverend peter shayne, while turner manages to portray the roles of sexy china blue and frail joanna crane satisfactorily.<br /><br />unfortunately, the performances of turner and perkins alone are insufficient to help get the film a grade higher than 4/10. watch it if you want to see turner in some sensational scenes (although even on this count the film can be easily matched by its competition-"basic instinct" for example), otherwise avoid.
