this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. there is not a shred of historical accuracy, in fact reality is reversed. just one example: morgan preyed on the few ethnic chinese he encountered. the acting is over the top, the script is a poorly written lie. i have never seen worse fake beards.<br /><br />hopper arrived in australia and reportedly only would make the film if the script was totally rewritten so he could be a hero. since the script was ten made up on the fly, the may explain how bad it is and how disjointed the movie is.<br /><br />any movie about ned kelly is a lot better than this film.
