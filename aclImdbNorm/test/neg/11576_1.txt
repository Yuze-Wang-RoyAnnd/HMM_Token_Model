i was watching the sci-fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on. while not as bad as wynorski's "curse of the komodo", this still sucks...bad. wynorski uses the same island as in "curse of the komodo", as well as the same actors and house. the effects are top notch (suprising) but thats about it........i don't know what else to say about this movie.......oh yeah! as in "curse of the komodo", the government gets involved and decides to bomb the island! also....when i saw this part i laughed hysterically...a komanbra!!! (part man, komodo and cobra!). overall this movie is utter crap even on bad movie standards. just remember if jim wynorski had anything to do with a movie....steer clear....to avoid from falling asleep keep repeating "it's almost over..it's almost over...". 0 out of 5.
