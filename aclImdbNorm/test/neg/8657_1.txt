yash raj films are so funny, whatever works they follow it yet they are called the best production house?<br /><br />seeing bhatt films working they copied the formula, bikini and everything plus casting low actors like uday and tanishaa<br /><br />the film is so horrible it makes you cringe<br /><br />the jokes are so bad and horny it makes you slap them uday resembles a gay plus a monkey<br /><br />tanishaa resembles an idiot <br /><br />the director thinks we all are idiots arjun sablok takes the audience for granted music is saving grace camera-work is good<br /><br />uday chopra hams like an idiot, tanishaa looks like kajol in k3g if kajol was annoying der then tanishaa is worse the rest are okay
