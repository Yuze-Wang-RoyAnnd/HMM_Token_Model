one of those movies where you take bets on who will die first and who will survive at the end. there was just something about the movie that made me zone out. i think because i keep looking back and thinking "yep still in that tree...still looking at the water". poor character development. i felt nothing when they were in danger. i was voting for the croc. i found it hard to believe a croc would try to tip a boat in the first place and then when it jumps into the boat i find that really unlikely as well. the croc seems too supernatural at times ('all knowing all seeing'). also when the croc attacks it's behavior seems very unrealistic. it's a killing machine and wouldn't be letting victims escape twice to three times in a row, especially when attacking in the water.
