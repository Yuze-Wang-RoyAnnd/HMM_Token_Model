i saw this film at the tender age of 18 with a group of friends. its reputation had preceded it, and though all my friends were also of legal age, i alone had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it. we gathered at a house where the parents had left town for the weekend. though we sat in close proximity to each other, we did not speak or otherwise acknowledge each other's presence. as it turned out, the film both merited and did not merit the anticipatory shame we felt. it did not disappoint in terms of sheer gratuitous content, but it disappointed in every other way.<br /><br />caligula attempts to transcend genres by combining a historical epic with a brazen porn flick. it fails miserably in its ambition, subjecting the audience to the worst of both worlds. the film's obvious selling point is its pornographic aspect, and it does indeed provide far more than its share of real, graphic sex. but in setting this sex in the context of caligula's depraved reign, it dignifies the act even less than the average adult movie. sex without context might at least be physically pleasurable for the consenting adults involved, but pleasure and perhaps even consent are largely absent from the world of caligula. in it, sex at best serves as an idle pastime and at worst as an instrument of sadistic domination. in the present day, it is somewhat common to hear words like "sin" and "depravity" used facetiously to describe acts which are enjoyable yet considered taboo according to certain moral or religious perspectives. caligula takes the viewer beyond the facetiousness by depicting true depravity and demonstrating that no joy or pleasure comes from it.<br /><br />the historical portions not only fail to meaningfully contextualize the sex, they fail to entertain, enlighten, intrigue, or interest the viewer in any way. they only provide lengthy stretches of unremitting tedium. rarely has a film proved so boring. the sex, after the initial shock and astonishment fades, only contributes to the overall monotony of the picture.<br /><br />rarely do discussions of this film involve its violence. while many films more violent than caligula have been made, few can rival it in terms of the shock value of its violence. apparenly, unrelenting barbarity as well as hyper-depraved sexuality characterized caligula's emperorship. the violence is even less for the faint of heart than the sex.<br /><br />a review like this will likely generate as much curiosity as it quells. i understand why someone would want to see this film; after all, i myself succumbed to the same curiosity. i simply hope that my review, by plainly describing its lack of redeeming value, will at least give potential viewers the knowledge to make an informed decision about whether to see it or not. my high school criminal justice teacher described police work as "hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror." this statement perfectly describes caligula. you have been warned.
