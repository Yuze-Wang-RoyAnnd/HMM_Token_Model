here's why this movie fell very short of its potential(i don't read much, so i don't care what the novel was like). 1. i think brendan frasier copied his encino man from lambert's tarzan. it was stiff, and while his tarzan call was a little more realistic, he had no humanity. 2. they screwed with the story. maybe that's how the book goes, but for as long as i can remember the first utterances of tarzan were "me tarzan, you jane". jane is the first human tarzan encounters. i did like the natives a bit more than the shoepolished midget pigmys in weismuller's version, but those bows and arrows were a bit cheesy. 3. tarzan is primarily a love story. i'm sorry, but the love interest enters over an hour into the picture. that qualifies her for a supporting role at best. supporting roles and leads don't fall for each other, not enough screen time, sorry. not only was andie mcdowell's vioce over pathetic(most likely because her strong southern accent couldn't be masked) the chemistry scale between tarzan and jane was a whopping 0. i never believed they loved each other, which made the belgian dudes closing voice over, quite frankly, silly. when tarzan sees jane for the first time in the jungle, he feels an urge, if you will, a feeling he's never felt before. jane brings out the humanity in him, and he brings out the untamed side of her. its this chemistry that compells the story of tarzan. not that lord greystoke's dying wish is to keep his land whole and that johnny boy is going to do it for him. even a good face lift couldn't help this movie. it needs massive internal reconstruction. oh, and could we possibly shoot more in the jungle, or at least use camera angles that don't show off the sound stage like qualities of the place. final judgement, 4 out of 10. sorry tin-man, and by the way, if you want to see real acting, drop lambert and check out leonardo dicaprio.
