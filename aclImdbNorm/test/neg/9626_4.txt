wow, what exciting visual effects. i also loved the costumes and artwork, the circus and ethereal feel to the film was sublime. it just required the need for the viewer to worry about the fate of our protagonist. as she is trapped in her imagination, there is never a sense of peril unlike, say, david lynch's films which haunt every time. this also draws attention to which age group this film is aimed at. who would this engage?<br /><br />mirrormask is obviously going to draw comparisons with labyrinth with the teen- angst/ fantasy theme, but unfortunately it doesn't really come close to delivering the same henson essence. the ill mother theme is never fully explained and certainly not something that you care about while lapping up the eye candy.<br /><br />not agonisingly awful a la the cell, nor as engagingly dreamlike as labyrinth - a forgettable but good-looking fantasy.
