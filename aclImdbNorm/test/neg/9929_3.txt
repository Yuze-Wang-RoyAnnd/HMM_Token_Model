i got about halfway through this movie and was very disappointed. it was just flat out boring and completely unrealistic. i can get past being unrealistic in a lot of movies, but not when it's supposed to be a crime drama thing. the evidence collection and interview processes were just plain oddball. i started fast forwarding to see how it ended. and then got bored with that and just turned it off and returned it. the main character, played by ellen barkin, just wasn't believable at all. peta wilson acted very well in this film, but her character was way out there and there wasn't anyone for her acting talents to play off of that made it work.
