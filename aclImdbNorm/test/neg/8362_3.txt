congratulations to christina ricci for making this movie and putting her mojo behind this important subject and trying to make a great film. ricci is my favorite actress: she is so gifted, so natural, her reactions are perfect and so is the energy she constantly radiates, which gives credence to the often misapplied term "star." <br /><br />the film misses its mark for lots of various reasons, but perhaps most notably for the story's seeming unadaptability to the screen in making it a compelling narrative...more on that later. the cast at first glance is excellent, but come to think of it, jessica lang as the jewish mother is too protestant and not exactly right, ann hetch doesn't come close to showing the compassion and dedication of the psychiatrist from the book, and when your making a movie, how can you justify saying no to anne heche and jessica lange? but the real problems are in the film's construction: first in the failure to elicit any kind of lasting sympathy for the elizabeth wurtzle character, and second to say anything meaningful regarding the all too common and horrible situation that this poor girl finds herself in. <br /><br />unfortunately do to the flashback construction, lizzy merely comes off as certainly more affected teenager than most, but not nearly as devastatingly ill as she comes off in the book. this is a major problem. this story had to be told from beginning to end and from the therapist's couch. she is only eight or nine when her depression starts due to devastating social factors, both society and the home, and this is a crucial point in not only eliciting the proper sympathy for her but also of the gravitas of her case. she is so talented, and such a vulnerable and disaffected spirit so early on, that one's heart can't help but reach out to her due to her victimization. this is missed on the film.<br /><br />ultimately one has to come to terms with what the film is trying to say: it is a biopic of one severely affected girl, but also it is a film about a nation who can't get its act together; that is very clear in the book but interestingly not in the film where the chosen at harvard are even more messed up than the average college enrollee. the film finally isn't able to get either of these messages across compellingly, and that's too bad. is prozac a good thing or is it a bad thing, or a mixed blessing or a seeming necessity in a country in which so many people can't function without a chemical crutch? these are tough and challenging concepts to work with and the writing does not really attempt to address any of them in a more or less engaging way. the challenger disaster is an interesting image to symbolize a dysfunctional america, but that doesn't have the effect it's suppose to have due to the crosscutting and insufficient earlier development of controlling themes.<br /><br />ricci's performance is tight and heartfelt, and one of the best of her acting career.<br /><br />michele williams is also superb in her role.
