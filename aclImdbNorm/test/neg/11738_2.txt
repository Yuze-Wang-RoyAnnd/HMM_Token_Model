this is one of the dumbest ideas for a movie. remake a classic film shot-by-shot. i hope nobody tries this technique again. in 1998, "good will hunting" director gus van sant tried it by remaking hitchcock's 1960 classic "psycho" and failed miserably. what on earth was van sant thinking of? this remake doesn't even come close to topping the original. the few changes that were made here were no help. if you want to see "psycho", the choice is obvious. see the original.<br /><br />* (out of four)
