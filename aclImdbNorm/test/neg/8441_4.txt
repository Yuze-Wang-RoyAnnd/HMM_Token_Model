piranha starts out as expected, stupid white people going to discover new lands and exploit them. i thought for a while it might be a cannibal film. it starts off like so many others, showing nothing but shots off untouched amazon rain forest. for all i know it could be florida. at this point you figure some animal mutilation or natives will pop up. instead you get the acting talents of william smith, who starred in l.a. vice and angels die hard. he plays caribe, an acclaimed hunter, who i would describe him as jack palance light. he is bigger in stature, but not quite the jack palance goodness. as for natives, you don't really get that many. where's the piranha? should i even ask that question? caribe now hunts humans, i guess. he doesn't really pursue anyone till the end of the movie though, just stares at them. caribe does race one of the tourists on a motorcycle in a over-dramatic smokey and the bandit kind of way. the motorcycle challenge happens for no real reason other than an action sequence. i can't tell you how many times i've seen a tourist challenge a stranger to a motorcycle race in the jungle. never actually. do they live, do they die? will you care? anybody wanna race on motorcycles? caution: this film contains extreme dry look. my advice is to rent a jack palance classic like craze.
