and believe me that's a pretty stunning accomplishment. take "jolly roger: massacre at cutter's cove," change the killer from a pirate to a prospector, change his obsession from buried treasure to old gold, and his color from puke green to deep blue. you now have "miner's massacre." the problem is, at least "jolly roger" was entertaining enough -- albeit in a so-bad-it's-good way -- to keep you watching it for the whole two hours. there's no strip-joint-murder scene or any bizarre killings. i can't tell you how many times i lost interest in "miner's massacre" and started doing dishes or cleaning around the condo. and, the ending is absolutely silly. the 49er dude just randomly re-appears out of nowhere to kill the local sheriff, while the lead actor and actress are sitting in the sheriff's cruiser, screaming. a truly horrible movie.
