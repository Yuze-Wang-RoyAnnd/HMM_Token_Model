there's not that much to say in the end. one would have expect much more from a director who made way better movies in the past. it just seems like he did it without actually caring. the actors are doing their job (though belmondo is far from amazing), but you just don't get hooked. in a word, it's boring. this is even more disappointing since i heard several time that this movie could be considered as a reaction to all the big american blockbusters, which are considered to be a threaten to the french exception by those who just can't admit they should turn to another job. i tell you, if that's the best reaction we're supposed to get, boy, i'm going to be really depressed soon...
