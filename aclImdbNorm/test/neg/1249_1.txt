this is possibly the worst film i have ever seen. what a weak waste of michael imperioli's obvious talent. disgusting film from start to finish. all i can say is, this director is no 'auteur'. you never once get inside the game, the character's head, the amazing talent with numbers the real stuey had. the coke scene is bad enough to throw your shoe at the set, it might have been a great scene had it been shot for movies and not the stage, with the camera half way across the house hovering over a mirror with drugs on it while the drama is going on far in the background. the scene where he wins the big championship is just laugh out loud ridiculous. this should be screened in film-making 101 - what not to do in making pictures.
