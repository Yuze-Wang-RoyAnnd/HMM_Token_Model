back in college i studied marketing and, even though i missed a whole lot of classes and never really paid any attention, i will always remember the main and most essential principle of marketing, namely: it's not what you sell; it's how you sell it! this principle fully applies to "the devil's triangle", as it's basically a beautifully wrapped and enticing yet empty package. writer/director richard winer knew exactly that he had to divert the viewer's attention away from the major inaccuracies, so he threw in some elements that never fail when it comes to providing a creepy atmosphere, like the sinister voice of narrator vincent price and the oddball music of king crimson. and i'm guessing richard winer's dirty little tricks worked very efficiently, as there was a huge bermuda triangle hype going on during the mid-70's and literally every movie production
