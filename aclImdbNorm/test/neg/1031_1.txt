here is a rundown of a typical rachael ray show:<br /><br />1. the awful theme song begins to play, and rachael descends wearing her snapcrotch outfit in this bizarre cargo elevator. 2. she begins running around screaming and/or insulting the audience, then yells at them sit down. 3. an awkward monologue.<br /><br />(the next are in any order) 4. a segment tooting rachael's own horn (i.e. "i lost 500 pounds with rach's recipes, "rachael ray saved my life," "rachael's fashion tips.") 5. a totally useless d.i.y. tip (i.e. how to engrave words into casserole dishes, how to use your washing machine as a salad spinner, how to build a tube of lipstick with a light on it.) 6. the unleashing of horrible recipe on the unsuspecting audience (reaction shots of first bites are never shown). 7. a celebrity guest with an awkward interview, followed by some obviously scripted questions from the audience. 8. a person who gets help from one of rachael's cronies (i.e. the i say yes to everything woman, the i own nothing but overalls lady, and the i can't find time to put on makeup housewife). what would they do without you rachael. *gasp*<br /><br />reasons that this show should be avoided like the plague: 1. fakeness: rachael ray claims that entire show is unscripted. many people who have attended tapings of the show have claimed that the entire show is scripted. many of these same people have also mentioned that there is even a very strict dress code for the show. <br /><br />2. her show jumps around too much: where as oprah, who is the highest rated talk show host of all time has a definite theme for her show, rachael's jumps around like an adhd soda child on crack. her show averages perhaps 10, short, worthless segments a show. on second you will be getting fashion tips from kojo, and the next rachael will be making gross stuffed "spanish" peppers with manchego cheese, and the next their will be a giant anaconda up on stage, and the next, well you get the picture.<br /><br />3. rachael is a poor host with bad ideas: aside from her grating personality, rachael's hosting ability is terrible, at best. her questions for her celebrity guests are poor, and often times not even relevant to the interview, and her segments are unappealing and offer little educational, or humorous value.<br /><br />in conclusion, you need not waste your time with this schlock. it will be canceled soon anyways.
