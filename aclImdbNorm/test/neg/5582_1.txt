it's incredible how a movie can take so much time and effort and still end up being abominable. for those of you who appreciate painstaking special effects and inconceivable detail in every shot you will watch this film in awe. simply because predator island contains none of this. it is a redundant remake of every horror monster movie in the last two decades. now i appreciate bad horror films, they have a certain flare for humor in the most dramatic of circumstances. however, if your goal is to create a memorable work that will thus be engulfed in the cult hall of fame then my first suggestion is to find some imagination/creativity plus get some talent. oh, and a few extra bucks to put into your picture.<br /><br />one horror film tradition has been to shock the audience with violent deaths and gore. however, shock doesn't deliver for more than a few seconds. to really evoke a satisfying reaction from paying crowd there should b development of characters, some identifiable traits. i know, you're probably saying this guy is not providing anything intelligent to the filmmakers, he's just stating an amateur remark. well, that goes to show you how amateur these filmmakers are.<br /><br />despite having to go through the horror of watching this movie, there was a silver lining. the performance by dan gordon as chris is splendid. he is given nothing to work with in a script and yet he is able to come out of that film looking like a star. out of all of the actors he is the only who believes in what he is reciting. he not only provides the audience with someone we can identify with but we also have someone we look forward to watching so we can get through the rest of the film. gordon shows genuine talent and the ability to pull off quality work and overcoming a huge obstacle, that being the rest of the cast. dan gordon is going to be a star, hopefully sooner than later. that is to say if he can get away films like this that will hold him back.
