i'm usually quite tolerant of movies, and very easily entertained, however this movie was dreadfully disappointing.<br /><br />i watched this movie after seeing on the cover that william zabka was in it (the karate kid bad boy) and during this movie i could see that this would be the only reason.<br /><br />this film is a tremendous waste of the actors talent. the music, and sound is dreadfully tacky - i couldn't believe this of a movie made in the 90's!<br /><br />i wouldn't really recommend this movie unless you're interested in one of the actors.
