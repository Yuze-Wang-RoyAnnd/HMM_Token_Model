arguably the most disgusting thing to come out of australia since vegemite... predictably distasteful comedy with barry humphries in a dual role as boozy australian diplomat les patterson and undercover agent dame edna! so many bodily function gags that even the farrelly brothers would have been sick, and several gross-out moments, especially the effects of the horrible h.e.l.p. virus. only for fans of extreme toilet humor. oh, and that's the "neverending story ii", not the "mad max" george miller, who directed... * 1/2 <br /><br />
