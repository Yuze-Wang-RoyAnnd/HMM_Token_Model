think of an extremely low-rent version of "heathers," and you've got "pep squad." that sums up the flick in a nutshell. i must give credit where credit's due, though. the film has a nice visual appeal to it. i liked the cinematography, i liked the wild color schemes, i liked the costume designs. but without good acting, a film has no redeeming value. i'd rather watch a film with little visual appeal, with good actors and sharp dialogue (i.e.: "the brothers mcmullen" or any edward burns film). the actors either recite their dialogue in monotones or scream it out like they're in a bad soap opera. this is why i don't badmouth most mainstream actors. let's face it, most actors who are mainstream are mainstream for a reason. if they're not "great" actors, they're at least competent. people badmouth leo dicaprio, but when was the last time you saw a movie where he recites the dialogue as if he's reading it off the page? it's a shame, because the director seems like he knows his stuff when it comes to mis en scene (sp). at the same time i can't totally praise steve balderson (the director). he did write the screenplay, which contains some horrible dialogue. he might be slightly racist too, since there's a black principal in the movie, who inhabits a culmination of african-american stereotypes.
