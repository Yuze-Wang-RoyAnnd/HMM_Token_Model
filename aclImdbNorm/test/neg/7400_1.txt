what a bloody nuisance! you can't get on subjects like these with tv budgets and some smartass director who can't tell the difference between a lanc i, ii and iii. all the silly clich'es are well in place; on the character and human level the story is so schmaltzy and unbelievable it hurts. and all those responsible get carried away with joy for the brilliant ratings. tech details: rubbish. lancs flying that close would have kicked each other out of the sky by the dozen. single engined night fighters attacking line astern: ridiculous. as i said: made up by a director who i bet never even heard the name lancaster before that project and some kid 3d guys who turned lancs into waddling ducks. but these are minor things compared to the overall mediocrity of this film. although it might be too harsh i dare say this hurts the memory of those who died on both sides. tv crap, entertaining the dumb masses who don't care anyway. shame on those responsible. use your brains next time. and enjoy the profit you made from it.
