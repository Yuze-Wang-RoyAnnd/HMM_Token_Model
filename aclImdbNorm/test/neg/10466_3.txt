another indian legend you never heard of before is let loose. as the name implies, this is a vengeful wraith who likes to absorb the skeletons of people while they're still using them. as usual, ancient burial grounds (can you say, "poltergeist?") have been disturbed by clich'ed greedy land developers building stuff.<br /><br />the cgi, if it had been better, might have made the effect more treacherous looking, but they skimped on the budget, and it shows--to comical effect. the unleashed creature probably should have been kept off stage during its first several killings-that might have added some mystery or impending doom atmosphere-but the inept director decided to show us in the first five minutes what it looks like, and it wasn't impressive. the deaths are just poorly done, again with shoddy cgi. i guess ancient spirits always kill by using cheap special effects. as for the "victims," they look they're going to laugh any moment while they do goofy screams. it's always obvious who's going to get it: a character with only a few lines shows up, strange noises are heard, cgi dots fly, exit character. repeat (several times).<br /><br />still, there's a few chase scenes featuring the monster that actually made this thing watchable. unfortunately, the director seems to be using these as a device to fall back on (so it's used too often) when he can't think of anything else for his characters to do. overall, it's pretty silly, but i've seen worse. this flick is cheap, but it's oddly fun to watch.
