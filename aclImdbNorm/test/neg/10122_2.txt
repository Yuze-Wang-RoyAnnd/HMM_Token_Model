this is, arguably, the worst of the major ava gardner films. yes, she is gorgeous. but that can wear thin over time, especially after the corny and predictable movie ending.<br /><br />in this turkey, robert walker has to pretend that he's eddie bracken (which surely embarrassed him). olga san juan plays the jane powell (golly, gee) part. dick haymes plays a sort of dim sidekick (!), and eve arden plays helen broderick (and a host of other wise-cracking female semi-comedians). yes, the film contains a major popular song, "speak low." but check out the other, entirely forgettable, pieces. dick haymes sings very well, of course, and so does the uncredited vocalist dubbing for ava.<br /><br />the sets are cheap, the script is filled with clich'es and failed humor, and tom conway looks as though he has been battling with liquor (as indeed he was). in short, if you want to see ava in her prime, buy a photo and stay well clear of this movie.
