if you can stomach the campiness, this movie should make you laugh out loud several times. it did for me, at least. i'll only mention one of my favorite elements: the "underwater shots" of the "fish" "swimming". the sound which accompanies those shots is great too.<br /><br />one last note: william katt is actually a pretty decent actor. i hope he gets another day in the sun; watching him as "the greatest american hero" was a fun part of my childhood a couple of decades ago, and he hasn't been very visible since. he seemed kind of depressed in this movie. somebody give him a fun job on a good show, or something.
