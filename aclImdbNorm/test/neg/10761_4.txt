it beats me how anyone can rate this film very highly. it is no understatement to call it far fetched. how the guy managed in such a short space of time to construct a wooden maze of underground rooms is quite ridiculous or maybe he was the greatest carpenter since jesus. the obese sheriff played by hoyt axton looked like a refugee from the jerry springer show and i found the blonde female lead jennifer jason leigh rather plain. we have an expression here in the u.k. 'mutton done up as lamb' which suits her perfectly. it wasn't all bad however, i enjoyed it immensely when the end credits rolled and 'the end' came up was quite brilliant for this hotch potch of a t.v. movie which if it had been a cinematic release would have been put on video and in discount stores in no time at all.
