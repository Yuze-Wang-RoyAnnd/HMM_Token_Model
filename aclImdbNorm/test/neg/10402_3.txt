fear and desire is of interest mainly to kubrick obsessives, who can plumb this pretentious clap trap for signs of his still-to-come greatness. kubrick was right in seeking to ensure that the film was not screened or available on legitimate video. he considered it embarrassing and amateurish, and he was correct in his evaluation. this is a weak and tedious film--at 68 minutes it still seems longer than "barry lyndon"!--it nevertheless is of historical interest, and has its genuine absorbing moments. it's a difficult film to find (only "unofficial" copies are in circulation), though perhaps this may change if kubrick's estate relents and has it released on video. recommended only for kubrick enthusiasts.
