really!here the french cinema hits rock bottom ,and compared to it, the least appealing of the american adolescent horror movies,the likes of "friday the thirteenth" "freddy" and co are masterpieces of the seventh art.<br /><br />it's all the more infuriating as there were exciting original elements :the for^et de broc'eliande and its legends ,the druids and king arthur ,all were splendid assets for a dreamlike fantasy and horror film.alas! filmed ,as an user aptly pointed out in a fake forest,near paris ,the movie is fake horror,fake celtic history,fake vestiges -you should see the professor (wilms who was a wonderful m.le quesnoy in "la vie est un long fleuve tranquille) scream for the "invaluable scrap" -which the production probably bought in a dime store-fake characters ,fake excavations...<br /><br />the boys disguised as druids are unintentionally very funny ;so are the girls who seem to be experts in martial arts.and what can we say of the professors? of the monster? a ten year old would write a better screenplay than this grotesque farce.to think that people can spend money for such drivel when artists are still waiting for a producer!<br /><br />word to the wise:maurice leblanc wrote a marvelous story dealing with druids and old ceremonies in his arsene lupin saga called "l'^ile aux trente cercueils" .a miniseries was made 30 years ago.avoid this "broceliande" garbage and try to see it instead.
