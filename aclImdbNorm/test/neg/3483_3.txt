this movie is one big stereotype. the acting (except philbin & harrison) is awful and the horrid script only make things worse. i must agree with another review that the "local" characters sound ridiculous as a matter of fact so do the "caucasian" characters. 3 stars out of 10 for 1)philbin 2)harrison 3)surf scenes. (1/2* out of ****) watch "aloha summer" (**) and/or "beyond paradise"(***) for hawaii done right, especially bp which i found to be entertaining and brilliant.
