most of the other posts beat this movie up, and deservedly so. i've just got to chime in on the technical ineptness of the film makers. it would have been nice if the director had at least had lunch with someone who knew what a gun was, because he had no clue.<br /><br />spoilers ahead!!! you have been warned!!! <br /><br />stupidity: <br /><br />spec ops team assembled from various military units whose members have never met each other before.<br /><br />maybe two people in the unit had weapons that used the same magazines, parts, ammo, etc.<br /><br />the sniper school instructor uses a sub machine gun (pistol caliber) as opposed to a rifle which we would assume she would be more proficient with.<br /><br />one poor team member's night vision optics weigh more than the rifle does. you can tell when he handles it, that it is seriously top heavy.<br /><br />the team leader sends out a team member to "challenge" the skeleton man when they first confront him. challenge a 200 year old reanimated native american skeleton with a long spear and an attitude riding an undead war horse with a severe nosebleed? i think not, bubba.<br /><br />bullets do not spark when they hit trees, mr. director. (a couple of people have already mentioned this.) <br /><br />the teams "air support" consists of a ubiquitous "black helicopter", only this one has a couple of sidewinder missiles slung underneath. someone forgot to tell the helo crew that the skeleton man doesn't fly, and they are over the american heartland where there won't be any enemy aircraft. they should have carried some air to ground missiles instead.<br /><br />the helo's air to ground ordnance consists of a door gunner with a semi-auto ak-47(or 74?). needless to say he only hits dirt. should have brought a belt fed light machine gun.<br /><br />door gunner later finds out that a grenade launcher is pretty useless as well.<br /><br />a wooden arrow from a freaking recurve bow does not down helicopters, mr. director.<br /><br />i pretty well could not take anymore after this point (about 30 minutes) and gave up. you seriously need a morphine drip to make it through this flick, it is just that painful.
