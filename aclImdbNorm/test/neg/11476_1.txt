five guys who were in the cub scouts together reunite years later to go camping. were they run into their childhood nemeses as well as escaped convicts in this supreme unfunny supposed comedy. most of the cast are content to simply phone it in, and don't really seem to care about the film in the least. the writers were so lazy that the names of the characters are, for the most part, the name of the actors that respectively play them. richard lewis's shtick gets really old really quick. even the late great character actor, brion james can't save this stinker. (even though he's one of the few actors in the film that doesn't totally embarrass himself) i hardly cracked a smile, much less had anything that would reasonably be even misconstrued as a laugh. awful.<br /><br />my grade:f
