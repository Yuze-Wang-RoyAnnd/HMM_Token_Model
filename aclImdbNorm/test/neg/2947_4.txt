this movie reminds me of harry potter - not the style but the marketing strategy. there may be part 2 , part three...until one day the product life cycle finishs, of course on the condition that the part one has a commercial success. so many things seems to be hidden and thus the story looks quite incomplete. the action design is boring. set design is ok but not fine. perhaps edison chen would be a big star one day. he really looks charming even on big screen. the most impressive is still anthony wong. 4/10<br /><br />
