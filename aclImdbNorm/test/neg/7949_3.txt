why remake the original "assault"? to my mind "assault" was carpenter's true masterpiece. it had all the elements good carpenter movies contain. external threat on a small group of individuals. people taking the challenge because they are forced to do so. isolation! just remember, the guns in carpenter's original made no sound, being thus a lot more threatening than conventional devices. and now this remake. concentrating on "main character i"s psychology and on his relation to main character ii (the evil but honorable). the anonymous threat in the carpenter movie replaced by a rather conventional conspiracy/corruption background. the "remakers" just didn't understand the main plot of the original. and thus produced something pretty ordinary.
