i kind of liked the film, it's just that the characters run around with no real point to their craziness. as i was saying, poor goat. the goat was nahing while the guy was pretending to grind on it. i would have liked the rape scenes to be more graphic (not the one with the goat though). jane ryall who played celia only did this one film. she was very nude throughout. this crazy couple who killed and tortured many people ended up in their rightful places. i almost forgot about the gay transvestite couple who are also picked out for being sinners. if you like crazy off the wall stuff, then this is your film. 3/10
