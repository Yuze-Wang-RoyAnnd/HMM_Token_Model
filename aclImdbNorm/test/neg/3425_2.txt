an interesting concept turned into carnage...<br /><br />my first seeing feature from geoffrey wright (romper stomper), when i first took interest in it, it seemed at the time an interesting concept...<br /><br />shakespere + aussie film + gothic setting + melbourne gangland<br /><br />a very odd mixed that turned into a disastrous piece of aussie cinema that gives my country a bad name...<br /><br />pros: -interesting concept<br /><br />cons: -waste of a good cast -stuffed and stupid plot -crooked camera angles -not much variety of locations -crap use of shakespearian diologue<br /><br />overall: australia's worst attempt of a shakespere film, stick to baz lurhman...or romper stomper (warning: that film is dangerous)
