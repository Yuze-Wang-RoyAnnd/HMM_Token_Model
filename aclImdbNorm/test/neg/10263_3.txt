the films use of blue-black and vibrant skin tones to create a noir-ish feel to this movie unfortunately do not work. in fact its quite irritating as it obscures the demon characters and reduces them to one dimensional beings.<br /><br />at least the original had an hysterical energy and the gore set-pieces were quite stunning. black gore is hardly frightening, nor is the main female demon at all frightening in her attempts to snarl and growl at the screen in her best camp lugosi style.<br /><br />the narrative is grossly disjointed and if you could imagine 'naked lunch' directed by russ meyer you may appreciate the attempt to be william burroughs-esque. otherwise give this film a wide girth. bava and argento fans - once again - are bitterly disappointed.
