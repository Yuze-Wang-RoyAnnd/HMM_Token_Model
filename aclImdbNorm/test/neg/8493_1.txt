i can just picture how this movie came to be:<br /><br />"so how else can we screw up our careers?" <br /><br />"i know! let's take a film that was wildly successful and make a sequel out of it!<br /><br />"perfect! we'll get b-grade actors who have half the charisma and want only 10% of carrey's original salary. we'll save millions and rake in a massive profit, never mind the fact nobody wants to see a second rate sequel with none of the original actors that made it popular in the first place! we as executives still honestly believe a movie was popular based on the name and story, not the actors who made it so in the first place!" <br /><br />"brilliant! let's put a massive budget and get the cheapest actors we can find!" <br /><br />and really, that's what son of the mask can be described as. just a simple b-grade movie that attempts to suck the life out of it's original classic.<br /><br />nevertheless, if the movie didn't contain the words the mask, or anything to do with the mask, it would be a nice kids movie. for all it's massive flaws and horrible acting, this really will appeal to kids. it's a good natured flick that really wants to scream out "like me!" but only those 8 and younger will truly enjoy it.<br /><br />jamie kennedy is the only worthwhile mention in this movie. he clearly is trying to make the material work, playing the desperate dad but the script is so poor, the only thing that spews out that is worthwhile was my drink after seeing this. the character of loki also deserves a mention, as he was the most enjoyable character and really one of the only reasons for older adults to see this film. it's too bad the character is wasted on this film, i would have really liked to have seen the character take on the true mask. instead, we are reduced to fart jokes and toilet humor near the end.<br /><br />the plot is so much by the books, i won't bother to mention it here. it's all so clearly obvious that even a disney exec would be green with envy.<br /><br />save your money, this one is heading to dvd in three months from the looks of it. shame on the studios for once again smearing a decent film with a horrible sequel. didn't dumb and dumberer teach them anything?
