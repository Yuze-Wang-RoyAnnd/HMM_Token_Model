this movie is not a comedy. it is not even funny in the "this movie is so bad it's funny" department. rather, it is just plain bad. other reviewers mention the bad lighting, but beyond that is the abundance of bad plastic surgery.<br /><br />meanwhile, a lot of great acting talent was wasted on a poor screenplay and uninspired direction. the main characters are one-dimensional and boring. (it is hard to feel sympathy for any of them). it is also hard to see the four characters as close friends. it seems like just a bunch of women thrown together, pretending to be close.<br /><br />i won't list all of the problems with this movie, as it doesn't merit that much of anyone's attention. (nor is it worth the time it takes to watch it).
