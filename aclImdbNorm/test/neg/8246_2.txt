this movie is so predictable when you know the modern american dream: do nothing, be a loser and then suddenly... whoah! you're a genius and an obnoxious one and the world is kissing the ground you are walking on.<br /><br />and surprisingly all the other smart people are losers. they don't know anything and are bitter when our wonderkid solves problems so easily. and what kind of problems? they are so difficult but still these professors can analyse the results in less than 10 seconds.<br /><br />every movie has something good in it anyway and robin williams is it in this one.
