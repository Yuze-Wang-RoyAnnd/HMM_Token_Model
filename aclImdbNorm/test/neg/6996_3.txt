you could see the final outcome from a mile away.all the signs were there....the prom,the liquor,the fast ride,the distraction of the females.... a good commercial for seatbelt usage,and later model vehicles that sit the passengers further back from the windshield.also,the ending is rather anti climatic,as the ford econoline van barely suffers a crease across its nose after hitting a bridge abuttment at high speed (highly unlikely).more damage to the van would have made it a little more believable.and why do these films always take place during/after a prom? is it a case of once you survive the prom,you will be good for life? more than anything else,it shows the lack of policing the prom for liquor,and not keeping tabs on the minors who are leaving the dance for a joyride.
