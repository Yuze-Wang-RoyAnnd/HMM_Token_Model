i bought the dvd of this movie because i am a fan of william devane and i was really disappointed about "a christmas visitor". the story of the movie is so boring and slow in the development that you just want to turn off your tv or dvd player after about the half of it. the dialogues are really bad and belong to a daily soap opera but not in a tv movie. william devane was alright in his part and he was acting quite good, but he did so much better in other movies and projects. meredith baxter was horrible and couldn't really bring the warm hearted mother to the viewers. instead she was playing very cool and wasn't better than a middle-class actress. i absolutely cannot recommend this movie. spare your time and your money for this one.
