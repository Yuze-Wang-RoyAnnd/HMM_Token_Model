the trailer is so deceiving... i thought this will be a good film... what was the point in bringing the women in hong kong for being killed? they could have done it in paris. and the fist half hour:<br /><br />-you love me!<br /><br />-no i don't! -you love me!<br /><br />-no i don't! -you love me!<br /><br />-no i don't!repeat for 100 times... then... well i don't love you... so i shoot you! :d so here is the reason why movie piracy is a good thing! imagine if i would have even give money for this torture! i'm sorry for the time i lost watching it... the film makers should pay me <br /><br />for the inconvenience... worst film ever seen...
