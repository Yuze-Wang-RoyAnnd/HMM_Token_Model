above all, you must not take this movie seriously. it takes itself seriously, unfortunately, but that can't be helped. this anime ninja flic has to be the crowning achievement in spoiling what could have been an endearing, if unoriginal, story with bad plot twists, ridiculous time-killing cutscenes, and one outrageous guest appearance which will either make you laugh or groan (or both, like me).<br /><br />while i'm typically a fan of ninja/samurai anime (ninja scroll and rurouni kenshin to name a few), this one has to be the exception. for the record, from a technical point of view of its time, this movie was very well animated and constructed. it is just the plot that stunk. the authors of this movie clearly decided (for what rational reason i don't know) that they could somehow make up for the lack of a script if the character halfway around the world in search of a treasure that (he learns) his father fought and died for. in the process, he saves a black slave named sam, meets a french girl who is living in an apache village, makes friends with a ninja clan whose members then try to kill him, meets more family members then he knew he had in the weirdest places and circumstances (and whom all subsequently die at some point in the movie).<br /><br />even so far, these ludicrous plot twists could be excused, but then come the two "guest appearances". #1: after having a ridicuously cliche showdown with two cowboys, jiro meets a man who introduces himself as "mark twain". at this point, you're probably saying "what the ****?!!" this "meeting" serves one purpose: it entirely discredits a movie which tries to add to itself an educated historical background. i found it disappointing that the authors went to all this trouble to research the 1860s us and didn't manage to realize that "mark twain's" real name was samuel clemens. #2: when jiro finally finds the treasure, it turns out that it used to belong to captain kidd. i can hear the groans of disgust now.<br /><br />finally, there are the running scenes. these scenes show various characters running, with the landscape moving statically behind them, for several minutes, and there are a lot of them. it is these scenes which make this movie, 2hrs 12 min, to seem to last a week and a half.<br /><br />if you and your friends are looking for a bad subtitled movie that just asks to be made fun of, this is it. feel free to poke fun at every possible aspect of it, and have fun. just don't take it seriously. 3/10
