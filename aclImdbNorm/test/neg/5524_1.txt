as other reviews have said, another of the countless number of alien clones, this time with a great wodge of the terminator thrown in, add a bit of the classic sf story "who goes there?", and a insanely stupid plot device lifted from the andromeda strain (apparently flashing red lights make rampaging killer 'droids unable to detect scared people standing three inches away from them).<br /><br />ok, the story: after a sequence of people running around in a space ship and killing each other we get a caption. <br /><br />"25 years later". <br /><br />the crew of a relay station orbiting mars, due to be relieved in 48 hours, detect a ginormous space ship on a collision course. it's the siberia, the ship we saw in the opening sequence. not a good time to have taken everything useful off-line on the relay station to do some repairs then. the approaching ship doesn't deviate from its course and is broadcasting a "do not under any circumstances enter this ship!" warning. after a lot of shouting at each other, the crew of the relay station patch something together and get the station out of the way just in the nick of time. but the ship changes course and rams them any way - impaling one of the crew on a stick-outy pointy crew impaler thing. the satellite starts to "loose integrity". bits de-pressurise. lots more shouting and running about in which only two crew people are sucked out into space backwards. (why are they always sucked out backwards?). <br /><br />after a few keystrokes the wheelchair bound techy (who is called 'wheeler' - the only only detectable joke in the whole movie) deduces that the siberia is draining them of all their power and they need to go aboard her and switch off its engines. they all go on-board and take their helmets off. "do not enter this ship!" obviously means get on board the ship and expose yourself to possibly fatal infectious diseases. one team head for the main computer room where they find a dead frozen guy clutching what looks like an american express card but turns out to be a minidisc. the other team find some switches. amazingly the dead bloke turns out to be the father of the attractive female crew member voted most likely to survive an encounter with a rampaging alien. they switch the engines off but this means the ships reactor will explode. a spooky point of view shot starts killing people. there's some guff about the siberia having discovered an new ore, a petential power source worth millions, which mean the more venal members of the crew immediately thrust themselves into danger to get hold of it. the pov shot returns with whoosh! whoosh! walking noises on the soundtrack. unfortunately these give you the idea the killer is wearing corduroy trousers and the effect is wasted.<br /><br />after that it's all just running around and getting killed in order of ugliness and acting ability, until only the obvious survivors survive - along with the cute dog which had managed to lead at least two crew members to their deaths. just why space hardened veterans wander into the jaws of certain death looking for their pets cats and dogs has long been a mystery of this kind of movie. other stupid highlights include everyone forgetting to act the falling levels of oxygen until reminded by the voice of the on-board computer (not that the low levels of oxygen in any way dampen any of the impressive fires this load of idiots start). if the killer droid id so clever it can steer the ship in a tight curve and have another go at ramming the relay station why didn't it turn off the "do not under any circumstances enter this ship!" warning signal.. i'm sure if it was looking for more people to kill then yelling go away! was not a good way of going about it.<br /><br />musetta vander is the only person who gets to do any acting - everyone else just flares their nostrils all the time while baring their teeth and shouting and pointing guns at each other. it that sort of script; full of exclamation marks - the only thing that kept me watching till the end was the hope that the script demand she take all her clothes off, or get wet while not wearing a lot. unfortunately it didn't. one of the things wrong with this movie (apart from it having more cyan put on screen than in any other movie ever) is that there was no gratuitous nudity.
