made and released at the time when the internet was just becoming huge, this is a storyline hitchcock would have loved.<br /><br />sadly, hitchcock wasn't around to make it, and we're left with an occasionally suspenseful but mostly silly thriller, that is held (barely) together by bullock's intelligence.<br /><br />it was released in 1995 but is already dated, and the amount of mistakes and inaccuaracies regarding computers must be seen to be believed, and you don't even have to be a dot.com person to spot them!
