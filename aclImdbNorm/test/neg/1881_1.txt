what really amazed me about this film was that it ringed so false. first of all, who in the late 80's (when the film takes place)lived like this family? a college professor wouldn't make enough money to support the lifestyle i saw on the film. hence, he and his stay home wife would be plagued by financial woes, especially when she gets cancer. second, streep is my age, and most women, particularly in her class (educated, white, well off) experienced the feminist movement. yet this woman seems oblivious to her anachronistic behavior. i actually felt that she was a very controlling woman who kept her husband an emotional child by taking care of his every need.<br /><br />the fact that so many people were moved by the film is amazing. i have admired carl franklin's films in the past, and i actually like meryl streep, but gad, what a manipulative and lying film this is.
