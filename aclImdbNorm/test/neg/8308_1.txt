i watched death machines as part of bci eclipse' drive-in cult classics (featuring crown international pictures releases) on dvd. as i work my way through the multiple dvd sets, i am growing to love many of crown international's movies -- especially, the creepy, erotic, psychological thrillers! <br /><br />death machines is not one of them.<br /><br />after seeing movies like malibu beach, the creeping terror and the pink angels, it is hard to say that this is the worst film ever made; but, it doesn't have much going for it.<br /><br />no plot; really no story to speak of.<br /><br />the acting isn't evident
