i am a regular reader of kathy reichs' temperance brennan novels. as such i am extremely surprised she even consulted on this show.<br /><br />it is horrible by comparison to the books. the temperance brennan character is, in the books, a down to earth recovering alcoholic and divorced mom of a college aged daughter. in 'bones', she is an arrogant (rhymes with rich), who, in typical p c fashion, is not a mother. the emphasis on her assisting staff, complete with lurid details of who has had how many sexual exploits, is totally in contrast with the books.<br /><br />in total deference to the p c movement, she portrays the enemies of the u s as peace lovers (!). some of the information isn't even correct, for example, having a character from afghanistan as an active member of an arab-american friendship group. since when is an afghan an arab?! i'm sure if negative references were made to 'disadvantaged minorities', or women, or glbt's, the show's producers/writers/directors would have to issue an apology. however, in typical far left fashion, all of the racial slurs go to the highest achieving minority group--asians, as david boreanaz' agent booth continually refers to angela montenegro as a 'squint'.<br /><br />forget that stuff, and forget this show. after 'the man in the suv' episode, i thought i'd try a second episode to see if it got any better. it only got worse! i don't even care if the teenager in question was murdered or committed suicide, and i won't be watching the show ever again.
