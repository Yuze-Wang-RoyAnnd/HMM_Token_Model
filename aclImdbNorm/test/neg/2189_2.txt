it starts off pretty well, with the accident and the decision not to return to la. but everything falls into place too quickly. there is a decent plot twist towards the end, but so many scenes that don't make sense. randy (played by brian austin green) comes home angry and ready to confront people and he takes the time to put on the club, when he parks his car in front of his house in the middle of nowhere? i don't want to spoil it, for anyone who does decide to see it, but the last 45 minutes are ridiculous. even the acting, which wasn't bad early on, turns bad towards the end. don't bother unless you want to see how bad it is.
