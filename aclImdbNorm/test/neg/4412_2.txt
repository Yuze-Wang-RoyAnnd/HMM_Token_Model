native chief's son is wrongfully accused for the death of his father. the evil witch doctor orders to execute him. he then comes back as a murdering tree(!), tabanga. well, what can you say about such a "film"? if it was intended to be a horror film, there obviously was some sort of bad judgment involved. and for a comedy, it still isn't funny enough. i don't know why people make films like this. i guess you have to be in a really silly mood to watch it. or you might want to see the incredible "monstrous" tree, which gives a new dimension to "a slow death". or maybe you want to check out the great acting skills by all involved. (ms. kilgore!) or the dialogue and screenplay, which were strangely ignored at the academy awards that year.<br /><br />"shouldn't we try psycho-analysis on that tree? maybe its mother was afraid of oaks." 2/10
