enormous suspension of disbelief is required where will's "genius" is concerned. not just in math--he is also very well read in economic history, able to out-shrink several shrinks, etc etc. no, no, no. i don't buy it. while they're at it, they might as well have him wearing a big "s" on his chest, flying faster than a jet plane and stopping bullets.<br /><br />among other problems...real genius (shelving for the moment the problem of what it really is, and whether it deserves such mindless homage) doesn't simply appear /ex nihilo/. it isn't ever so multi-faceted. and it is very rarely appreciated by contemporaries.<br /><br />better to have made will a basketball prodigy. except that damon's too short.
