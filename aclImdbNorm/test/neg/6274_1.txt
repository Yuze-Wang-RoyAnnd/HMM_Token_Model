this movie is so bad they should burn the master. you cant spoil the plot because this movie doesn't have one. the graphics are less than fake, they're horrendous. then you've got the rambling through the countryside star gazer work-a-holic who bounces between his own lunacy & the mad rantings of the crazed preacher. & when he finally makes it to dc, they don't even have the decency to kill him; the monster (which you don't know at the time) is already dieing but how ... who knows & of course it has the ultimate sappy ending... everybody else on the planet is dead or dieing but his family & a handful of stragglers survive. imagine that! this will be the movie that c thomas howell will go to his grave regretting he ever starred in. it probably gives him nightmares.
