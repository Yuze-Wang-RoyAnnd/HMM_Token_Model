i was not very excited to see this movie in the first place but a group of us decided to go see it on opening night. i felt like getting up and walking out and attempting to get my money back 20 minutes into this film. i felt that the movie was very boring, uninteresting, and not true in many aspects including "gaming". i tried my best not to fall asleep during the movie as i watched one of the worst horror films i have ever seen. the scary movie series was scarier than this movie. the sad attempt to pull in a gothic girl, an overworked business man, and 15 year old geek, and some random guy into a video game that kills you is a bad plot to begin with. then they try to throw in a very horrible love scene where the main character kisses another girl after saving her 10 minutes after his girlfriend was murdered. the theater was packed when the movie started by then end a little over half of the people had left before it was over. if you feel the need to waste only 1 hour and 16 minutes of your time seeing this movie ... prepare to feel cheated.
