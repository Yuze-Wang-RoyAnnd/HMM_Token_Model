i have seen about five or six episodes of this stupid show, and most of them i was forced to watch. and i did not like the episodes i saw. what happened to dan schneider? after giving us such awesome shows like drake and josh, why did he decide to create a stupid show like this? my problem is not just with dan, it is also with the guys who nominated this show for an emmy, were they drunk that day, or what's the problem? drake and josh didn't get nominated for an emmy, but it's way better than zoey 101. the makers of this show should be ashamed for the existence of this show, let's just hope the pregnancy of you know who will affect the show, or better yet it'll cause it to get canceled.
