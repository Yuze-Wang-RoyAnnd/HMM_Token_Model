czech cinematography is traveling through dark times... this movie is a tangible evidence. slama obviously wanted to make a mediocre documentary about fictive people, characteristic of their stupidity. a young and healthy boy who doesn't want to work and prefer to live in a decaying shack with a feckless alcoholic aunt. because of the idiocy of tonik, who's just able to announce "dad, i'll not work in the factory" (i'd really like to know why); i understand the condition of his "house", but i'm really not able to digest the horrible mess around. cramped sentimentality everywhere. why didn't monika escort her boy to work abroad? young czech couples do it very often. and take someone else's children to live in a devastated barn... that's too much.<br /><br />irresponsible mother (badly acted by geislerov'a), naive & stupid boy (tonik), silly and confused girl (monika)... yes, somebody has already told it - badly directed and acted soap opera. actors like martin huba, bolek polivka, tatiana wilhelmova and simona stasova did their best, but unfortunately it couldn't save the whole piece.
