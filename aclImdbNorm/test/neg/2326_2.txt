i bought the video for lb13 at hmv (we pay more in britain) as a friend had told me it was highly rated and the reviews on this site were generally impressive.<br /><br />i have to say that the opening credits were a let down...the dancing/music not very powerful.<br /><br />the car ride and unexpected crash just as the lady passenger was going to be harmed was a nice touch,..something unexpected...though the way she walked away from the car with hair perfectly groomed and still carrying a handbag looked corny for most directors ..but for lynch was something else.<br /><br />her dazed walking around after such a shock was enhanced by a regular low noise similar to fingers scraping along a blackboard; i thought another lynch master touch perhaps portraying the demons gnawing into her shocked and traumatised self conscious. after a while this noise became somewhat annoying and on further investigation i discovered the new video cassette squeaked.<br /><br />i dont know whether this squeak took away a lot of my enjoyment but this movie became a waste of time.(and money)<br /><br />the two female characters had some presence and the lesbian scenes were fair enough, though predictable. there were no male characters of any merit and apart from a few vaguely good scenes (the hoover switching on )there were far too many dreadful scenes that were plain weak and ridiculous. eg, the coffee being spat into the napkin by the menacing loon and the silly monster face at the back of the diner. oh and what about the paint in the wifes jewels..boring and naff.<br /><br />this whole film gives you the feel of the failed genius..you know when you listen to the worst dylan track ever and think my god that was embarrassing....was that really bob?<br /><br />the whole feel is that of a failed tv movie , badly put together with a few (not many) extra bits to give it a 15 rating.<br /><br />i whizzed it on during the last 30 minutes .<br /><br />do i give it another chance and watch again. if i want to be puzzled and work hard at understanding a film i will watch frank woods guide to consolidated accounting.<br /><br />lynch did one classic ..blue velvet and straight story was nice.<br /><br />this, like wild at heart, was a let down ; his weirdness is now predictable and stale. anybody want to buy a 2nd hand video?<br /><br />make way for some younger original talent, david.<br /><br />four out of ten (and no more). sorry.
