another pretentious film from vicente aranda. if "juana la loca" shinned of the same, at least its quality was superior (mainly thanks to the great performance of pilar l'opez de ayala), but "carmen" is boring and full of topics (ardent brunette with a dagger in the stocking, poor man dragged to madness due to passion, sierra nevada gangs, "toreros",...)<br /><br />obviously paz vega is a pretty woman, but about its talent there're more doubts, and sbaraglia role is so stupid that results almost incredible. the script is weak and and aranda's presumptuous character influences the entire film. with these ingredients the result could not be good.<br /><br />not the worst film i've seen, but a complete failure, in my opinion.
