when a loser teen is bitten by an insect, he becomes the superhero dragonfly...<br /><br />superhero movie is the latest spoof movie to hit the screens. sadly however, despite the presence of david zucker (who was involved with airplane!, top secret and the naked gun movies) it still suffers from the fault most recent spoofs have...mainly it's more dumb than fun! the fault mainly lies with the gags. it's simply not funny enough. some of the jokes do work, such as the nail gun scene, but other parts simply fall flat. the x-men spoof for example, or the whole farting sequence. blazing saddles this isn't! one of the key things about the best spoof movies, like airplane is that although the dialog is extremely funny, the cast for the most part play is completely straight. this makes it even funnier. even when there is simple dialog in the foreground, there may well be funny things happening behind the cast. again funny. the other key thing is that they all have a plot of sorts, to hang the gags on.<br /><br />the recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies, then try and spoof them. as a result the so-called plot of these movies very rarely exist. another flaw these movies have, is that some of the scenes were actually funny in the original versions, and in most cases even funnier than the spoof scene! the cast try to get into the spirit required, but with a lot of unfunny dialog and scenes, it's hard to get worked up about it.<br /><br />as recent spoof movies go, it's not as bad as epic movie, date movie, or the awful meet the spartans, but considering that some people involved here have made good, funny movies in the past, it's nowhere near good enough.
