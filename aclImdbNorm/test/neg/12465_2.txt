the box to this movie totally misrepresents itself. the cover shows a view of legs & panties in a short skirt. the title is `tart.' the synopsis on the back of the box made it seem as though cat, the main character, was an outcast who became one of the popular students, but that popularity lead to a bizarre lifestyle that she could not escape from. everything that the box built this movie up to was a horrible lie. i expected a sort of crappy, direct-to-video version of `heathers' targeted at the teenagers of today.<br /><br />let me tell you what `tart' was really about. yes, this really is the plot; so if you don't want to know what happens, stop reading. we have one unlikable, boring rich girl. this unlikable girl's best friend is a skank. the skank gets expelled from school, so the unlikable girl befriends some british girl. this leads to the unlikable girl dating this boring guy, who the box refers to as the `most popular boy in school.' if that guy was the most popular guy in their school, i wish i would have gone to that high school, because i could have kicked the crap out of him. anyway, as any movie will tell you, the most popular guy in school is invariably a murderer or drug addict or thief, or in this case, all of the above. anyway, everyone ends up disliking the unlikable main character because she is jewish. then the most popular guy in school beats her best friend, the skank, to death with a rock because the skank caught the most popular boy in a homosexual act. the unlikable girl's stoic mother and hypochondriac younger brother are there for her at the end. oh, and the entire movie is about snotty rich kids and their horrible parents too. gee, what is wrong with that? that sounds like a fantastic movie! well, that's what i thought. but you see, there are no likeable characters in this movie. the main character is boring. the filmmakers made her average, while during the film she keeps spouting off about what a freak she is. the skank is not skanky enough, and has little screen time. the popular guy is nothing to write home about. the popular girls are just your run-of-the-mill rich girls. there are no moral lessons. cat, the boring main character, is not a freak, does not ever become one of the truly popular girls, and (worst of all) after all the crap she goes through, she thinks she is still too good to befriend the only nice girl, the dorky girl. to be honest, i have no idea why the movie is called tart. i kept asking, who's the tart? is she the tart? are they all tarts? at 94 minutes, theoretically this is not a long movie. but after actually watching this awful waste of a vhs tape, and not knowing who the tart was, i was surprised that the movie was only an hour and a half. the movie felt like it was two hours and some change. after a while, i was hoping the movie would be about pop tarts. at least when you look at a box of pop tarts, you know what to expect.
