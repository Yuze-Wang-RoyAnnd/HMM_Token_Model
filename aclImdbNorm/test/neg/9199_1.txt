it's just a bad film.not as bad as r.i.c.c.o. but bad.it got me hooked at the beginging then totally lost me after that.the acting was way off then on then going way way way off.do not see this movie at all costs,trust me with all my heart!!!!the directors who are brothers are not the next hughes brothers,who made really great films like dead presidents,from hell,american pimp,and menace ii society.the only person who made me watch this was the acting of paris campbell,who will be a great actor one day if he makes better films than this.christina caparoula also did a nice job for what she got.i hope the fittest is 10 times better than this piece of crap!
