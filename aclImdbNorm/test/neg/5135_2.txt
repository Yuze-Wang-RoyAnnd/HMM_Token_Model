yeah, i made it all the way to the end. it was pretty hard though.<br /><br />sometimes i was wondering if there was even a director on set. the acting...well, i don't even know what to say. i thought the girl who played emily tried her best with the boring, sometimes wacky and sometimes predictable dialog. <br /><br />i know that it was low budget but the hollow sound and the lighting unfortunately made it look and sound like a 100-minute-long audition tape. <br /><br />i'm not even going to talk about the ending...<br /><br />the best thing about the movie was the music.<br /><br />that being said, i do not recommend this movie to anyone. even for lesbians who don't have many movies to watch overall, this is nothing to waste your time on. if you're looking for a sad lesbian themed movie, check out the children's hour, lost and delirious or high art. those will all leave you depressed and gloomy but you won't have to suffer cinematic hell in the process.
