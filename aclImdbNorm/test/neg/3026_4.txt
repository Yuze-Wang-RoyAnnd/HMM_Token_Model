directed by e. elias merhige "begotten" is an experiment with a few interesting ideas that don't quite succeed in what they were trying to do. the film is a 76 minute ultra slow, questionably effective, irritating experience that tries to present an intriguing philosophy about the creation of the earth and human nature.<br /><br />it opens with god presented as a chair-bound psychopathic man who tears open his stomach using a knife. from the guts, blood and human waste mother nature emerges. she proceeds to impregnate herself with the dead god's semen. later she gives birth to the son of the earth. a retard who is constantly abused a group of cannibalistic people whom i believe to be the representation of mankind.<br /><br />"begotten" takes a twisted and disturbing look on the origin of life. demonstrating the self-destructive nature, violence, lust and greed that have become a trademark for mankind. the problem in the movie come from two points. one is that the film is just too slow in it's exhibition. what we get is a good thirty minutes spent on showing how the son of the earth is constantly shaking naked on the ground while at the same time being molested and tortured by mankind. such tasteless prolonging gets boring pretty fast and lacks the punch in delivering a blow to the viewer's senses.<br /><br />another point is "beggoten's" visual appearance and sound. the grainy, inverted, black and white low frame cinematography enchants the disturbing factor of the plot, but such novelties often work in only short periods of time. then gradually begin to lose their effect as the audience becomes accustomed to the look. the audio suffers from the same problems. it's constant repetitive and similar sounds become annoying so fast i had an urge to turn off the volume. "begotten" loses it's charm shortly after it begins. it tries to be original and creative but it fails to expand on the ideas hinted by the vague plot instead it repeats the same scene again and again.<br /><br />the conclusion is that "begotten" is stuck in one moment. even though plot-wise it tries to move forward, the visuals and audio remain the same throughout. showing the same action in a slightly different way with just slightly a different sound. a gimmick cannot alone make a movie. it also needs pace and variety, something merhige seems to have forgotten.
