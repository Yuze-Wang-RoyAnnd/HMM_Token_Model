"chairman of the board" is a ridiculously stupid film from the popular comic carrot top (also seen on the 1-800-collect commercials). he plays a surfing inventor who comes upon a man who has a flat tire. top helps him out and a few days later discovers the guy's died and has given his company to the comedian. even if someone else was in carrot top's role, it still would have been bad. the jokes (which are constantly rigged throughout) are terrible and the idea of a romantic "plot twist" should have been discarded. do not watch!!!
