alexandra maria lara: a very beautiful and enticing woman, but not a good actress. in all the films i've seen her in, she appears to me as the exact same character. whether it be in the downfall, nackt, vom suchen und finden der liebe and now wo ist fred! she always is (plays?) the young, good-hearted woman, who is a little naive and doesn't know how to handle the things happening to her. she disposes of a repertoire of probably five different facial expressions that she works with abundantly. i personally have a hard time believing that she could play a mysterious and slightly obnoxious character because it just isn't in here. so she's typecast as the nice girl next door, which she is, but, once again, she ain't up to snuff when it comes to acting. til schweiger: same thing! the film: downright stupid. as it was an american movie it would have been a great role for adam sandler who i don't like either. i wasn't offended by the fact that this is a film with handicapped people in it, i just thought that the jokes resulting from this weren't funny at all. i chuckled twice or three times but when i was halfway through it, i was just bored and annoyed and wanted this flick to end.
