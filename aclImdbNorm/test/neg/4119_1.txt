i can't remember the last time a movie was so boring that i walked out. the weatherman and the island were both so bad that i thought about it but i even stayed to the end in those. this movie was incomprehensible, not funny and just went on and on and on. like some other commentators, i wondered if parts were just french humor that i didn't get or if the characters were serious. i finally just gave up and tried napping because i didn't want to disturb my husband if he was enjoying it but he noticed and let me know that it was okay if i wanted to leave and out the door we went. he would like to know how it ended...if denevue lived or died etc...(i don't even care).
