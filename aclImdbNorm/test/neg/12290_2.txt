saw this at the video store and thought i'd give it a try. sounded like a good story and the cover looked good. that was it. the characters looked good, and the actor who played "noel", was the most convincing, though he didn't have any heavy time in the movie. i find it really hard to give a movie a bad rating, but this is one, in a minute number, that gets it my book. as the movie went along i kept wanting it to get better but to no avail. asthetically, it was good. the sound and lighting was good, but the acting in this film killed it for me. it was like watching a low grade soap opera. i just kept saying, "i can't believe they released this move like this". i paused several times out of sheer unbelief that the acting was that bad. there's so much i want to say but i'll just say this, everything else, for the most part, was good, it was the acting, as a final cut, that really did this film in.
