this movie was so stupid i couldn't believe what i was seeing as i was watching it, it was like a huge train wreck -- i couldn't look away because it was just so horribly awful! i can honestly say i've never seen anything this bad in my whole entire life. it was so cheesy and the acting was just so deplorable that i just kept thinking "this just has to be some kind of a joke, right? nobody would actually make a movie this crappy on purpose, right?" i really hope this is all just a bad joke and these people don't actually expect people to watch this with a straight face, and i really hope the people who were in this movie were doing terrible acting on purpose and don't actually believe that they are good actors?! the drag queens are pretty funny to watch, though, and so are the cheesy special effects straight out of a bad 80's sci-fi movie.<br /><br />only watch this if you've already seen every other movie in existence first and there is nothing left to watch at all! i would give this a "0" if it were possible.
