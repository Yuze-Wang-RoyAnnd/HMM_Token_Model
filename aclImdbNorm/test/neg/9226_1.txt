if the following sounds tempting, then by all means rush down to your local blockbuster and rent this movie post-haste:<br /><br />1. awful 60's hairstyles, from pathetic perms to dodgy ducktails.<br /><br />2. the worst child actor in the world ever, who does nothing but cry and say daddy in the most annoying voice imaginable.<br /><br />3. lots of stock footage of alligators and monkeys that doesn't mesh with the film. at all.<br /><br />4. stereotypical indians who use blowpipes and talk gobbledegook. oh, and it goes without saying they whoop around a campfire.<br /><br />5. hilariously fake plane crash mechanics where the cast actually throw themselves into the corners of the cardboard set.<br /><br />6. the exterior shots of 5, which look suspiciously like a toy jet on a string being led around a studio lit with blue light.<br /><br />7. terrible special effects which make the ones used in the first star trek series look cutting edge by comparison. ( special mention: the little boy's blond hair glowing. oh dear..) <br /><br />8. laughable editing and continuity, where background items move between scenes, the soundtrack changes completely without any warning etc.<br /><br />9. not got enough money to hire a professional dancer? get any lady from off the street to prance about like an idiot! no-one will notice the difference! er..<br /><br />10. a 'thrilling' climax involving quicksand, snakes (more stuff from the archives) and a ton of fake blood. don't forget to put in a stupid 'tribal' sounding song either!<br /><br />the more sensible among you however, will wait for it's inevitable appearance on mst3k when this classic tv show is resurrected and then you can watch it in the spirit it was intended. any other kind of enjoyment to be derived from this crap is unthinkable.. not to mention unworkable. so don't even try it. 0/10
