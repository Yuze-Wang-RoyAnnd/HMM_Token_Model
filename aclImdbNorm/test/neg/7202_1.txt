this is just about the worst piece of garbage i've ever had the displeasure of sitting through. the story was embarrassingly amateurish, the graphics were horrible, and the acting... i've never seen worse acting in my entire life. a kindergarten class could come up with a scarier, better written, and more entertaining concept than this. i pity anyone who wastes their time on this film, as well as the actors who agreed to doing the job. it was obvious that they were not given appropriate direction. the writers must have spent their time at film school in the "back room" playing peaknuckle. a lot of professors wasted a lot of time on these two. i would be truly embarrassed to admit that i knew them.
