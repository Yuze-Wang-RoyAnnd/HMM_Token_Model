french cinema sucks! down with all these psychiotric visions with their my-god-am-i-cultivated distinguished attitudes! pestilence to conceited symbolic film-language and impervious chiffres! i'll no longer have a mind for that! l'eos carax, did you ever think about, that a dialogue in a film could be natural and vivid??? maybe i'm too common to understand you? or had it been your task to confirm all the clich'es of a frenchman the world can have? guillaume the to-be-guilliotined comes to his home-palace, mme. deneuve, not in the picture, plays the flute: "here am i, darling!" in this moment, i knew, that she's in the bathtub, and we`ll see her lying in there soon. don't misunderstand me, i'm not prudish, and the incestous sex scene was the climax of the film. but this is, in berlin, we say "etepetete", what means something like "^etre-peut-^etre", a snobistic, self-satisfied, and, the worst, seen that often in french movies i can tell! other example: she, beautiful and willing, is looking at herself in a mirror, combing her hair, and her wild-bearded, dirty young guru rushs into the room, breathless shouting: "there's no escape, there's no escape!" forty years after existencialistic sartres and consorts- what's new, what's exciting about? my god, there's that woman and she loves and admires you, what would be more natural to be happy with your life? and when you're not, please explain much better, why!! born french means you have to live a life in extravaganza, no escape, is that the point?
