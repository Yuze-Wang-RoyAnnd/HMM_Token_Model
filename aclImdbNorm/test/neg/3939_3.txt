seriously, if you want to see a clich'e horror movie you have to see this one i guess. it contains all the " scary parts where nothing happens ", " the nerd type who actually isn't killed", " boy and girl coming together and surviving", "facing an old child-fear" etc... i can go on. i wanted to see this movie cause i tought the mix of a video game and a movie would work out. guess i was wrong. which makes the movie more bearable? it is only 1hour17min so if you are bored it might be a good idea although i rather stay bored. why absolutely not see it? frankie munitz aka malcolm is just irritating as the nerd-type. i could smack the guy and it is so sad he didn't die earlier and in the end he even comes back. see something else!
