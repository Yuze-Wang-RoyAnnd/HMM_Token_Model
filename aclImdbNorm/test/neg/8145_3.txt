two years after this short, the last "our gang" short was made. after seeing this, you wonder how it even lasted that much longer. the quality of "our gang" nosedived soon after moving from hal roach to mgm, and this short is a perfect example. the gags are all very unfunny and froggy's last line of this being the happiest day of his life paints a bad picture in your mind of what it's like for him the rest of the time. a very poor example of film making.
