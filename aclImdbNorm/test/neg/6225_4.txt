relentless like one of those loud action movies. the entire cast seems to be on speed. i didn't quite get the director's intentions if any. i wonder if she's ever seen a stanley donen, vincent minnelli or even a george sidney musical. structure, please! this is one hell of a mess and i loved abba. the costumes the unflattering photography - unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations) the one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of meryl streep making a fool of herself. no chemistry with her friends (christine baranski and julie walters) think of streep with lily tomlyn in the altman film and you'll understand what i was hoping for. i was embarrassed in particular by pierce brosnam and colin firth. the audience, however, seemed to enjoy it so it probably it's just me.
