maybe it was the excessive weight gain seagal had put on. or maybe it was the horrible acting of wayans in an action flick. or was it the total lack of chemistry between the two leading characters? these and other considerations lead me to conclude that seagal should have never made this acting nightmare. true, the story line was good. yet, as an avid follower of seagal's career and background, his physical appearance was inconsistent with his genre of clean, pure, healthy zen buddhist living, notably in his on screen discussions with wayans. (then again his real life affair with the "nanny" was inconsistent also!)<br /><br />if seagal wants to become a more diversified actor, then he should do what a fellow action figure did in "kindergarten cop"...put humorous material or situations in the script where the actor has no choice but to react in a comical way. otherwise, leave the wise-cracks and the futile attempts at humor out of it while chasing a serial killer. seagal is not a natural humor type of guy. it did not work.<br /><br />
