this movie is a clumsy mishmash of various ghost-story and suspense-thriller conventions, none of them fully realized and all of them rather irritating. the script was perfunctory. the acting, ditto. the scary fx were mostly laughable except for one exquisite seat-jumper moment that scared me even though i saw it coming a mile off. now, explain to me someone why you would need ghosts, and black magic, and arcane ritual objects, and count crapula cg boogeymen, and psychic investigators, and family curses, and irish superstitions, and bowls of milk left out for the supernatural beings, and possessed dollies, all in the same movie? with all that you would expect more than one good moment of horror, but this movie is lame, lame, lame.
