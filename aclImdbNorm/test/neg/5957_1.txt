spoilers<br /><br />this movie was rented as a joke, and what a joke it was. the film is based on a dog catcher who is looking for el chupacabra. the dog catchers outfit is so ridiculous. it looks like he sewed the patch on his hat and for some reason he shows of his "muscles" by rolling up his sleeves. throughout the movie, mostly at night, you can see how bad the lighting was. they are in a car which is brightly lit and they are driving in pitch black. often you can see the camera man's shadow on the ground. the costumes are terrible, the lighting is terrible, and the acting is terrible. this is a good movie for a laugh...maybe.
