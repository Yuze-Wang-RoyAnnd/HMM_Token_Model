i just caught this on showtime...ewwwwwww, not even fun in a bad movie kind of way. one of the lamest monster flicks i've ever seen. plus the tv reporter in the movie was that annoying jerri from a past season of survivor. the only amusing thing was that the "secret base" was the house from fantasy island (and a million other movies and tv shows; the place is located in the l.a. area). i fully expected mr roarke and tattoo to come out and greet the visitors. if tattoo had gotten eaten by the snake, i might have given this movie a 2, but oh well. watching people stand there and scream for five minutes while the komodo or the cobra loomed over them instead of making a run for it was pretty funny, especially because you could really tell that they were just screaming at an empty spot where the computer animators would later paint in the monster. i nearly fell out of my chair, though, when in a flashback scene they brought in either the cobra or the komodo - then normal size - in some indestructible solid steel container with some air holes drilled into it. wouldn't a wire cage have sufficed? lol! guess they couldn't afford to rent a real komodo and cobra. i have to remember i rent showtime for their series and not their movies.
