i love oddball animation, i love a lot of asian films, but i didn't love this particular product of japan. the fuccons are supposedly an american family (they're all mannequins) who have moved to japan, and they're somewhat a 50's sitcom type family, with slightly more modern sensibilities at times. the dvd features several very short episodes (like less than 5 minutes each?) and i did not find it to be either funny or entertaining, not even in a weird way. i'm not sure what the appeal is of this. i did pick up on some satire here and there, gosh, who wouldn't, but satire is usually somewhat humorous, isn't it? and nothing i saw or heard rated even a little smirk. i picked this up used and it certainly sounded appealing, but i guess either i'm missing the point or it's just plain lame. the box even says it's fuccon hilarious, right there on the front, but i beg to differ. 2 out of 10.
