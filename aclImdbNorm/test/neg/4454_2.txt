a lot of alistair maclean's books have made it onto the big screen. some of them (the guns of navarone, fear is the key, where eagles dare) have been translated rather well; some (breakheart pass, ice station zebra, the secret ways) have been passable enough; a few (river of death, bear island, the way to dusty death) have been pretty rotten. caravan to vaccares is another movie based on one of maclean's perennially popular bestsellers, but alas this is yet another that deserves adding to the "rotten" list. peopled by uninteresting characters who get into uninteresting situations and escapades, caravan to vaccares is an absolute failure, both as a thriller and an entertainment. its only semi-redeeming qualities are: a) that it is filmed on very attractive provence locations, and: b) charlotte rampling looks utterly ravishing (with fully nude scenes to boot) as the main female character.<br /><br />disillusioned american drifter neil bowman (david birney) is travelling aimlessly through france when he meets british photographer lila (charlotte rampling). they decide to accompany each other, and during their wanderings make the acquaintance of mysterious nobleman duc de croyter (michel lonsdale). the duc persuades the pair to aid him in protecting and escorting hungarian scientist zuger (michael bryant), who is sought by various shady parties because of some information that he is carrying in his head. kept secret from bowman and lila is the fact that zuger has discovered a secret formula for using solar power as cheap, economical energy. the hungarian needs desperately to get his formula to new york, but hired guns have been put on his trail to capture him
