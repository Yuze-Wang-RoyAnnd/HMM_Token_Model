this is one of the worst movies ever there is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and they are literally walking on land and they added bubbles! the shark is boring and is just this big slow computer generated silly thing. antonio sabato is horrible, i mean even worse than normal. how does this guy work? the directing is the worst and there is nothing redeemable in the entire films. i love shark movies and this one just disappoints. i've seen this studios movies before and everything they do has some star on their way down doing bad work. i'd rather see an unknown actor who cares about making a good story.
