i was forced to watch 'changi' last year in year 10 australian history. looking around the class room, both classes, all 40 students were nearly asleep, all 40 heads on the table whispering to the person next to them. i refuse to believe that because i am only 16, that my opinion doesn't count, having studied world war two, i not only felt embarrassed and ashamed watching this australian piece of trash television. i was out of my mind at the appalling effort this mini series applied in the usage of film elements. the acting was poor, the screenplay was very inaccurate and the score was dreadful. please, do not watch this film, it is bias and very racists (to the japans).
