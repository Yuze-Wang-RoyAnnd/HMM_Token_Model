this is a good blueprint for a study of corporate power and the dichotomoy between required public life and the need for privacy. robert taylor has been primed by corporate head burl ives as a surrogate son to replace him as head of the corporation. he sends him to england to negotiate a deal, where taylor is both taken aback by the ethics and morality of the men he is dealing with and manages to fall in love with a refugee while he's at it. he comes back emtpy handed, having done his duty but having told the truth to the english about his motives. he attempts to marry the refugee rather than the boss's niece and so begins an attempt by ives to discredit the refugee as a suitable wife for a corporate executive. it could have been gritter, nastier and less romantic - the amount of time spent on the romance skews the film away from the points it's trying to make about corporate ethics.<br /><br />somehow the costume design was nominated (undeservedly) for an oscar - it's all business suits and the two women in the film dress conservatively - studio politics at work yet again, no doubt.<br /><br />what is stiking however is the black and white cinemascope cinematography which is excellent - this if anything deserved the oscar nom. (it was mgm's first 'scope film in b&w).<br /><br />not as good as it could have been but not terrible either.
