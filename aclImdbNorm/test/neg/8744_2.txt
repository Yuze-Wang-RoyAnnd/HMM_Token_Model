this joins the endless line of corny, predictable 50's sci-fi shlock out there. as usual, it's pretty bad. there isn't much of a plot that i could detect and the over-exaggeration of the leads only adds to the unintentional laughs. the title is misleading also. catching this on mst3k is probably the only way for it to be viewed, and it's better left that way.
