i am very interested in animal children and i have read many edger rice burroughs novels -- but this awful movie couldn't keep me interested, nor could i stomach all the absurd, unrealistic scenes. i only managed to sit through the africa part and john's first few days in scotland. let's talk about 'unrealistic' and 'downright silly'! the actors in ape suits looked like extra large chimps, rather than great apes (there is a difference). they did not move with the grace that a wild animal would. (for comparison, see some of the better planet of the apes movies where they trained their actors to move in simian fashion). the apes eat large haunches of meat -- not a common ape practice as far as i know. i am a sucker for animal stories but the script did not make me care about the apes. the great white hunters of the expedition that finds john clayton are charicaturish entirely. the parents of clayton were shipwrecked on an ocean beach, but somehow it is a very long trip down the river to get to the coast -- give me a break! let's talk about 'slow'. even the folks who think this is an excellent movie admit that it is not an action movie. far from it. it tries to be a character study -- unfortunately the downright silly part predominates! i did not read burroughs' tarzan books, but many of his other series -- they were packed with meaningful action and heroic purpose! this film just isn't there.
