210 minute version (extremely hardcore, or so i hear) or the r-rated version released into theaters? both are terribly awful, of course. peter o'toole and malcolm mcdowell have both claimed they wish they had never made this film (the latter of the two men reported this in an imdb interview!), and i can see why. nothing but a nonsensical mess of softcore porn and a half-hearted attempt at a plot.<br /><br />not much of anything here, other than cheap tricks and stupid scenes. i liked what mcdowell himself said about the film: "it was like one moment i'd be staring, admiring my mule or something, and the next scene would be two lesbians going at it."<br /><br />how true.<br /><br />what an awful movie.<br /><br />1/5 stars.
