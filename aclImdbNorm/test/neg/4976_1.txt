unforgiven is clint eastwoods last tribute to the once great west. but whilst i thought this was going to be good and raise the bar for future westerns to come i was sadly mistaken. unforgiven, though simple in plot it falls flat on characters and emotions and i would certainly say that unforgiven is eastwoods worst film to date. eastwoods himself seems too old to play the part of acting and directing which also adds a downfall to the overall look of the film.<br /><br />all the characters seem rushed and ragged around the edges especially eastwoods character. the acting doesn't seem to flow and contribute to what the characters are feeling. the direction is poorly misled by quirky shots. so overall unforgiven is not eastwoods best and by far one of the worst westerns around.
