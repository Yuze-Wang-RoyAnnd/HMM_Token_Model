recap: a lone swordsman, living in the desert and acting as an agent to other swordsmen, recollects how his life turned out to be as it is. it started with that the woman he loved chose to marry his brother instead, causing him to leave his home town. one of the swordsmen is huang who is himself in the middle of a complicated love story, where a woman wants to have him killed for having ran away from a promise to marry her younger sister. but the sister wants to hire a swordsman to have huang protected, and everything is put to an edge when the woman and her sister is really the same person.<br /><br />comments: i've seen the redux version released in 2008 of the original that was released in 1994. how the two versions differ i can't say, but the redux is very heavily stylized in the way of chinese wuxia action. that is unfortunate as that style to me seems to have forgotten one of the most important elements of a successful and entertaining movie. a comprehensible story. but true to its style scenery and visual elements seem much more important and much more in focus of writer and director kar wai wong. therefore there are lots of colorful, very beautiful scenes, that are completely unrelated to the story.<br /><br />the editing and timeline of the story is also mishandled. much is left out in the scenes, the time line is broken and rearranged in a confusing way. very slow and calm scenes are suddenly relieved by surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated fights, only to themselves being relieved by something else and unrelated. the result is a confusing and very uninteresting movie.<br /><br />thanks to these brutal but very few fights, the movie is put into the action genre. the poster and photographs also imply this but could almost be regarded as false marketing. only a few minutes out of the 90 could be considered as anything like action, the other couldn't be farther away from it. the movie in its entirety is very slow, dull and hence very boring. not even the rare action filled scenes help since they are so disconnected from the rest of the movie.<br /><br />i might say that i'm not a fan of this chinese style, since they often seem to be afflicted of these same problems, most importantly that the visual is more important than the story, but ashes of time redux is perhaps the worst example i've seen.<br /><br />3/10
