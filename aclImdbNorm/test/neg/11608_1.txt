this movie is about pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winers who think they have something interesting to say, performed by pathetic, spoiled, ego-driven winers who think they are interesting. straight from the coke-filled gutters of new york's arty farty incestuous drama scene.<br /><br />how so many viewers get tricked into making them think this carries any substance remains a mystery to me. maybe they secretly long to belong too to this overpaid and overestimated 'actor guild' or maybe they have never seen a decent movie?<br /><br />get out, put your hands in the dirty earth and get a real job. otherwise, kill your self with a real gun.
