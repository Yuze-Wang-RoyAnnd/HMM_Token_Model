i am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60s--films so ridiculous and silly that they are good for a laugh. so, because of this it's natural that i'd choose this film--especially because with john agar in it, it was practically guaranteed to be bad. sadly, while it was a bad film, it was the worst type of bad film--dull beyond belief and unfunny. at least with stupid and over-the-top bad films, you can laugh at the atrocious monsters and terrible direction and acting. here, you never really see that much of the monster (mostly due to the darkness of the print) and the acting, while bad, is more low energy bad...listless and dull.<br /><br />the film begins with some young adults going to satan's hollow to neck. well, considering the name of the place, it's not surprising when they are later found chewed to pieces! duh...don't go necking at satan's hollow!! well, there are reports of some sort of crashing object from the sky, so what do the teens go? yep, throw a dance party--a very, very, very slow dance party where the kids almost dance in slow motion. so it's up to the sheriff (agar) and his men to ensure that the teens can dance in peace without fear of mastication.<br /><br />as for the monster, it's some guy in a gorilla suit with a silly mask--a bit like the monster in robot monster. not exactly original and not exactly high tech. to make it worse, it makes snorting noises and moves very, very slowly--so slow that even the most corpulent teen could easily outrun it! how it manages to kill repeatedly is beyond me.<br /><br />overall, too dull to like--even if you are a fan of lousy cinema.
