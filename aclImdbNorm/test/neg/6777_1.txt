i saw this cartoon accidentally on television one night when i couldn't get to sleep. it didn't help in the slightest. i found myself staring up at the ceiling, trying to forget that face. i could quite happily never see this cartoon again, simply because of that face.<br /><br />now, don't get me wrong - i love fairy tales and nursery rhymes as much as anyone. but this twisted and terrifying rendition simply is disturbing. it is mainly the cruel laughter, and the exaggerated features that terrify me, and i still have nightmares because of it. please, i urge you not to allow your children to see this. it is far, far too scary. please, i pray you, keep it away.
