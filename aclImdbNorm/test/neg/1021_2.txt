southern cross, written and directed by james becket is a waste of good celluloid and actor's efforts. a formula film is not necessarily bad if it pays off on it's promise, which this film does not. it is a tiresome concoction of movie cliches that can be traced to a thousand different films from the past. it is full of random and empty plot twists that add nothing but aimless action, such as a trip by the protagonists to a ghost town where the villains (unexplainedly) follow them. this was obviously concocted as an excuse for a shoot out and escape scene bordering on the preposterous, with people popping in and out of doorways and running past windows while firing pistols at each other. it makes one believe that somebody told becket there was a ghost town in the chilean foothills and he said, "oh great, lets do a shoot out scene there."<br /><br />don't even waste your rental money on this. it is a bunch of random bits and pieces from a hundred different films thrown together to call an action drama.
