this movie tries its darndest to capture that classic bad canadian movie feel:<br /><br />"quirky" and obnoxious characters (a few); "quirky" town with "quirky" folk; a "quirky" coffee shop or restaurant (coffee shop here); lots of shots of canadian stuff for postcards (ocean stuff here); lots of mention of "gotta get out of this town"; downright booooring.<br /><br />and it succeeds on all counts.<br /><br />something to note, though. i couldn't figure out whether this movie was just trying to be post-northern exposure "quirky" comedy or something surreal like a drug-induced or psychotic hallucination. the editing of this movie jumped around nonsensically from one unrelated thing to another with zero pacing or motivation. not to mention the fact that half the time we didn't even know where we were jumping. take for instance, the very opening shots, of yelling teens in a car. who are they and what the h--- did they have to do with anything? and this sub - uh - plot (use that word plot loosely) concering kids that seem to span generations. i don't think they actually do, but the editing makes it look like they materialize from flashback, all of a sudden, to current time. huh? what did i miss?<br /><br />avoid. unless for laughs. or you want to try and trip out on the inept editing.
