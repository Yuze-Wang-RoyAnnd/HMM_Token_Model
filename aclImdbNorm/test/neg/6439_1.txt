i think this programme is a load of rubbish. all they do is argue and slap each other across the face and they call this acting?! these people get paid lots of money for this and most of them can't even act to save their lives. also, the story lines are awful and after watching it for a few minutes, i am bored with it. i like the way that harry hill takes the mickey out of it on his tv show 'tv burp' e.g. the weak joke "the princess and the pea isn't exactly shakespeare is it?" that had sonia and naomi in stitches. i don't see how that is funny. i think this is a waste of everybody's money for their tv licence so this can be shown 4/5 days a week. isn't there anything better than this?
