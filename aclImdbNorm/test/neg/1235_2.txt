i will give it a second chance but was very disappointed in the first one. it wouldn't hold a candle to the other series. it has a lot of meaningless dialog that doesn't add to the storyline at all. i agree with the others that it doesn't seem to develop a story that is interesting. it is slow and plodding and i only know what the comanches are planning to do. maybe it will all tie together in the second installment but i am going to have to force myself to watch it and find out. i am of apache heritage from the texas/new mexico area but i don't recognize much of what is happening. maybe i am just ignorant of the facts but this isn't doing much to educate me.
