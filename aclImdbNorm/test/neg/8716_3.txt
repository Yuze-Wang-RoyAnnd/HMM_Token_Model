but even caricatures need a plausible plot line. i suppose in 1934 some part of that audience long ago would enjoy this tepid farce. it doesn't age well. it does give nat pendelton and zasu pitts experienced and expert support players a shot at leading roles. pendelton, who is featured prominently in the thin man series tries his best but is over matched by witless plot. with the backdrop being a stage play with gangsters its not exactly original material. movie's saving grace is the always excellent edward everett horton in a wasted performance. but don't waste your time watching everett in this film. i would encourage anyone to watch him in his effort in holiday, with cary grant and katherine hepburn. same era 1936, but much better script and storyline. better gags and needless to say star power as well.
