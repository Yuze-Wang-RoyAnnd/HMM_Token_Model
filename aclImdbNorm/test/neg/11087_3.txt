let me start off by saying i love japanese cinema, literature and culture generally. i've seen many japanese movies and enjoyed them, but "portrait of hell" (aka jigokuhen) makes itself ridiculous. the two characters who dominate the action -- the "evil lord" in his privileged bubble and the "stubborn, crazy artist" are pure types with zero subtlety or nuance, and all their actions emanate from cartoonish extremes. the film wants to show horrible scenes of violence and raw emotion but many of these scenes are so over the top they actually become laughable and the overall feeling is that of a made-for-tv movie that went off the rails. if this rarely screened movie falls in your hands or comes to your town, spare yourself and give it a pass.
