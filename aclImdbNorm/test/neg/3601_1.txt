this is the worst waste of time i've ever experienced. not even close to the first one. the story line difficult to follow - plot was weak - at best. the whole thing looked like three stories trying some way to tie them together and make a movie. it had a few good lines here and there - and the attempt at the message was admirable, but they went from houston through new york to get to dallas. it was really hard to tell over what period of time the present time took up. the movie was just over an hour and it felt like we had sat there watching the movie all afternoon. mayve points for being honest - but a son should not have to do all that kronk felt he had to do. do your self a favor - watch kuzco again.
