i love movies, all genres, and from big dollar spectacles to small indie projects. but even making allowance for this piece of junk being 25 years old and its attempt at homage to the 1950's it just suffers in almost aspect, by which we judge films.<br /><br />throughout the movie, i was reminded of several "student films," i've had a chance to watch, efforts where creativity is required to fill gaps where funds are needed. <br /><br />all in all, chances are there are much better uses for 90 minutes of your life.<br /><br />2/10
