this movie is full of pseudo deep thoughtfulness and it's cloying in its writerly-ness, that includes a canned ham voice-over and some unbelievable dialogue. dialogue that is tinny and tone deaf the way spike sometimes (not always) is when writing "certain" characters. for those that like nonsense films like pieces of april and one hour photo, this is another one for you.<br /><br />that said, this comment is nothing against ryan gosling who has shown his awesome chops in the believer. a film that proves that movies are a director's medium, and when a movie is rotten it's fair to say the fault lies there and not in the actors.
