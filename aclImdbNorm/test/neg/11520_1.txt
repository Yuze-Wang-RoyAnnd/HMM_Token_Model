ed wood rides again. the fact that this movie was made should give any young<br /><br />aspiring film maker hope. any screenplay you might have thought of using to<br /><br />line a litterbox or a birdcage should now not seem that bad. do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of tylenol or rolaids. watching this<br /><br />movie made me realize that boa vs. python was not that bad after all. it probably would have been better to do this movie in claymation as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film. it is understandable why this director has so many aliases. there is a bright side to watching this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chips, then you can eat your way out of the cocoon of cheese that surrounds you enabling you to<br /><br />make your toward your tv set's cocoon of cheese that surrounds it.
