well, i got and saw this movie based on the rather high score here (7.1 now), and some of the good reviews. usually imdb is a good guide when it comes to score, though in this case i was very much deceived.<br /><br />the movie is a present-day detective story, with vinnie jones as the investigator journalist, who investigates the death of a construction worker. mixed with this is a made up dickens' novel (called the riddle, set in the 18th or 19th century), which also deals with a murder story. both story lines are connected through the discovery of an unpublished manuscript.<br /><br />sounds interesting? it could have been, however this movie horribly fails in a number of areas : 1) acting. mediocre at best, but it is watchable. no worse than your average uk sitcom, though for a movie one expects a little better. especially with a score of over 7. 2) music. the music used is simply horrible, it distracts and it is annoying. especially the pub music, and the music which plays in the journalist's apartment. 3) storyline. this is a big joke. there are gaping plot holes everywhere and even the obligatory love story is so unrealistic that it's almost funny. furthermore, without going into any detail, i can safely say that the ending is absurd, and one of the worst pieces of acting and storyline of the year. 4) camera-work. at times camera positions and views are distracting, and serve absolutely no purpose to the "story".<br /><br />i'm a bit of a movie fanatic, and watch on average 1 to 2 movies a day, but this is easily the worst movie i've seen in months. don't waste your money or your time on this rubbish.
