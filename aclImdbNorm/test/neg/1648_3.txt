it amazes me that anyone would find pauly shore entertaining: he is basically one joke that gets stale *real* fast. he has his little "california" jerk vocabulary and a basic stock of lame jokes. mainly, he is just obnoxious.<br /><br />that said, i watched this movie because i was up sick and there was literally nothing else on but infomercials, otherwise i would have turned it off after 30 minutes. anyway, the film could have been ok if pauly could have just turned off his spiel and just played it as a comic actor instead of, well, pauly. <br /><br />anyway, i'm sure pauly fans will like it anyway - but if you are not a pauly fan, stay away from this crock of manure.<br /><br />i had to leave this comment after seeing that another user actually gave this film a 10/10! (maybe it was pauly!!) personally, i gave it a 3/10 because they didn't have any mike-in-frame shots, didn't drop the camera, and the supporting cast was pretty good.
