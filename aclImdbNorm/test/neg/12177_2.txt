if this movie would have been in english, all critics would have trashed it. the language is extremely bad, the scenes are awfully directed and it's not at all funny. after the movie i thought that this movie could have been written by an 8th grader, at least if you consider the lack of believable characters and the fixation on certain male body parts. (oh, on dogs as well...) the story is just plain nonsense compared to the more mature vingar av glas that premiered almost at the same time. of course the public chose jalla! jalla! while vingar av glas got little attention.<br /><br />what was really disturbing for me was the fact that the movie looked really bad. that was probably due to the fact that first time director josef fares used really cheap camera equipment and then decided to just play around with it, for fun i suppose. the result, however, is a movie that can easily be split into 12 short films with a new directorial style in each one of them. this was very frustrating. maybe josef fares should have stayed with his short films since that seems to be the only art form he can master.<br /><br />another disturbing fact is that the story does not hold together. at several times in the middle of the movie, the story has to move on very quickly and the characters then run into one another in a way that is just too unbelievable. <br /><br />and then i have not mentioned the 2-dimensional characters, especially those in the supporting roles. <br /><br />even though i consider this one of the worst swedish films of the 90s as well as one of the most overrated, it is kind of understandable that the public liked it. i mean, bad taste has always been the trademark of the masses...<br /><br />i'm more surprised that the critics enjoyed it. they should have known better...<br /><br />grade 2 of 10<br /><br />
