curse of the wolf starts as reluctant werewolf dakota (renee porada) manages to escape from her 'pack' & into the city where 6 months later she is working in a vet's. the rest of dakota's pack are unhappy & want her back, their leader michael (todd humes) says she will come back to them but fat werewolf franklin (brian heffron) picks her scent up & the pack decides to force the issue & get her back using her affections for her human friends including her boyfriend danny (dennis carver). can dakota save danny & finally rid herself of her werewolf pursuers? i doubt you will care...<br /><br />executive produced, written & directed by len kabasinski who also had a fairly large role in the film as stick i was dreading watching curse of the wolf since kabasinski was the man behind swamp zombies (2005) which is surely one of the worst films ever made, ever. unfortunately my worst fears were confirmed & one has to say that curse of the wolf is a truly horrible film in every way, both conceptually & technically. curse of the wolf is the sort of film where the low budget dictates what happens & the script rather than the script dictating the budget. you get the impression that everything was written & conceived to take advantage of the few sets & actor's they had, you can almost imagine the makers saying we've got a few actor's, some basic equipment & a couple of locations so lets make a horror film around them. the story is awful (michael finds the location of dakota by looking at a large dog two women are taking for a walk), the character's are awful (a big fat werewolf guy who farts a lot), the dialogue is awful (just about every line in the thing) & there's never any motivation for anything that happens (why are the pack so desperate to get dakota back?), people just do seemingly random things & since director kabasinski's background is in martial arts he insists in inserting lots of random martial arts fight sequences into the plot. no offence but this is meant to be a horror film not a martial arts one, isn't it? in fact apart from the presence of a few werewolves you would be hard pushed to describe curse of the wolf as anything approaching a horror film. at almost two hours in length it feels like it goes on forever & is so slow & uneventful it's just not funny.<br /><br />director kabasinski was obviously working on a low budget but film-making this bad should be a crime. there's no continuity between shots, the fight scenes look awful & are so poorly staged it's untrue & it's sometimes impossible to follow what's going on be it because of the choppy editing & poor camera angles or the fact that it is sometimes so dark that you literally can't see a thing. seriously there are times during curse of the wolf where the screen is totally black & you can't see a thing, i would hate to have to sit through this watching it on a fuzzy low resolution vhs. the sound is awful too, you can hear the wind & breeze against the microphone! there are also lots of other unpleasant & unwanted ambient sounds during just about every scene. did the production actually have any lighting gear while making this? it doesn't feel like it. the special effects mostly consist of werewolf mask's that look like the sort of thing shops sell at halloween for the kids, basically they look awful.<br /><br />technically curse of the wolf is as bad as they come, i'm sorry because i know this had a low budget but it's truly horrible to sit through & try to garner some entertainment from. this is high school film student quality, i'm sorry if that sounds unkind but it's a fact. the acting is, well you can probably guess so i'll stop myself right here before i say something else negative, i mean i've done enough of that already & i really take no pleasure in it.<br /><br />curse of the wolf is terrible, both conceptually & technically this is a real chore to sit through. curse of the wolf is the type of film where while your watching it time seems to stand still, it's the type of film that lasts for almost two hours yet feels like two years. one of the worst films you or i am ever likely to see, definitely one to avoid.
