much of the commentary on this board revolves around debating the validity of some comparison to r dogs made on the dvd cover. forget about all of that... this film-- er-- home movie is utterly horrendous. how can anyone with a shred of credibility claim this as being 10/10??? there is no plot, none. i couldn't believe that i spent money to rent this (more on that later) and that i had fooled myself into believing that this (based on box cover art and some sort of film fest award blurb) had potential. the only thing i do really remember was that, unbelievably, one of the annoying main characters was supposedly offed with a bullet to the head... and he ends up surviving the wound and making it to the final credits alive. wow. and looky dere, killers has a sequel. double wow.<br /><br />true story -- i actually was in so much denial that i had wasted my money and life force on this rental that i kept the videotape for what must've been six months. i kept telling myself that it never actually happened. the video on top of the tv was an illusion - a mental symbol of my self-loathing. after someone pointed out that is was indeed real and that i needed to get a grip, i decided that i couldn't just leave it there. i thought, "how many others have i denied the suffering of sitting through the viewing of this masterpiece by hoarding killers all to myself?" i had to do the right thing and return it back to the hell from which it came. <br /><br />so, as i imagine most of the populous of imdb would do in a similar situation, i mustered up some major courage and drove to the video store... at 2am. after making sure that no one was around, i got out of my car (still running of course), slipped the movie into the drop box slot, and booked the hell out of there never to return.<br /><br />i guess i expected that some goons from hollywood video corporate would come looking for me (the bill must've racked up to something like $1,238.67 by that time) so i moved away from the area. however, coincidently, much like the killers storyline, nothing ever happened.
