this movie has some good lines, but watching dillon's less-than-masterful rourke impersonation just left me wanting to see the original. i like marisa tomei but she's no faye dunaway.<br /><br />also, in my opinion, the number one movie rule is to make the lead character someone you care about. you might not love the character, but you should care what happens to him. this is achieved in barfly with the hilarious running gag about the fights with eddie the bartender. the main fight in factotum is when, completely unprovoked, he stalks up to the lily taylor character in a bar, punches her to the floor and calls her a whore.<br /><br />the whole thing just didn't work. again, some great lines -- some laugh-out-loud funny -- but as a movie overall it's a fail. mediocre attempt at reinventing something that was brilliant, and you can't get past that. next? let's remake breakfast at tiffany's with kate hudson.
