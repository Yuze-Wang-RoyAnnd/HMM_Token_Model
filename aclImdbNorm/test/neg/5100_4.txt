river queen attempts to pack a complicated, sweeping, historical narrative into just under two hours. there are some breathtaking battle scenes and the wanganui scenery is beautifully captured. however, the film did suffer from some poor leads - samantha morton (sarah) especially came across as unconvincing. there seemed to be an indecisiveness about how the role should be played - as a helpless waif tossed by fate or as a strong, determined character with a clear view of her destiny. kiefer sutherland's character - private doyle - seemed to be pointless and for the most part - unintelligible. keifer's irish brogue needs a little polishing. on the other hand, cliff curtis, temuera morrison and rawiri pene (as sarah's son "boy") were well rounded and believable.<br /><br />the last 20 minutes of river queen came across as particularly compressed and rushed. it seemed as if they decided they had to tie up all the loose ends before 120 minutes were up. e.g. how on earth did wiremu know how to find sarah and doyle? no explanation and very unsatisfying.<br /><br />i did go to this movie with an open mind. i hadn't read or heard anything much apart from its troubled production. what i experienced was a mish mash of new zealand history, beautifully photographed but ultimately disappointing.
