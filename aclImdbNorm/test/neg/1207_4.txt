i have rarely laughed so hard at a movie. notice that i laughed at iron eagle, not with it, because this is probably the stupidest film i have ever seen (with the obvious exception of sci-fi monstrosity cybertracker). you should also remember that this film is not a comedy!<br /><br />even overlooking the preposterous plot (the idea that a 16-year-old could walk into a us air force base, steal an f-16, fly to the middle east and kill about a thousand people without anyone noticing is beyond belief), the film is full of ridiculous action scenes that make little or no sense. for example, at various points, doug masters uses a machine-gun on his plane to shoot a steel girder, a control tower, and a tent. all of these things explode in a massive fireball. why? the enemy aircraft also explode in a strange way reminiscent of a paper aeroplane being blown up with a firework.<br /><br />on the plus side, i did actually enjoy this film. admittedly not in the way the makers probably wanted it to be enjoyed, but all the same i laughed at it and later bought the dvd. it's also improved by the awesome presence of david suchet as the evil terrorist leader (maybe you'll recall him as mustachioed belgian detective poirot?) overall, then, the film is a laugh and a light-hearted alternative to more serious fighter-plane movies like top gun. even if it is just as subtly homo-erotic (check out the man-hug between doug and chappy. something's going on between 'em!)
