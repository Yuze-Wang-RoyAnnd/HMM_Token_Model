a not so good action thriller because it unsuccessfully trends the same water as early steven seagal films because there is not a very good set piece. steven seagal plays the same kind of character that he has played since above the law. in my opinion the performance of keenen ivory wayans is wasted in such an average film and belongs in a much better film. bob gunton is okay as the main heavy. the best acting in the entire film belongs to brian cox who is very frightening in the role of the murderer. my favorite scenes are the fight scenes with the russian mafia. one of the film reasons to see the glimmer man(1996) is for the brief appearence of the beautiful and voluptupus nikki cox. its too bad that there were not more scenes with her in them.
