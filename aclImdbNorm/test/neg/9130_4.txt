what i hoped for (or even expected) was the well known "stop motion" imagery and extreme slow motions, extreme zooms and all embracing fish eye takes. in short: the art of a) finding interesting visual events and b) capturing them in a way the human eye is not capable of, to be replayed so that the human eye can see. the stuff that made the other qatsi's hits.<br /><br />i just wondered how the creation of the whole would fit the title.<br /><br />having watched the movie i got the feeling that the focus in this third part was on the message and not on the wrapping. that's fine, especially since the message is so valid. but i already knew the message, and it appeared there was nothing else left for me. more then half the film was solarized or colorized or posterized or transformed through some other filter. it looked a lot like the effects your video camera does but you never use. a lot of the images would have been prettier without the filters, like the giraffe and zebra chase. you could say that 'technology or whatever human based malicious source disfigured our beautiful nature' but why use these seventies effects to symbolize that? at the point that there had been more than 10 minutes in a row of this cheap looking effect i was ready to leave. the hope that the rest just couldn't be that bad made me stay. but then there was the slow motion: slow motion is good because it gives you time to analyze the moving picture. but if there are no more than 24 or maybe 50 or 60 frames a second, then there's just not enough motion to slow down. please, record the motion-to-be-slowed faster, like was done with the beautiful shots of the foaming and splashing water (some of) the laughing people and the drill song singing soldiers. i acknowledge that archive pictures can't be redone, but i had already seen a lot of that footage anyway, it could have done without it. it must have been a lot of work to search through the archive footage, and the effects can't have been that easy to apply and arrange as well. on top of that, a lot of the work was mixed with each other. it shows that the creator wasn't out to lengthen the movie or to spare himself. but i didn't like the mixed stuff one bit... the idea behind it was sometimes nice or even clever, but the implementation was insufficient. the computer generated images didn't bother me that much, however out of date. the 'bits' streaming along circuits (in the first part of the film) looked more recent and were nice. mandelbrot is always fun, the fractal-mountain was less. i was pleased to hear a cello playing a major role in the music. a little less vibrato at certain moments would have been appropriate with glass' music, but that's a matter of taste. as is all of the above, of course. i do hope that there will be another qatsi story to tell soon, where computer imagery will have a less significant role and that will inspire somebody to get into the field again.<br /><br />
