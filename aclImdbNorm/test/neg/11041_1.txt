*****classic ****excellent ***good **fair *tragic<br /><br />review:<br /><br />oldboy is not for everyone. it's pervasive violence, its live octopus eating and it's unimaginary story.<br /><br />the film focuses around a man who's been kidnapped and is imprisoned for 15 years, oh dae-su is released, only to find that he must find his captor in 5 days. now the story though may seem gripping to start with but once watching this bloated and un-original blood fest it develops into a mash of bitter blood and a forceful film.<br /><br />it's directing is on par of average and by no means the standards of what a south korean thriller should be. oldboys acting scenes are paralleled with dull humour and a poorly writtern script.<br /><br />oldboy is occasionlly presented with thin straw performances that one could only feel shameful about.<br /><br />verdict:<br /><br />not for everyone but it's scope and vision isn't clear enough to see further than the grey abyss of fog.<br /><br />*tragic
