by far this has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life. i watch practically every movie that is on at night (either showtime, hbo, cinemax, etc). "three" aka "survivor island" keeps you in as much suspense as watching paint dry only to let you down even more miserably. if you want to feel like you just wasted what seems like an eternity on the worst film ever created then by all means watch this movie. i must have screamed at a minimum 900 times from the idiotic twists. if i had 4 hands i'd give this movie 4 thumbs down.<br /><br />in my personal opinion, i believe the only people who would like this movie are those with terrible morals.
