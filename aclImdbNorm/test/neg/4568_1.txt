totally un-funny "jokes" that fall flat, amateurish acting (with one or two exceptions), boring characters and dialogue that's, at best, mediocre. after watching this movie, one must wonder how on earth a producer could come across a project like this and think, "i must make this film." no wonder it couldn't get a theatrical release.
