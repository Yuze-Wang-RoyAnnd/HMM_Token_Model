there is a reason to call this a teen flick. out of 100 possible points i would put it somewhere in the teens. it is predictable, the acting is horrible, especially the minor roles, and above all else it is super predictable. the ending is so hokey that i should have left early and maybe it would have passed. by the way, could you call the male lead a pervert? i bet if it really happened, someone in my school district would have said so. finally, in the school i grew up in, even though the average class had over 1000 students, we could have picked out a chump like josie as being a fraud and we would have singled her out of the crowd. my final word is save your time, when it comes on tv watch something better, like the stock quotes.
