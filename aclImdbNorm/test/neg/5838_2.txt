this soft soft-core/sci-fi b-movie is what you'd have if you took an early fred olen ray film and took out the fun. or conversely, it's like an uwe boll 'movie' but without as much ineptitude. a young nubile chain-gang convict (c.c. costigan) agrees to pose as a space marshal in order to stop wacky kim dawson's plans of...having everyone have sex with everyone else apparently (that vile fiend). anyone who went into this film looking for serious science fiction, well you got what you deserved for not doing any homework on the film at all. first of all when did kim dawson ever star in anything other than soft-core skinamax level crap. for that matter take a look at the resume's for costigan and the director before you take a hissy fit saying you expected something else. don't get me wrong, for a space/action/soft-core/titillation flick, this film is still not good, but if you expected something along the lines of "contact", i do not pity you.<br /><br />my grade: d- <br /><br />where i saw it: starz-on-demand (available until december 8th, 2005)
