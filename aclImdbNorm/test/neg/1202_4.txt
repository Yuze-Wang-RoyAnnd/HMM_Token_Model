...but it definitely still only deserves 4/10 stars and no more. a moronic dumb kid's father is a fighter pilot who gets shot down by some arab country. they never name the country in the movie, its really ridiculous, they just vaguely refer to some arab nation, this movie is really ignorant like that. but lamar from revenge of the nerds is in here, he is friends with the main character doug masters. well, doug masters, who lives on an air force base, his father is an air force pilot, yet he fails to get into the air force academy, conceives of a plot (with help from his retarded friends) to steal two jets and go rescue his father. yea, exactly - this is one of the greatest films ever made!!! louis gossett jr is fantastic in his role. you can tell he basically wanted to smack the hell out of doug masters the whole movie. well anyway, you can probably guess how the plot ends, i can't believe they made 3 sequels to this movie.
