the most self-indulgent movie i have every had the misfortune to<br /><br />rent. unwatchable. much of the movie is obviously improvised,<br /><br />and not well. it looks like toback took the first take of<br /><br />everything. the movie gets good for a couple of minutes when<br /><br />robert downey jr. shows up, then goes to hell again real<br /><br />quickly.
