you know i only watched 15 minutes of this film, so i can't really describe how great it is. i mean the concept alone is so original and intriguing it just did not let me go. then there is the mass of academy award winning people involved here plus the academy award nominated director. you just can't miss. i mean imagine it is the middle of the night and you're not sleepy yet. this film comes on. you watch it and are shocked. it is so brilliant, so original it is so great. it will feel to you that half an hour later you've turned off the screen, but as you go to your bed you see it's only 15 minutes after midnight. enjoy!!!<br /><br />3 out of 10
