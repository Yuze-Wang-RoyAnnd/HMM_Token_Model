i saw this at my city's independent cinema - no surprise, because no mainstream theatre would want its fingerprints on this train wreck.<br /><br />the camera work is very distracting. the constant shifting, refocusing, and zooms could induce a sensitive person to have motion sickness. it looks more like a film student's project than a serious movie.<br /><br />though well-acted, the characters are unlikeable. josh is devious, always trying to manipulate situations and people to his advantage. without any context to emily and josh's relationship, she comes off as a whiny, insecure girl who's desperate to get married. rhett is an emotional infant, incapable of understanding the complexities of human interaction. without any redeeming qualities, i didn't care about what happened to any of them.<br /><br />obviously some people liked this movie, as the couple sitting behind me were laughing hysterically. of course, they could have just making fun of it. i could hardly blame them for it.
