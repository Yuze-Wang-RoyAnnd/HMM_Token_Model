another stinker from the pm entertainment group, and thankfully one of their last.<br /><br />'firetrap' is effectively a very low budgeted remake of 'the towering inferno' i don't mind low budget b movies as long as some effort is put into them - there is no effort whatsoever in 'firetrap' is stars dean'superman'cain, who is an absolutely terrible actor, seriously he has all the acting abilities of a porn star, but he turns out to be the best actor here and that's saying something, the rest are just a bunch of no hopers given the boot from various daytime soaps. the special fx are just rubbish, shots showing the burning building from the ground are among the worst i've ever seen, the fire looks like someone scribbled an orange pen at the front of the camera. on top of that there is not one character you actually root for - you hate everyone and hope they all die well before the 90 minutes are up.<br /><br />the script is embarrassing - the red herring's are signposted well in advance, someone else has mentioned this but 'the scene where the janitor fights off a blazing fire engulfing the building with his broom....hilarious, or same janitor going into a room marked 'hazardous material', were these scenes supposed to be tongue-in-cheek? somehow i doubt it<br /><br />the one good point and only one good point was there was a fair bit of action in amongst the daytime soap dramatics which kept my attention, but so little care was given to everything in the film, i can't recommend it - watch 'the towering inferno' instead<br /><br />3/10
