i knew i was in for a long 90 minutes when the opening voice over mispronounced the word 'scarecrow' (it sounded like scare crew). and sure enough 90 minutes later, after witnessing beyond horrid acting, tedious drama, scarecrow's punches going nowhere near their intended target, but "hitting" it anyway, ken shamrock "acting", and the most stupid illogical ending, i've seen in my life (ok, no, i take that last one back, in about a week). after making it through all that, i openly weeped that i couldn't just go to lacuna a la jim carrey and just erase it completely from my mind. any thoughts i might have had that director brian katkin might have made an ok film given the right circumstances that i had after watching "slaughter studios", are totally and completely gone from my mind now.<br /><br />my grade: f <br /><br />eye candy: tara platt and lisa robert get topless <br /><br />where i saw it: starz on demand (available until september 22nd, 2005)
