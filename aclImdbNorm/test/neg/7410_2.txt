an airplane transporting some scientists and a prototype of a dna machine, a powerful and revolutionary invent, fall in a jungle in pacific. the insurance company sponsors a rescue expedition, commanded by harlan knowles (lance henriksen), the owner of a huge corporation, which owns the prototype, and father of one of the scientist. there, the group finds the rests of the plane five miles far from the expected location and the machine and the remains of the persons. further, they realize that a sasquatch, a kind of big foot, is chasing them. this movie is so ridiculous that i do not know what i am doing, spending my time again in this garbage. the direction is awful, the actors and the lines are horrible, copying parts of `the predator' and even `the blair witch project'. to summarize how bad this movie is, its best scene is when marla lawson, the character of andrea roth, is wounded, and the guide of the expedition says that she needs to have an injection of tetanus vaccine. andrea undresses her jeans, and the guide says: 'nice butts, but the shot needs to be in your arm'. ridiculous! my vote is two.<br /><br />title (brazil): `sasquatch, o abomin'avel' (`sasquatch, the abominable')<br /><br />
