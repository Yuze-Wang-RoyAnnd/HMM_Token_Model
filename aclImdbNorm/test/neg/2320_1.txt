for some reason my father-in-law gave me a copy of this tape. i think because my great uncle, buddy baer, was the giant in this movie and my father-in-law thought i'd like to see it. i had, years before as a child, and didn't like it then, either.<br /><br />my son, then two, watched it and was hooked. every waking moment in front of the tv, this horrid video played. i went to work with the inane songs stuck in my head. the two "leads" were worse than a junior high stage review. the dancers looked like rejects from an ed wood horror flick and abbot and costello phoned their parts in. thankfully, i was able to distract my son long enough to lose this videotape. frankly, i think it was the tape from "the ring".<br /><br />to correct another reviewer, buddy baer is the uncle of jethro (max baer, jr) not his father. 0 out of 10.
