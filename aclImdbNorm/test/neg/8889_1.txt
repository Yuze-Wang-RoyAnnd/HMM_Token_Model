this flick is so bad its beyond belief.even for an independent low budget film...it just, well, sucks.i can't even believe even troma would put out such crap.i have been a fan of some troma flicks for years(toxic avenger,squeeze play,rockabilly vampire to name a few).but lloyd, come on,this goes way beyond the boundaries of any taste.it features some of the worst acting imaginable.i think it would have been possible to find unemployed street people who could have been as good...oh,wait, that is what they did.i mean it,these characters have negative charisma.with any luck, the producer and director of this film will have a huge karmic debt because of this atrocity.as will the special effects people.but beyond the terrible acting and the horrid special effects,the dialogue is absolutely traumatic to the ears.the script is full of plot holes the size of alaska, and there are severe continuity problems.the worst part however, is that it not entertaining in even the smallest way.and this is the most unforgivable sin in film making.but, don't take my word for it.go out and waste four bucks renting it.just don't say i didn't warn you.
