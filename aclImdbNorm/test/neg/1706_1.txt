this is a film that revolves around two mysteries (which i have now demystifed).<br /><br />first, did the film makers understand the concept of 'parody' before using it to carpet bomb the audience throughout the film? parody is when a reproduction attempts to mock, comment on, or pay homage through self-depreciating humour to, the original work. in other words, there should be reasons to parody such work, and they should definitely be clever. i didn't see any of those in the film. i did see some awful 10 seconds jokes that fell flat within 2 seconds of delivery. bryan stoller probably went to eric roberts and said "hey, i was drunk last night, watching survivors, and had this brain fart for a straight to dvd release. i want you on board without reading the script...because i plan to direct this film without one!" <br /><br />and herein lies the second mystery: eric robert's career. i use to think eric roberts had the career he had because he was unlucky. now i realize it's because he is stupid (and therefore deserves the career that he had). after watching this movie, it is apparent that he would have been better off had he gone into mainstream adult films, which has higher budgets, more...intense...scenes and roles, better acting and direction, more elaborate and compelling plot lines, and a much wider audience than this b-movie reject (c-movie?).
