where do i start. lets list the good things about this movie first.<br /><br />1. mikael persbrandt is great as the gangster thomas. this is the only character you will actually care about, and he's a bad guy! (allthogh never does anything bad, and is generally a pretty likable guy) 2. kjell bergkvist is always great. he's a bit toned down here, but he is quite funny still 3. the movie looked pretty good by swedish standards, good use of depth of field and lights.<br /><br />now the bad. this is by far the worst script to make it into the big screen ever. the acting by everyone else was pretty bad and over the top. the direction was horrible. a totally meaningless story, totally unrealistic characters and events and 1.5 hours to long. during emotional scenes pretty much everyone in the theater laughed. people just started walking out during the course of the screening. <br /><br />there's no way to actually summarize the story into something coherent, so i wont even try. every clich'e ever conceived is in there, and in all the wrong places. i'm sorry to say this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life. <br /><br />watch it for a good laugh, but try not to pay any money for it ;)<br /><br />.r
