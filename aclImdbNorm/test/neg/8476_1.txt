"son of the mask" is a terrible excuse of a movie. i went to see this with my friend and i still wish we had seen "because of winn-dixie" instead. i must say that it is partially my fault, as i agreed to go see it with him. being a fan of the first "mask" movie (jim carrey was hilarious) i had hoped it wasn't as bad as all of the critics said it was.<br /><br />ten minutes into the movie i knew it was headed for disaster. disgusting and pointless attempts at being funny got little seven and eight year old children shrieking with laughter, but the rest of us were left staring at the screen in disbelief.<br /><br />finding the movie as repulsive and unfunny as i did is surprising to even me, as i loved "scary movie" and "anchorman", two films which many people i know found crude and offensive. but the thing is, "son of the mask" is not funny unless you're under the age of ten.<br /><br />the film features lots of cgi in it, but it cannot save this piece of rubbish. whoever allowed this movie to make it to the big screen was probably thinking it had potential, considering the success of its original. unfortunately, it has none of the laughs, fun, or excitement of the first, creating a mockery of the original movie. i recommend renting the original "mask" to anyone who is thinking about seeing this one. 1 star out of 10 is generous to this awful mess.
