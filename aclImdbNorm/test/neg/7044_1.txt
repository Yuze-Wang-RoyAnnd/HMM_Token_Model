wow. as soon as i saw this movie's cover, i immediately wanted to watch it because it looked so bad. sometimes i watch bollywood movies just because they're so bad that it will be entertaining (eg. koi mil gaya). this movie had all the elements of an atrocious film: a "gang of local thugs" that is completely harmless, a poorly done motorcycle scene, horrible dialouge ("congrats son, i am very proud that you are a bad boy"), actors playing basketball as if they are good, atrocious songs ("me bad, me bad, me bad bad boy"), unexplained plot lines like why are the good boy and bad boy friends??? and why is the hot girl in love with the nerd?? i've never seen such a poorly constructed story with such horrible directly. some of the scenes actually took 30 seconds long like the one where the good and bad boys inexplicably ran over the "gang member's" poker game. congrats ashwini chaudry, you are a bad director. if you want to watch a good movie, watch guru, if you want to watch a movie so bad that it's actually entertaining, then watch good boy, boy.
