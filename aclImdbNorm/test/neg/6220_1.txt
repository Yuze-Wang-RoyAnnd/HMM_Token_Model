after sitting through this film, i have decided that it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i knew it the moment i was subjected to three teenage girls screaming and overacting when they (omg!) meet again, and then watching the same thing, only done by women old enough to be my mom. and that was only the first few minutes. yeesh. so here are my comments...<br /><br />1. middle aged women + ridiculous dance moves complete with hip thrusts and over the top costumes = not a good idea.<br /><br />2. pierce brosnan could not sing his way out of a paper bag. nor could practically anyone else in this pile of excrement, for that matter.<br /><br />3. the songs were so random. it was obvious to me that they were thrown, willy nilly, into the incredibly contrived and stupid plot.<br /><br />4. my three year old nephew could have written a better script.<br /><br />i was either cringing or laughing derisively during the movie. and i normally really like movie musicals. of course they are bound to be a bit corny...but this was ridiculous. what a waste of talent. i mean, you have great actors and actresses in this movie...i am embarrassed for them that this is now a part of their career. i regret wasting my money and time on this piece of crap.
