this film suffers horrendously from its direction "julian grant" , and its incompetent lead, steve guttenberg, who's putting a solid effort to win a bruce willis look-alike contest! the writing is reckless hollywood action thriller; sean bean --whose one of my favorites-- david fraser, and kim coates give a decent performance. the film is definitely below average. 3 out of 10! i wonder what hollywood studios thought, actually giving the go ahead, to weak director such as grant. and i'd say to sean bean "what were you thinking even considering participating in a film like this, after such great films like goldeneye, ronin, and patriot games!
