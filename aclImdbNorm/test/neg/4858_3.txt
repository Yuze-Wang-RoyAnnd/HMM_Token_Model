this 22 minute short, short of a precursor to the later much better "rock and rule", features two folk singer mice who are going nowhere. the female mouse, jan, signs a deal with the devil to become a hit rock star. so it's up to daniel mouse to save her soul. made in the late '70's this has all the trappings of said decade (crap music, crap clothing and hair style, awful folk tunes) this cartoon is featured on the second disc of the 2-disk collector's edition of "rock and rule", it also comes with a making of that runs almost as long as the show itself.<br /><br />my grade: d+
