ever wanted to see how low a movie could sink? well, look no further! this movie has it all! <br /><br />racism jokes, handicapped jokes, overweight jokes, suicide jokes, murder jokes, drug jokes, animal abuse jokes, eating dirt jokes, old man young wife jokes, cancer jokes, gay jokes, crap jokes, falling flat on one's face over and over jokes, overuse of blood jokes, rape jokes, pee jokes, alcohol abuse jokes, anal rash jokes, a bunch of people yacking their coffee back up jokes, nudity jokes, see who can say the most swear words in one scene jokes, lesbian jokes, girlfriend abuse jokes, and the list goes on and on people!<br /><br />the worst part is: none of it is funny! (not that anyone would find most of those funny to begin with.) it seems that when it just can't get any worst, it pushes your expectations to an all new bottom, as it always seems to find another to make the viewer feel worse. there was one scene that had me almost throw up and almost completely depressed at the same time. i don't think i need to point out which one, but then again, i'm sure there are other scenes that will give people this same feeling.<br /><br />there was one moment at the end of the movie that actually made sense and was slightly realistic, when suddenly one of the characters in the scene was piled on with the nastiest remains of a trash bag and thrown several feet on the ground only to have a bunch of beer bottles smashed into his head. all of this probably when he least deserved it. so all thought of a 1 more point redemption was quickly regarded. this is indeed a terrible movie. this is one that needs to be studied and bisected into small parts at a film school to teach students what not to do.
