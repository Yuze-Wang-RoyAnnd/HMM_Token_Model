i normally don't try and second guess a crime thriller, but cleaner was just entirely too predictable. samuel l. jackson playing the character tom cutler, along with his profession created an interesting twist in the beginning of the film, however, that was about it. without even thinking i knew where the plot would be taken and within 30 minutes i had already figured out who the killer was. rather then trusting myself and having seen several films that make a turnabout, i watched to its completion. what a disappointment, i was right from the beginning.<br /><br />the casting of characters was a good, as well as the acting from jackson and harris...except for eva mendes. from the starting gate she didn't play a believable character in correlation to the script and this ruined the entire plot too soon. maybe this was a directing mishap or just weakness in the story itself. her role as ann norcut should have shown more emotion and distress for the situation that was building around her. this would've made the build-up a bit more compelling and the ending more dramatic. nevertheless, cleaner is watchable, not memorable. i've seen episodes of csi that were more thrilling then this.
