a mediocre at best horror flick that deals with dumb, not so horny teens who discover an evil video game (gasp) is killing those who die in the game (double gasp). this movie is the sustained mystery of the mystery gang in "scooby doo". i was waiting for them to pull off a mask of one of the villains. i could deal with this for 40 minutes even as a movie on sci-fi but going all the way to the theaters, come on people. the effects were very mediocre, this whole scenario is something of crummy two-but director uwe boll, since this would be his cast. as always the great thing about video game systems is the glorious power button. i'd suggest using that mid-viewing. *1/2
