the video box for 'joyride' says "starring second generation superstars", and one can't help but feel sad. granted, melanie griffith has gone on to bigger and better things...but who cares about the rest of the cast? so with that being the pathetic attention grabber on the box i was foolish enough to purchase the film for a dollar thinking i would be in the land of 'so-bad-they're-good 70's films' eh, not so much. while so many aimless 70's youth films (or plain ol' 70's films for that matter) tried so hard to say something deep and meaningful, 'joyride' doesn't even try. it's just aimless. it is devoid of any interest whatsoever. each character is so poorly conceived that it's no wonder these actors look so listless.<br /><br />in a nutshell the movie is about three 20-somethings who go to alaska to start a business, but instead get robbed and then have to find work. they get beat up, eat dog food, steal cars, rob banks. it's all very typical but on top of that it's executed in the most mundane way possible. there are no surprises and the flow is so bad, and the actions of the characters so ambiguous that you can miss several scenes and not mind at all.<br /><br />but if you're a fan of melanie griffith's breasts - then this is a must-see. that's still not enough to get this above the lowest rating i can give.<br /><br />best line: "jesus, everything is biology with you." * out of ****
