total disgrace! truly awful! the screenplay and dialogue is a joke, and combined with a director who doesn't have a clue about life in saudi arabia. it's not a surprise, quite saudi film ha, the director is palestinian-canadian, the writer is lebanese, the lead actress is jordanian, and the shooting took place in dubai, and all those elements show very well to make the film far from representing the saudi society. yes it contains some saudi clich'e's, the stuff we see in cartoons in the newspapers everyday, but that's about everything. the film had the opportunity to show real problem with saudi society, or at least give us something new and genuine about the youth troubles and concerns in saudi arabia, instead it copied and pasted from here and there, and the result was a mess. even the supposedly love story in the movie doesn't exist or at least we haven't seen it. the only bright side in this total debacle is some good acting from the supporting cast. the veteran khaled sami was funny in a badly written role as the grand father, which he is clearly got miscasted, for he looks younger than the actor who plays his son. also the actor who plays the fanatic brother's role, turki al-yusuf, has done well, in fact he was the best actor in the film. the rest of the cast, being professionals for long, did an ok job, but the lead actor hisham abdulrahman was just bad. he had one look of a little adorable bobby for all situations. he couldn't even say his lines in a proper manner. he has charisma that made him win the title of star academy, a very famous reality show, and he is good in interviews and tv shows, but he was just the weakest link of this film. the lead actress i didn't mind very much, but even she acted badly in some scenes and overplayed her sensuality in unneeded way.<br /><br />the film was a huge hit, saudi flocked in thousands to neighboring bahrain and dubai to attend it when it was screened there, and it made a tone of money, then it was screened in pay per view, then in broadcasting tv, and that was in a span of a few weeks. this was to cash on saudis eagerness to homegrown entertainment, but alas; the film was neither homegrown, nor entertaining.
