this is a disaster-movie, in both meanings of the word. every character, every role, every conversation, every twist, everything in this movie stinks big time. it's a shame to see dennis hopper's talent wasted in this dreadful movie. i can give you 100's of examples but see for yourself.<br /><br />or rather : don't.
