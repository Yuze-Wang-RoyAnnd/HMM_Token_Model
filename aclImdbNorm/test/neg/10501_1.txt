so, this is the worst movie you will probably ever see. it's up there with "crossbones" and "southern comfort", but if your a bad movie fan like i am, this atrocity of a film will be the most fun you've had in years. why does the camera make old-school kung fu noises when it zooms? why does that random guy stuff a nascar commemorative plate in his bag? and who is he anyway? why do the vampires shoot lightning after they die? what is this? highlander? dracula mccloud? who cares! just laugh at it. this movie has no continuity, no plot, no anything, really. ron hall's range of emotions are always off. he looks happy when he should be sad, angry when he should be confused. the rest of the cast couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. the special ("short bus" kinda special) effects are randomly placed, and never needed. most scenes are lit with a desk lamp, if they are lit at all. mel novak has the audacity to look off-camera for his line, and it's not even edited out. they just keep on filming. in fact, half of this movie isn't even on film at all. it's 1/2 film, 1/2 sony hand-cam. for most of the film it seems that they left their boom mike at home. this movie doesn't just have a few plot holes, it's a mine field of confusion and mental pain! but oh do i love it! thank you ron hall, for this cinematic abomination. i went out and bought it, cause it's just so damn funny. ($1.99 on amazon, and i had it rush delivered!)<br /><br />"i have weapons! i have weapons! i have weapons!"
