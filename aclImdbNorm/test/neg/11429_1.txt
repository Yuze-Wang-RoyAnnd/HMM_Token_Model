ah, here it is! a movie, which is said by people to remind me of the epic "trainspotting". ouch, was i a fool to believe that, and ouch, how my buttocks hurt after having forced myself to watch this c**p from beginning to end. after the first 10-15 minutes i just wanted it all to end, or at least they could've put some nudity or action or cool acid house music into it to make it worth the time... but no, when i was through with it, i put it into my cd shelf and i hope i will never have to pick it out again just to show it to some friend who is so anxious to see it that he/she don't want to listen to my warnings.
