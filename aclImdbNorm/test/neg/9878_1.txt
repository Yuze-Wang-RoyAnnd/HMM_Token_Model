***may contain spoilers****<br /><br />i was super excited to go see blood and chocolate with my friends. i couldn't wait because the book is one of my favorites. but as soon as the movie started, i couldn't believe how different it was. at first i was like, okay, so both of her parents are dead...maybe it'll be okay. but then came the rest of the movie. by the time it was over i was furious. nothing was correct but their names and the fact that vivian fell in love with aiden. by the end of the book, gabriel was my all time favorite...and then the movie goes and turns him into a complete heartless idiot?! the movie also showed the shifters, or werewolves, as these vile, evil creatures were as the book shows them as just wanting to fit in and keep their pack safe. they would never kill humans for the fun of it.<br /><br />if they wanted to make a movie like they did, they should have given it a different title and named the characters different. because then i would go out and watch it again and buy it, but when i think about it all i can see is the bad. you couldn't pay me to go see it again or buy it.
