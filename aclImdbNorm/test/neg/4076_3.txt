if you're not a fan of the 80s, and you need to be a particularly strong fan, or of one of the two leads, there's nothing about this film to recommend.<br /><br />the story, as others have said, is dull, almost an afterthought to the basic notion of the characters and the idea of making a slightly manic comedy. i watched it to about an hour, hoping it would turn a corner, a twist would occur or it would somehow kick into gear but no... it's not unwatchable, it's just dull. it goes by. it goes by with bits of running around madly, lingering shots of feet at strange angles, bits of shouting madly but i didn't get a real feel of energy or manic fun, it just came across as forced. needless to say also, there was nothing to laugh at particularly. a bit of mild amusement here or there but nothing more.<br /><br />don't be fooled by the mention of feminism by the way, all it means in this case is that almost all the principal cast is female. if anything, it's actually cloying... two female leads, fine, excellent, the drug dealer is female, okay, their landlord is a landlady, alright, their friends are female, okay, the only other person we particularly see who lives in the same building, oh, female... i wasn't on the lookout for that but after a while it felt like a conscious decision had been made to have the film cast that way and it felt, again, a bit forced and cloying.<br /><br />on the plus-side, if you are a fan of 80s fashions and culture, there is plenty to see and if you're a fan of helen slater, she's fun and enjoyable to watch. there's also some screen-time for carol kane, which is great, but not enough...<br /><br />overall: 3/10. if you're a huge fan of the 80s, helen slater and carol kane, you could maybe stretch it to a 5 because of them, although there's still the fact it's a comedy which isn't funny, which hinders it substantially. if you're not a fan of those things, you might as well make it 0 because there's nothing much else to enjoy here.
