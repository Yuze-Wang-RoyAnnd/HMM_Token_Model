about 5 minutes into the movie you're thrown into this brutally tepid cat and mouse romance between the two main characters and it just gets worse from there. the biggest problem is the characters and how completely unbelievable they are. this is what 50 year old producers and out-of-touch hollywood script writers think stoner life is like, as if they gave the cast of friends some pot. bland, dull, annoying and completely unrealistic. i despise this movie.
