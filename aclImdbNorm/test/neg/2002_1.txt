please don't waste your money on this sorry excuse for a motion picture. the only way i could see someone watching this is if they are a die-hard fan of erika elaniak, but you would be better off surfing the internet than to watch this piece of crap. i would rather watch paint dry than go through watching this. <br /><br />they lure you in with casper and erika and lead you to believe it is a sci-fi dracula movie, but it quickly works out to be a farce about van helsing's great-great (you get the point) grandson, here ironically for one last show-down between himself and dracula.<br /><br />the movie also tries to make a political statement, i believe, when it appears that none of the characters in the future know who god is, that they have not been taught about him and don't understand when they see a cross. could have done a lot more with this idea. it's a shame it turned out the way it did.
