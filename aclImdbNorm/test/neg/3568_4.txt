for me this movie is essentially like a feature length pilot episode for a tv series. it reminds me particularly of the british remake of the tv series wallander, starring kenneth brannagh. people interviewed by the police are hardy, and often as bitter as the weather, the lead investigator has huge family problems, investigations invariably lead to cruelties of the distant past, and the plotting is labyrinthine with strange occurrences and subplots making sense only at the end. both have excellent cinematography.<br /><br />the plotting of jar city is extraordinarily reminiscent of a standard uk or us crime series. effectively you could take the plots of any of the episodes of touch of frost and transplant them on top of the bleak locale in this movie and have an effective sequel.<br /><br />really the script couldn't be more obviously from the cookie cutter. you get even the most familiar of motifs, such as the police going to the local prison to interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath, who inevitably explodes at the end of the interview.<br /><br />i'm absolutely convinced that this is scones and jam for many folk, but i feel it needs pointing out to people like myself who do not go to the cinema to watch television. what i felt a keen lack of was message. the movie takes as its theme the genetic studies in iceland. icelanders in genetic terms have remained largely isolated from the outside world, presenting a great opportunity for scientists to study their genetics. lots of information concerning the heredity of the population has been kept, and many genetic diseases unique to iceland can be traced effectively in a population that has refrained from interbreeding, and is remarkably genetically homogeneous (it's like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle of the london underground map, instead of a jigsaw puzzle of a field of daisies). a company called decode genetics attempted to set up a database carrying all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire population of iceland. due to privacy concerns this project was terminated, and at the end of last year decode genetics went bankrupt in iceland. the episode is a rich topic for debate.<br /><br />but in this movie genetics and medical science are not there for education's sake, they're there for weird atmosphere.<br /><br />it's a grisly movie if you are interested in that, and there's often a morbid focus on food to accompany events, like a coroner who eats lunch in between incisions. the most queasy for me was when the lead inspector devours a sheep's head. unfortunately for me this occasionally became farcical. the movie attempts the rather delicate task of mixing the grisly with the sentimental, and ended up providing unintentional humour towards the end. this is the equivalent, in cinematic terms, of attempting to prepare fugu, if you're not well-qualified, deft of hand and sharp of eye, you poison the client. this rather novice director should have lowered the tariff on his performance.<br /><br />i walked out of this movie feeling rather bad about myself and about life in general.
