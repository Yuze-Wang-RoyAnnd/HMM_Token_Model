i realize the line on my summary is not too polite.<br /><br />this film written & directed by scott caan & starring giovanni ribisi,don cheadle & himself runs a long 88 minutes.<br /><br />there is a dog in this puppy of a movie., he is cute.<br /><br />the movie opened in 2 u.s. theatres in late april 2007,for one week & grossed all of $ 914. it quickly went to dvd in early august 2007.<br /><br />we were only able to take about 40 minutes before we turned the dvd off.<br /><br />this was the type of movie that played on lower half of double bill. you saw the main film & figured lets see what this one is like, you might have walked out before we shut it off.<br /><br />the 3 actors & the young ladies in the film all have done & deserve better than this..<br /><br />ratings: ** (out of 4) 54 points (out of 100) imdb 4 (out of 10_
