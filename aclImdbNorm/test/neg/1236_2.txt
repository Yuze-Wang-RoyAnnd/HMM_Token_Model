agustus and call really did nothing? why are they hero's they did nothing other then get to places after the bad guys where dead. what was the point of this show? i was very very disappointed. i expected more action, more story, and to see the birth of heros and great deeds. instead i saw very little, it seemed like agustus and call where just side story's for the great indian chief. <br /><br />i'm not even sure that the history is even very close. they did very little to show why the texans and comanche fought against each other.<br /><br />the only good part about this movie was zhan who played gus very very well and is a great actor. a lot of good story that could have been gone to waste. it was sad and i wish that i had not watched it.
