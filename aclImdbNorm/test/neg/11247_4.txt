the first film was quite hip and had amusing moments, this film doesn't exactly have the same standard. calvin palmer (ice cube) is still trying to keep his barbershop going, but this isn't just against stylist gina (queen latifah) with a beauty shop next door, but soon enough a big barbershop chain called nappy cutz opening across the street. calvin, along with co-workers and friends eddie (cedric the entertainer), jimmy (sean patrick thomas), terri (eve) and isaac rosenberg (troy garity), they are doing everything they can to keep regular customers coming, and ultimately their business running against the competition. also starring michael ealy as ricky nash, leonard earl howze as dinka, harry lennix as quentin leroux, robert wisdom as alderman brown, jazsmin lewis as jennifer, kenan thompson as kenard and bad company's garcelle beauvais-nilon as loretta. i didn't like this film as much as the first because of the unnecessary flashbacks about eddie, and it isn't as witty, i just got bored of it. okay!
