it's partly bad luck for "illuminata" that it comes out after "shakespeare in love" as it deals with virtually the same themes of life as art, art as life and the magic of the theatre and the same archetypal foibles of theater folk, but a whole lot more ponderously.<br /><br />there are scenes that come alive, as a play develops and gets reinterpreted by a writer's life, but there's a whole lot of orson welles-ish ego in this produced by/directed by/lead acted by john torturro as a vehicle for his wife katharine borowitz (with an adorable cameo by their son).<br /><br />each actor gets his/her moment literally in the spotlight, but there's so many "masques" or set pieces that seem like 19th century parlor games. bill irwin talks. susan sarandon gets to be a diva. christopher walken gets to be a different kind of villain - a gay critic. the women have to disrobe unnecessarily because this is an art film.<br /><br />the art and set direction are marvelous, though quite dark. this should get an award as the best use of a jersey city theater as a set ever in a movie.
