i got this movie in a bargain bin, hoping for an amusingly bad flick. boy was i disappointed. (except for avon.) you see, the movie is indeed horrible, but so horrible, it isn't even laughable. the plot, oh wait, there is no plot. i suppose you could say it's about the main character rising up in the ranks of street fighting. at the end of the movie, the directors decided to either not make any more sense, or, more likely, died and had a monkey finish directing the movie. don't read if you don't want the ending spoiled! although the ending doesn't really spoil anything. the main character somehow ends up in a room filled with mirrors, a la enter the dragon, and then gets real angry, has stupid flashback, and hits a mirror. the end. wheeee.<br /><br />the only redeeming factor of this movie was avon's scene. he's talking to the rival street fighting boss and says something along these lines, completely deadpan: "do not worry about him anymore sir. i have killed him in a sophisticated manner. i wined him, i dined hm, we went to a disco. we was havin a lot of fun. and then i killed him." at which point the boss says "good work avon. you're number 1." and avon says "number 1! alllriiiiight! alriiight!" the scene continues with avon continuing to say "alllrriiiight!" over and over. the next scene is of a dead avon floating in a pool. intelligent? i think not.<br /><br />lastly, i own the "homeboy" version of this movie, meaning the title on the box i own is "homeboy." it shows a huge guy holding a giant gun and screaming. this never happens in the movie. this man is never in the movie. high quality.<br /><br />note--i am new to this reviewing, but hell yes i am going to keep it up.
