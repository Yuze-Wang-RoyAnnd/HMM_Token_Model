this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. its been a few years since i saw it and nothing has come close since then and i doubt that there ever will be a movie produced that is as bad as this. it tries to make fun of a variety of different movies, for example 'nell' (!) and instead of funny its just pathetic. whatever you do, don't rent or by this garbage and if someone throws it at you....turn around and run the other way!!
