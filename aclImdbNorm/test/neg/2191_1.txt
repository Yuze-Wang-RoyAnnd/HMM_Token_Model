i read all of the other comments which made this movie out to be an excellent movie. i saw nothing of the excellence that was stated. i thought it was long and boring. i tried twice to watch it. the first time i fell asleep and the second time i made it to within six minutes of the end and gave up. i suppose that it was mainly my fault going in with great expectation, but i don't think that this would have completely ruined the movie for me. the movie was just bland. it had nothing that was spectacular or unique to it. the plot was not half bad, the action sequences were non-existent, the dialogue forced and the movie just went on forever. i would not recommend seeing this movie.
