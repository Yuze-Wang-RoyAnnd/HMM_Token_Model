if this is classed as 'real life' of london, then the producers must be on different planet.<br /><br />it is the most depressing, suicidal, dark, dingy, dross on tv.<br /><br />everyone is fighting, everything has nasty under tones running through it, nothing is done for genuine reasons.<br /><br />if you want a real life picture of people in london or the uk, then this programme is by the farthest from reality.<br /><br />there is not one good word i can say about this programme. the only certainty is that will be a great big fight over christmas dinner.<br /><br />even the characters are totally unbelievable!
