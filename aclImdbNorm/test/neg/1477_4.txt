... and it's a not very good documentary either american movie seems to have confused some people into thinking this is a spoof documentary ( " mockumentary ) and even some newspaper tv listings described it as such . i'll not laugh out loud at that because it's easy to mistake this documentary as one big wind up ala this is spinal tap <br /><br />what seems to have caused the confusion is that the documentary centres around budding film maker mark borchardt who is .... how can i put it ? rather self deluded ? yes but that's not necessarily a bad thing since if we had no dreams we'd all still be living in caves and the fact that mark is obsessed with horror movies is not to be taken as a criticism since both sam raimi ( yes that one ) and peter jackson ( yes that one ) both started out doing low budget horror comedies so again it's not a criticism . no it's just that mark borchardt ( yes that one ) is a parody of american trailer trash <br /><br />remember in there's something about mary ben stiller gives a lift to a dodgy hitch hiker ( " come into my office because you're f***in' fired " ) ? well that's who mark resembles along with most of jerry springer's guests so it's very easy to see why some people thought this wasn't a real documentary . it's also not a very good documentary since mark and co give me the creeps . did you know that someone thought mark would grow up to be a serial killer ? does anyone else think there's plenty of time left for this to happen ?
