truly, truly awful. i don't even know where to begin. this is a perfect example of a movie that doesn't know what to do with itself. i'm not sure i could even assign a category myself, except that i'm quite sure it's a slap in the face of everyone, every where. even the unborn.<br /><br />at times, i thought i was watching a parody, or some kind of farce. at times, just a bad b movie. but i kept holding out for the porno, which, i fear, is almost(but not entirely), non existent.<br /><br />some one advised skipping to the ending. i would definitely second that emotion. the last five minutes are intense, and certainly contain some of the best film making/cgi you will ever see, ever.<br /><br />ed wood would be proud.
