i don't know if i should be amused or insulted by drivel like this put out by "lifetime: television for women" should be renamed "lifetime: television for shut in drama queens" because i've yet to see a movie that wasn't a tear jerking pot boiler. this film was no exception. you know a film's going to be bad when the biggest headliner is tori spelling, completely a creation of bad plastic surgery and spoiled privilege minus any real talent. everyone else matched her in unbelievably bad acting and the storyline was beyond dumb, as if anyone could believe any of it. if i hadn't have been helpless on the sofa pinned down watching with the same fascination you view a gory car wreck i would have changed the channel.
