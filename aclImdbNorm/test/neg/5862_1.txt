this is possibly the single worst film i have ever seen - it has no good features at all.<br /><br />it looked as if it was made in about 20 minutes with the other time filled with title graphics.<br /><br />the lead male transformed from deaths door to superman - eh you what<br /><br />other than that totally predictable and not at all interesting.<br /><br />i left the cinema feeling cheated.<br /><br />needless to say i could not reccomend this film to anyone.
