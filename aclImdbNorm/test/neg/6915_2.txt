no one in this movie has very much to do. this is probably the longest 65 minutes i've ever spent watching a movie. the makeup effects on the pianist with macromeglia are pretty good, but that's the only thing that keeps this from being rate a 1. the doctor's assistant goes through extreme mood swings from passivity to hysteria in seconds and then seems to forget where she was in the next scene. the director assembled a lot of the right ingredients for a mad-doctor movie, but somehow forgot the skeleton of a story to hang them on. unless you know someone in the cast or crew, i wouldn't recommend even sampling this one.
