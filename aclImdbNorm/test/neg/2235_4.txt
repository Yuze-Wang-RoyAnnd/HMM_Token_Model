for one thing, he produced this movie. it has the feel of later movies with international casts that are dubbed. the opening credits tell us it was filmed in vienna.<br /><br />bey was a delight in the universal adventure movies of the 1940s. he was also superb in a movie i saw maybe ten years ago but have never heard of since: "the amazing mr. x." maybe it was dr. x. i remember it as a thrilling and frightening movie.<br /><br />this one is pretty wooden, unfortunately. the plot isn't easy to follow. when i got the hang of it, i was disappointed anyway.<br /><br />francis lederer looks great as a concert pianist. he was a very handsome leading man ten or 15 years earlier. he never really caught on as a major star, though he should have.<br /><br />this isn't terrible but it's pretty heavy going.
