there's some nice scenery to look at here,if you can keep your eyes open long enough to see any of it.i'm a big fan of slice-of-life movies,but these people are just plain bland.although there's nothing political here,the entire film can be looked at as a political statement,in that it shows how communism destroys the individual,making everyone the same bland animal that just spends its life sleeping,eating,and occasionally making love.
