do not avoid this movie. simply because it is so bad that it is absolutely hilarious. it possibly is the worst movie i have ever seen but it was so bad that my friends and i were able to laugh at every single moment of this film. at times we actually debated whether it was this bad on purpose but we're pretty sure that it is not. characters appear out of nowhere as if they have already been established, the scenery changes mid scene to this warehouse constantly, and the vampire assassin ends up having around 6 climactic fights with enemies before finally getting to the head vampire. you will also be able to enjoy the one and only face of the vampire assassin as he never changes his expression despite his obvious attempts to. so if you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh histerically then i suggest this one as long as you go in with an open mind. don't expect a good movie, expect the worst... and it will be even worse than that. i seriously want to buy this movie and place it atop my comedy movie selection. right next to anchorman.
