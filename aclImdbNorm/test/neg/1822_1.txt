this brief review contains no spoilers since the movie spoils itself. it is wooden and pedantic. it has no saving grace whatsoever. if someone invites you to his house to watch "mr. imperium", don't go. even the title of the movie is dreadful and portends what garbage lies within. the whole plot is so bad that it could drive mother theresa to despair!!! it wasn't a stroke that led to the early demise of poor ezio, it was having to act in this clunker that did him in. it must have haunted him the rest of his days. perhaps he was an enemy alien and wanted revenge upon the americans for his confinement. he found a perfect vehicle for his wrath in this travesty.
