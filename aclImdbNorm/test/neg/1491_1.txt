i had a hard time staying awake for the two hour opening episode. it was dumbed down to such an extent, i doubt if i learned a single thing. the graphics were rudimentary. any small idea was repeated ad nauseum. contrast this to the cosmos series hosted by carl sagan. that had a good musical theme. there was no music coming from these infernal 10-dimensional strings.
