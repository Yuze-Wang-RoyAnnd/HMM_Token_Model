based on the comments made so far, everyone seems to either hate this movie or love it. i think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a great movie, it has its interesting moments. for one thing, it was filmed on location in colorado (was it breckinridge or telluride? i can't remember, but it is in the credits). the location is absolutely stunning and spectacular. it's beautiful, even to me who lived in colorado for several years.<br /><br />next, it has disney's penchant for wonderful character actors. harry morgan has never been in better form than when he plays in a disney movie. he is literally hysterical. also, remember the wonderful mary wickes? although she has a "bit part" in this movie, she is great, as always. if you don't know who she is, think of the animated disney version of hunchback from notre dame (she was one of the gargoyles), and she was also the most interesting nun in "sister act", as well as the best nun in "the trouble with angels." she has always been a great character actress and most character actors never receive the recognition they deserve.<br /><br />in addition to character actors and all-star casts, in the 1960s-1970s disney may have not had the "greatest" movies, but, if you really watch some of them from beginning to end, you will notice that every movie has some really funny or hysterical moment in it. the entire movie may not be funny, but there is always a comic gem (at least 1 or 2) in every single "live-action" movie disney ever made. whether it's harry morgan in one of his bellowing tones of voice, or tim conway floundering around, or joe flynn giving one of his priceless looks of horror, it is all good. the whole film may not be good, but there are always hysterical moments in every disney film from this period that i have ever seen. disney in this time period always managed to make a person smile, despite the dumbness of the film.<br /><br />bsed on these comments, i disagree with viewers who say every disney movie in this time period is awful. that statement it not quite accurate. rather, it is easier for me to give credit to the funny moments and overlook the weaknesses in the plots.<br /><br />some live-action disney movies are true classics (old yeller, bedknobs and broomsticks, mary poppins), but for those that aren't, i am able to appreciate them for what they were -- good clean family fun in a time when movies had become vulgar, crude and offensive.
