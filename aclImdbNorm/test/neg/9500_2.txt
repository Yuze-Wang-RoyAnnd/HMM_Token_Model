yah. i know. it has the name "sinatra" in the title, so how bad can it be? well, it's bad, trust me! i rented this thinking it was some movie i missed in the theaters. it's not. it's some garbage "movie" made by the folks at showtime (cable station). geez, these cable stations make a few bucks they think they can make whatever garbage movies they want! it's not good. i am as big a sinatra fan as any sane man, but this movie was just dumb. boring. dull. unfunny. uninteresting. the only redeeming quality is that (assuming they did stick to the facts) you do learn about what happened to the captors of frank jr. otherwise it's just a stupid film.
