"hardbodies 2" is harmless, aimless and plot less. i would add "brainless" to that list, but the movie-within-a-movie gimmick, although not done very well, helps it to narrowly escape that label. the scenery has changed from the california beaches to the greek islands, and the only returning cast members from the first film are sorrells pickard (the bearded guy) and roberta collins (who at one point falls into a mud pit, bringing back memories of her classic catfight with pam grier in "the big doll house"). all the other actors are new, but apparently brad zutaut is supposed to be playing the same character (scotty) as grant cramer did in "hardbodies". this sequel lacks the energy and appeal of the first movie, and doesn't come close to matching it in the "hotness" department, either. of course brenda bakke and fabiana udenio are both very pretty, but the teal roberts - cindy silver - kristi somers team is unbeatable. "hardbodies 2" is not the worst of its kind by any means, but if you only want to see one of these movies, the original is the one to get. (*1/2)
