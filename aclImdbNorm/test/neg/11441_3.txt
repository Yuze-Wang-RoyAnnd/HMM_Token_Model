not as bad as 1992's "nails" (where hopper plays an "unstable" cop) but pretty bad. how can a movie with such a great cast go so wrong? this film manages to find a way. the story was pretty stupid and hopper's direction seemed like he had never directed before. all of the long shots in the beginning were bothersome. lots of meaningless scenes with a lot of meaningless dialogue.
