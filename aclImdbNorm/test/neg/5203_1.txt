as a huge fan of the original operation delta force, i thought i'd pick this film up. i figured it couldn't be too bad. however, here's a list of things i learnt from watching operation delta force 4: deep fault.<br /><br />- the delta force, despite being the elite in american armed forces, are mostly mildly-overweight men in their late 30s and early 40s.<br /><br />- the delta force, despite being the elite in american armed forces, carry standard police issue pistols or ak-47s on their most important missions.<br /><br />- the delta force, despite being the elite in american armed forces, haven't learnt that during stealth missions, wearing bright red ski jumpers and running around in open spaces aren't exactly going to keep you out of sight.<br /><br />- when you drop a molotov cocktail into a tank, it explodes externally like a grenade.<br /><br />- when you get hit by tank fire, you can run away, although the smoke caused may present minor difficulties for breathing.<br /><br />- you can die from one standard gun shot, but you can also live despite being hit multiple times by a sniper rifle, and a few times by an ak-47.<br /><br />- in hand-to-hand combat, members of the delta force, despite being the elite in american armed forces, are regularly pummeled by railroad attendants.<br /><br />- if bad guys are approaching you while on a slow-moving train, there's nothing to worry about - between the 4 of them, they can't manage to figure out how to get an automatic weapon to fire automatically, let alone hit anyone from 5 metres (16 feet) with at least 50 attempts between them.<br /><br />- if you're short on actors, just recycle them - the bad guy from operation delta force 1 plays a good guy called mac in operation delta force 4, and the guy who played mac in operation delta force 3 now plays skip lang, a different good guy.<br /><br />- it's not ok for the delta force to shoot an unarmed terrorist, even if he's attempting to reload his weapon to kill you.<br /><br />- grenades explode on impact with the ground when thrown by members of the delta force. when thrown by non-delta force personnel, they explode at exactly the point where the delta force members have thrown the grenades back at the bad guys.<br /><br />- tanks can drive faster than standard trucks.<br /><br />- militias and personal armies use the exact same chopper that the un used in operation delta force 1.<br /><br />- when a chopper arrives, a bad guy in that chopper cannot see you if you lie face-down.<br /><br />- shooting someone multiple times in the chest will cause minor damage. stabbing that person in the knee will kill them inside 5 seconds.<br /><br />- the delta force steal cars from old people to get around when in foreign countries, because the us military do not provide them with any means of transport. this may also explain why they caught public transport.<br /><br />as you can see, this is not really the finest moment in film-making, but it's good for a laugh.
