"ashes of time" was an audacious project but ended up being a pretentious movie. this film is a good example of how to tell a simple story in a complex manner. the plot of "ashes of time" is fairly simple and comes down to two words: "love triangle". because of those "love triangles" crossing stories, jealousy, hate and love are the main dynamics displayed by the characters. the narrative part is seen through ou-yang feng's eyes (leslie cheung). ou-yang feng lives in the desert, where he acts as middleman to various swordsmen and becomes the tool of destiny through which vengeance is achieved. unfortunately "ashes of time" fails in telling these simple stories of love and hate. wong kar-wai lost himself driven by a desire to make each frame of the film a painting and an aesthetic experience. in fact beside the casting of beautiful actors (men and women) everything else is a failure in this movie. dialogs are minimalists and not original at all. picture's quality is very much unequal, the editing is one of the worst ever seen (at least by me) in the "swordplay" genre and finally the filming of the rare sword fight is very confusing and unappealing. even the attempt of building artistic scenes is not always achieved: the so call erotic "women on a horse" scene is ridiculous, not erotic and useless. wong kar-wai wanted to deliver 100 minutes of pure aesthetic experience and forgot that a film is first about how a plot is told. by forgetting that he delivers an awkward movie that doesn't even fulfill its artistic objective.
