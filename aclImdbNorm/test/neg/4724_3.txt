this film was a mexican made horror film from the late 60s. it's not that good, but really not so bad either. there is plenty of schlock and it is padded pretty heavily with nudity and violence, but it had a plot and at least tried to keep to it (even if the plot was the same damn frankenstein inspired "don't tamper in god's domain" b-movie fare). there was some padding mixed in with the female wrestling, but it was made in mexico and wrestling does seem to be popular in mexico.<br /><br />the plot is that a doctor wants to save his son, who is dying from leukemia. the other doctors have given no hope for the poor guy, but dad has the idea of transplanting a gorilla's heart for his son's to save his life (i don't know, i'm a lawyer not a doctor). the transplant works, but sonny-boy ends up becoming a man-ape who terrorizes nude women and kills anyone who gets in his path. there's also a subplot involving a cop and his girlfriend who is a wrestler (this really didn't add too much, but if they wanted to throw in some masked female wrestlers here's a good reason to do so).<br /><br />the film was kind of cheap, but not too bad for a b-movie of the day. the plot was basically just recycled and there were a few things that weren't tied in that well. however, this film is kind of fun in its own way (i don't know why, maybe because it's a mexican horror film and sticks out in my normal bad movie diet). i guess it may be because it's a mix and mash of some very weird things.<br /><br />watch it if you like cheesy foreign films, nudity, and female wrestlers.
