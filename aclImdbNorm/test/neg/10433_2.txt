when i think of a 1970s-period film, this is not what i think of. i don't want a monotonous, one-song robin trower soundtrack; i want a soundtrack punctuated with the top-40 bubblegum songs of the day that epitomized the '70s. the generic karaoke-style disco music during the prom scene was especially annoying. the acting (if you can call it that) was very wooden, and seemed just read from script in monotone. the film quality and camera work was horrid; the dialog murky, the script seemed thrown together without much thought and the plot was thin if not nonexistent. i can't believe people are giving it the high ratings i've read here. basically a forgettable, poor attempt at recreating a beloved era of the past. two stars is all i can come up with. sorry, guys.
