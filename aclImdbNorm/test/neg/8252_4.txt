what is about mathematical geniuses that get the critics juices flowing ? a beautiful mind wasn`t up to much in my opinion ( fellowship of the ring deserved the oscar that year ) while good will hunting had several awards lavished on it undeservedly<br /><br />first off is the script . when i attended film school i was told good will hunting is a very good example on how not to start a script and the tutor was right . this movie lacks any type of opening hook and for the most part it`s very very slow . if you wrote an unsolicited script like this the script reader would have given up on it by page 15<br /><br />structure aside the idea of a member of the american underclass being some sort of intellectual god doesn`t really ring true . ask yourself this : if he`s the cleverst character in the movie how come he`s gone through his short life without anyone noticing his abilities ? not one single teacher from his childhood noticed his gift ? highly unlikely as is the fact he`s read so much mind expanding litrature . and if will`s so clever how come he`s so oblivous of what happens to young good looking boys in american prisons ?<br /><br />but it`s the casting that let much of the film down . you want to get a couple of actors to play rough tough irish gang members ? let`s get matt damon and ben affleck which is like getting russell crowe to play a pacifist or charles bronson to play a liberal do gooder . i failed to be convinced by the foul mouthed damon and affleck as they strutted about smacking people in the chops and couldn`t help thinking that even though they wrote the script the parts should have been awarded to different actors , after all billy bob thornton has written screenplays for films he hasn`t been cast in and the same criteria should have been applied here<br /><br />there are some good points to the movie . robin williams is excellent as the man who tries to show will his potential and also very good is stellan skarsgard who is quite simply one of the greatest character actors to stepped foot outside of europe and despite my previous criticism of the script there is quite a moving piece of dialogue at the park as williams character explains to will what he has seen in life<br /><br />but i`ve got to repeat that there`s less plus points than negatives to this movie and i`ve got to agree with the people who`ve said good will hunting is boring and unconvincing
