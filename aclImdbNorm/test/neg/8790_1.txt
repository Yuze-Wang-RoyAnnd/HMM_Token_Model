this movie was obscenely obvious and predictable. the scenes were poorly written and acted even worse. following the horrible scenes was the terrible script filled with pointless and poorly thought out lines. i would never suggest this movie to anyone who would have any sense in watching decent movies. this movie was not only with the same ideas as the show the bachelor and bachelorette but also contained many parts in which you would know what the next move and line was going to be without ever having to watched the movie before. the casting was fine but the actors played there characters horribly with more drama then should have been used and said lines in was that wanted you to change the channel quickly. as a note please don't watch this movie.
