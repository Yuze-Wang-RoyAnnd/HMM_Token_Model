a wonderful semi-humorous homage to expressionistic black and white films of folks like fw murnau, fritz lang, carl dreyer, marcel carn'e and others. allen plays a character caught in a kafkaesque nightmare, at first thinking he is part of a vigilante group trying to catch a killer and slowly realizing that he might be a suspect. the writing is a little forced (this is, after all, woody allen trying to be a coy kafka), but the point is made, and no harm done. the cinematography is interesting, about 100 shades of gray, but make sure you watch in a very dark room with a good screen, or details will get swallowed in the fog. this is an amusing little movie with a few laughs that are actually snorts of "uh-huh". the acting is fine, considering the odd vehicle, and it's worth watching if you are big woody allen fan. also of interest to those knowledgeable about expressionistic films. i'd give this a 6.5 out of 10.
