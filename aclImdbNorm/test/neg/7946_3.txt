it's new year's eve, a cop-killer (in the form of, laurence fishburne) end up at a precinct that's closing down due till snow. when the people are layed siege on, cops have to team up with cons to survive. this re-make of the john carpenter classic just had to add a few beyond stupid plot twists, take out all the tension, and add a horrid john lequizamo to the cast, didn't it? the first film was thrilling, gritty, and a joy to watch. this one is more hollywood, clich'ed, and painful to behold. the only thing i took from this movie was ocd can be very annoying...very. the ending song is sooooooooooooooooo bad.<br /><br />my grade: d- <br /><br />dvd extras: commentary by richet, demonaco and jeffrey silver; delet scenes with optional commentary; 5 minute "armed and dangerous" featurette on the weapons expert; 7 and a half minute "behind precinct walls"; "plan of attack"; "the assault team"; 12 and a half minute behind the scenes featurette;, trailers for "unleashed", "white noise", :seed of chucky" <br /><br />miscelanious: i got this at best buy and it came with a bonus disc including the first 2 minutes of "cry wolf"; a 10 minute first look at "unleashed"; the trailer for that film; and a fuzion interview with john leguizamo
