being a child of the 1980s, i grew up with numerous educational as well as diversionary programs (or both), and continue to learn so much from them now that i admire the wisdom of those who worked on them. after learning that sesame street, to name the best example, was not solely responsible for the fact that i could read at an adult level before i could walk, it only increased the level of disgust i feel not only towards the lyons corporation and its product, but those who defend them, too. as if i had faith in those we assign to protect us or our children to begin with, the fact that barney & friends still pollutes our airwaves after more than a decade later is a discredit not only to the fcc, american commerce, and its makers, it is a discredit to all of humanity. in a world where i can be harassed without recourse by the police, welfare services, and child protection agencies simply for being born different to those in power, yet broadcasters are allowed to pump this drivel into my home uncontested, you have to ask what is wrong with people.<br /><br />you see, in a world where we are expected to behave like adults and account for ourselves, what we say to our sons and daughters is of importance because it will often have consequences long after we are gone. not only are our attempts to make our children more normal, more alike, more think-alike, potentially devastating, what we end up teaching them to be normal has a big part to play, too. so the question becomes one of what barney is teaching our children to be normal. apart from lessons such as that we are not good if we do not have good feelings, or that someone will change the rules to make us happy when we come up short, other shocking things we are shown on the barney show include barney molesting children. the issue of child abduction and child molestation is a big one in our society, and has been ever since we started trying to pretend it was not, but that would qualify as one of the most inappropriate ways in which to present the topic.<br /><br />so far i have only mentioned the inappropriate and emotionally damaging lessons barney himself presents. adding to the problem is the children shown on the show. i use the word children loosely here, as the range of ages shown goes as low as three years and as high as fourteen. yet no difference in emotional response is shown at either extreme. fourteen year olds react to barney and his proposed situations in the exact same way as five year olds. experts in childhood and adolescent autism especially consider this an incredibly foul thing to expose children to. adults on the autistic spectrum who faced increasing problems as their needs were not only not met but flat-out ignored have a tendency to watch this and feel an urge to do the kinds of things with barney that would make fourteen year olds cry. as irreverent and sick as shows targeted toward the elder-child market such as you can't do that on television were, they stamp all over barney by demonstrating that not only do different ages respond to the same thing in different ways, so too do different people.<br /><br />so in response to mdmireles1295, i have to say that i hope like hell they do not have children. for every time i see a parent showing their child this drivel, it gives me an overwhelming urge to report them to the police for child abuse. and i speak as a man whose entire upbringing was dominated by abuse. they might sing about manners, loving, caring, or sharing, but the examples they show are not only so lopsided as to be the opposite of educational, they are so devoid of realism as to become dangerous, as the light triton has already pointed out. the kind of lessons children learn from barney are that people do not vary, feelings must be suppressed at all costs, and rules are entirely arbitrary. when compared to the lessons that variation is what makes the world go around and even the most bitter feelings have a purpose that television taught me as a boy, it still boggles the mind that the authorities have yet to step in and yank this trash off the air. if a parent did to their child what barney does around the world, they would face criminal charges.<br /><br />hence, i gave barney my favourite two out of ten score that i give to all rubbish with absolutely no redeeming value. in a world of adults that know how to properly respond to their children, it has no place.
