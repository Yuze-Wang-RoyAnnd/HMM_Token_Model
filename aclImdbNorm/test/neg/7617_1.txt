i've been a fan of jim henson and his characters since the very beginning. the most beguiling thing about them was the love and innocence and camaraderie shown. kermit was a role model of deep thinking and problem solving. a spiritual character, yet sweetly and believably so. all the other characters were slightly eccentric but it demonstrated how different kinds of beings can co-exist in a caring manner together, respecting each other's difference.<br /><br />following movies have somewhat kept the same vibe. yet this "it's a very merry muppet christmas movie" would have jim henson spinning in his grave. these characters have been completely re-written to be horny, nasty, selfish, and cheesy.<br /><br />the cast goes on to portray god as an uncaring corporate head, with a mean streak. angels as spineless, non-spiritual corporate staff, and the movie was so bad i had to stop watching. i had bought it for my great-nephew but fortunately i preview anything i give a child.<br /><br />this movie deserved the trash bin instead and has no socially redeeming content or charm.<br /><br />shame, shame on the people who re-wrote the characters and departed from jim henson's original heart-centered, socially conscious version. it does a terrible disservice to a great hearted man who is no longer around to defend his creations.
