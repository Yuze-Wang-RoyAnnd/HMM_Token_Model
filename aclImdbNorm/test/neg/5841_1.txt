obviously, a number of agents didn't see beyond dollar signs when they signed up their clients for this 117-minute *omage* to the courtesan complex.<br /><br />sure, the film could have been alright, had the $1 million been left out of it. seriously. the amount of the check doesn't matter,prostitution is still prostitution and no amount of "love conquers all" can change the fact that no marriage vows ever meant to imply "for richer for poorer, for pimping as in fidelity". picture the story otherwise, though: 2 kids, flat broke, borderline "desperate" and completely stupid. they collide with wealthy business man. kids' marriage is strained by imperfect times and the fact that the husband is something of a loser. enter mr. tuxedo, oozing charm and stability -- a virtual magnet for the ticking biological clock -- and with him the wife's temptation, tensions, suspense. whom will she choose? maybe, under those conditions, i could actually care. as-is, frankly, redford's selfish and manipulative playboy winds up the sympathetic character. a woman who will sell herself is just about what a guy deserves who will pimp out his wife. the indecent proposition makes the husband a total loser, deficient in every positive male characteristic, and makes the wife a cheap strumpet seduced by money rather than confused by another potential love, a woman devoid of moral center and self-respect.<br /><br />all the impressive talent (acting, directing, cinematography) wasted on this film -- and it was an impressive amount -- couldn't save it from its splashy-but-too-trashy $1 million pitch line. if i see this turkey at one more bridal shower, i'm going to roast it! (or maybe cross it with titanic and pitch the tape in the ocean!)
