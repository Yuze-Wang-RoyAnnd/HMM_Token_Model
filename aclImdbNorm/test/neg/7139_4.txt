the grudge 2...let's see. don't get me wrong, i'm not a japanese horror film or horror or grudge basher. i loved the first one and the original ju-on. i feel that much more justice could have been done for this one. aubrey only existed to fill in what needed to be 'discovered' in the ending, (which if you've already seen ju-on before this, you already know the whole movie) all it was really was a complete remake of ju-on, just more closely followed than the grudge. though everyone may have thought that it's coming to america was a bit interesting, it was expected as the house burning in the end of the grudge left the 2nd hungering for a new plot. <br /><br />save your $6.50 and wait for this to come out on dvd, rent it, watch it, then decide if you want to buy it. this movie is good for a fall asleep at 2 in the morning film. but overall, i'd say a 4 out of 10. sorry grudge fans, it's just...they just failed at this one.
