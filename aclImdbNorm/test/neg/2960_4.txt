this belabored and sloppy spy melodrama featuring two buffoonish (one idealistic, one drug addled) california kids dealing secrets to the kgb never seems to get enough steam up to sustain any tension and suspense before it dies a very slow death over two hours later. john schlesinger's finished product gives the impression that he was asleep in his director's chair most of the time as the film lags and the actors sleep walk, save for the highly annoying over the top performance of sean penn. <br /><br />childhood altar boys and friends chris (tim hutton) and daulton (penn) devise a plan to sell secrets to the kgb when chris lands a job that allows him access to top secret government materials. disillusioned by what he sees as us meddling in foreign affairs the idealistic chris and the drug hungry daulton make contact with the russians and begin to funnel them classified materials. when chris decides he wants out things begin to unravel at a lackadaisical pace. <br /><br />the eighties were not kind to distinguished director john schlesinger. in the 60s and 70s he had a series of critically acclaimed films in both england and america but then came honky tonk freeway in 1981 and it marked the beginning of the end. the falcon and the snowman more or less put a lid on it. lacking the suspense of marathon man and the quality performances (hoffman voight, christie, jackson, finch, olivier) he had coaxed from leads in the past falcon goes in circles most of the way. <br /><br />sean penn chews scenery from start to finish in such an obnoxious fashion you find yourself encouraging his torturers to do more to him. tim hutton is governed by his limited acting chops and most of his scenes show a need for more rehearsal time. lori singer as hutton's girlfriend plays it mute most of the way with schlesinger content to film her vapid expressions. when she does emote you understand why. only david suchet as the kgb handler with a piercing eyed introspective presence and restraint acquits himself well.
