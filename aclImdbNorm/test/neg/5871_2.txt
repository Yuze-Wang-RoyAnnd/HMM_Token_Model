this is one of those movies you find when you stay up too late and only have basic cable. it's hard to believe this movie was made in '95, considering it looks like something out of the late 80s. plucky youngsters with varied home problems face a demented ice cream man who's on a mission to make the best flavor ever: soylent cream!!! <br /><br />this movie is extremely demented and is only scary in how creepy and absolutely, ridiculously gross it is. actually, the really scary thing about this movie is the nature of the problems these kids face at home. the fact that these kids have no escape from their silent suburban sufferings makes any random loony loose in the neighborhood seem like a walk in the park.<br /><br />the most laughable part of this movie is the fact that the stereotypical "fat kid" is so obviously a slim pre-teen with a mountain of padding under his baggy sweatshirts. i guess that either a) they hadn't invented/ couldn't afford a fat suit, b) the casting director was too lazy to find a pudgy child star or c) we are honestly supposed to believe that this child is starving and has an enormously distended belly. <br /><br />so if you're up at 2 am and need something ridiculous and disgusting to rip on with your intoxicated friends, go ahead and take a look. personally, i'd rather be sleeping.
