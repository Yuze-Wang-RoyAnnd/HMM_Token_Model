there is something about this show that keeps me watching and hoping for the future of it. in the writing, the jokes are few and far between, and the story lines are a bore, so i figure it must be the physical comedy and the visuals.<br /><br />i do enjoy the camera movement, set dressing, and wardrobe. it's amusingly highly contrasted against the dullness that reigns. and i'm pretty sure every time i have laughed it was because of john or molly's physical comedy. the two of them make a sickeningly cute couple that make me laugh and want to puke at the same time.<br /><br />so here i go ready to sit down to kath & kim one more time tonight to see what path this production will go down (or up as the case may be, looking forward positively).
