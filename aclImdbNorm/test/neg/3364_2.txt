jack frost 2 is out of the question, i'm actually surprised people are allowed to make these sort of movies.<br /><br />as sam and his wife take to the tropicana for a relaxing christmas, jack returns to kill off the fun and take on a revenge with inbreeding...<br /><br />don't take a swip at this film at all, most people say its a laugh with your mates, but frankily its a waste of time. if the people who made this film can get a job by doing what they do, they can at least take the time and effort to write up a better story, especially the cheesy character names.
