comedy works best when it relates to stuff that's true. but even as such, some effort is required to make jokes that everyone likes and even the most grumpy of viewers can crack a smile. when i look at the daily show, i see the whole "it's funny because it's true" thing, but i don't, however, see the effort and often times i don't if they're being funny or just trying to make a point(i notice this mostly in the interview segments). the daily show started off as a news parody, by definition they poke fun at how the media plays it's own news by pretending to be inept and dumb news reporters and anchormen and they tackled tons of subjects from science to movies and sometimes politics, then jon stewart came along...and it all went to hell. thr first years of jon stewart's reign were arguably golden, i though he was so funny, but then 2004 came along and it's where you start to notice a huge chance in the show from there on. the show's humor has gone stale, colbert left, steve carell left, many of the show's best anchors left and now it's mostly about jon stewart and the show's gone from a parody to a semi-serious news show, essentially evening news but with some gags here and there. for those who haven't seen the show and are having trouble finding out what to watch on cable, i'll give you a brief description of what the show's about(at least until 2009): -bush, cheney and all republicans(unless they happen to embrace an opinion shared by democrats as well) are stupid, evil, corrupt and hypocrites, anyone who stands by conservative beliefs is also evil, corrupt and a hypocrite; -people who doubt the man-made global warming theory are evil and stupid; -vote democrat; there, i saved you 25 minutes of your time, go watch something else. at first, i though that the producers hijacked the show for their own personal political agenda, but when i actually see the interviews, it becomes crystal clear what this show's about(what i mentioned above), but i'll get to that in a moment. frist off, the humor in the daily show according to jon stewart expects you to find a random filmed quote said by either bush, cheney or a random republican humorous because well, because. jon sets up the joke, setting it in writers specific context and expects that the random quote somehow delivers the punchline. so, unless you <<get>> the context, it's entirely useless as bankable humor. also the daily show expects you to laugh when they show a montage of one politician talking and in another separate video saying another thing, again putting into a context that the writers expect you to understand, thus making it funny,why? well, because jon said so. now imagine the daily show using that formula countless times for years every week, and you'll start to understand of what used to be a laugh-fest that is now 25 minutes of just silent stares(yes, even in the lewis black segments). at first, some decent amount of effort was put into these jokes, but now much less of that is apparent. and the interview have the most odd sense of bias that i've ever seen. jon stewart calls bill o'reilly a bully, but what does that make him, when he sucks up to every single actor and democrat(john kerry before, obama today) that appears on the show and looks down upon respected republicans and accomplished conservative newsmen such as weekly standard's own bill kristol? he puts them in some sort of people's tribunal as if they're being charged with a crime, often times any person on the show who stands up for bush is portrayed as delusional, as if that person's out of touch with reality and assumes he speaks for the majority of america, that's the de facto treatment for anybody conservative, unless they happen to share a similar point of view with democrats, if so then's it's an endless love fest. but still, it doesn't matter, in the eyes of jon you are already wrong before you walked into the show and are still wrong afterwords. that's the kind of treatment you get if you are anything remotely right-wing. now you have to wonder what that could possibly have anything to do with humor. one wonders what'll happen if democrats win the white house...
