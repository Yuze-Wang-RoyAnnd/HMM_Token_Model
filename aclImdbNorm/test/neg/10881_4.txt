continuing in the string of "stalker/slasher" flicks in the vein of "wolf creek," "hostel," "joy ride," etc., comes "rest stop." the most unoriginal and useless one of them all.<br /><br />we start, reasonably promising, with the violent death of a pretty young girl in a filthy restroom.<br /><br />this is where our interest is lost. we, then, move to the clich'e road trip couple, on their way to la with their eyes on acting stardom. . . which, doing movies like this, they'll never achieve.<br /><br />from the sexual romp in the park, the couple drives, arguing all the way, to a deserted and disgusting rest area for the girl to use the bathroom. harmless enough until she exits and finds her boyfriend missing and realizes she's being stalked by a lame version of "joy ride"'s rusty nail. . . only driving around in mater from "cars".<br /><br />honestly, if this had been directed/written/produced/acted by anyone else, it might've been fairly good. but no.<br /><br />because then comes the ghost story. yup. . . you guessed it. plenty of "oh, i'll help you, but wait, you're dead" to "wait is this stalker a person, monster, or ghost?".<br /><br />but wait? who comes to the rescue to save the girl's life and possibly the movie? that one lawerence brother. excellent. we're saved. (sarcasm) oh wait, no we're not.<br /><br />you know. . . if you want to laugh off a pretty bad, or if you get free rentals like i do, give it a try.<br /><br />if anything, you'll learn how not to make a movie.<br /><br />-ap3-
