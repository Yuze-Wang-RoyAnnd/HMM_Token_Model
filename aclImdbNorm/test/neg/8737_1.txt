a buddy and i went to see this movie when it came out in 1980. it was playing in a huge theater and we were the only two people in the place. it lasted two days in the theater before they stopped showing it. it was so bad that we laughed all the way through it. since that time, we rate movies based on kill or be killed as the worst movie of all time. like other reviewers have mentioned, it is so bad that it is funny. it isn't worth a second look that's for sure. i just can't bring myself to give it more than a 1 because i don't think the makers of the movie intended for it to be so bad and i can't give credit for an accident. sorry.
