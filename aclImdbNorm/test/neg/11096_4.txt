if you thought this is the french the mummy and if you're hoping for another "vidocq"...well look elsewhere. it does have the same kind of story like the mummy concerning this book of the dead and a soul that needs to find 7 missing pieces that are scattered in the louvre. i found the movie to be slightly entertaining, boring for the most part. the special effects aren't bad, but it's nothing spectacular as i was expecting big explosions and perhaps the eiffel tower crumbling down until i realized that those kind of scenes were in the mummy and this is belhpegor. apparently based on a french cult tv series, belphegor could have been so much better. i voted this film a 4/10 only for the beautiful sophie marceau...she must be almost 40 and she looks breathtaking!
