this is the one major problem with this film, along with a good deal of qu'ebecois' biggest movies: done in a pretentious way by pretentious people.<br /><br />it's really sad, but "big shots" movie makers (driving dodge stratus...) from this province believes they got the thruth, they know what the little people like.<br /><br />we're not a rich province, every time a big movie like this (30 millions?!!?) is made, it's cutting off a lot of others who won't see their movie made because of lack of governmental help. so it generates mediocrity; only movies from "friends of the family" are going to be made.<br /><br />i sound angry and i am. i went see nouvelle-france expecting a journey in the lives of my ancestors, but i found myself stuck in a pool of inconsistencies: french accent (we gotta please our cousins, so f*** our qu'ebecois' language)and lack of historical research is only a few. add a campy love story and the same music score playing again and again and dumb qu'ebecois' viewer is gonna open up and ask for more. i'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots... it's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained "movie business" of qu'ebec.<br /><br />rent cruising bar instead and have a real good time.<br /><br />ps: i'll never forgive them for ruining such an awesome title.
