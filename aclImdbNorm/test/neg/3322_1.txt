i'm usually not inclined to write reviews about films i don't think deserve a mention. but, in the quest to grow as a writer and film critic, i feel it is important to express my thoughts when i don't like a film. "queen of the damned" is one of those films.<br /><br />anne rice's popular horror stories of lestat, a bisexual vampire, first took to the screen in 1994 in the successful "an interview with a vampire". starring two of hollywood's biggest heavyweights in tom cruise and brad pitt, the film's stylish aesthetic and gothic mise en scene captured the audience. while it may have been a case of style way over substance, there was something about it that worked, despite its chessiness (i have never been that enamoured with the vampire genre in general).<br /><br />since that time brad pitt and tom cruise have gone on to much bigger things. it's likely both would have roared with laughter when asked to appear in a sequel. they would have been laughing even harder when they saw the final outcome. "queen of the damned" typifies the type of cr*p hollywood is content to put out at a low cost with the hope of earning a quick buck thanks to an average soundtrack and big marketing campaign aimed at 13 to 17 year olds.<br /><br />needless to say this film is terrible from the start. lestat, now played by brit stuart townsend of "shooting fish" fame, awakens from his dark grave to the sound of... you guessed it, nu-metal. he freaks out some confused punkish musicians and joins their band, under the proviso that he only appear at night, what with the sun burning his skin and all during the day...<br /><br />jesse (marguerite moreau), a student studying the paranormal (vampire studies 101 perhaps?), tries to find out if lestat really is who he says he is. along the way she falls for him (something to do with her odd past), but has a little competition in queen akasha (aaliyah), a vampire demon queen who is returning from the underworld to acquire lestat as her chosen king.<br /><br />the film is shamefully self-indulgant, yet its campy tone leaves some room for its depreciating humour. anybody who sees this film for anything but a good laugh needs to see more films in general! watching townsend is enjoyable. he knows the role is utterly over the top and does his best to walk the tightrope between utter hamming and serious acting. the late aaliyah is, unfortunately, terrible in the title role. she has minimal screentime, and what she does have she does not use to the fullest. the poor makeup and special effects do not help; at times she sounds like she's talking through a voicebox.<br /><br />it is rumoured that this film was heading straight to video until aaliyah's untimely death last year. with the possibility for people to see her final film, warner bros put this out to a general release. otherwise this would have been one of those movies you see on the shelf at video shops but avoid because you can tell it is going to be simply terrible.<br /><br />no doubt films like this will continue to be made. look at the spate of teen rom-com rip offs around or the spoofing of that genre itself with films like "not another teen movie". if there is a market to exploit hollywood will do so.<br /><br />the biggest issue i have with this film is not the film itself. hollywood is about making money, so if there is a market for this film then they will pursue it. that's business. but what concerns me the most is that people will actively go out to the cinema and pay money to watch it! i guess that's the biggest argument in the world of cinema: is film art first and entertainment second, or is it the other way around? the only people who can decide that is the audience. if you like and are intrigued by good films, stay clear of this turkey.
