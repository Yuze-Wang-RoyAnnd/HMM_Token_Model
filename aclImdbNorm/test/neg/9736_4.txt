despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the 20th century, erwin rommel is generally well-regarded by historians and world war ii buffs as a gentleman, a soldier's soldier, and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare. if only hitler had given him the troops and materiel he had desired in africa, the argument goes, things would have gone very differently. and that's probably true. rommel was, in fact, a military genius, and by all accounts an upstanding, honest man.<br /><br />but this film goes out of its way to portray him as a near-saint. he does his job, trying to win the war for hitler, but constantly the fuhrer interferes and gives him ridiculous orders, which rommel (james mason) expresses amazement with but rarely actually questions and never, ever disobeys. only when it's patently obvious that hitler is leading germany to ruin does rommel think of treason against him; this dilemma plays out as the main theme of the film, a good man in bad circumstances trying to do the right thing.<br /><br />mason is fine as rommel, but it's hardly a memorable performance along the lines of, say, george c. scott as patton. of course, rommel wasn't as colorful as patton, but this film is so intent on making him look like a decent human being that it forgets to make him interesting. he occasionally lapses into some warmth when with his wife lucie (a young jessica tandy, well-cast), but usually mason is called upon to give a stiff british performance
