this is a poor caricature of "lonesome dove" - and larry mcmurtry.<br /><br />i love your books, with "lonesome dove" among the top three. i have admired the way you view yourself, through your characters, with such unflinching honesty, balanced by never taking it all too seriously. i am, therefore, spoiled.<br /><br />why have you come to this?<br /><br />"comanche moon" is not up to your standards. i see that you are credited with the screen-writing, but this is so unlike you, i prefer to think it is written by someone else.<br /><br />the dialogue makes me claustrophobic, wishing someone would break out with a naturally stated sentence. the part about 'genius' was agonizing. mccrae was unrecognizable - chiefly because of the inane words coming out of his mouth.<br /><br />well, i miss call, too.<br /><br />the most important missing factors are gus and call and the men they are: their matter-of-fact courage; the underlying vein comprised of ethics and honesty; their lack of self delusion. hard men leading hard lives with a certain undeniable grace.<br /><br />some blame has to attach to the labored direction here and throughout. all of the cast needed dialect and dialogue coaching.<br /><br />while i try to imagine robert duvall as mccrae, speaking this same dialogue, it comes off better - but not much. it tries to sound cowboy-of-few-words shy, sly-grin witty, but doesn't half succeed...<br /><br />how can it be so different from "lonesome dove"? can the writer have forgotten his characters? you have fooled some of the people, mr. mcmurtry - but not this one.
