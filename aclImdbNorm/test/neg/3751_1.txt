let's not kid ourselves, this atrocity is not plan nine or cat women. it is bad, period! the performances vary from drama school theatrics (marla english) to a 'couldn't care less' walk through (tom conway). the photography (even in a good print) is so murky it is occasionally hard to see what is happening. the real problem, however, is the aimless, pointless, nearly plot less story and the leaden, paceless direction. at a brisk 77 minutes it still feels endless.<br /><br />the screenplay is especially inept. there are two story lines that only intersect at the very end of the picture. tom conway is trying to create a super race, using voodoo and modern science (although there is little science in evidence) which he can control telepathically. he is keeping his wife prisoner (for no discernible reason). meanwhile a couple of petty crooks and a white hunter type guide are trying to find the village in which he is working, in the expectation of gold and jewels. when they finally arrive, tom conway decides that one of them, the woman, is the perfect subject for his experiments. she is turned into a monster, kills conway (natch!) and then reverts to normal. she sees a gold statue half drowned in a boiling pool, tries to retrieve it and falls in the water and apparently drowns. the white hunter rescues the wife. in the final shot we see the supposedly drowned woman emerge as the monster again; threatening a sequel (now that really is a scary thought!).<br /><br />the aip producer, samuel z arkoff, in a lecture included on the dvd, prides himself on spotting the teenage niche market and satisfying it with ingenious low budget movies. however, it is difficult to see how anyone could think this rancid concoction would satisfy any sort of audience. what appeal do they think it could possibly have? the monster appears so rarely that it could hardly be called a horror film. the jungle action is tepid and tedious. there are no teenagers in it and no characters that teenagers could be expected to identify with.<br /><br />the producers exposed 77 minutes of film, but they didn't make a movie. this is a con trick and arkoff should be ashamed of his association with it.
