i'm not a movie snob. i've liked lots of movies that critics hate, and i've hated movies that critics love. however, i have to agree with critics here--"galaxina" is just substandard. clearly intended to be a comedy, it only has a few scattered laughs. "galaxina" has poor photography; it has poor special effects; it has some pretty poor acting; and the production values...well, the sets might as well have been made of cardboard.<br /><br />"galaxina" tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magical object called "the blue star". after a long voyage (and some very unconvincing space battles), the crew arrives at its destination, a sort of wild west alien world. there's a painfully unfunny cantina scene (clearly designed to be a spoof of the famous "star wars" scene), a chase involving space bikers, and a final getaway.<br /><br />the cast tries, but can't breathe life into this turkey. stephen macht and avery schreiber have done better work in other movies. james david hinton is pretty good as a member of the spaceship's crew. the late dorothy stratten stars as the robot of title, and while she looks great, her role doesn't give her much of a chance to act.<br /><br />you might catch this film to see dorothy stratten. however, if you're looking for a good movie, you'll probably want to skip this one.
