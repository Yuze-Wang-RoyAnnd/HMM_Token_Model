i was very disappointed by this movie. ms english who says that she is a fan of the original movie seemed to have taken a great piece of artistic work, and transformed it into a flat-lined "ho-hum" you've come a long way baby production. i tried to like meg ryan's mary haines, but she was just boring. she didn't seem to feel anything about her husband's affair. there was no emotional struggle, no deep hurt. in the original 1939 movie norma shearer's mary haines felt betrayed, shocked, vulnerable, confused and angry. the 2008 production was more about some fake sisterhood theme, (actually my wife's words)and didn't make you shed a tear or even chuckle. the only performances that were note worthy we're of debra messing, and bette midler. (i wanted more of bette.) there was really no protagonist in this movie. the sylvia fowler character had too many sub themes to it. and crystal allen had no fire. the remake of the department store encounter with annette benning, and miss mendez was luke warm. also the pacing was slow as well. obviously the 1939 version needed to be updated, but this one wasn't it. the reason that the original version worked so well was that the characters were dealing with "man" problems. a subject by the way which isn't out-dated. the magic of the original movie was that the movie was about both sexes, while you never saw the men.
