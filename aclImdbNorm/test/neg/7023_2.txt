this is a terrible movie, and i'm not even sure why it's so terrible. it's ugly, for one, with that trendy 1970s visual style that maybe seemed like a good idea at the time but which now enables one to instantly recognize a film from that time period as being a 70s product. the film retains the story and songs that made the stage version of the musical such a hit, but the songs sound lifeless on screen. but mostly, the movie sucks because of the wan performance of lucille ball, who you'd think would be able to make something of this larger-than-life character if anyone could. she sleepwalks through the movie like a terrified actress choking on her opening night, and the film sinks with her. even bea arthur, who i bet was hilarious in the best friend role onstage, can't breathe any life into this stinker.<br /><br />avoid at all costs.<br /><br />grade: d
