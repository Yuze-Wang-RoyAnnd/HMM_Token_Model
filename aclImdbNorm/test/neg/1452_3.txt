i seem to remember a lot of hype about this movie when it came out, but had avoided seeing it throughout the years. i wish i'd waited longer. maybe this movie was funny in 1988, i don't know. i was younger then, but it didn't seem like the world was that different. michelle pfeiffer, lovely as she is, is never convincing. mercedes ruehl not only chews scenery, but stuffs it in her cheeks like a gerbil to save for later. dean stockwell is about as convincing as a mob boss as james gandolfini would be as principal dancer for the bolshoi. and matthew modine demonstrated the most pronounced case of delayed puberty i've ever seen. all in all, it's not bad enough to make you want to pluck out your eyes with a melon-baller, but it's not far off.
