isn't it depressing how the most violent cartoon on cartoon network is aimed at girls? while i'm not watching soldiers getting shot and blown up on saving private ryan or band of brothers, it would be nice if there was a cartoon or at least something on tv i could watch to satisfy my violent urges. and something that i would not get made fun of for watching. i did see some episodes (i should really be shot for this) and had to sit through the movie (now, where do i find a gun?), and it is quite clear that this lost its spark after the first few episodes. if you like seeing 500-foot monsters that can destroy huge cities in seconds getting slaughtered by toddlers about one foot tall, this is a must-see. but it does get very boring after a while, and with a show like this, even original ideas become chiefly dull. the movie just felt like one overlong episode (i can't remember any of it), and the villain should have been far more intimidating than a green monkey. this show is a laughing stock. it churns out the same basic premise episode after episode after episode, and though it may try to have some mystery and intrigue once in a while, the ending will always be the same - "the powerpuff girls save the day!" all is good and nice, but all is very, very repetitive... i give it 3 out of 10 for being the only danged cartoon on cn to revolve around violence, although it is aimed at girls, so i won't be tuning in for it ever. i've established myself as a fan of war and violence films and i won't have that reputation destroyed... 3/10
