this movie started off great; the first 30 minutes are very funny and clever with some interesting characters. that's the good news. the bad news is that the film then gets too repetitive and then it gets downright stupid. <br /><br />what we wind up getting is a santa claus with "magical" powers with a lot of new age baloney thrown in the mix. it's just ridiculous and hardly the kind of "christmas movie" i would expect from jim varney's "ernest."<br /><br />to be fair, it still had a decent amount of laughs and is profanity-free but just not a film i could recommend.
