i cant put it any simpler than that, this is a terrible film. i've worked in the industry and made several (short) films myself, so okay my standard is pretty high but seriously, i absolutely hate this film. i haven't made a comment on imdb before but i hated this film so much i literally had to come and warn others. it is a piece of sh*t. the writer/director is an idiot who just has no idea how to make/write a good film and has the writing skills of an adolescent teenager. the characters are unrealistic (the lead woman doesn't think of taking the policeman's pistol yet is resourceful enough to improvise a molotov cocktail? please...) and not even likable, hell i hated her and cheered when she died. i don't understand what the director was trying to do with his demon redneck idea, but it just looked like sloppy writing and convenient bullsh*t with no real thought behind it to me. this is officially the worst movie i've seen all year. congratulations shiban, you now rank up there with such greats as micheal bay in the prestigious "shouldnt be allowed to waste millions of dollars on making a film" club. i hope you read this, i really do. and to the 163 idiots that rated this film 10 out of 10 bwahhahahahah oh my god i hope a redneck demon appears conveniently behind you and tortures you.
