this was a crappy, miserably acted movie based on sublimated male fantasies. a shame that it was based in texas, an otherwise excellent state. i would recommend this movie to no-one, and wish that it had never entered my consciousness as i am now so irritated that i wasted my brain cells even paying the slightest attention to it.
