whoa, this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen! the packaging for the film is better than the film itself. my girlfriend and i watched it this past weekend, and we only continued to watch it in the hopes that it would get better...it didn't...<br /><br />the picture quality is poor; it looks like it was shot on video and transferred to film. the lighting is not great, which makes it harder to read the actors' facial expressions. the acting itself was cheesy, but i guess it's acceptable for "yet another" teenage horror flick. the sound was a huge problem: sometimes you have to rewind the video because the sound is unclear and/or muffled.<br /><br />it holds no real merit of it's own; trying to ride on the coattails of "sleepy hollow." don't bother with this one.
