sorry folks, i love ray bolger's work but the one thing he ain't is a leading man. maybe if you pretend he's the last man on earth, this romantic plot might work but come'on now !<br /><br />here's a movie that exists simply to showcase the title song which was a big hit for the basie band the year before (1951). and some pretty nifty singing and dancing save it from being a total disaster. <br /><br />however, the story line is pathetic, even by 1952 musical comedy standards. and the other songs are equally as forgettable as evening in paris cologne. the dialogue embarrasses the stars, day & bolger. only claude dauphin's boyeresque charms keep his character three dimensional.<br /><br />so, how to enjoy this movie on video ? <br /><br />a.) fast forward through all the dialogue...<br /><br />b.) surrender yourself to doris day's vocals and ray bolger's loose-limbed footwork. and don't miss dauphin's hilarious take on a rain-soaked, windswept reprise of "april in paris"...<br /><br />c.) finally, keep a couple of bottles of cabernet chilled and handy.<br /><br />bob raymond
