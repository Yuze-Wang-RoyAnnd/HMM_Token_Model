this movie begins with a man who appears to be some sort of sports driver. he meets up with a gang which contains an arrogant boss, an obvious idiot, a fat boy who never speaks, and a woman who rotates between the three of them. the group which is called satan's angels, wants rod, the driver, as their personal driver. he says no but then says yes after the authorities make him a spy to check on them. they rob a weapon shop in a ridiculously plot-missing scene. the scene involves the woman walking into the store with her long hair in a bun and large circular glasses on. she says she wants protection and wants the shopkeeper to load the gun to show her how. she then takes it from the shopkeeper and shoots him. the other three in the gang (excluding rod) run into the store. they take everything off the walls and then proceed to play with it like children receiving their toys on christmas day.<br /><br />this movie surely wastes no precious screen time with a plot.
