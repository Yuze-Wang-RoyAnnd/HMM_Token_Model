the emperor's (richard haydn) dog is betrothed to johanna's (joan fontaine) dog. however, when virgil (bing crosby) arrives in town to sell a gramaphone record player to the emperor, his dog is attacked by johanna's dog. after a revenge attack where virgil is banished from town, a psychoanalyst insists that johanna's dog must confront virgil's dog so that she can overcome her doggy fears. this is arranged and the dogs fall in love. so do virgil and johanna. the rest of the film passes by with romance and at the end, johanna's dog gives birth. but who is the father.......? <br /><br />the dog story is the very weak vehicle that is used to try and create a story between humans. its a terrible storyline. there are 3 main musical pieces all of which are rubbish - bad songs and dreadful choreography. its just an extremely boring film - bing has too many words in each sentence and delivers them in an almost shouty, irritating manner. its not funny............ ever..........but its meant to be. bing and joan have done much better than this.
