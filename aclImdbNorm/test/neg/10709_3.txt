it's a male bashing bonanza. i saw this on sci-fi a while ago, and the idea seemed interesting. it could have been a good movie, and the plot itself i don't see as male bashing, but certain specific references to men get really annoying. i might still watch the movie again though because it does at least try to redeem itself by hinting that maybe the women in the movie aren't really as non-violent as they claim, but it still doesn't compensate for the really tiring male-bashing. i mean, i can understand a little, it's part of the movie's plot, but come on, it gets really tiring after awhile. not only that, but to assume that the majority of women in the world would accept becoming homosexual that easily and that the few remaining heterosexuals would be such a minority as to go "in the closet". it's just too unbelievable. there are far too many women out there with cultural or religious restrictions that would balk at this it is totally implausible. i mean i know its sci-fi, and i love sci-fi, but the best sci-fi has at least a hint of it being possible, and this is too implausible. the phrase "truth is stranger than fiction" came about because fiction has to at least seem plausible to be welcomed, but truth isn't always. this movie is not that. other than that, the movie does have some good acting and the eventual morals of the story, that something like what happened was wrong, do redeem it a little, but not enough.
