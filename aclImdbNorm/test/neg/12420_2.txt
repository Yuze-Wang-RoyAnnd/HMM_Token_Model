this is basically your run of the mill violent biker flick complete with nifty slangs, crashes, and music. ok, so just slangs and crashes. it's a slight notch above much of the other fare featured on mst3k but it's still the equivalent of driving a nail into your kneecap: slow and painful. to give away plot would exhaust my energy so i'll just say you're better off skipping this one.
