the name of bad company's greatest hits album is called "10 from 6". you could have just turned up this album and cut the sound on this movie. most of the songs played in the movie were from this album. i guess oldsters during the 1970s were probably tired of all the period pieces made then about the 1930s and 1940s. that's how i feel about movies made about the 1970s. the characters in the movie looked like they were auditioning for danny terrio. why is it that movies have to exaggerate the 1970s. the only good period piece i liked was "freaks and geeks". they cut that television show. it was exactly like things were in high school when i was there back circa 1980. i was old enough to remember the 70s and no small town was like this. it was totally youth dominated. there were no reactionaries talking about the hippies and about the inner city of philly. that was more the 70s that i remember as a kid. this movie was very dull and cheesy. at times, i was falling asleep. i don't know why an actor who was acting during the 70s, appeared in this one. he was probably trying to lend it some credibility. walken didn't even show up until the second half. i guess the only true thing about the movie was the "baby boomers" were/are a spoiled lot. all the kids in the movie were spoiled brats. i don't know what they had against their father.
