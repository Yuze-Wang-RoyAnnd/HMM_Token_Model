respected western auteur budd boetticher is woefully out of place with this choppy modern day cops and robbers story that suffers from a strong lack of emotional believability. boetticher seems to have waived rehearsal time and settled for the first take as leads joe cotton and rhonda fleming put little effort into their roles, delivering lines flatly and without energy. <br /><br />mild mannered employee leon "foggy" poole works as an inside man on a bank job that goes bad and gets his wife killed in the process. he escapes from prison and immediately sets out to kill the wife of the detective who killed his. hundreds of cops are mobilized to keep him from getting to the home of the intended who has been moved to another location but wouldn't you know in the films final moments we have foggy trailing feet behind the victim (who thought somehow that taking a bus back to the house was a sound move) while a company of cops observe and bicker over what action to take. sound preposterous? you should see it. it's all of that and more. <br /><br />lucien ballard's camera work does a decent job of bringing noir to the suburbs but the editing is lackadaisical and shapeless and it drains the film of its suspense and pace. as poole, wendell corey is the best thing in the film managing to evoke great sympathy as he transitions from gentle soul to murderer. these attributes aside killer uniformly fails in construction and execution making its message clear. go western old budd.
