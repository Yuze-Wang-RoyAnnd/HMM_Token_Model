i've seen worse, which is a backhanded way of saying how crummy this film was. the plot is ridiculous: a student shoots a police officer and five more take him hostage? in a dimly-lit, smoky new york school -- and somehow this clich'ed hostage situation takes 24 hours to resolve? are you serious? a day-long hostage situation -- with a wounded nypd officer no less, takes all day? i realize this film was made pre-9/11, but still. i looked at the clock and wondered how they could possibly drag this overdone plot on for another hour and 10 minutes.<br /><br />the acting was mediocre at best all-around, and the characters were seemingly thought up by 7th graders. the child-abuse kid, the pregnant scared girl, the violent gang wannabe, a confused unfortunate victim, the wise-cracking white guy. please.<br /><br />trying to make this hostage situation into a mission for "more textbooks" and better school conditions? please -- this is a weak attempt to justify writing a movie about a kid who shoots a cop. they're confused, ignorant idiots who get involved in a dumb -- far-fetched -- situation. don't try and paint them, suddenly, as noble, the most laughable is ziggy, who lives in the school's attic and admires michaelangelo so much so that he paints these striking scenes on the walls. you've got to be kidding me.<br /><br />the "no racism" signs in the protesting crowd? a black kid shoots a black cop and a black negotiator tries to patch it all up. this is a random message.<br /><br />i understand the overall message, which was poorly portrayed, albeit by some actors who have gone on to respectable careers.<br /><br />this was a joke though the red sniper lasers on the roof? the worst scene was the kid, fake snow falling, dying in the arms of his buddy on the roof, "promise me" etc. how original.<br /><br />the epilogue of "i went to prison but now i'm pre-law at xyz university" ... a fitting way to end a joke of a movie.
