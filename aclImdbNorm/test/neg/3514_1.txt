i must begin by saying that this is one of the most annoying films i have seen in my entire life! annoying factor number one: never seeing the "son's" face (for the entire movie). and the infinitely more annoying factor: that incessantly ringing phone..nothing but listening to the phone ring over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over...you get my point. the old man was being harassed but the viewer was too! at first the film was interesting to me but it deteriorated very quickly. the film may possibly have been good as a short but was definitely not enough to maintain anything approaching feature film length. i guess what i am trying to say is that the message about racism (which finally put in an appearance during the last two scenes of the movie) is secondary to this old mans being harassed. who cares to sit and watch what is really nothing more than an old man spouting obscenities at someone prank calling him?? if you've never seen a movie that just gets under your skin and drives you crazy...check this one out!
