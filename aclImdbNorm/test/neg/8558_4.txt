lord protector is kiddie fare, but for whose kids? obviously shot for television or stv, this amateurish rehash krull has several stock characters -- a magician, an assassin, a warrior, a scientist -- on the trail of something or other in order to defeat the dark forces about to be unleashed on their planet. badly written, acted and staged in available california locations like municipal parks and a ranch, lord protector has nothing to recommend it, not even as a time waster. jay underwood is the only "name" actor, and most people, especially the intended audience of five year olds, are not likely to remember him from such ancient disney fare as not quite human. a no-name actor playing a magician in an ill-fitting silver wig at least plays it with tongue planted firmly in cheek, while those around him act as if they are in a dinner theater production of king lear. i was hoping at least for a decent action or special effects sequence. alas, the action sequences are pathetically staged and the few special effects are those old fashioned painted-over cartoon gags we used to see in 1950s and 1960s fantasy flicks, like bert gordon's the magic sword. the filmmakers planned a sequel that mercifully never came to be. often, such cheap hollywood back-lot productions use a combination of legit and porn actors. i kept myself occupied during the film's seemingly interminable running time, trying to figure which was which in this one. i didn't have much luck.
