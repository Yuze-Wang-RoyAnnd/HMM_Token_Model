i was not old enough to really appreciate the original mod squad, but i knew everyone thought it was cool. i have some of the "books" that were written based on the series in my screen-to-print collection, and they're pretty light duty, so i didn't expect much from the movie. that's a good thing, because this movie was bad on a long leash. <br /><br />i admire the risk in creating a movie that is so completely true to the 1960's hit. the movie audience, though, has gained sophistication in 30 years. at least, i think so. i certainly expect something more than an hour and a half of the original mod squad concept, with (now old) car chases, (now considered poor) camera work, (tinny sounding) soundtrack and (poor) script and all, on the big screen. in the 1960s, we didn't care as much because we had minimal expectations. an integrated police team of young people wearing something besides suits was enough. it was that, another thrilling episode of "ironsides" or "password."<br /><br />rating this "episode" against usual theatre releases, the story was...well, i'm not sure i should even say because i'm not sure there was one. drugs are bad? whatever. the script was silly. when the characters are exchanging dialog and advancing the plot with lines like "i overheard him say so on the phone," and "i think i got a plan," we really are in trouble. no wonder the acting was dreadful: no one knew how to say such idiotic lines.<br /><br />if i were claire danes, i'd be going after my agent with a flame-thrower right now. (actually, i think everyone in and watching the film has a right to seek retribution.)<br /><br />and where was the mod in that squad? i realize these kids just got out of juvenile hall, but no one had a velvet suit? "mod" only meant young and integrated? what happened to white go-go boots? perhaps the costume department was going for gritty, but all they got was dirty and dingy.<br /><br />since the movie was completely true to the original series, and required special behavior from the actors, cameramen, stunt men, etc., we should appreciate it more. unfortunately, i still don't like it. if i wanted to watch 60's crime drama, i'd buy dvds. no thanks.
