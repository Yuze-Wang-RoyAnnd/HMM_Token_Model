let's see how many ways you can insult my gender: 1. of course girl #1 is a horrible skank who cheats on her boyfriend and sounds/looks like a heroin addict.<br /><br />2. of course girl #1 sleeps with the guy on the first date after getting wasted.<br /><br />3. of course the lesbians are butch "germans" who are into s&m.<br /><br />4. this one was actually a surprise. ending the movie on a note of torture celebrated by the majority of characters was sickening. seeing a woman beaten isn't my idea of comedy.<br /><br />5. director's commentary - talking about hooking up with actresses in the movie, just so you know, is crass and incredibly unprofessional.
