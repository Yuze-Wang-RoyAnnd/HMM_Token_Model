this has got to be one of the weakest plots in a movie i have ever seen.<br /><br />however, that is not all that this movie is lacking. this movie has the worst acting, writing, directing, special effects, you name it--it's the worst ever.<br /><br />i highly advise you to spend your time on worthwhile movies and not waste your time on this garbage.<br /><br />i do agree with an earlier post that the "women" were definitely men dressed up in drag, and that did give me a laugh, i keep trying to figure out if they were being obvious about it or if they were actually trying to be sexy women.<br /><br />anyway, there is not much else in this movie that is worth watching!<br /><br />to sum it up: horrible acting, horrible script, horrible idea for a movie. an hour and a half of my life i want back right now!!
