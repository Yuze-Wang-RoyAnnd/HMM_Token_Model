one chinese gang attacks and wipes out another gang in the beginning of the film. unfortunately, the patriarch of the winning family is killed in the process. oddly, and without any discernible reason, the gang solicits a volunteer to blame the massacre on and he leaves until the police decide to stop investigating. now how one man alone is the one responsible for about 50 deaths is beyond me, so sending this one guy away just seemed silly, but that's the plot. later, when this man comes home, betrayals and scheming have occurred--leading to almost one hour and fifteen minutes of non-stop killing.<br /><br />if you are looking for a chinese martial arts film with much of a plot, then you should probably skip this movie, as its practically non-stop action and practically no plot or character development--even when compared to other martial arts films. i would estimate that 80-90% of the film are fight scenes--endless and reasonably well made fight scenes using knives. again and again and again, fight scenes! if you want a film with a body count perhaps running into the hundreds as people are slashed, kicked, and slashed, then this is the film for you. the problem was by the end of the film there are literally no people left to kill and the film really lost my interest!! deep it ain't, but if you want to see excitement and action only, then this film is for you! <br /><br />by the way, this movie is set in contemporary times and no one thinks of shooting the hero until just near the end. and, when they finally do the logical thing, it's too late and the effort is really, really lame! logical errors like this and the lady's suicide (why???) make this a "turn off your brain" type of film.
