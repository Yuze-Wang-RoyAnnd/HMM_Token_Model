i sat through this on tv hoping because of the names in it that it would be worth the time...but dear gussie, whoever thought this script was worth producing? the basic idea is excellent but the execution is appallingly bad, with a constantly illogical sequence of scenes, an ending that is almost laughably melodramatic and poor rock hudson wanders through this with an understandably confused look on his slightly sagging face. looks like a bad b movie from the 40's...
