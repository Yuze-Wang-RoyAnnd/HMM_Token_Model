one of a few movies filmed at coronado high school in scottsdale, az in the late 80's as well as just one of the guys, bill and ted's excellent adventure and just perfect (which was a segmented movie played during the mickey mouse club.) movie is definitely for kids as the previous comments have it pretty right on. <br /><br />coronado has gone through an overhaul in the past couple of years and many of the buildings seen in this film are now gone. the field where they are playing catch is adjacent to the football field, one of the few areas still there. the internal scenes near the lockers i believe were in the old 200 building.<br /><br />unless it is playing late at night on the disney channel it may be a very hard to find flick. how they ever made sequels to this is beyond me.
