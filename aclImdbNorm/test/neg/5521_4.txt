happy days was one of my favorite shows when it aired in 1974. but the critics were quick to show their ignorance combined with a total lack of a sense of humor by slamming this show because they thought it was a cheap attempt to cash-in on the success of american graffitti.<br /><br />there were some similarities between american graffitti and happy days.<br /><br />both opened with "rock around the clock" by bill haley & the comets. both took place in a bygone era and both featured ron howard as one of the leading roles. but there were also some major differences. while american graffitti took place in 1962 california and centered around a group of newly graduated high school students about to take that big step into adulthood, happy days took place in milwaulkee, wisconson and centered around a group of teenagers in high school, dealing with the joys and tribulations of adolescence.<br /><br />happy days originally opened with the juke box playing the original version of bill haley & the comets' rock around the clock. but when oldies became hot, thanks to the success of american graffitti, , and the original 1954 version of rock around the clock, entered the billboard hot 100 and became a hit again in 1974, royalty payments went through the roof. so a "remake" of the song (the correct term is now "new stereo recording") was quickly substituted.<br /><br />the current theme song for happy days was then introduced for the second season if memory serves me right.<br /><br />fans and foes alike agree that this show is escapist. liberties were taken and details overlooked, making this show less than completely authentic.<br /><br />this is perfectly fine. happy days is supposed to be a comedy, not a history lesson. but occasionally the writers did sometimes stick their necks out by hitting on controversial topics. one episode centered around the cunninghams building of a fall out shelter. another episode was about a divorced woman moving into the neighborhood with a dream of starting a new life. the topic of prejudice was addressed when howard was invited to the wedding of an old army buddy who just happened to be black (in an era when prejudice and discrimination was sadly an acceptable part of the american way of life). the issue of the draft even came up on a later episode!<br /><br />the show as originally set in 1955. one problem that was dealt wisely was with the cast. most of them were teenagers and as each year passed, it was obvious that they grew older so the series aged with the cast, moving the series out of the safe waters of the eisenhower years into the age of camelot, all the way with jfk and then into the turbulent later half of the 1960s. that, along with the writers running out of ideas, and later, cast members like ron howard leaving the series, wisely quitting while they were ahead, left me wishing that they had all done the right thing by pulling the plug on this show and quitting while they were ahead. that, along with the idol worshiping studio audience who just couldn't control themselves every time the great fonzie entered the scene, began to wear very thin very fast.<br /><br />this show originally portrayed the fabulous fifties as we like to remember that era. time heals wounds, you know. everything has its place and though i would prefer hearing the "original hit versions" over those "new stereo recordings", those "new stereo recordings" worked very well on happy days. and this is where i find myself regretting my buying the dvd! unlike the complete first season dvd, the original music on the complete second season, has been replaced with different music. while it is great that the original episodes were digitally restored to digital perfection, the removal of the original music destroyed what it was that made this show so much fun to watch!
