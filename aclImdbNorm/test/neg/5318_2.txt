this was painful! recently given away as a free dvd with a british newspaper, this british-belgian co-production from 1977 (could've fooled me, it looks ten years older than that at least) is quite deservedly obscure and if you make it past the half-hour mark, consider yourself a trouper. the combining of animation and live action is ropey at best and downright dreadful at worst, which makes you wonder why it was decided to even attempt making the film in this manner when clearly the technology wasn't really there. harris is no more than a human prop and the animation is some of the most flat and lifeless i've seen, with the obligatory 'trippy' moments (especially where the animation of the brainiac-type subtracto character is involved) that rendered countless cartoon features from the late sixties onward instantly dated. the screenplay by don black provides a convincing argument for the usually resilient lyricist to stick to what he does best, and the pace is so slow that even the very young will be bored. as for adults, stick to jonathan swift's original novel.
