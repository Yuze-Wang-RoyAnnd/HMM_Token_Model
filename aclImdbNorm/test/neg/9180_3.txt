unlike most of the reviewers of this particular movie, i'm really not the much of a cynthia rothrock fan, to say the least. however when i saw that the movie had fred williamson and robert forster (both great actors), i just had to watch the film. williamson is a dakota smith, an alcoholic cop who is demoted to scrubbing toilets with a toothbrush and even worse having to team up with cynthia at the behest of the captain (robert forster). forster is always watchable, it's just a crying shame that the movie itself is so damn trite and clich'ed. it also features one of the least terrifying villains ever to be committed to celluloid. williamson would return to the dakota character in a few more films, the next one being "down n dirty" <br /><br />eye candy: nina richardson shows some t&a; mary kapper goes topless <br /><br />my grade: d <br /><br />where i saw it: showtime extreme
