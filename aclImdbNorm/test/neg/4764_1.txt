this movie is about a group of people who are infected by a powerful man-made virus. they are pursued by government men into the desert.<br /><br />the premise of the film is quite interesting but is hampered by the fact that the delivery is extremely boring. at no point does the film engage with the viewer on any level. granted, the miniscule budget is a problem but is not the reason for the film's failure. much more at fault is the very po-faced delivery. there is a great deal of narration but, unfortunately, the narrator has an annoyingly over-dramatic voice. very little seems to happen to these people and well before the end you will be rooting for the government men - the sooner they kill the protagonists the sooner the movie will end. a much better title for this film would have been four people run about in the desert with some stock footage of a helicopter. overall, very tedious.
