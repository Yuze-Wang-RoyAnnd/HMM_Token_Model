<br /><br />man, i just cant believe this movie. i have watched it entirely (believe me, i have done this !) and the best part was the traillers on the beginning (and i hate traillers!!!!).<br /><br />no plot, no acting, no nothing. i was watching the movie and thinking, "when this is going to start" ? it never started. how people can spend money and time to make such a crap ?<br /><br />the "plot": a dog gets bitten by a bat and get rabies - okay, until now no problem, nothing special but ok. now the rest of the movie will be - the dog will chase people!!! thats it, nothing else!!! now add to this some of the worse actings/actors i have ever seem, some completely irrealistic scenes (and some others really idiotic, like the child cant breath and the mother gives him a big and strong hug to see if he gets better), and a very lame ending, thats it, here you have crap... ops!.... cujo.<br /><br />do your self a favor and make something more worthy, like hiting your head against the wall or play chess with yourself.<br /><br />zero out of 10.<br /><br />gabriel.
