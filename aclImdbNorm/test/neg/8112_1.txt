the first word i can find to describe this movie is awful.<br /><br />this movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. first of all is the plot a very thin plot (wont comment further on this part) and a plot which a lot of movies from this genre is following. this makes the movie so bad, because you know whats going to happen. secondly does the movie contain a lot of questions which never is revealed. one of the questions (and this is no spoiler) is: what the hell are the kids doing in that corn!!!!!!!!!! thirdly is the characters very bad, not only because the movie is bad, but also because of the sorry actors. they are bad as they can be.<br /><br />the last thing that make this movie bad, is that its a horror movie. you are supposed to be scared of the killings or the sudden shocks, but you are not scared, you a not horrified because you know whats going to happen.<br /><br />conclusion: the movie is as bad as the movie about the killer ants! i hoped that it was a very great movie but because the story is bad, the actors are bad, the film raises a lot of questions and because its not scary, the movie is best unseen.
