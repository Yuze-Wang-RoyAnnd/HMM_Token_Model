occasionally i accidentally leave the television on after "south park" and i end up catching some of the train wreck of middle school humor that is "mind of mencia". it's the only time i wish my room was cleaner because i'd be able to find the remote that much faster. the truth is comedy central was in need of a replacement "chappelle's show", and what they got was a show that appeals to idiots that either miss dave so much they'll cling to any minority variety show, or are satisfied with the plain "mexicans love tacos" jokes that carlos mencia shovels in every week. i am to understand, though, that there are some people out there that actually find mencia *shudder* funny. i firmly stand by my words when i say i believe these people to exist only in myth. however, if you are indeed out there, i ask only that you never enter into my housing district, and read these major differences between carlos and "chappelle's show": <br /><br />1) dave was funny. you may want to highlight this one. <br /><br />2) "chappelle's show" was five times as edgy as mencia could ever hope to be. yet every time a promo for his little show airs, it's all about him, tooting his own horn about how he's nothing we've ever seen before. you've got that right, carlos. and not in a good way. chappelle didn't need to tell people he was edgy and funny. we all just kind of stuck around to watch the show to find out for ourselves.<br /><br />3) chappelle actually had race jokes that dove into some depth of the different cultures- things that some people didn't know about. like his "i know black people" game segment. the grand prize was some hair cream that black people use. that's deeper than mencia would ever dare to dive. so how dare he call himself edgy? if mencia were writing that sketch the grand prize would have been fried chicken and kool-aid. and my accusations have some merit. i saw a promo for his show (which i have affectionately come to call 'my t.v. monitor taking a s--t for thirty minutes') a few days ago and it was some stereotype olympics sketch, which i admitted to myself was a pretty funny concept. then i saw that the mexican that won received a green card as a grand prize. that's it?! that's as close to the fire as you wanna get? who couldn't think of that- back in 7th grade? for you fans of the show, if you're ever watching and you miss one of his punchlines- perhaps because you and your friends were discussing how "duh-de-durr" never gets old and is in no way the part of the joke where someone funny would have something clever to say- just remember that there are only five possible choices for punchlines anyway: green card, tacos, border jumpers, lawn mowers, and of course, duh-de-dur. just remember-whichever it was, it was screamed. enjoy!<br /><br />4) kind of relating to number two. every time he says something that gets a laugh, he'll pause to tell people (while laughing at his own joke) that he thinks he "went too far with that last one". then don't say it for god's sake. or let the people decide by themselves. he and comedy central keep shoving this tripe down my throat that he's this tell-it-like-it-is show that is more controversial than "the da vinci code". you're not. you never will be. <br /><br />i've never been offended by the show's content. i would never give it that much credit. i'm offended that carlos mencia is given thirty minutes to scream unnecessarily. yeah... i'm literally offended by that fact.
