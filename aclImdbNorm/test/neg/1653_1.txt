it says a lot about the united kingdom when television programmes like this not only get made but also run for three series. unfunny, politically correct to the point of sickening and poorly acted and written. meera syal has not been funny or accomplished in anything that she has been in, go on tell me i am wrong, and jasper carrott, funny guy as he is, is well past his eighties prime. this is such a bad comedy that it could have been made by itv but even stinkers like the upper hand and the one with james bolam as a car park attendant look like fawlty towers compared to this rubbish. i would love to sit down with the writer/director of this show so that they can point out the humour in this programme. admittedly the majority of the uk's population is made up of poorly educated chavs but this would not tickle their funny bones. that's if they could tear themselves away from big brother or from their mobile phones but that's another story. complete and utter dirt!
