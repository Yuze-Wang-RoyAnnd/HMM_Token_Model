this movie comes down like a square peg in a square hole. a poorly made peg. a peg so cheap it couldn't even be produced in a sweatshop assembly line in chinatown, mexico. in fact, when you try to press the peg into the hole for which it is obviously designed, it crumbles into sticky, disgusting pieces that smell like rotting fruit and won't wash off. quigly is such a peg.<br /><br />this movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created. a movie like this must have been the result of some accident of nature; some freakish entity that congealed in the corner of a dank office somewhere and festered and grew until it was too big and terrifying to look at. only science would be interested in such a thing; anyone not bent on studying it would exhume it from this world.<br /><br />what it comes down to is this: if you're the kind to enjoy first year violin recitals, racism, or coke zero, it might just be your birthday.
