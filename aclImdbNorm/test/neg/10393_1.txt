i'm not sure if this is a comedy or not, but i found it pretty comical. isobel is possessed by the devil. somehow a perverted priest and the gardener are gonna' fix that. part exorcism and part soap opera, you'll at least get some laughs. there's the paranoid jealous dad, satanic sister, valley of the dolls mother, and then the cowboy boyfriend; all there to help the skirt chasing priest fight the demons from dear isobel. it sometimes felt like a jerry springer episode, but i actually paid to see this. instead of the cool head-twisting, sailor cursing, and crucifix humping that regan did in the exorcist; you get a lot of isobel bouncing on her bed like it's a trampoline, hiding in her closet, and jumping from a hay-loft. yeah, it's chuck e. cheese gone wild. so, if you want to watch a quote unquote horror film that is worth a few laughs while you wait for the predictable ending ... this is your movie.
