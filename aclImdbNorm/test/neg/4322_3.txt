spoiler ahead! the mummy (lon chaney jr.) is on the loose in a new england college town searching for a college student (ramsey ames) who is the reincarnation of his beloved princess ananka. dull, slow (even at 65 minutes--it moves slower than the mummy!), indifferently acted, but the ending is worth waiting for. the mummy gets the girl (!!!!!) and she ages rapidly as the both slowly sink in a swamp. this is (i believe) the only time in a universal monster movie that the monster got the girl! that aside, this is stricly amateur night. probably the worst of the mummy sequels--and that's saying something!
