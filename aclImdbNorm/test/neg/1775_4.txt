my tolerance for shlocky direction was overwhelmed by some of the choices in this could-be-really-good time-waster.<br /><br />when the "romantic" intervals were of a nature to take me out of the story and into "how-and-why-did-the-movie-maker-do-/that/?" mode, you got to figure something is missing in there; restraint and tastefulness, i think.<br /><br />brian brown is a capable, empathetic actor - usually. i think he didn't like the project or the people, and it shows. i don't remember anything the other guy did. can't even picture his face.<br /><br />on the other hand, it doesn't have to be any good to be entertaining; some of the vignettes and twists are fun and even ingenious.<br /><br />i watched this movie ($2.00 purchase at the vid rental place) against the advice of the screenwriter; i understand he was tempted to remove his name from the credits. matter of pride, i bet.
