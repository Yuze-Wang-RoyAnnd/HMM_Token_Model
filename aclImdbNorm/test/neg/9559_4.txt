bugsy siegel was 31 when he went out to the west coast. in addition to his dreams about las vegas, he toyed with the idea of acting. he was a good looking guy and about 7 years younger than his pal george raft, so it wasn't such a crazy idea.<br /><br />warren beatty was 54 when he made this movie and despite the hair dye, he's too old for this part. beatty was miscast; bugsy should have been played by someone like alec baldwin. bugsy was a tough guy feared by his contemporaries; beatty just doesn't radiate menace.<br /><br />this was a vanity project for beatty, who hasn't come to terms with the fact that he's no longer a leading man.<br /><br />the other big annoying miscast is mantegna as george raft. raft had a distinctive voice and mannerisms, none of which mantegna even attempts to match. you never once believe that mantegna came from the streets.<br /><br />warren beatty and robert redford have both been pretending to be younger for years by massive use of hair dye, and now it;ll be a shock to suddenly go gray and play character parts.
