it's awful.<br /><br />pretty succinct review i know, but it has been a long time since a film has left me in such a bewildered state - wondering how the hell a film like that gets made.<br /><br />the last time it happened was last years turkey 'mission to mars'.<br /><br />salvatore coco is an ex-con - trying to better himself through self help videos, endless seminars and betterment courses. he lives by the catchphrases these courses expound.<br /><br />he stumbles across a washed up nightclub singer, played by nikki bennett, and has an epiphany; his new career is going to be that of a talent agent - with the singer as his one and only client.<br /><br />financed by his gospel singing, paraplegic girlfriend, played by sasha horler - he sets up shop and tries to relaunch nikki's career, with disastarous results.<br /><br />'walk the talk' is the reason why australians are so contemptuous of australian cinema. it is poorly constructed, lame and way wayyy too long (111 minutes for a comedy that should barely have scraped the 80 minute mark).<br /><br />every scene is too long, and are very repetitive. the audience is not given a character to empathise with; a vital ingredient in a film like this supposedly about an 'underdog' giving it a go.<br /><br />the downbeat and frankly poor ending comes at the end of 30 minutes of the most mind numbing dialogue and scenes that have you crying out for a power failure.<br /><br />this film is a failure on all levels - made worse for queensland audiences by its liberal and innacurate use of various gold coast/palm beach location; and its laughable use of brisbane suburb names like norman park and caboolture.
