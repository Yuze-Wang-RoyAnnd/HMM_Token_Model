!!!! mild spoilers !!!!<br /><br />with the exception of the terminator and total recall i don`t think arnie`s action/adventure movies are up to much . they`re better than his comedies for sure but that`s hardly saying much . the problem i have with his all action blockbusters is that they`re overblown and lacking in any sort of morality <br /><br />morality ? i mentioned in my review of terminator 2 the scene where good guy terminator blows the kneecaps off the swat team . are we to think that because the hero maims people doing their job instead of killing them we will admire him in someway ? this is the problem with eraser , when james cann`s character is revealed as a traitor within the us marshal department arnie`s character john kruger goes on the run with a witness he`s protecting but in several later sequences kruger kills a fairly large amount of marshals working with the villain . are we take it they were all traitors too ? surely many of them were honest men who were trying to stop kruger because the bad guy told them kruger was the traitor ? it`s a rather uneasy thought that kruger killed several people who were trying to genuinely up hold the law <br /><br />despite costing one hundred million dollars the special effects aren`t all that impressive . look at the scene where kruger lets go of the jet wing and scrambles to put on a parachute . it`s obvious as the action intercuts that it`s a stuntman who`s doing the free fall sequence while arnie is in a studio in front of a blue screen . eraser is also a film that has unnecessary cgi featuring killer alligators , not only unnecessary cgi but unconvincing cgi too . there`s also a few plot holes like in the opening scene involving a couple of witness protection people that the mob has caught up with . kruger opens a car trunk and pulls out a couple of bodies and starts a fire thereby throwing the mob of the scent . kruger is next seen rearranging the dental records via computer of the couple he`s saved . it would be logical to do this but would all the couples dental records be kept on computer ? most importantly of all are we to believe the us marshal department keep a freezer full of bodies for such events ?<br /><br />so they`re you go , a typical arnie thriller long on unlikely set pieces and short on intelligence and it`s interesting to note that eraser didn`t make much of a profit at the box office as the production costs almost outweighed a potential audience figure . after eraser arnie didn`t do much more business at the box office save for terminator 3 : rise of the machines which was an event movie and it`ll be interesting to see if he`ll be remembered as a politician rather than a movie star
