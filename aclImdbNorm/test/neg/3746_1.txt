i walked out of the cinema having suffered this film after 30 mins. i left two friends pinned in by a great fat bloke to endure the remainder.<br /><br />as soon as the opening sequence of the film unrolled, i sensed something was wrong and it wasn't long before i to stop myself from hiding under my seat cringing in embarrassment. i'm not one for walking out of films however bad as they usually have some redeeming feature, but this one suffered from a catalogue of bad directing, bad acting (bar 'bruno' character & the impeccable jean rochefort -according to my friends),awful editing (in terms of theme and meaning), terrible soundtrack and image correlation that seemed to make an art out placing the wrong peace of music over the image and scene at the wrong time . the worst crime was its overall insipidness and unbelievability (a result of the aforementioned atrocities). why was it so awful? i do not want to waste more of my time explaining. i'd say go and see it for yourself but i don't want to fill the coffers of this project any more than necessary. oh, the screening did possess one redeeming feature: my friend cambering over the rows of seats in silhouette with his umbrella hooked over his arm as he tried to steady himself -more pathos, tension & entertainment in those few moments than in the 125 mins of this sadly dire effort.
