i have recently gone to the movie theatres to see the new (2007) version of bridge to teribithia. after, i went to the library to rent the older version to see it again without paying again. i must say that i was extremely disappointed! i found the older version to have horrible acting as well as corny lines including jessie saying, "i know daddy, but i hurt so much inside" after leslie dies. it was quite horribly done and the casting was not much better in my opinion. i watched in amazement all the while saying no wonder they remade it. the story is great but trust me spend the money and see the new version, if you just see the old one you may never experience the true magic of teribithia.
