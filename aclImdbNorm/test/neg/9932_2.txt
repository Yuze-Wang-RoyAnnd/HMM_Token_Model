i caught this on hbo under its category of "guilty pleasures", and i would agree that i felt guilty (and pleasured) watching it. one, it's trash, and really raunchy trash. two, the plot is slow and predictable and once you learn "who did it", you think, "so what?". however, i must admit to being enough of a male chauvinist pig to want to sit through what is obviously a poor movie, if for no other reason than to see peta wilson get completely naked a number of times. do i feel dirty for having watched it? yes. am i sorry i watched it? no. so, there's the contradiction between being a lover of good movies and a lover of the female anatomy, even when in a poor movie. sigh!
