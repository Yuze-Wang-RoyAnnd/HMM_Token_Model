this has got to be the worse move i've ever seen!!!!! it was not only boring, it was "gag me with a spoon" dumb. where'd ya find the actors ... on a street corner? who did the special effects...maaco? for god's sakes i could have made a better movie with my cell phone. and if that wasn't bad enough, you even had extras at the end of the movie so we could see just how stupid the actors are in real life. who ever did the makeup for the aliens...must have spent $5 at your local used costume store and called it a day. and who in the world wrote up the movie description on the back of the dvd case should be shot. puhleez!! it's not even 1/8 % of what it is described as. that description is just to suck people in to buying, renting or paying a ticket to see it. no wonder there was never a trailer to it....ya would have drove them all away!!!!!!!<br /><br />bad actors...$5 <br /><br />special effects...$5.50 <br /><br />fake fire....$1.89 (cigarette lighter) <br /><br />time spent watching this movie....total waste! (i should sue ya for my time watching it)
