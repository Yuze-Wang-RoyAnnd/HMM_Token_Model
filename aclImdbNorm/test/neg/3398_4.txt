the incomparable paul naschy, horror film icon of spain, lends his talents to this entertaining if not scattershot film. what begins as an action flick ends up a horror story. all i can say is just sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />paul naschy plays a cold-hearted hit-man hired by some shady japanese diamond hunters (one of which is his flame who is carrying his child) to swipe a cache of diamonds from a belgian businessman. when the deed is done, the allure of the diamonds is too tempting for paul to dismiss so he kills his japanese cohorts. his girlfriend, whose brother paul killed, vows revenge and chases paul through the forest, shooting him up and leaving him for dead. however, paul is found by an egghead with two horny daughters and brought to his estate to recuperate.<br /><br />at the estate, the two daughters, silvia aguilar and azucena hernandez, fight for paul in his weakened state, with the busty silvia aguilar determined not to lose out to the sweet and prim azucena. but things get hairy for mr. naschy who begins to see the ghost of the daughter's long dead mother on the estate grounds. couple this with the japanese lass looking to finish the job of killing paul and he gets pulled from two sides.<br /><br />story: $$ (the story goes a number of ways and doesn't fully satisfy. the script builds up a fight for paul between the daughters but silvia, whose character seems assertive and volatile, simply lets azucena win in the paul naschy sweepstakes without putting up a fight. personally, i would have preferred the ghostly apparition story to the revenge seeking of the japanese woman)<br /><br />violence: $$$ (you get gunplay, a blown-up babe and pigs eating some poor schmuck alive. gore hounds will not be letdown with this naschy flick).<br /><br />acting: $$$ (paul naschy, as always, is fun to watch but he does spend a bit too much time in bed recovering from his wounds. starring with him again are the luscious silvia aguilar and the beautiful azucena hernandez, who teamed with mr. naschy in the little gem "the craving." both girls do a fine job).<br /><br />nudity: $$$ (you get very brief glimpses of both aguilar and hernandez but they are strategically placed, keeping the naught bits covered. full nudity is supplied by the two lesser appealing actresses: the japanese woman chasing paul and the african maid that works for silvia and azucena).
