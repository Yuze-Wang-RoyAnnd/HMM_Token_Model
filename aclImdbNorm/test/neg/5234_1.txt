** may contain spoilers ** horrible. just horrible. i loved stephen king's novel, and this is just a horrible adaptation of it. they change the ending. they change the plot. they changed alan pangborne's character from a grieving husband to a happy fianc'e. if you are a fan of stephen king's novel, stay away. even if you are not, stay away.<br /><br />the book was awesomely dark, even for steve king. an 11 year old kills himself in the novel. a middle school principal is found with child pornography in the novel. this is nowhere near as good as the novel.<br /><br />this movie is my least favorite film of all time. i hate this film with a vengeance.
