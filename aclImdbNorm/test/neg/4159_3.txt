i thought this film was a poor effort by the british film council - fell flat as hey, come on, tim robbins is an old guy and here is this beautiful young woman who falls straight for him as well. like lost in translation its really hard to suspend disbelief in this context. it's a good looking film but lacks punch. when tim robbins is pretending to be psychic it looks like he has a small migraine. he looks uncomfortable and life less. the part where he is screening suspect employees at sphinx is laughable. if an investigator came to my factory the last thing i would do is tell him about my freckle fetish. it's obviously over-intellectual. clumsy. the city is as it is, a convenient backdrop. they obviously picked the most futuristic city they could (shanghai) as a backdrop but the city never really comes out and effects the characters as in for example blade runner, where the characters of the city often intersect the story. slow as a wet week. no chemistry, real dramatic high points, so so plot.
