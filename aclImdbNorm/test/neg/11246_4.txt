...this one just isn't worth the cost of a movie ticket. what these filmmakers have done cannot properly be called filmmaking; rather, they just chose sixteen students of some diversity (though not quite as much diversity as the reviews have suggested) and set them loose. the results are, to be brutally frank, far more often boring, self-indulgent, overwrought and off-puttingly grainy than truly insightful.<br /><br />there are, of course, moments of recognition and identification of the sort only possible in documentary film, but overall there's not much more truth here than in "bully" or, for that matter, a decent tv documentary of the same sort. though full of talk about sex and sexual diversity and racism, the film brings nothing to the table that will be of use to anyone who has thought about any of these issues with any seriousness. and while certain segments serve absolutely no purpose other than to inject a bit of (admittedly welcome) comic relief, most often the five-minute limit keeps up from becoming emotionally involved with any of the students. an interesting idea, but thumbs down for chain camera.
