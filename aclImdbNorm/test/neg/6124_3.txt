the dominating conflict is between a couple of fine actors (huppert and dutronc) and the horrible script. evidently, the actors lost, since the director/screenwriter claude chabrol eventually forced the leading couple to follow this worthless piece of sick imagination to the letter. fortunately, the powerful performances by huppert and dutronc dramatically improve the overall quality of the movie, which miraculously gains the depth and humor. as for chabrol's persistence in keeping the film bland and illogical, it reaches the climax in the final scene, which is so incredibly poor that you will wonder which pills he was taking himself while directing it.
