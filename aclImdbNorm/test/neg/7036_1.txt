one of the worst films i have ever seen, but extremely funny (not on purpose though). every scene that contains anything to do with; aircraft, romance, script or acting is badly messed up.<br /><br />i recommend this film for all pilots, it's so bad that you should burst into laughter at some point in the film (also see airport 79:the concorde, for the same reason).<br /><br />anyone else, avoid this film like the plague (except for fans of b-movies, of course)<br /><br />enjoy
