bare wench is another softcore parody of the blair witch project (i think there's about two dozen of those things out there). it has 5 very attractive women (which includes nikki fritz, julie smith, and julie strain), and one dorky guy whose only purpose is to provide comic relief.<br /><br />okay, so i'm thinking "cool. great looking women, having softcore lesbian sex with each other very 10 minutes or so. this should be real good."<br /><br />unfortunately, the producers blew it. there is nothing in this video that actually qualifies as a sex scene. there's a couple of false starts, but the majority of the action is just the women posing for the camera. i guess once the producers had spent their money on the women, and spent more getting them to remove their clothes, they didn't have any money left to get them to actually do anything. and i guess they also used up all their alloted nudity time too early, because towards the end of the video, there is a huge amount of pointless dialogue that is obviously being used for no other reason than to pad out the run time. "you're a liar! no you are! you go into the cave! no you go! i think we should go home! well, i don't!" this goes on and on and on forever.<br /><br />there's way better stuff than this.
