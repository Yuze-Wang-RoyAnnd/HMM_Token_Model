the only reason i rated this film as 2 is because channing tatumis beautiful however the whole film lacks emotion and was boring to watch. usually i adore a good romance but this was just a waste of time, i didn't shed a tear despite it containing sad content it just wasn't acted very well at all. i'm no film critic but i just advise girls to avoid this really unless the only reason you're watching it is to see channing tatum lol the rest of the film is rubbish and if he wasn't in it (not that his acting was any good) i would have stopped watching much quicker. it's a shame really because if the right actors were chosen for this film it could have had the potential to be a real tear jerker. .. if you're looking for a good cry or a film for a girly night in...give this one a miss!!
