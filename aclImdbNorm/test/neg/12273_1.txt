it looked cool from the movie sleeve, but after five minutes we weren't sure if it was a homosexual documentary of west side story without any female interest. the film quality was poor, and there was hardly enough gang fighting action to sustain even the drunkest person's interest for long enough to watch the entire film. may god have mercy on the souls of both the actors and the filmmakers responsible for what i can only describe as my new one and only reason why i never will want to see (or trust) an australian made film again. i have to write more so i will again say that the actors were so bad that i'm positive i could make a better movie with fifteen dollars and a box of trojans. please don't see this movie for your own sake.
