this was a letdown in many ways. the location filming in ireland, though quite beautiful at times, cannot save this uninspired flick. greg evigan and alexandra paul, as the married couple trying to get their marriage back on track and who inherit a haunted mansion, just aren't interesting characters. paul, towards the end of the film, becomes incredibly annoying and one wishes she would just close her mouth and shut up, as it seems she is screaming as if it has just become an olympic event! other problems with this film are odd segments that have nothing to do with the core of the film, such as the opening sequence with two cleaning women and the woman in a bed with a severed hand climbing over her writhing, naked body. although the woman is quite adequate doing this it does nothing storywise. one is left thinking the production team needed to pad out a short running time and just tossed in some padding and a bit of t and a. the cgi effects are cartoonish as well and the fiery finale rivals co-executive producer roger corman's much earlier and far superior film the fall of the house of usher in all its ineffective cheapness. any attempt at true tension and suspense, and as a result chills, are thrown out the window in this low budget bust. if you like images of ireland you might find something here but you would do better renting or buying a travelogue. skip this unless you are undiscriminating and think plot is secondary. rent another low budget ghost story(if you can find it) titled the woman in black and see how good and scary a movie can be. this was a wasted opportunity.
