in a not totally successful attempt to be taken seriously, and move into 'adult' films, mr. hughes gives us this film about a young married couple. true, it's got every cliche in the book in it, silly fantasy stuff and all that, but more importantly- it's got elizabeth mcgovern.<br /><br />clearly the best actress to have ever appeared in a john hughes film, she lends a weight to it that elevates the sometimes silly material. kevin bacon (and his hair) is pretty good as her husband, but mcgovern steals the movie with her quiet true moments of honesty. the 'teen film' fun that worked so well in other hughes films falls flat here- like a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh when you were 9, but keeps telling them when you are 15 and you wish he'd find some new material. but i keep going back to mcgoverns performance, because it's truly moving. mr. hughes most interesting films to me have real actors in them (some kind of wonderful, breakfast club) and when his material bumps up against a true talent, some wonderful things can happen. if only he'd trust that it doesn't have to be tarted up with the silly fantasy stuff.
