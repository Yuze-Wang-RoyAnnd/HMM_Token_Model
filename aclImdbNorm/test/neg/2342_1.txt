to me this film is just a very very lame teen party movie with all the normal clich'es and boring stereotyped characters (nerds, jocks, popular girls, sleezy guys, etc) but with an underlying anti drug/drinking theme. <br /><br />if you ever have the unfortunate chance of seeing this film, keep an eye out for all the references to responsibility and keeping it real (dunno how else to word it) i guess the only thing that'd make this film cool, would be if they tv playing it was on fire. that, or dvd it was on exploded...<br /><br />1 out of 10000 - watch animal house instead.
