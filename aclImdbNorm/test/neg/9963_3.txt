i'm working my way through the horror classics 50 movie pack collection and the mad monster is one of the movies in the set.<br /><br />i am sure that george zucco was a good actor; but, this was only the second film in which i saw him, the first being dead men walk, in which he played two parts. however, even good acting couldn't save the mad monster.<br /><br />zucco plays a mad scientist, dr. cameron (who was banned from academia because of his unethical and inhumane experiments). he believes that he can control evolution by bringing out the characteristics of one animal into another.<br /><br />in this case, like so many others of its ilk, it is a transfusion of (i assume) wolf's blood into humans. his goal is to create an invincible army, which he can control through the antidote. the subject of his experiments is his hired hand, a retarded gardener, whose dialogue slows down this snail-paced classic to almost a full-stop. <br /><br />beyond his experiments, dr. cameron also plots revenge on those who discredited him, using his transformed gardener. however, he loses control of his subject, who begins to transform without the transfusion -- yikes! <br /><br />the werewolf transformations are classic hollywood stop-action / makeup effects. no doubt these were groundbreaking techniques of the time; but, in today's digital age it's hard to imagine audiences being scared by this.
