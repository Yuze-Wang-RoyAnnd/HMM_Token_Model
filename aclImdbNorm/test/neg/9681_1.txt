this film is a completely inaccurate depiction of the real story of noah's ark. the producers probably did not even read the bible. this is the worst movie i have ever seen! noah's wife was never mentioned by name in the bible, but the writers of the film "gave" her the name naamah. this movie depicts the destruction of sodom a good 1000 years before it happened, and what about gamorrah? it too was destroyed at the same time sodom was. (maybe the producers thought that not including gamorrah in the story and showing the city of "sodom" as in you-know-what would raise more eyebrows.) this film is utter filth and mocks god and the bible. it is a wonder that any true christian would want to participate in the production of this abysmal, hideous, reprobated mockery of the bible.
