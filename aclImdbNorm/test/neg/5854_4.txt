astroesque (2 outta 5 stars)<br /><br />i have no idea what the title is supposed... even less of an idea of what is supposed to be going on in this movie half the time... yet, it still kept me sort of interested. this is low, low budget film-making along the lines of "el mariachi", filmed in 16mm... and, for what it's worth, the shots are very well-composed and visually stylish. directed, written by and starring comic book writer/artist michael allred... i guess it's no surprise that the film looks good. unfortunately, some of the acting is beyond bad... and the rest is competent at best. allred himself comes off the best... but only because he doesn't actually speak much. he just strides around looking cool most of the time... or running from crazed rednecks who are trying to kill him. the sound is also pretty bad... almost as if it was unfinished in places... maybe they couldn't afford to pay for the music they'd planned to use? strange, vaguely science-fictiony plot... similar in tone to "the man who fell to earth"... but most of the film boils down to a standard run-from-the-bad-guys and kill-them-before-they-kill-you plot. ultimately too oblique to be successful but not without interest for adventurous movie watchers.
