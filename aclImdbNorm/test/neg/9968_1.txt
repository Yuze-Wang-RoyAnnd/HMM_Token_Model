the only thing of interest about this movie is its subject matter. taking a look at the manson "family" from the point of view of the family members themselves is a great idea. however, trying to make sense of the uncomprehensible is something that can really only be accomplished in a masterwork -- and this ain't it.<br /><br />presumably because there was so much information to squeeze into a screenplay, this film was done in a faux documentary style, with reenactments thrown in. trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.<br /><br />worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings. it's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.<br /><br />all in all, this movie is one big wasted opportunity. the one ray of sunshine is the acting of marc pitman, who plays tex, who in real life did most of the actual killing. whereas the female characters come off as giggly airheads in the 60s flashbacks, pitman manages to convey real feeling.<br /><br />in short, don't bother with this movie.
