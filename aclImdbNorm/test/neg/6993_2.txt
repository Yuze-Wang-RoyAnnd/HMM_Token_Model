so pathetic its not even funny. from the first scene in the movie i knew i was in for a bad time. thank goodness i only saw this movie on tv. the story line was terrible, not to mention the acting. it was horrid. very unreal and unusual things happened in this move such as. the lady sticks a whip under the door and whips the guy a little and he just hands over the keys. i'm like, get real. the creators lousy attempt to make a futuristic city even deepened my dislike for the film. to tell you the truth the only good thing in this movie at all was the fighting, which was in itself pretty lame. all i could ask myself when watching this movie was "when is it gonna go off!"
