i really enjoyed the first film and when it turned up again, without thinking, or checking, i took a family of friends to see it. i was ashamed that i had enthused so much about it to them.<br /><br />disney processed the original film just like the human body processes a delicious meal - takes in something good and turns out ... well, you know. and by having a dark-skinned person as the fbi man, the results of fingerprinting the informant were subdued.<br /><br />taken as an isolated film, i suppose it is not too bad if one likes that weird sort of thing, but when one has read the book or seen the first film - horrible!
