what a terrible sequel. the reason i give this film two stars instead of zero because it's a movie that has violence and gore and critters, yet it is planned out poorly. and this god-awful sequel was done by none other than bum-bum-bum-bum!!!!!!!!! mick garris! the bonehead that brought you the remake of the shining which nearly got kubrick to nearly roll in his grave when he discovered it was actually made. garris is also the man that brought you the sad sequel of the fly, the fly, which was a wonderful movie, but garris's movie nearly ruined john getz career. anyway, if you really want to see the crappy critters trilogy in order, don't. that's the mistake i made, rent the first one or the third one or better yet don't stoop to that level at all! this movie sucked so bad that i can't believe it, please avoid this crap. shame on you, mick!
