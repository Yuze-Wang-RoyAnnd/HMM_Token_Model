there are certain scenes in this film (like the hero's first meeting with super-villainess shirley eaton) where it seems to be on the edge of breaking sexual taboos and doing its premise (females want to rule the world by making men slaves) justice, but it never dares to. the result is a film with no sexuality and some tame violence. despite the choppy plot, the film is not overly bad until its climax, where its amateurishness runs rampant (terrible editing, overuse of stock footage). worth seeing only as a curio.
