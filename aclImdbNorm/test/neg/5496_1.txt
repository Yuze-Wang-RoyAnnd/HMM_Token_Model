r.i.c.c.o. is the stupidest film ever made. i can't believe my father bought this crap. this film should da never got made. if this film was wide known, trust me it will be on the #1 spot for imdb's worst.the acting is horrible it's scary,which it is why it's horror. this piece of s*** had no horror in at at all. it's an urban action,which is funny, because i could of swore it was a comedy. when people got shot i couldn't help but laugh. i am the only person who reviewed this and i hope that i am the last. with this vote only i hope it make it to the #1 spot at the worst!!!!!!!
