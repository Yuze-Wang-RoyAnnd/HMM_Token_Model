while it's true that the movie is somewhat interesting, the execution leaves a lot to be desired (much like blood orgy of the leather girls, i spit on your grave, and born in flames, all superior). i don't think it's not porn, but porn is in the eye of the beholder: if it functions as porn for somebody, who am i to say that he/she is wrong? i was rather puzzled by the statement in winkimation's generally thoughtful review ("such a shame") that "for once we actually see men's faces when they come." a few years ago i did occasional freelance reviews for an adult mag and i recall seeing plenty of men's faces when they came. i think this is probably more common when the film features on of the few male porn "stars" (and especially when that male is the director). though i unsurprisingly can't refer to any specific titles, i know that there are some instances in ron jeremy's, uh, work. i also don't know that i'd agree that a man is necessarily showing vulnerability in his face when coming.
