"season on the brink" is one of my favorite books of all time - an insightful unflinching look at bob knight and his indiana hoosiers. and dennehy is one of my favorite supporting actors of all time. so i made a point of watching this adaptation.<br /><br />it disappointed on every level. dennehy's performance was less than inspired, and he seemed unprepared to play knight - like he had accepted the role just prior to filming. the rest of the cast isn't much better.<br /><br />and it was obvious that this was espn's first movie. it was poorly directed, poorly filmed, and the lack of budget was obvious anytime games were being simulated (smaller gyms, empty seats, etc.) skip this adaptation and read the book - it holds up well to this day!
