first of all, i'd like to say i am a teenager so this is all marketed towards me, and i can safely say that icarly very poor programing, and the fact that it's accepted among both genders baffles me. it contains some of the worst attempts at comedy i've ever witnessed with mediocre acting to boot. the supposed humor within the show is all based on saying someone's lines again with poor sarcasm, poor sarcasm, saying bad one-liners, and, well, you get the picture. also, i should mention that i do still watch spongebob, which i know i'll get a negative backlash for, but that's quality programming with some honestly funny moments in it, less we forget something icarly's missing; wit. the show's about a young girl, carly, putting on a web-show with her friends, which i can say is without a doubt a nicer version of the internet. that's fine, but the show's just...well, not funny at all, as previously stated. if this is what children's programming has come to today, parents, show them something that's actually funny; spongebob or rocco's modern life would work.<br /><br />also, compared to it's brothering show, drake & josh, it's terrible, which was implied. seriously, please watch something worthwhile. even for a children's show it's poor.
