ok, this movie, was the worst display i have seen in years. the actors weren't to bad (i figured it was a b-movie so they were doing b-movie acting). anyways, i watched this movie, thinking, oh cool a ufo sci-fi movie. wrong. it was just an excuse for radical christians to push a message onto people. the last scene was extremely messed up. that is a horrible thing to do to a person to make them believe in something. what someone believe in is a matter of opinion. this movie just shows how corrupted religion is, especially christianity.<br /><br />if you want to watch a b-movie, this ain't. if you want to watch a movie that is trying to brainwash the masses. well this is the pick of the litter. go right for it. if you are going to convey a message, do it, don't force it. ridiculous, that people would abuse the media to such a degree. especially, christians.
