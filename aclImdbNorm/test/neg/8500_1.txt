i didn't understand the people who rated it over 5. i think it's a horrible film from any point of view. plots, acting, art, dialog, music, whatsoever! i don't mind a low budget..however you have to get some point. wandering, wondering..pointless..then two boys started kissing in bed. awful,,just awful. i love indie films, don't mind it is slow. however this movie disappointed me from any perspectives. even the graffito, not artistic.<br /><br />i was wondering what kind of people would like it. i am a female in my 30's. is it for teens who have some kind of the loneliness about life, or i just don't get it? what i gained then? wasting time! please go for some others.
