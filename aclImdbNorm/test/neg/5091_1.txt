for weeks i had been looking forward to seeing this movie only to find myself hugely disappointed after wards. in my opinion, the only good thing 'river queen' had going for it was the amazing scenery used as backgrounds. the story line was all over the place, samantha's character sarah was very difficult to understand and what on earth were all the many close ups of her face for? it brought absolutely nothing to the story-if there was one at all!a better actor for the part of boy could also have been selected, to me it sounded like he read his lines straight of the script while shooting his scenes.overall, a real shame as it could have been such a good movie.
