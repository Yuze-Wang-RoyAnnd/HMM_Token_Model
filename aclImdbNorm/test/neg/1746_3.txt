let's see. this movie is many things to different people. to finns, as shown by the comments, it can be ok or dreadful or boring. to other folks, it can be something different. first off: if you do not speak finnish (i do), you will understand half of what is going on, as subtitles are dreadful and even the title is translated incorrectly ("paha maa" would probably be idiomatically translated as badlands in uk english).<br /><br />why did i not like it? because it is a tarantino-style movie: it simply takes a very harsh reality and throws it back at you, as brutally as possible. i, however, am not american, and thus i am not particularly fond of this proceeding, because all it does is show that the director has really nothing new to say. technical prowess (camera work is brilliant), script (not that unoriginal) do not rescue this movie from the bottom where it belongs. should you wish to see a finnish movie, then go for any of the kaurism"aki brothers' movie, who match talent and directorial skill, with very good actresses and actors. <br /><br />this director ought to review his intention and priorities: none was intelligible, and thus this film failed. by not watching it you won't miss much.
