the frustrating thing about a movie like this, with a true potential for greatness, is that it almost enjoys being heavy-handed. we speak of allegory, of metaphor...but the truth is, there's no getting around the fact that there is absolutely no plot or real character.<br /><br />at a certain point, we most know who the people are...even if we never understand where they are going. the sheer pretentiousness wore me down every time i tried to grasp a truth in this film.<br /><br />call it beautiful, great and awesome...i just call it "cheating." all style and no substance. sure, it's a matter of taste...but i would never take a confusing modernist pastiche of symbols and splashes over the spiritual clarity of jean cocteau or renoir. but if it works for you, i'm all for it. art is a personal thing, i guess.
