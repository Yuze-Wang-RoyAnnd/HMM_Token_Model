i got this movie for fifty cents at a going out of business sale. i want my fifty cents back. bad acting, poor script writing, lousy direction, historically inaccurate, even the sound of the film is awful. it's not the subject matter that offends. i'm one of the many who find suspense films and true crime films very interesting. the subject matter could have been treated more seriously, with much more attention to detail and accuracy, and the lack of respect shown for the victims and their devastated friends and family is enough to puzzle anyone. also, there is little to no attention paid to what could have caused someone to begin the bizarre behavior that ed gein was displaying in acting out these horrible crimes. <br /><br />save your time and sanity. don't watch this awful film. if you bought it, you have my sympathy. it's not a total waste though...you can throw away the disc and make use of the plastic case!
