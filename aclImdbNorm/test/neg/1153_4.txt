if good intentions were enough to produce a good film, i would have rated the turgid, ponderous, obvious "focus" a bit higher than 4. macy does his best, but as an earlier poster commented, miller's little parable asks us to suspend disbelief too often. perhaps the novel gives us a bit more background on newman, so we can understand how someone who is obviously not without intelligence could be so dense in perceiving the attitudes of those around him. i agree with another reviewer that if one is unaware of how bigoted average citizens were in america during this time period, then this movie might be an eye-opener. i grew up in the fifties, and the "good" pastors of my lutheran church found nothing wrong with having the church picnic at a commercial beach, whose sign prominently indicated that no jews or blacks would be admitted. it is difficult for young people today to understand that this was the norm, and not just in the south. as late as 1964, when i graduated from a somewhat racially integrated (but sexually segregated) public high school in baltimore, my black classmates could not attend the traditional "father and son banquet," as it was held at a facility which did not admit blacks. sadly, it was an establishment owned by a jewish family. the subject matter of "focus" is important, and we should never forget, despite the lingering signs of racism in modern america, how truly repulsive the attitudes of that previous generation were.(the "greatest generation," indeed). so, perhaps this film is somewhat valuable in countering the recent wave of sentimental crap about the forties from the likes of steven spielberg and tom brokow. but in the end, as in "far from heaven," the filmmakers' good intentions are undermined by having a protagonist so ridiculously oblivious to the social conventions of their time.
