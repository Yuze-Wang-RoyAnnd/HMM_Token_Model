almost a masterclass in how not to direct a movie. from the misjudged, often incomprehensible script onwards dr rey builds on a series of poor decisions that make the film an excruciating viewing experience. sadly the film never rises beyond a kind of old fashioned, almost misogynistic gay camp in which women are over-wrought, ott and middle aged and the men are young, vacuous and forever on the hunt for sex. the director was unable to pitch either the tone of the film or the level of the performances.<br /><br />there is certainly a great deal of 'acting' going on. dianne wiest slips into a pale impersonation of her bullets over broadway performance and poor old jane birkin flounders in her attempt to give a comic performance. though you have to pity her as there is very little real comedy here. the whole thing feels like a very low rent version of merchant ivory's le divorce which, to be quite honest, wasn't very good, either.
