simply i just watched this movie just because of sarah & am also giving these 4 stars just because of her,on the other side this movie was easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen. theacting was horrible. the script was uninspired. this was a movie that kept contradicting itself. the film was sloppy and unoriginal. its not like i was expecting a good film. just something to give me a jump or two. this did not even do that.<br /><br />he worst thing is that, the more i think about the overall plot, the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we keep finding. a real shame really, as i'm fairly sure that there was a good idea lurking in there somewhere...<br /><br />i'm perhaps being a bit harsh giving the film a 4/10 but given the actors involved and again sara obvious writing talent, this film really should have delivered far more.<br /><br />this movie is just crap, i cant put it differently. since the very beginning one knows is going to be crap.<br /><br />the story, dialogue, acting, special effects, make-up, pretty much everything sucks. i like vampire movies and i know they will never be oscar winning movies but this one is not even worth seeing, i can't believe how somebody produced this thing.<br /><br />it's not even about vampires, it's more about a dream/reality experience. the development of the movie is incoherent, the motivation of the characters is... doesn't exist, everything seems like a big joke. maybe that's what they tried to do, but i sincerely doubt it. i wish i knew what they tried to pull but it just backfired, it's definitely one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life (and i've seen many bad movies, but nothing compared to this) please, make yourselves a favor and do not watch this.<br /><br />p.s. it's also full of clich'es! p.s. 2 bad script, bad directing, bad cinematography. p.s. 3 i bothered commenting on this as a favor to everyone.
