first, let me make it clear that i'm a big fan of bad sci-fi, especially when it involves gigantic, city-stomping monsters. but this one is so fantastically lame that i can't even like it for being bad. they apparently didn't shave enough money off the budget by skimping on the props (the only prop we have to indicate the size of the alien girl is an oversized novelty pencil, available at spencer's gifts for about fifteen bucks), they also decided not to outlay for concept or plot. the monster does look okay, in my opinion, but it doesn't have enough interaction with the backgrounds, i.e. not enough destruction to suit most fans of the genre. the general rule of giant monster movies is: if you don't have a lot of fake-looking buildings to smash, then you'd better have another fake-looking monster to wrestle with. this movie has neither. i can't make my final complaint about the movie without giving away the ending, but suffice to say the origin of the monster, and the method found to get rid of it, just don't hold water. not even as well as most of these movies. skip it.
