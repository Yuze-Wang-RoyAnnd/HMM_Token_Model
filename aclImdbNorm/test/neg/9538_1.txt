ok - say some college in southern california has an movie making class. and some dudes were enrolled just to film girls, and they gave them a camera. and then they were drunk/stoned/ or just to plain stupid to actually use a camera, and they turned this in for their grade. and failed.<br /><br />that is my only explanation for this, this, thing. good god they left the date and time counter on during some of it. the picture started in new scene way before the sound, and forget about a plot. well apparently there was one and they had to tell you all about it once the 3 hour introduction sequence was finished. but i am glad they did because i never would have gotten it by watching this.<br /><br />stay away from this.
