bloody awful! there's just no other way to put it. in fact, it's **so** bad that the only reason i'm wasting words on this is to warn off other reasonable viewers who want to be intelligently entertained. you'll lose i.q. points watching this. come to think of it, it's not even suitable for mindless viewing because of the irritation factor. there's no guilty pleasure in watching something this incompetent.<br /><br />reasons to avoid it:<br /><br />1) horribly scientifically inaccurate, to the point where this isn't sci-fi anymore, it's just mindnumbingly sloppy, lazy fantasy.<br /><br />2) it sports fx that are cheesy beyond belief. not even cheesy-kitsch that's a wink and a nod, like vintage doctor who, but just cheap and shoddy to the point of being insulting. the fx are so bad they're not even laughable. they spent about a dollar-fifty on this, not more.<br /><br />3) the direction is so weak and mindless that the only way the actors could make it through to the end of shooting without becoming terminally depressed was to sleepwalk through their roles, although catherine mccormack made some effort anyway, probably on principle and despite the director. moreover, this isn't peter hyams's only bad film: his flubs vastly outnumber any barely salvageable ones, of which timecop was the last such, and that was 15 years before this writing. he's had nothing halfway decent since (end of days was just as slapdash, arnold was the only draw, and he needed much firmer direction than hyams provided). hyams just keeps making it more and more pointless for anyone to consider giving him more work.<br /><br />and finally,<br /><br />4) ray bradbury's stories deserve far better treatment than this. refusing to watch this film sends that message, not that hollywood is particularly listening.<br /><br />watch at your own risk. if you do and it turns you off movies altogether, you've only yourself (and hyams) to blame because you've been more than adequately warned.
