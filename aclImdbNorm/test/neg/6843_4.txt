the most fertile man in ireland revolves around eamon manley who is 24 year old and still happens to be a virgin. he lives with his mother in belfast. he is also a very shy guy towards women. everything has changes for eamon when he is seduced by a woman(as far as i can remember a neighbour). it is not because he looses his virginity but he discovers that he has a super power. despite having protection, this neighbour becomes pregnant. he is told by the doctor that he has very high sperm count. his mother brilliantly comes up with an idea which makes us see ginger headed babies all around in the end of the film. he starts helping out women in both side of belfast to conceive babies. first voluntarily then with the help of his colleague runs a business out of it. the most fertile man in ireland has its funny moments but needed to come up with better jokes and with a better script. i couldn't help thinking that it gave me the impression of a tv sitcom rather than a movie. kris marshall is a different name on the silver screen but does not shine as star. it's more like the guy you saw in such and such movie. like him being in love actually(i think he was very funny in that one)..well, it was okay to watch but couldn't help dozing off from time to time. ** out of *****
