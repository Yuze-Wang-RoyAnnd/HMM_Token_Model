a little while ago, i stumbled upon this dvd while browsing netflix, and with such an impressive cast, decided to give it a go.<br /><br />never before have i seen a movie try to be a new version of an existing great movie (scarface) and failing so spectacularly.<br /><br />the main issue seems to be a complete misunderstanding of what the story should be. in scarface, tony montana was the self-proclaimed "bad guy." his spectacular rise and eventual downfall wasn't sad, it was a great (and the only logical ending) to someone who lived such a life.<br /><br />damian chapa, as director, writer, and lead actor, sees kilo as some sort of hero, or at least a complicated guy. however he doesn't want to do the grunt work of creating a realistic, sympathetic character. he was raised by a white mother, except for the six months of his childhood where his father, a gangster himself, showed him his life. for reasons never fully explained or even really mentioned, he decides he wants to be a drug dealer, and actually drives to the bad part of town, approaches two dealers and says, "hey, i'd like to buy some drugs." he drops his father's name, and in apparently no time they are not only rich, the two guys who are supplying him are acting subserviently to him for reasons, again, never explained.<br /><br />chapa wants you to feel bad when his character is sentenced to prison when a police informant lies about him. however, since he's dealt large quantities of drugs before, why should one feel sympathy for him going to jail for it this time? the most obvious case of chapa wanting to be the good guy is in his prison execution of a white supremacist/rapist played by gary busey. in scarface, tony montana kills someone in prison because he pretty much has to in order to elevate himself, it's done, he moves on. but in this case they ham-handedly have to make busey not only a rapist/pedophile but also a white supremacist. a little overkill, don't you think? i won't go into detail in this regard too much more, but their desperate message of "please like me! i'm a complicated gangster!" fails on every level. try as they might, i didn't feel bad, conflicted, or sympathetic when his buddies are killed (following a shootout), his wife is also killed (shortly after she called him out on being a lousy father, and during an attempted escape when he decided it'd be ok to ride right next to a car filled with gunmen while his wife is in the car), and his eventual demise.<br /><br />suffice it to say his acting can be fairly summed up as lousy, his only achievement bringing the term "wooden" to starry new heights. busey should be credited for actually putting effort into his ridiculous role. tiny lister did well. stacy keach is playing his warden from prison break role. robert wagner is coasting for a paycheck. faye dunaway, while a touch dramatic, still turns in a performance better than this movie deserved. brad dourif is in the film for about two minutes and does what he can. and to give the film credit, it does one-up scarface in one way - jennifer tilly now holds the title of "most ridiculous attempt at a hispanic accent." (sorry robert loggia.) in short, this movie had an interesting premise, but a poor story arc, unsympathetic characters, and hit-or-miss performances. i'd advise mr. chapa to ease up on the forced sympathy next time - really, we don't need to like your character, we just need to be interested. better luck next time.
