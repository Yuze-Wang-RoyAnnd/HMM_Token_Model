i loved this movie 10 years ago when i was about 16 years old. my biggest mistake was to watch it again, 10 years later. it's not the worst "i-wanna-be-a-pilot" movies ever, but it has so many flaws in it that you can hardly overlook them.<br /><br />queen's "one vision" (along with the rest of the soundtrack) makes this film better than the average patriotic nonsense you usually get to see ;)<br /><br />[****------]
