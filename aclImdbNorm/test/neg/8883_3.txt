perhaps i missed something, but i found goya's ghosts to be a tedious costume melodrama. as to the story it was trying to tell, i found that a confusing mish-mash that went off in all directions. and perhaps it should have been made by a spanish director with the appropriate languages subtitled rather than in unconvincingly accented english. i can't judge the historical veracity of the story but it seemed to move along with a similar "artist's model's tragic fate" plot line as girl with a pearl earring. was the movie a commentary on the religious injustices of the inquisition, false piety, torture then and now, or what???? i never seemed to be able to figure that one out. natalie portman's various characters also seemed ridiculously stereotypical. and ultimately the movie was crowned with the concluding melodrama of a disheveled bardem's head and body hanging on the edge of cart heading off into the sunset
