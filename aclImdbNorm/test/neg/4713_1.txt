i remember seeing this at my local blockbuster and picked it up cause i was curious. i liked movies about mythological creatures. i like movies about werewolves, vampires, zombies, etc. this is based on half-caste, a half-human half-leopard creature that preys on the people of africa.<br /><br />the movie is horrendous! the actors are terrible! there is no script whatsoever! it's all improvised! the whole thing is filmed at night because they say that is the only time you ever see it. it's obvious bull*bleep*! they film at night to make it scary. but, they have failed to scare me. after the first person was killed, i put this back in the case and took it back to blockbuster. one of the most boring movies i've ever seen.<br /><br />now you are probably saying i have no right to review a movie if i haven't finished it. well, this is one of the films that didn't deserve to be watched all the way through.<br /><br />1 star out of 10. this is really bad!
