another winner from that 50s , 60s era that i love so much for the comedic value they give with each viewing these days .corman never lets you down with these films , they take themselves seriously and they have very low budgets , a recipe for good watching for sure . ed nelson a very competent actor got started with corman as well as many other favorites who show up in superman and many of the westerns of the day . the costume is pretty bad and the sound of the alien speaking , well the reverb was a little off but thats the beauty of it . film making for the love of it , not looking for perfection just digging the action of doing it , it comes thru . these films are a fun time ! even better is the mst3k version !!
