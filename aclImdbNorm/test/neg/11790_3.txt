i'm sure that any legitimate submariner would happily ship out on the usos seaview (yes, sos...) why, you could play full-court basketball in the torpedo room, it's so large. and how 'bout the bay windows in the bow, the better to see giant squids or minefields that appear out of nowhere? did i mention the colorful mess-cook with the parrot on his shoulder? and the admiral's stateroom with what appears to be a loft? big bleeping sub...<br /><br />ok, ok...it's never gonna win any prizes for authenticity. and if the sub is laughable, the plot is even worse. somehow the van allen belts of radiation, hundreds of miles in space, have "caught fire" are going to make global warming look like a weenie roast. pompous admiral nelson (walter pidgeon), along with his sidekick lucius (peter lorre, looking suitably uncomfortable) hatch a scheme to put out the fire by firing a missile into its midst.<br /><br />there's plenty of intrigue (sic) along the way, with a born-again survivor (and his little dog, too!) two "dames" who can never leave well enough alone, a passel of "red shirts" who are expendable, and plot holes big enough for godzilla to walk through. thrill to the seaview being chased at what looks like 60 miles per hour by another sub -- no need for advanced sonar when you can follow from 100 feet astern.<br /><br />the movie careens from one cliff-hanger to another; the payoff is so anticlimactic as to be pointless, certainly not worth the 1 hour and 50 minute wait.<br /><br />the technical adviser for this shipwreck must have been a 14-year old boy with a stack of popular mechanics magazines. worth watching, if only to riff upon.
