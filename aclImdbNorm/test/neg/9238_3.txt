****probably will contain spoilers****<br /><br />after a successful attempt to get attention (i would not call making sure that you get help before you die a "failed suicide attempt"), joey finds out that she is pregnant and starts seeing images of spirits.<br /><br />overall the movie was a little slow going, but entertaining enough to watch the whole thing. for a horror movie, there were only a few minor creeps and thrills. halfway through, however, was a really good scary scene (i wont give it away though) :) i watched this movie because i really liked the preceding movie, the eye.<br /><br />i was a little confused, however to determine that, other than being a "supernatural suspense" movie from the same creators, the eye 2 had no relation to the eye, *whatsoever*; different cast, different story. the eye2 does not even have anything to do with eyes :\<br /><br />the movie had a few questionable scenes: joey attempts suicide 3 times (4 times, if you count the time when witnesses say they saw joey trying to jump in front of the train), she is associated with brutally defacing an attacker, she freaks out in a restaurant and witnesses say she was "attacking" people and yet she is allowed to go about her business freely, without even so much as a psyche evaluation or put in the hospital (for reasons other than her pregnancy).<br /><br />the movie was not the greatest horror movie, the story was rather far-fetched (even for a fiction movie :p ), the spooks were either few and/or nothing we have not seen before. however, it was an "interesting" story and once you know what the "truth" is behind the spooks, it was an interesting twist on the "ghost" story.<br /><br />i rate the movie 3 out of 10.
