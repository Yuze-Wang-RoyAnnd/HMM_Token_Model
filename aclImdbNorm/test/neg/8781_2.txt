this movie contains the worst acting performance of all time. spilsbury lacks energy to say the least. energy is what clayton moore gave us in spades. i never felt once in this movie that spilsbury was anxious for anything. revenge, love, justice? not in this guy's portrayal.<br /><br />there is also no chemistry between tonto and lr. if the plot did not force them to be friends, you don't get the impression they want to hang out with each other. plus, the sidekick has the more interesting personality. ewww.<br /><br />the dialogue is predictable and boring.<br /><br />the narration is stunningly bad and if you are familiar with the dukes of hazzard you can picture what this is like. i cannot believe the director would agree to this. it insulted me as a viewer by explaining every plot line i just witnessed.<br /><br />hey, at least the horses and locations looked good, maybe that is what happens when you hire a cinematographer to be your director.<br /><br />rating-2 you may be able to watch this one for laughs or to demonstrate to an alien what a bad movie is.
