hi, everyone, oh, boy... this one is a lulu. it has really bad background music whenever they can squeeze it in. there are three bad guys who, i guess, are the stars of this. they beat people up and chop people up and crash trucks and bulldozers into people. usual stuff.<br /><br />the woman who is sending them on their missions is unable to move her mouth when she speaks. it's sort of like watching a bad ventriloquist who is her own dummy. she walks like she is balancing an egg on her head.<br /><br />the wardrobe is 70s leisure style for the men and blah for the female lead who is supposed to be a good nurse. the bad novocain mouth woman wears red. a silk frock perhaps, or maybe just a poplin windbreaker that is too big.<br /><br />i actually liked the ending even though it did not make a lot of sense. it lets us in on what happened earlier in the film.<br /><br />the police officers are ok. some bad, some good, all stupid except two. the two bright ones could have worked again in hollywood.<br /><br />the movie starts interestingly enough and ends with a surprise. the middle sucks. the guy in the diner who gives a free hamburger to the star does a good job. he is like a 1940s character actor. great voice.<br /><br />this one is a bit too long. the lady with marbles in her mouth could have had just a couple of lines and the rest could have been said by a parrot. it would have been easier to understand a bird.<br /><br />her scene with a sword could have been handled by a trained woodpecker.<br /><br />tom willett
