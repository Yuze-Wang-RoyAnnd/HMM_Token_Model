if a movie can't hold your interest in the first 25 minutes, it's over as far as i'm concerned. this concept that you have to simply deal with a slow first third of a movie and be rewarded later is nonsense. a good movie has to start and end strong. it all seem interesting and some decent shots and lots of promise, but ultimately muddled and irrelevant. there are so many other movies from asia to watch, many of which i am sure most of you have not seen, that i would really skip this one and look elsewhere. why exactly does imdb require a 10 line minimum for reviews? i said my piece and i hope this helps a few of you move on to the next film.
