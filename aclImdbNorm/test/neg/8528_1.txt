this was one of the slowest movies i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. after the introduction where we are given the backstory of "something" killing a couple people in a farm house, we are introduced to a white looser family that is moving to a farm - and nothing happens for a looooong time. then they meet this drifter who helps out on the farm and nothing happens again for a very long time. then finally the girl of the family has some plotergeist stuff happens. then some more happens, the drifter guy goes nuts and the movie ends. in between its all about how this family had to move out becuz the girl got in some trouble back home and they have no money and its done so poorly that i could care less about these pathetic people. i cannot believe i actually went to the theatres to see this! not only did this movie suck, but some a$$hole answered his cell phone, dumb morons were making noise and the movie sucked. thats why theaters suck - bad movies, overpriced crappy food, and idiots in the theatre, i'm staying home and watching dvds from now on, at least i could smoke if i was at home while watching this stupid movie. stay home and bake some pie rather than going to a theatre to see this piece of typical crap. dumb stupid crap.
