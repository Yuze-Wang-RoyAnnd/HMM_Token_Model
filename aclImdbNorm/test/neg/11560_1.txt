some films are just plain silly beyond explanation. this is one of them. words cannot do justice to the wooden acting, the stupid plotline, and the ever-predictable outcome. about the only thing that makes this film halfway worth watching are the scantily clad women (and the mute guy for you ladies) in it. the leader of the warrior women and valeria are quite appealing to the eye. but that's about all this movie has going for it.<br /><br />some silliness in point: one scene, when they start to journey to the lair of the dark one, they are walking away from a supposedly destroyed land. but we clearly see a 1980's new york behind them. about 2/3rds of this movie looks like it was filmed in a high school basement. the deadly sock puppets look about as scary as a sesame street monster. i have to agree with latronic in that many 1950's trash b-movies did a better job than this. about the only one i can think of that didn't was teenagers from outer space.
