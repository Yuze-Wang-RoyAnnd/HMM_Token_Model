a few yrs ago, i remember reading an essay by a feminist film theorist who briefly mentioned rosalind russell. this theorist wrote that the 'strength' of the 'strong women' that rozzie r. played lay partly in their ability to stand by their man (even when he wasn't worth it).<br /><br />i thought of this essay after watching 'crimes of passion'.<br /><br />kathleen turner exudes the same strength and style as russell in her portrayal of prostitute china blue. she's the object of affection for two men: the loony priest played by anthony perkins, and a bland whitebread boy who's marriage is slowly fading. and she won't let either of them have a piece of her until ...<br /><br />i won't give away the ending - but i will say that this is ultimately bland whitebread boy's fantasy. no matter how hard ken russell tries, he can't disguise the fact that this movie is basically a 1940s melodrama for the mtv generation. except its retrogressive class and gender politics make those old black-and-white films look revolutionary by comparison.
