although i do not recommend this film, neither do i recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie. though i have not given away the ending, or most of the plot twists, this movie would be best viewed without any prior information. it's hard to pinpoint the chief problem with the film donnie darko, as there are many to deal with. richard kelly, in his first feature film, seems to have collected enough scenes of adolescent rage, late-night stoner diatribes, self-righteous justifications and inoffensive, banal philosophy to inspire twenty teen-angst dramas; then mashed them into a single two hour package with a sci-fi twist. the result is deeply distressing-- for all the wrong reasons. the film attempts to lead the audience down convoluted paths without any sense of symbolism or meaning, to make them sympathize with one-dimensional characters, and above all hopes that they will ignore the underdeveloped plot, full of unreconciled loose ends, by hiding it under a veneer of cgi effects and neo-surrealism. the main character, donnie darko, is a young man, committed to therapy, misunderstood by his friends, and rendered hostile and disaffected by his suburban life. we are meant to feel that he is more intelligent than his schoolmates, although sometimes that is a difficult assumption to make. for example, when one of his friends comes up with an absurd theory about the smurfs, and donnie counters with a theory of his own, his friend complains about donnie acting "all smart." donnie's speech, however, is no smarter than that of his friend-- just angrier. the only clear evidence of his intelligence is his principal's description of his standardized test scores as `intimidating;' but given the director's slant against simple categorization of human elements (as shown in the fear-love sequence), this is a poor substitute for character development. donnie takes prescribed drugs to combat mental problems, which are not addressed directly in this film. in fact, the entire issue of the drugs is understated, and one of the first chances the director has to redeem the film is lost. the ambiguity of donnie's strange destiny, the possibility that all of this may be a product of his imagination, is pushed into the background, making the film 100 percent science fiction. this would not be a bad thing in itself, except that the "science" behind the "fiction" is very shaky. the explanations of time travel are weak, at best sounding like detached, uninformed rambling. we get the idea that the film's writer once read a book about time travel or a few chapters, and can't quite remember how it worked, but was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to work it into the film. the scientific portion, as a result, depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than actual development of the theories involved (at one point, a teacher discussing time travel states that if he continues to speak on the subject, he'd be fired. apparently no further explanation is needed). donnie's dealings with a visitor from the future lead him to commit several vicious actions. the justification for these actions is a tricky business. he damages his school, but it's okay, because his school doesn't treat him like a person. his punishment of a creepy self-esteem advocate (somewhat similar to tom cruise's character in magnolia) results in the man's public humiliation. but should the audience believe that donnie is some sort of avenging angel, striking out against ignorance and debauchery? he himself seems ignorant of the effects of these actions until after the fact. aside from these flaws, the film is riddled with flat, uninteresting generalizations of humanity. the story is set in 1988, just before the bush/dukakis election, and the director touches on this point during the film. the focus, however, extends exactly this far: donnie's gruff, blue collar father is voting for bush, while his free-spirited, rebellious daughter plans to vote for dukakis. there is nothing even remotely resembling a political statement here; simply a statement of the obvious. the former are not necessary to make a good film, but the latter should be left out. likewise, donnie's heartfelt speech about not being able to lump all human emotions into the bland categories of "fear and "love;" this doesn't ask the audience to make any great leaps of understanding. everybody knows that there are more that two human emotions, and particular emphasis on this fact is worthless. mr. kelly gives homage to several symbols of 80's pop culture in his film: e.t., stephen king, the smurfs, back to the future. at it's heart, this film feels like the director's homage to himself, a collection of his own experiences, interests, personal heroes and adversaries, affirmations and disenchantments, roughly stitched together by untrained hands. entire songs are played in music video format to the characters actions, seemingly because the director likes the songs. characters who have little to no bearing on the plot (including the archetypal bully, fat girl, and right-wing idiot teacher) are given unnecessary focus, because the director really wanted to pack them in somehow. the awkward mess that is donnie darko leaves us wondering if mr. kelly has enough ideas left in his head to make another film, or if he has wasted all his creativity in one pointless, cluttered, meandering effort.<br /><br />my rating: 1/10.
