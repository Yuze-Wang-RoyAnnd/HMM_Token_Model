dubbed beyond comprehension, the hbo version of lumumba is a disastrous rendering of what looks like what was once a decent film. some scenes simply don't make sense in english and the actors bring zero energy to their voice reading. add in the self-censorship involving cia operative frank carlucci, and you have a film stripped of both its drama and its power. here's hoping the subtitled version gets to american television screens at some point.
