i was really disappointed after viewing pinocchio's revenge the other night. i had a good inclination that it was going to be a bad one, but i didn't think that it'd be as bad as it turned out. a wooden puppet of a murdered boy falls into the hands of an attorney's eight-year-old daughter. from there, it is a murderous path for anyone who gets in the way between the puppet and the little girl. we've seen movies like this before, i.e. the child's play series, which is by the way, far better. however, it was good to see actors like james w. quinn and todd allen. both of which have worked under kevin tenney before. in any event, i encourage viewers to check out "night of the demons" and the original "witchboard." these are titles that tend to bring out the best in kevin s. tenney.
