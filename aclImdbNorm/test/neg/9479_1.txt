this movie sucks so bad. its funny to see what a poor story this has, where two pea-brained american twins who know about nothing outside their school can come to another continent, and do unimaginable things there. its just so stupid and so bizarre. how can they just find two french guys, hit on them and in the end kiss them, not knowing anything about them? more realistic would have been having the guys take them away and rape them, which could have easily happened in such a situation. as for the bit where they make the french president drink 'bad water', that was just lame. i don't think he would have been too pleased in real life. everything worked out too easily for the girls, and they could have been in real trouble many times in the movie, if it at all depicted real life.<br /><br />my rating : 0 / 10
