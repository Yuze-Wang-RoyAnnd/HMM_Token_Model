the first two bring it on movies were both quite good in their own ways. the first was fairly serious, the second was successfully satirical - and the third opted for the usual idiotic low-brow comedy that we always see in the utterly brainless teen movies that hollywood has coming out of the woodwork. the entire point in this movie was that cheerleaders are total airheads who hardly know enough to carry on a common conversation, and that's the extent of this movie's comedy. ha ha. not.<br /><br />there is no shred of cleverness in this movie, no theme, no subtext, nothing for anybody with half a brain to be entertained by (and sure enough, i could not sit through all of it). if you're the sort of person who're entertained by fart jokes, this movie is for you. congratulations.<br /><br />2 out of 10.
