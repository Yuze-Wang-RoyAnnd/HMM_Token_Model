i got a kick out of reynolds saying to his attorney, "look,i've done a lot of shi%ty thing in my life, but i never killed anyone." obviously he forgot about his career which slid down hill after he started making stupid movies like 'cannonball run.' physical evidence was originally supposed to be a sequel to 'the jagged edge' that glen close sanely rejected. the verdict is in, avoid physical evidence.
