this movie has more goofs than any other movie i have seen in my life. the special effects are damned terrible. for instance, near the end, when the concorde is falling after the cargo door tears off, the thing spins like a toy. the special effects of airport (1970) are way better than this crap. also, the force of a concorde opening up at altitude and speed would essentially turn the thing inside-out. (that is if it would even open at all) but the movie has its good points. mostly when it ends. that's also cheesy. e.g. the thing lands on a bank of loosely-packed snow, if it did that, it would splinter into a million pieces. overall, 2 out of 10. instant flop. great laugh flick.
