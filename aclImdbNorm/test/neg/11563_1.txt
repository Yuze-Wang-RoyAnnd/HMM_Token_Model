this movie is really bad. most of it looks like it was filmed either in a park or a basement. there's a giant spider but all we see of it is one leg. there are some worms that live in a cave that are just cheap sock puppets with cardboard teeth. and the plot is a bunch of post-apocalyptic mumbo jumbo that makes no sense at all. the whole thing is just laughable.
