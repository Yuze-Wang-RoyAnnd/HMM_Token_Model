be warned by the line on the back of the box that promotes a story involving "over sexed jocks". there isn't a thing redeeming about carrie 2. the plot is absurd, the acting terrible, and the ending all too predictable.<br /><br />i wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but i was expecting to be entertained. i wasn't. the only way i could rationalize watching this movie was because i was at a relative's house while waiting for my car to be fixed. unless in the same predicament stay well away from this film.
