sadly a great opportunity to utilise a superb cast to bring king lear up to date. however, instead, we got a contrived family drama that appeared to dip into lear when the writer had run out of ideas, the cast worked hard but it just didn't gel. recently stephen harrigan showed how to adapt and update the classics with his screenplay for the magnificent tv movie "king of texas".
