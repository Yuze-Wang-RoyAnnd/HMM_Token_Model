but at least this movie got what it deserved - to be sent to the satellite of love to be ridiculed on by mike, tom servo, and crow t. robot from pearl forrester on "mystery science theater 3000!" "soultaker" is one of those long lost, forgotten movies that are so bad you'll be guaranteed to have nightmares or depression later on in life. even though the movie is not that old, it's still a very forgotten type of movie. if it had never been for the intelligent minds at "mystery science theater 3000," the movie would not only seem like it was never made, but the movie wouldn't be very enjoyable by us moviegoers.<br /><br />in real life: this movie is really bad. in the satellite of love: this movie is excellent!
