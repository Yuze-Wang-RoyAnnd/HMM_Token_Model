in thailand, the americans connor (colin egglesfield) and his girlfriend amanda (meredith monroe) quarrel in a muay-thai fight, and amanda leaves connor alone. she asks the direction of the hotel to a stranger, indeed the mean vampire niran (don hetrakul), and she is bitten and kidnapped by his gang of evil vampires in motorcycles. connor joins to a clan of "good" vampires leaded by sang (stephanie chao), trying to save amanda from the claws of niran.<br /><br />i expected that "vampires: the turning" were a good movie. the locations and the cinematography are beautiful; the very heavy music score is excellent; stephanie chao is gorgeous and attractive; but unfortunately, the screenplay and the director are terrible and the very loose costume of meredith monroe does not help her fallen breasts. the story is very short, and the unknown marty weiss uses long scenes with motorcycle race, fights and boring flashbacks to complete a minimum running time for film. my vote is four.<br /><br />title (brazil): "vampiros: a convers~ao" ("vampires: the conversion")
