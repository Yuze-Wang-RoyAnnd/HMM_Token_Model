i went to this film full of hope. with so many capable and humorous actors headed up by sir ben i thought this is going to be a little treat.<br /><br />oh how i felt like gouging my eyes out as the credits rolled. that i had wasted 93mins of my life this film that was clearly doa. there are some real problems with this film and it will probably be easier to list them; 1. no jokes, i am not particularly hard to please comedically - high or low brow - but there really is not one laugh in this film.<br /><br />2. sir ben mumbles through every single line whether he is supposed to be drunk or not?!? 3. there is no effort to to begin let alone develop the relationship between the love interests in this. 2 people bumping into each other randomly in the street would instantly have more rapport.<br /><br />4. all the acting talent that is assembled is completely wasted. don't be fooled into watching this because of the names.<br /><br />5. for a cold ass hit-man he rubbed out more people in gandhi than this flaccid waste of time (a by the way dyed beards look really creepy) i was hoping that this was a slow burner but in the end the only thing that could inject any life - and justice - into this is frank pulling out his 9 and offing the whole cast starting with tea and ending with himself - sorry it was that bad.
