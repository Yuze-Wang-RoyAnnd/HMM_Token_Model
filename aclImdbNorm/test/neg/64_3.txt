this only gets bashed because it stars david hasselhoff. well, then let me bash it to. compared to the garbage they call horror coming out nowadays, this film isn't too bad. it has the beautiful leslie cumming. she is super hot, but can't talk very well. there is a great scene with her when she is supernaturally raped. she shows off her nice body. linda blair does nothing here as well as hasselhoff. 3/10
