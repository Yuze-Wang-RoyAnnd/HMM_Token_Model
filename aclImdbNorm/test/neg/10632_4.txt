i would say this is a background movie. play it the background as your tending to busy work (laundry, checking email, etc). i thought this was a film that was done before amy adams became successful after enchanted. wrong! it was done in 2009! the screenplay/script is pretty awful. i love musicals but the singing is just average and doesn't move the plot along. ughh. it almost seems like it's a made for tv movie based on the cinematography. am i watching a tv show? <br /><br />even the secretary breaks out into song. what the f@#$ is going on?! actually she seemed to have the best voice. amy adams was so great in enchanted. lead actor is average. disappointed for sure. this movie would have been good for lifetime, but that's about it. :(
