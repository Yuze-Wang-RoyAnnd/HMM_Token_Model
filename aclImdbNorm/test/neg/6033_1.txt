this has some of the stupidest fight scenes of all time. if i was a veteran of any war i would cry when i see this movie, not because i would remember being in vietnam, but because it is a poor representation of any veteran of that war. even though the troops are carrying m16s, that movie resembles nothing like vietnam. the viet cong even uniforms look like old leftover japanese uniforms from a wwii movie. the setting is obviously some crappy hollywood back lot. the worst scene contains a us soldier fighting "hand to hand" like in a bad martial arts movie. after he dispatches several enemy troops he says, "hey come down here and lets kick some butt!" to a helicopter in the air. he then is shot. this movie is trash.
