put the film down and back slowly away. the acting rivals a highschool play, the plot is treadworn, and the production values are slightly higher than community theater. the goofs are so plentiful that it becomes a laugher. rooms are switched around, the dead move, dogs are used for wolves, men shot point blank with .45 caliber pistols are able to walk and ride snowmobiles, blouses button and unbutton without human touch... this is a baaaaaaaaaddddddd movie. i nearly passed out when i saw the average rating. there is no accounting for taste. btw, there is no nudity.
