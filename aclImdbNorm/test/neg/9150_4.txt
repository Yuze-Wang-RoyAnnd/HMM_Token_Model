yes, it's true that it was jessica alba who leads me to this movie, because without her, i should have never pick it.<br /><br />but, i find it long, dull and above all, unoriginal. all along, i thought that the story was full of clich'es and the directing very boring. so it was a surprise to see that the director and writer are the one and same person. i take notice to remember to avoid all his next movies.<br /><br />it's a pity because all good things were at hand: malaysia is a beautiful jungle, it was the british empire and the cast is wonderful: jessica knows how to open her soul and for one time, she has found an appropriate movie for this. bob hoskins shows a great experience and he should have won an award for this role.<br /><br />the only positive thing is that it makes me open a world-map to locate this island because if you guess it happens in south asia, you don't know where exactly! ah, the little plane flight with red lines in the indiana jones movie!!!
