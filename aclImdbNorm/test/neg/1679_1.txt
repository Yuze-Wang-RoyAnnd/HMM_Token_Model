i have yet to watch the first entry in this series, however, fortunately, i was still able to follow the complex and intricate plot, with all its unexpected twists and turns, and i applaud them for the utter originality of the concepts herein. in case there is any confusion, let me leave no doubt as to the fact that everything i've just said is coated in pure, carefully nurtured sarcasm, the kind that flourishes and grows exponentially when exposed to crap like this flick. a clear sign that this is unimpressive is that it was directed by a visual effects creator, whose only other credit in that field is a henry rooker film that wasn't well received. the acting is average at best, and i defy anyone to not find... scottish computer-woman(come on, seriously, what is with that last name?)'s russian accent laughable and/or irritating. there is an attempt or two at stylization in this, and they are reasonable. the action isn't terrible. cinematography and editing are fine. the music is cool enough. language is infrequent, if even that. violence is fairly bloody. i recommend this solely to fans of b-movies, and i will say that you can do worse than this. 1/10
