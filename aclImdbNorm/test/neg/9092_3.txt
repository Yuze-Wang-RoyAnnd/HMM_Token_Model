this movie was a disappointment. the story is essentially the shining with a castle (or a very cheap set masquerading as a castle, to be specific) substituting as the hotel and a monster instead of the ghosts. the budget is the same you'd see from a cinemax softcore porn, as is the photography, sets, lighting, and video it was shot on. the story is a failed attempt at sincerity: there's no easier way to make your audience feel sympathetic for your characters than to show them experiencing emotional trauma. and the trauma in this movie is pretty trite. want an example? a blind girl listening to a language tape teaching the italian words for colors begins to cry at what she will never see.<br /><br />this movie had a few things going for it, however: the monster is actually pretty cool, pretty scary-looking. and there is a pretty decent amount of nudity from raffaella offidani, herself a star of italian "erotic" films. the gore, however, leaves much to be desired, as does the acting, even from the experienced jeffrey combs.<br /><br />other than this i've only seen two other stuart gordon films: re-animator and from beyond, both of which were outstanding. but i won't let this little footnote in his career keep me from watching many more of his movies.
