a fine line up of actors and a seemingly nice plot -- though not original -- promised me a nice evening in front of the tv. i was disappointed. the actors delivered up to standard (juliette lewis cuddly as ever; william hurt solid but in the background; shelley duvall convincing as ever) but the story was too thin to keep me engaged to the story and, the twist to the finale was too obvious and too late; there was only one character who was nice to he girl, so guess what?! then the final after-twist
