and again, i find myself in the minority.<br /><br />i didn't like this one. this is the only varney work i haven't embraced, including knowhutimean. slam dunk ernest rates the credit for being the worst of the line, but this is a clear competitor for that dubious title.<br /><br />this work is too rough, and too base to be lovable. lovability was one of ernest's key components, and this element was completely lost herein. unfortunately, most think this is the best of the line, but if you loved the essence of what made ernest, ernest, you will realize to what i refer about fifteen minutes into this work. it was too blatantly base to be fun.<br /><br />it rates a 3.5/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
