this film is the proof that a good actor is nothing without a good direction. ed harris is awful. how could you cast an actor built like rambo to play the "maestro"? he shows no credibility at all and overplays beethoven. most of all, long hairs doesn't look good at all on his head. the main actress is missing all the subtleties needed for its character. the camera shots are cheesy and too conventional. the lights are to close of the characters feelings. bad casting and cheap direction. too bad! the only scene that worth the movie is when beeth (i hope you don't care that i call him trough his nickname?) is turning the girl's song to a joke. any way, i hope that harris could find his way back to true movie where he can really shows his hairless talent.
