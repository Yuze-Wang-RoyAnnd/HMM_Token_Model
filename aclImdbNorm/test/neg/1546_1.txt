i've already commented on this film (under the name thelegendarywd). but i see there are others who have commented since. all i can say is: what the f**k!?". i cannot believe that a whole 16 people have commented on this film or even seen this movie. add to that the fact that a couple give it great reviews (probably the makers of the film who went to one of those places in a strip mall that provide internet service and wrote a good review - seeing as how there is no way they could or would pay for their own internet provider... just look at their movie). although i still admit i got a soft spot for this movie. i thought that some of the other people writing about this one might have it confused with another... until i read the reviews... especially the person who identified the tag line on the front of the box: "the ultimate in frontal lobotomy" (what the f**k is that supposed to mean anyway? "frontal" lobotomy?)... i totally forgot about that until i read it in the review. people, we are a select few... i say we meet once a year to view this film... wait, does anyone still have it? if anyone does have it please contact me... i'm dyin' to get drunk.
