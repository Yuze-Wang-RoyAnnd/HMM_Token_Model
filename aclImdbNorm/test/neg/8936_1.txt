one of the worst movies ever made... if you can get through this movies without falling asleep, then you are doing pretty good, considering no matter how hard you turn up the volume you cant hear what the 'actors' (?) are saying and if you can acually see whats going on from the terrible film (i mean hell if you cant find anything that works better... use a home movie camara... at least you can acually tell whats going on!)<br /><br />it is beyond my imagination how people get a movie like this to slip through the cracks, and escape on video... and further more.. how do people making this not know how terrible it is... good god... (!)<br /><br />after what i have just told you... if you are waiting for me to give you a summary of this piece of trash movie, there is nothing to tell... a group of campers on motorcycles get lost in the woods and a bunch of people terrorize them... or somthing to that... whats more so an action movie than a horror... this 'movie' (?) is of no interest... if someone acually likes this i litterally feel for you.... <br /><br />absolute trash... not even one of those cheap funny flicks to watch go rent.. 'plan 9 from outerspace' and have a ball
