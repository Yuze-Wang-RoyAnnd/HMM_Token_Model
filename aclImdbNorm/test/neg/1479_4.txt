so boring you'll fall asleep after the 20 first minutes. sorry mr boutonnat, i do admire your work (all these beautiful "films" you directed such as "tristana", "sans logique" etc...) but here, the plot is extremely... vain ! except the magnificent photography, everything appears dumb and there's no envy to know what will happen at these "medium" actors. moreover, the dialogs are minimalists. the famous question "where are the children" is repeated so often it looks like a farce. believe me, it's a pure waste of time (concerning the plot), and 3 hours is a long long time. certainly the real reason of this box-office total mess !
