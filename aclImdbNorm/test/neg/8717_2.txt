surely one of the lamest shows ever to be produced on these shores and thats saying something. even many of the lead actors didn't stick around for the duration. the fact that it ran for eight years is a sad indictment on the average intelligence and cultural nous of the aussie viewer. it went round and round in circles, with repetitive gags and poorly-drawn characters. arthur macarthur, for god's sake. did they actually pay the writers of this show? i wonder if anyone checked their qualifications. there were tired gags about rural people and second-rate farce situations that were poor imitations of a thousand english and us sitcoms that had gone before. i think that's what i hate about it so much, that it appears no one involved wanted to make it memorable, original or clever, instead opting for the lowest common denominator each time.
