this film was sourced from my friends mum who worked in a charity shop. she gave it to us along with a load of other unknown cassette tapes. the film itself is a bit rubbish. there are a few notable bits to laugh at like the bit when his girlfriend gets her head drilled into, but in general the film is bland. interstingly when i saw the trailer for "the island" i couldn't help noticing the similarities. clonus may have been the inspiration for that film? all in all don't bother watching this film as it is dull and boring. we enjoyed it so much when we were 16 that we named our band after it. another sign this film is a bit crappy is the shots on the back of the video case don't actually appear in the film? weird
