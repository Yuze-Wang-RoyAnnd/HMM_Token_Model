herman has made northern drama his own with little voice and brassed off, but the formula falters in this ropey, flat and contrived tale of two teenage delinquents trying to get season tickets to see newcastle.<br /><br />truancy, underage smoking and drinking, underage sex, teenage abortion, school bullying, drug abuse, substance abuse, depression, child violence, child sex abuse, shoplifting, housebreaking, auto theft, violent assault and armed robbery all put in an appearance here. none of these issues are explored, they merely serve to move the story along from one implausible situation to another. the film is not as acutely observed as trainspotting, as poignant as the full monty, or as reflective of the times as wonderland (from which it shamelessly steals music in an overly-manipulative manner). i suspect none of the filmmakers are from newcastle, and have certainly never experienced the social problems the film references. i am all for entertainment, and herman's track record shows he is aware of the need to balance the social message with laughs and tears. quite simply, he comes up incredibly short here.<br /><br />the film has a nice ending, but there are far too many flat, banal moments to sit through to get there. nicely shot, not very well acted, and ultimately fails on three crucial points: script, script, script.
