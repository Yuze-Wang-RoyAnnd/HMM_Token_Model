okay, now i know where all those boring cop/homicide tv shows came from. i do believe they can be traced back to this movie. "scene of the crime" feels more like a tv episode, or an episode of a serial. complete with stock characters and situations - the hotshot cop who clashes with his superiors... the aging cop who doesn't want a desk job, despite failing eyesight... the reckless rookie... the double-crossing dame, etc.<br /><br />i like many of the actors here, and they do a good job, but overall i found this movie dull as i'm not a fan of the genre. i kept tuning out when they were discussing the case ...something about bookies and informers. and oh yeah, there was a stripper, played by the previously wholesome gloria dehaven. what i want to know is: why did she keep calling van johnson "uncle wiggly"? wasn't uncle wiggly a rabbit? a character from a children's book? what the heck does that have to do with anything? i guess i just don't get tough-guy film noir-ish kinda jargon.<br /><br />in fact, much of the dialogue made me mutter "nobody talks like that!" however, i could relate to one scene where the cop's wife (arlene dahl), who worries every time he goes to work, realizes that maybe she shouldn't have made her husband the center of her life. yeah, i know that feeling of loving someone so much, being so dependent on them, that there's a constant fear for their safety. so there are moments of truth in this film, underneath the stylized dialogue and atmosphere which is trying so self-consciously to be gritty and real, that it actually seems unreal to me.<br /><br />a little background: this movie was made when dore schary took over mgm from louis b. mayer, and began to put an end to the wholesome musicals that made mgm so great. dore schary was determined to bring more "realism" to movies. i kinda hate dore schary. maybe we can blame him for all the pretentious, bleak movies being made today, wallowing in the ugly "truths" about life, focusing on (and, in my opinion, helping to perpetuate) the worst of humanity rather than the best. no longer uplifting us the way classic movies were designed to do - providing a necessary distraction during the great depression and world war ii.<br /><br />well, damn it, we still need that kind of distraction today! there's still plenty of depression and plenty of war. and what are people turning to nowadays when they want to escape? trashy, brain-deadening reality tv. thanks a lot, dore!
