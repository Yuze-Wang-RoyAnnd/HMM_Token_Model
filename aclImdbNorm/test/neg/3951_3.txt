after the mysterious death of an old friend,a group of teenagers find themselves in the possession of stay alive,a horror survival video game based on the gruesome story of erzebet bathory known as the blood countess.the group begins to play the grisly game and soon they are murdered one by one in the same method as the character they played in the game.as the line between the game world and the reality disappears,our heroes must find a way to defeat vicious blood countess. "stay alive" is an incredibly poor teen slasher flick without any iota of suspense.writer-director william brent bell doesn't have the damn clue how to make a watchable horror movie.the jump scares are irritating,the blood/gore level is almost non-existent and the story doesn't make sense.the dialogue is utterly bad and the acting of all involved is embarrassing."stay alive" is easily one of the worst mainstream horror flicks of 2006.stay away from this stinking turd.
