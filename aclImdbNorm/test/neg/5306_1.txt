i saw a 12:45 a.m. show last night, and i would've walked out 20 min. in, but there was nowhere to go! blatant product placement, juvenile script, so much talent gone to waste, gay-bashing...what didn't they do? the movie is also insanely long (we got out at 3). as a person who rarely pays full price at the movies, imagine my chagrin doling out $22 for this self-indulgent, mean-spirited nightmare (plus $2 parking). i woke up today still feeling depressed, and haven't been able to shake it all day. i love vince vaughn, and he seemed straight up lost in this thing, as was i. when cedric the entertainer is the high-water mark (a man so un-entertaining that he has to call himself "the entertainer" so you'll understand what it is he thinks he's doing), you have a serious problem. also, the appearance of robert pastorelli is down-right creepy, since he died almost a year ago (march 10). this should give you an idea how long they've been polishing this turd. this movie is mean to the bitter end. we stayed just to make sure they didn't give robert an "in remembrance", which they didn't. save yourself! save your money! save your soul!
