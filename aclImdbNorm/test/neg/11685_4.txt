first there are some plot holes in this movie. we see in the very beginning a kid dies from playing the game. but who was tied up in the mail truck delivering the package which contains the game? how did the driver place the package into the mailbox when he was lashed to the steering wheel? it is not like he was mr. fantastic. wow that in just the first 15 minutes... the actors are second rate, take the "bad guy" played by patrick kilpatrick (who?) exactly he has appeared in one episode of everything on tv and some secondary roles in poor movies (like this one). so most of the acting is like tv dramas, i can live with that, but the graphics or special effects are horrible. the disembodied "game" voice sounds like a poor clone of hal from "space oddessy 2000". what they called zombies looked more like shadows jumping around like monkeys from "planet of the apes". the aliens had transparent bodies like the shadow zombies. in most cases, the movie was just predictable as it had no hook or hidden agenda going. the story was a good idea but like most good ideas discussed over lunch was never developed beyond that good idea stage.
