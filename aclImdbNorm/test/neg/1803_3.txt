the movie adaptation of heart of darkness is disappointing, both as a movie and as a representation of joseph conrad's classic story. <br /><br />there are several small differences between the book and movie, but that's expected in any book to movie transition. kurtz dies in a different location; the manager does not accompany marlow on his voyage; kurtz's mistress spends much more time with him than in the story. the real issue is the amount of footage that's put into the movie but has no basis in the actual story. for some reason, the director finds the need to "spice up" a few of the scenes, adding drama or actions that seldom make any sense and are always unimportant to the story. some examples that come to mind are kurtz's "mistress" beating marlow over the head and knocking him out. nothing happens while he's unconscious and marlow didn't even provoke the attack. a couple hours pass and he wakes up: total waste of time. kurtz has a pet monkey which, for some random reason, he kills on a whim. also, when marlow leaves kurtz's station, he makes the "noble" decision to leave behind all the priceless ivory he had obtained, for no real reason at all. one other flaw is kurtz's character. john malkovich is a terrible choice to play the man who is described as tall and inspirational: a man with a commanding presence. he practically whispers all of his lines which, in a more capable actor's hands, could have been very thought provoking. i can't remove the image of john malkovich playing a mentally disabled farmhand in of mice and men when i'm watching him botch the role of kurtz. over all, i would rate the movie at 3 out of 10 stars. it's a good movie if you've read the book and want to see it in movie form, perhaps to help you visual the scenes, but as a source of entertainment, i would never recommend it.
