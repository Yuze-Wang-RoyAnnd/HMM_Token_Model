everything about this movie was bad, the acting was bad and the plot was bad. and were is all the blood and gore that was in "demons" which is a good movie and it was not scary at all. my brother said that this movie was bad but i had to give it a chance since the first movie was very good. when the movie was over i understand why my brother thought this movie was bad. the only plus in this movie was the music by "the smiths" and "the cult", but this is a movie and the music soundtrack is not the most important thing. and i saw that it has been released four sequels after this film, i haven't seen none of them but can they be as awful as this one, i have no plans to see them but maybe i will see them some time.
