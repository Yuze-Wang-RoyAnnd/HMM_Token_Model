i grew up watching the "bowery boys" on the weekends and even at young an age i could tell this was low rent stuff as the name implies. still it was fun to watch satch (hall) get the better of muggs (gorcey) after muggs would beat the crap out him. the east side kids stuff were never shown even though it was public domain stuff and probably cheap to run, it was just to low a standard for kids to tune in even though we only had like 5 channels to watch. enter the year 2005 and i am repossesin about my childhood. i can't find any bowery boys on dvd but i found the east side kids on disc and also on a public domain website. thankfully i saved my dough and saw bowery blitz on the web for free, and it really really blows. now i can see there are some bowery boys and maybe monogram bad movie lovers here that gave this melodrama crap a 7 of 10 but c'mon folks, this ain't even trying to be funny. it's an east side kids drama, not a comedy so it's no good. the best part was seeing muggs fight at the end, he reminded me of my grade school days flayling away like a girl when i would get in a fight, it was kinda abusin. leonard maltin said in his mini bio that this flick is one of the better ones, so you can just imagine the rest. if you wanna see some halfway decent east side action see ghosts on the loose maybe but the bottom line is usually a comedy team starts out strong in their career and tapers off, these mugs blew chucks early on then slowly picked it up until hall's antics dominated than they were at best. still 2nd tier stuff way below the 3 stooges, who they imitate but amusing for those who grew up with them. this feature won't bring back pleasant "bowery boys" memories and is best left to monogram fanatics.
