i rented this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club -- you know, those hip, cool places you might stumble upon late on a saturday night. well, there's not one ounce of "cool" in this ridiculous movie. the score is goofy, the original songs are awful, both lead actors' singing is continually off-key (to be kind) and unprofessional at best, the plot is no more complex than "boy meets girl," the acting is laughable, and the only decent cinematic moments are the stock footage scenes. the jazz club scenes feature sophomoric dialog smothered by overly-busy organ music. this joey de francesco should keep his day job (unless his day job is helping with movie scores). is it possible to not only get my four dollars back, but have my therapy sessions paid for as well? this movie, interestingly enough, is so bad, you might want to watch it. sort of like driving by a bad accident -- you just have to look at least once. just get the ear plugs ready!
