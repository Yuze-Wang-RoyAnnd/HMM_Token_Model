this show has shown it's true colors now that democrats are in power. it never did lead the world in iq as anyone who thought it has intelligence has been programmed to think one way (which is a scary thing).<br /><br />comedy central moved this & it's spin off back to an earlier time once the democrats took power for a reason- because now when the democrats screw up - which is just as often as republicans do - stewart no longer takes pot shots at them. that is why the ratings for both this & the spin are dropping.<br /><br />basically, most of the humor now is either lame, or lame sarah palin jokes - which all the ratings dropping comedians are now telling. the facts to back this up speak for themselves. the jay leno show which has been doing the same kind of humor is on the verge of being canceled. the ratings for letterman & conan & the shows that follow them are down.<br /><br />so emperor stewart is not alone. trouble is if any of them start taking real rips at the bungling democrats in power, they could raise their ratings in a hurry because the best humor is always at the expense of whose in power. the bush years proved that because the ratings for this show & colbert, & letterman & leno were higher there.<br /><br />o'bama has done one thing, proved these shows have to be willing to take chances & rip the folks in power if they are to prosper. right now, the daily show & stewart are sagging but maybe they can get lucky & have palin elected as the first woman president in 2012. then the lame palin jokes will become ratings grabbers.
