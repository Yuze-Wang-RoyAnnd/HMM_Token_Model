this western/musical/comedy is not one of the best of the genre i have seen.i found it much too slow.it just plodded along to the inevitable end.i also found it disjointed.i couldn't wait for it to be over.randolph scott is the headliner here,and lloyd bridges also stars.but for my money money edgar buchanan is the best of the bunch.buchanan appeared in many westerns in his day,many times providing comic relief,as he does in this picture.i also liked ann dvorak as rita.otherwise,though,i can't think of much to recommend this movie.the movie is based on a novel by ernest haycock,who also wrote the novel stagecoach,which was mad into a movie of the same name in 1939,and remade in 1966 and again in 1986.the 1939 version of stagecoach,is in my mind,one of the best movies ever made.anyway.as for abilene town,my vote is a 3/10
