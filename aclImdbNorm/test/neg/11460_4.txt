unfortunately, this film is typical of the watering down of a good film by numerous sequels. universal made several serial monster films in the 1940s, which were pale imitations of the original. the intelligent egyptologist imhotep has been replaced by a leg-dragging frankenstein in mummy wrappings, who exhibits no signs of intelligent life. this film is entertaining in spots but if you have seen the mummy (1932), you will be disappointed.
