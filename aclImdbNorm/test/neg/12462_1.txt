as a rule, i try to find as much in films as i possibly can to enjoy them. i made no exceptions with "tart", doing my very best to appreciate it for what it was. but no effort, no matter how great, could possibly redeem this pitiful excuse for a movie.<br /><br />it failed for a number of reasons. firstly, the cinematography was directionless and ineffective. secondly, the script reached depths of 'poor' that took it well and truly beyond the 'so bad it's good' category. thirdly, the acting left mind-blowing amounts to be desired - it was appalling, it really was. anyone who saw mischa barton (seen here as the remarkably terrible grace, a character so poorly invented and realised that ja ja binks doesn't seem so bad) as devon in john duigan's "lawn dogs" will wonder what went wrong between then and now. perhaps, had she been given a character worth bothering with, and a modicum of direction, she at least might have given this film one redeeming feature. alas, such was not the case. finally, the film seemed to have no point whatsoever, expressing nothing, achieving nothing. really, i wonder why christina wayne bothered.<br /><br />"tart" made a feeble attempt to be something, and failed. the result - a film, sadly, so bad that it's just very, very bad. don't bother - it really isn't worth it.
