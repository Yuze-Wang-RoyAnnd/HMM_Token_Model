may or may not contain spoilers. <br /><br />inuyasha is not a good anime. it's actually very overrated. why? there's absolutely no story line, no plot, and the show just drags on... and on... and on... that's because there are more side stories and fillers than episodes that make the plot progress. and the fillers are just the same stories being repeated over and over again. the same episodes seem to go with the same plot: kagome sensing a jewel shard, a worm/slime/tentacle demon thing pops up, inuyasha says "wind-scar", "iron reaver soul stealer", etc. and kills the demon, they get the jewel shard, and then we just repeat this scene 160 or more times.<br /><br />besides the repeating of episodes, there's the repeating of comedic devices, and they're not funny anymore. wait, they never were. sexual harassment is not funny. viz rated the series older teens, 16+. i have no idea why they rated it that. there's nothing bad about it except for the so-called funny sexual harassment, which is kind of suggestive, and that could get you arrested these days.<br /><br />now, this is how we know inuyasha is overrated. the videogames. they all sucked. especially the mask game. i played that at my friend's house. it wasn't anything interesting. the game was slow, boring, and it had nintendo 64 like graphics. in a magazine, it got a rating of 4/10, saying "...this role-playing game is slower than milkshake moving up a cocktail straw." then, there's all these stupid inuyasha toys, action figures, trading cards, stickers, and coloring books. coloring books! we thought inuyasha was 16+! maybe not... but after being a member of inuyasha groups on msn, about half the people on there were 10 to 13. i guess inuyasha is a little kid anime after all. (i think that just a small bit of editing done to this show, it could be shown on toonami.) there are over 40 manga volumes. i can only help but wonder how many miles of forest that have been cut down to make them. sad...<br /><br />then there's the music. the music is so annoying. we hear the same 5 songs every episode. after 10 episodes, the music gets really annoying. in other anime, they have music to fit the mood and we don't hear some songs very often. there are about 15 different inuyasha soundtracks. don't waste your money on that garbage!<br /><br />and how do you think i know all this? because i used to be a fan of inuyasha. i feel ashamed of myself. i'd rather watch kim possible or pokemon instead. sadly, those two shows have more romance between the two main protagonists than inuyasha will ever have...
