dean cain, the one time super-man, plays max hooper the super-thief. he can break into any company and steal any thing for the right price. unfortunately his latest heist ends him up in a high-rise in which someone else has set a fire to hide their own attempts to steal the product. now the thief finds himself having to be the hero rescuing everyone in the building. unfortunately the other thief is still in the building and the f.b.i. & c.i.a. are outside waiting for max.<br /><br />the movie is barely passable. dean cain is a fun actor and has done much better with more improved material but here he is saddled with a weak script and pretty poor direction.
