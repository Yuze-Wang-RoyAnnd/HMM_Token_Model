i recently was in a stage version of this play. and, on the last day of the run, i was excited to see that it was going to be playing on tv. i stuck a tape in as it was on late at night, and i watched it the next day. i have to say i was very disappointed. the actors in the film made few of the discovers that are in the script. that is understandable as the resersal process is probably different, but it was upsetting to see. a lot of the original script was changed for the movie as well to make it better for the screen, but i am not sure if it helped the movie out at all. i gave this 4 stars only because i know the script and the writing is a lot better than what this movie portrays.
