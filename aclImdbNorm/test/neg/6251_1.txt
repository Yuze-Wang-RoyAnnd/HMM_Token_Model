even as a big fan of the low to no budget horror genre, i couldnt find this disaster mildly amusing. with horrible acting, a painfully generic "plot" and no dimensional characters, no matter how bored and drunk you are, this one is not worth your 81 minutes. don't make the same mistake i did. rent something else. anything else!!!
