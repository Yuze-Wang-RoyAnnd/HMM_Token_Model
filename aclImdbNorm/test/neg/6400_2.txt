this takes place on fire island back in the 1970s. a couple peter (craig dudley) and buddy (j. will deane) are throwing a 4th of july party at their house. unfortunately their relationship is falling apart and they have to get ready for a house full of very strange guests. the rest of the movie chronicles the party and what happens between peter and buddy.<br /><br />ok--i'm a gay man but i was 8 back when this was made. if this is a true view of what gay life was in the 1970s, i'm glad i wasn't around. from the puzzling opening credits which shows kids playing in the sand (???) this movie slides slowly into disaster. there's a guru (robert case) who talks nonstop about nothing of any importance. i wanted to gag the guy halfway into his first long speech. there's the young kid danny who is there for his first time. there's the lesbian couple (who do nothing--except one strips for no reason). there's the leather queen. worst of all is the effeminate man named jimmy (jimmy foster). we're introduced to him and his friend (whose name i never got) when they get a flat tire. they basically scream and screech for 10 minutes and have no idea how to fix a flat. i know some people find this funny but i found it offensive and pretty sad. the party itself is full of people you would never want to know. it's like being dumped in a party full of bad actors playing obnoxious people. with the sole exception of dudley no one can act.<br /><br />this may be valuable as a portrait of what fire island was like in the 1970s...but it's pretty dull viewing. this gets a 2 only for the frequent male nudity of some very nice bodies.
