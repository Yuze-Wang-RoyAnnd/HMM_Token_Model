truly appalling waste of space. me and my friend tried to watch this film to its conclusion but had to switch it off about 30 minutes from the end. and i can count the films i have switched off before the end on one hand.<br /><br />the script and direction are leaden and deeply uninspiring. i wouldn't be surprised if they found the script in a pile of cast off scripts from 1983. for example the irritating scroat threatening the real estate guy from his house phone. i mean seriously. the police would be beating his door down in minutes. the scenes and events just wash by you like turds in a river. it is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film. the narrative flicks between characters in a seemingly random manner breaking up the pathetic attempts at building the characters. oh and what "characters" they are. the protagonist played by rourke is dreadful. he could have just sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed. after 60 or so minutes of the film i had built absolutely zero attachment to this character. he is neither sympathetic nor hateful. just a disfigured dummy from a shop window blundering through every single scene. his motivation is impossible to discern from his generally mumbled and emotionless delivery. is he happy? is he sad? angry? no idea. just those same dead eyes staring out at you from a disfigured chunk of flesh. and the native american theme is just awful and pointless.<br /><br />the good guys are at best unlikeable. a dull white collar stereotype and a simpering neurotic ex-wife stereotype. cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy, "you aren't going to shoot me" that is both tiresomely unoriginal and annoying.<br /><br />the richie nix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating one sided psycho character. which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guys in some way sympathetic or at least realistically motivated.<br /><br />roasario dawsons character starts with some promise but soon descends into a sickening and childlike parody of the gangsters chick scenes from jackie brown. you really want me to believe her character was so attracted to rourke's? or worse she is just a floozy who sleeps with anything that moves? realistic female characters ftw! <br /><br />in summary a complete mess of a film. hopeless characterisations and performances. a leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction. and ultimately extremely dull. its not even comedy bad either. laughing at rourkes haggard face gets pretty old after sitting through the first 15 turgid minutes of the film.
