the title pretty much lets you know what you're getting. it's a grade-c howler but not as blatantly funny as i was hoping. directed by exploitation film specialist eddie romero from a story that originally came from jonathan demme (long before directing "silence of the lambs" and "philadelphia"), this low-budget 1972 action movie was obviously filmed in the philippines but set in some anonymous third world country. playing hooker and small-time drug dealer lee daniels, blaxploitation superstar pam grier plays the first half of the title role, while long-forgotten margaret markov is the other half, karen brent, an unlikely patty hearst-like political revolutionary looking to partner with her comrades to overthrow the oppressive local government. naturally antagonistic toward each other, they are in a women's prison camp where they wear inexplicably bright yellow mini-skirts as uniforms. run by a closeted warden and lecherous matron, the prison is just an excuse for a lengthy shower scene and some half-hearted cat-fighting as lee and karen are pitted against each other. of course, they escape but shackled together a la "the defiant ones" and continue the cat-fighting until they attack a couple of nuns to steal their habits.<br /><br />meanwhile, various groups of unsavory men are in pursuit - the loutish drug lord looking for lee who stole $40k from him, the rather passive revolutionaries looking for karen, and the incompetent police (who suffer the humiliation of exposing their privates to the drug lord). needless to say, everything eventually comes to a head but not before gratuitous nudity by a number of filipino women, a dog wears karen's panties and some of the worst of 1970's men's fashion (one beer-bellied revolutionary wears a leather halter top with a straight face). there is a rather sad ending, but what's truly sad is how much of the potential black comedy is missed entirely in this hilariously preposterous exercise. sadly, grier is disappointing in this outing because her character is not allowed much to do beyond dealing with all the "jive", while markov is an amazonian blonde whom i am convinced is trying desperately to be credible. since no one displays any talent for acting, the rest of the cast is not worth noting, except balding, bug-eyed sid haig, who uses his standard psycho persona as the drug lord. the 2003 dvd contains only the original trailer as an extra.
