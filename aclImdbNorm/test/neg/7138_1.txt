what a horrible movie. this movie was so out of order and so hard to follow.it was so hard to follow and was just confusing. the whole time i was watching it i was wishing it would end!!i felt like i wasted 2hours of my life that i will never get back. save your money and don't rent this movie. i now see why sarah michelle gellar was barely in the movie. the first movie was great but this was just sucked. i would never recommend this movie to anyone. save your money and watch the trailer because that is about the only thing that is worth seeing with this movie. this movie had no real story to it either. i am still wondering what i watched.
