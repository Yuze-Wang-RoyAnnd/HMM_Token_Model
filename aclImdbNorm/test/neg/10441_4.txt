the recent release of "mad dog morgan" on troma dvd is disappointing.this appears to be a censored print for television viewing. some of the more violent scenes have been edited and portions of the colorful language have been removed. anyone who viewed the film uncut will be mad as hell at this toxic dvd version. "mad dog morgan" deserves to be released on dvd in the original theatrical cut. however, even as released on dvd, the film is still one of the better depictions of bushranger life in nineteenth century australia. after having toured the old melbourne gaol, with death masks of convicts on display, it is "mad dog morgan" that comes to mind.
