a tedious gangster film that leaves you wishing someone had edited it farce more ruthlessly. i would have thought that the story of the creation of las vegas would prove interesting but it fails at almost every turn. warren beatty's performance as the stupid and unlikeable bugsy seigel leaves you wishing you were watching someone else. once or twice he flashes through the fog of his performance to deliver an interesting scene but most of the time you just can't care about him. annette benning gives a skilled turn as his untrustworthy lover but even she's only faintly more savoury than he is.<br /><br />i really wouldn't bother with this turgid drama unless you're a benning devotee.
