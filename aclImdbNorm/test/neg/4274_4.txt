this movie is about a young girl who goes to live with her rich cousins falls in love with one of her cousin, and reject the advance of a amoral suitor who brings trouble on the family. after seeing the 1999 version and reading the book, i decided to watch the older version. i found it did stay true to fanny character in the book, but it was also boring character. fanny character played by sylvestra le touzel was lackluster; she often appeared to be about to faint. i also did not like robert bourbage who played henry crawford. i could not imagine him being interested in fanny or her cousin maria. jackie smith wood who played mary crawford was okay but the wig she wore was so ugly. i lost interested in her acting and i kept staring at her wig. i kept expecting it would drop off her head. i could also see a slip of her real hair under the wig.
