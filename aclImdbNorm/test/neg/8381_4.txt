cult starts 20 years ago on the 'quinling mountain range, southern china' as a guy called owen quinlin (robert berson) finds an ancient amulet said to have magical powers, cut to california where quinlin has set up a cult & the members are about to sacrifice themselves when one of them (cazzy golomb) foils his evil scheme... jump forward to the present day as five college students, mindy (rachel miner), cassandra (taryn manning), bailey (glenn dunk), alex (joel michaely) & morgan (victoria venegas) are researching the events of twenty years ago that have become know as the 'quinling massacre' for a school project. unfortunately morgan decides to kill herself which unleashes the evil spirit of owen quinlin for reasons that are rather tenuous, he sets about completing what he started all those years ago by claiming souls so he can finally inherit the magical powers of the amulet for his own evil use...<br /><br />edited, co-produced & directed by joe knee this is not a good film & that's being kind to it. the script by benjamin oren which seems to take itself very seriously is a dour supernatural tale about a cult leader who comes back from the dead to finish what he started a few years prior, as you would expect the character's involved now have links to what happened all those years ago & it's as dull as it sounds. the character's are bland & forgettable, the dialogue just as much so, there's no proper horror or exploitation in it, it's slow going at times, it's predictable, it's clich'ed, it goes completely off the rails at the end & doesn't make much sense when you think about it. the story never grips or engages you, it's never exciting or particularly interesting & i'd struggle to even call it average. there is very little here by which i could recommend cult, don't bother with this one.<br /><br />director knee does alright but the film has that bland shot-on-video made-for-tv look about it, it's utterly forgettable & flat stuff throughout. there's no scares, there's no atmosphere & it lacks any tension. there is no gore either, sure there's a fair amount of blood splatter but no proper actual special make-up effect gore scenes.<br /><br />with a supposed budget of about $950,000 cult looks cheap although it's not as badly made as some low budget horror films i've seen recently. the acting isn't even worth mentioning.<br /><br />cult is a poor film that didn't do anything for me, i'd struggle to call this average. there are much better horror films out there.
