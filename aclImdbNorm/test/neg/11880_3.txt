what a stupid waste of money! 30,000 square feet of rebuilt ancient rome, 2 millions cubic meters of 50 feet tall buildings, 10,000 costumes, 2 years of works, an international ancient history committee (sic!), some first class actors and actresses . the final result? an empty tv-movie for a single-digit iq attendance.
