bad, bad, movie, so bad it is worth watching. as long as you watch this movie knowing that it is bad and you'll be spending 2 hours of your time watching a bad movie, it's worth it. the special effects are cheesy and the animals look fake and the acting is bad, but watching the faces of the actors as they try to look frightened is just very funny. if your sister is about to be eaten by a giant komodo dragon wouldn't you do a little something to try and save her? if she did get eaten wouldn't you fall on your knees crying your heart out? this guy just sat in a chair and ran his fingers through his hair. how anti-climatic is that? maybe he was supposed to be in shock or something. he does join his sister in the komodo's belly - oh didn't mean to spoil it for you.
