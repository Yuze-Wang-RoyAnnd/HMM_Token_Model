a real let down, the novel is such a brilliant stomach churning journey into madness but this made for tv movie style nonsense is turgid and painfully slow. stick to mike hammer. i find it hard to believe that no body has made a brilliant version of this book, kubrick gushes over it on the cover, he should have taken over the reins on this one. stacey keach is too soppy as lou ford, and the whole thing has the same production values as that seventies tv spin off, of planet of the apes. i thoroughly recommend that you go out and buy lots of jim thompson novels though, actually the grifters isn't done too badly, thats one of his, starring jon cusak.
