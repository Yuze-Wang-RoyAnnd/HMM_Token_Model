yes, absolutely dreadful, and this coming from someone who loves bad movies - but there's a limit. i enjoy all sorts of horror/suspense films, and have seen some wonderful work from european film makers. broceliande is sadly not among those those wonderful pieces of film-making. the camera work is worse than amateurish. not the fashionable, shaky mtv "cameraman needs ritalin" type of camera work so many film-makers use to camouflage their lack of talent. this is simply bad frame composition and terrible image composition. the acting is farcical when it is not entirely two-dimensional. the dialogues are stilted and unnatural - even more so than your usual run-of-the-mill horror/suspense film delving into pseudo-mysticism. i think that what put me off the most was the horribly choreographed fight scenes at the end of the film. these were bad to the point of being ludicrous. i've seen what a small budget can do, and it can do wonders. this was just bad film-making. very, very sad.
