this is a really really bad movie. that may seem like an oversimplification. a fickle, childish retort comparable to a petty unsubstantiated insult. the truth is, there is not enough i can say about the confusing senseless plot, the really atrocious acting (i'm talking nasty here folks), or the random images of violence toward women that make up the chaotic pastiche of radically horrendous film-making mistakes that propel this affront to all that is good and decent in the world of cinema, nay, human culture. please, take my word for it, don't watch it... ever. i'm serious. stop. you'll thank me for it later.
