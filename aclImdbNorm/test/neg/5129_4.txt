spoilers, beware!!! flashdance is a fair movie, in my opinion. some things do confuse me about it (e.g. jeanie asks alex how long it took for her to get so good at dancing; alex replies "about 25 years," isn't alex supposed to be 18?) and some things do fascinate me about it (i loved the spins!). overall, though, it intrigued me. when this movie was made, i wasn't even born. i didn't really experience the eighties (i was born in '85) and i have to wonder: sometimes alex would just run in place a bit, or throw herself all over, not really dancing, just banging in to things, tossing her head back, and waving her arms-was this considered "dancing" back then? if it was, i'm not sure i could've standed it. the spins, the flip, the fluid movements were great, but some of it-my neighbor's toddler could've done better! also, if alex is a welder during the day, wouldn't she be tired after a hard day's work? when she doesn't go to work for nearly a week, wouldn't she be laid off? living in a warehouse-i can almost see it, but not quite. it doesn't seem right that she's a welder, owns a warehouse house, and is trying to get into ballet. none of it really makes sense. i shouldn't be too judgemental considering my own background, but please. maybe jennifer beals is too feminine for me to see her as a welder, i don't know. but either way, they could've picked a better actress. the actors were fine. i even liked the romance. you make your own decision. but mine is-rent it once, don't see it again-it isn't worth it.
