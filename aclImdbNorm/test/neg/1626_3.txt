this movie has some of the worst production values and editing i've ever seen. there are several instances of actors pausing while trying to remember their lines, actors walking in front of actors who are talking, and one point where the film skips about seven frames. not to mention the heroine getting shot in the chest, yet she starts limping! oh, and what about the secret passageway that is well lit and right out in the open. awful.<br /><br />the plot is non-existant, something to do with a primitive nuclear bomb and going to the ends of the earth and some kind of caveman war. ator pulls out a hang-glider at one point in the film's dumbest moment. the dialogue is stupid, containing such gems as "it is everything and nothing." and "i can feel it, here."<br /><br />the movie is a mess, a confusing, insipid mess. ator is a bland hero, the sword fights are absurd, and the plot plods along slowly. all in all, this is a movie to avoid.
