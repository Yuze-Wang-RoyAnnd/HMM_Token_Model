this story had the potential of a good film. the difficult choice of love versus money and the angst and regret of making the wrong one. however the movie was ruined by the horrible miscasting of robert redford as the villain who offers $1,000,000 to sleep with demi moore. like redford has to pay for it. redford's boyish good looks and all american charm just don't cut it as an unlikeable, threatening, boor. redford's acting skillls are insufficient to make his character menacing. i can see it now, $1,000,000 to sleep with robert redford. ok says the lady but you will have to give me some time to raise the money. jack nicholson would have been perfect as the sleazeball.
