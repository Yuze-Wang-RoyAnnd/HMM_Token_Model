there are a lot of 'bad' films out there. tune in to channel 5 every night of the week and you might just be treated to a daily, shocking effort from one filmmaker or another. there are possibly films that have caused me more pain - were harder to sit through - than this, but in terms of writing, acting, direction, cinematography and the bare basics of cinema inbetweeners is a truly, truly appalling effort and should be avoided at all costs. the only laugh it gave me was in the behind the scenes documentary on the dvd, in which the film's geeky director darren fisher explains how it was his script that attracted the 'talent' to the project! never underestimate the power of self-delusion.<br /><br />darren fisher - britain's answer to edward d. wood jr.!
