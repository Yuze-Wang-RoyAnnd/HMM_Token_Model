what a terrible movie! the acting in this film is about the quality of a high school play, or a story driven pornography film. this is not pornography in this film, but there sure is a lot of gratuitous nudity! this is one of the only redeeming qualities of the film, one of the only things that saved it from receiving a rating on one star. also there are a million cops that die in this film. hardly offensive though since the violence is so unrealistic we can only laugh. but breasts pop out and become exposed in the most surprising and hilarious times, if you enjoy really really bad movies check this one out. this is a bonnie and clyde type story, where a mother and her two daughters are out for revenge. this film also features a sex scene with two of the oldest people i have ever seen rolling around naked!
