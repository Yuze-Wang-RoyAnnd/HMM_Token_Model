****contains spoilers****<br /><br />as a fan of rachael leigh cook, i watched for this show to finally come on so that i could see it. i taped it so i could watch it several times, and there is something about this show that really bothers me!<br /><br />i recognize that this was a made-for-tv movie. not only that, but it was made for lifetime, which is a channel that i despise. because it was made for tv, i can ignore the huge plot holes. i can ignore the massive lack of character development in ally sheedy's character. i can overlook the fact that george c. scott and rachael leigh cook, both of whom are very talented actors, were definately not reaching the best of their abilities. i can look past the fact that don diamont's character was so cliche'd, that you knew when you saw him he was the villain. i can even pass over the obvious mistake in the timeline (she's raped during her winter break, and then over a year later she has the baby from it.)<br /><br />the major thing that i can't get over is this: there are two trials for the custody of the child. in the first trial, custody is awarded to the child's father because he is "better educated, has a degree from a community college, and has a full time job." in the second trial the judgement is reversed because the judge feels that there is lack of evidence that emma (rlc's character)is an unfit mother, and custody shouldn't be taken from the primary caretaker and given to someone with no previous interaction with the child.<br /><br />the problem is this: nowhere during the course of these trials is the fact that a thirtysomthing year old man raped a 15 year old girl and got her pregnant taken into consideration! whether it was a rape or not, he had sex with a minor! wouldn't that be taken into consideration when the judge is choosing him for custody because he's a "mature adult?" mature adults don't have sex with minors! <br /><br />it's not the worst cable movie that you would ever see, but it's not a great show either. ** out of ****
