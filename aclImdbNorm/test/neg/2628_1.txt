milo is a complete rip off of the 1992 slasher flick mikey, if you actually check it up both films have the same tagline!but if you want to watch an incredibly funny film with absolutely no plot whatsoever......well then this is the film for you.the acting is terrible and the flashback scenes are overwhelmingly confusing. the story behind this atrocity is simple milo jeeder is a kid with serious family problems,his father is an abortion doctor who keeps unborn feoutus's in a jar (nice!) and was desperate for a child of his own, he figured out a way to bring one of these aborted children to life and he named him............. milo!!!!!<br /><br />aside from all the bad acting,terrible directing,annoying sound of milo's voice and the ear piercing sound of the bell on his bike ,if you take away all that badness its still a bad but funny attempt at a film.<br /><br />i'll give it a bank busting 1 out of 10
