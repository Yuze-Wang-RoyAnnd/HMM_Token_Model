bad. bad. bad. those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema. and its... #1 movie in america! what is this country thinking? mike myers looking more like micheal jackson. some chineese lady that falls asleep within 3 minutes. a lame plot with dirty jokes. it's grotesuque and awful. when green-eggs and ham comes out in 2005 i'll be so happy! (not) eddie murphy and tracy morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost green-eggs and ham. they'll try to chase sam-i-am and that mean guy who are running away with it. (i hope they don't ruin the classic book.) don't waste time and money by seeing this.
