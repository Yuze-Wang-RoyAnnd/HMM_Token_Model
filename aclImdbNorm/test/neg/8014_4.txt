i saw this hallmark television movie when it originally aired. i lost interest in the story because a character was said to be a witch. i just was not in the right frame of mind to watch this film. but hallmark stands for the best, quality films. now, there is a reason to give this film a second look. clive owen who plays "damon wildeve" just might have a chance to be selected as the next james bond 007 when pierce brosnan passes it on. clive owen might have to wait until the year 2008. the other reason is the female lead is catherine zeta-jones is now a celebrity (she was an unknown at the time) and became an academy award winner for outstanding supporting actress in 2003. joan plowright as "mrs. yeobright" is also in this film. i like the opening line in this film: "deliver my heart from this fearful, lonely place. send me a great love from somewhere or else i shall die, truly i shall die."
