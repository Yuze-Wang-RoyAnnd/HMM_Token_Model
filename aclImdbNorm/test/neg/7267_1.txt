honest to god, the outline pretty much says it all. the planet andromina (not to be confused with aunt jemima) is represented by a cheap l.a. stripclub. there's no strippers, so the most recent male visitors go off to recruit strippers.<br /><br />the men get mistaken for kings or arrested for spying on women (although despite the fact its a planet of women we only get two women who participate in any girl-girl sex scenes), and eventually, as always happen in science fiction cliche movies everywhere, the women become convinced that men are good for something. well, not the men who made this movie, at any rate!<br /><br />but boy, do we get to see a lot of that something, in prodigious amounts of softcore sex and nudity. this one has less plot then usual for such flicks, so change the channel if you don't like this kind of movie, and grit your teeth if you're into this kind of thing.
