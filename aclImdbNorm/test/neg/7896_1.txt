the movie starts off relatively well and seems to be getting somewhere when an african american passenger sues an airline for negligence. there is one scene in which his pet dog gets sucked into the engine and thats really a sad thing. but the way it is portrayed makes it difficult for one to figure out if that was an attempt at crude humor or really a tragedy to reflect on the extent of negligence? after this point, they clearly ran out of ideas. if you stuck around long enough, you will soon be treated with one of the worst movies ever made. it is basically a highly racist sequence of smoking dope, toilet humor, styling of each and every segment of the aircraft to reflect african american pop culture and pretty much nothing else. you'd think that the only 3 white passengers onboard would lead to some hilarious consequences but nothing of the same happens. they were basically just added to show how badly they could initially be treated and later be accepted into the hood if they behaved. avoid.
