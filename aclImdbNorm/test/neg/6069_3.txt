i am a music lover and was excited to see this movie. unfortunately, i was disappointed. i was ready to walk out half way through the movie. i didn't identify with any of the characters, which meant that i didn't care what happened to them and lost interest in the story completely. on the good side, ed harris looked exactly like beethoven, and the 9th symphony is always a pleasure to hear, so that made part of the film bearable. also the parts where they talk about the bridge almost redeemed the entire movie, but it couldn't sustain me through to the end. the actors did what they could with what they had to work with, but the screenplay just wasn't adequate to make it even remotely interesting. the bit about "wash me" was utter rubbish. i wonder how many takes the actors had to do on that one (i wouldn't be able to say those lines without bursting into laughter.) anyway, such a shame, it could have been so much better.
