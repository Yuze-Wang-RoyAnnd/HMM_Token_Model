this is the story of a news investigator who hates his job - which prove why actors - even as weak as tom cruise and denzel washington - are on the big screen and your neighbors are not!<br /><br />i'll say this though - the better moments show some basis for being really funny (not just wacky), to keep trying, maybe taking some classes, and using the time to keep learning how to make a good movie. ("dude, where's my car" and the "scary movie" sequence have it all over this ... college attempt.)<br /><br />the lighting wasn't; the production wasn't; and the script had moments (the conversation from space - very nice try unconvincingly executed). (this reminded me of "dark star" - which is about being "lost in space" - but this movie is just lost.)<br /><br />the talent was the bartender (he said 'dog' so annoyingly that i knew he had to be acting... wasn't he? ... now that's acting!), the mark hammond guy, and marty. i guess i gave the movie a point for each one of them... 3/10.<br /><br />-ld<br /><br />______________________________________________<br /><br />my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
