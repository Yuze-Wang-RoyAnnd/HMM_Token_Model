i rented this movie from my local library and thought it might be good considering i like this type of movie and considering who was in it but boy was i wrong. the acting stunk, the fight scenes were just as bad and they got a couple of known people to be in it but didn't cast anyone with acting ability to play the lead? i noticed some people gave it a 10. why would you ever consider giving this pile of horse **** a 10. you can say it's worth a 10 for the sheer comedy of it but when you vote on a movie that's not supposed to be a comedy you can't give it a 10 for comedy. you have to rate it on what it was supposed to actually be like and not for something the director wasn't intending. maybe some of you voted 10 cause you thought it would be funny to have this crappy movie have a high rating so that people would go out and rent or buy it cause you think it's fun to mislead people. you're playing with peoples time and money which you have no right to do. if the movie sucked give it a bad rating if it was good give it a good rating but don't lie. i gave this movie a 4 and am glad that i was able to check this out for free from my library cause this movie sucked and really isn't worth paying a cent to see.
