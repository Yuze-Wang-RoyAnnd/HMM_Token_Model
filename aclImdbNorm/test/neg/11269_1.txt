"yagyu ichizoku no inbo" (let's just say "the shogun's samurai") is somewhere between horrifically boring and mind-bogglingly painful to watch. as an historical epic, it could have had so many more chances to be a rich saga... but it's really no more than just another cheap '70s action flick with a based-on-real-events story and an eyepatch-sporting sonny chiba. before this movie's halfway point, i was even tempted to commit seppuku! the music is like a thousand dogs in heat wailing in your ears to a tune composed by ennio morricone (that's not an insult towards morricone). the use of zoom lens cinematography is more nauseating than fascinating. and in terms of action, it's really nothing more than a series of brutal attacks and oh-no-they-didn't shocks. what a terrible movie.
