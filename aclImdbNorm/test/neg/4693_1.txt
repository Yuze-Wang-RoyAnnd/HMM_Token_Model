first, ifc runs town and country, and now this. the difference between that stinker and this pink panther rip-off is that town and country was watchable. this isn't.<br /><br />i can only surmise that the cast signed up for this so they could goof off in europe on somebody else's dime. belushi is especially irritating. his scene with candy (doing a z-grade dom deluise) was torture. speaking of torture, five minutes of the talentless shepherd, and i bet the prisoners at gitmo would crack like walnuts!<br /><br />the real "crime" (besides this being green-lighted) is shepherd's character: a mousy wife who takes a monte carlo casino for a half-million bucks! if you buy that, i have some oceanfront property in arizona you might be interested in!
