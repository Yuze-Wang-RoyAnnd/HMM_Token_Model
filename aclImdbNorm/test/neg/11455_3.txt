cimarron was painful to sit through. although irene dunn does a good job with the heavy-handed script, richard dix' pompous and overacted role is brutal. the passage of time has not treated the character of isaiah, as well as other racial and religious notions, well, although the movie is somewhat progressive on the roles of women and the mistreatment of native americans. the editing is especially weak. this is, without a doubt, the worst of all the "best" pictures.
