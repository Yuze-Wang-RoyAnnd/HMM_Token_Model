i rented this movie with my friend for a good laugh. we actually got laughed at by the clerk at the video store because of our questionable movie tastes. unfortunately, i don't remember the first half of the movie because all i did was stare at the giant metal braces jane wore. and i didn't hear anything either due to the incomprehensible lisp. the other thing that was able to grasp my attention besides her metal mouth was her questionable fashion sense. this movie was made in 2005 but it seems like the wardrobe people jumped all the way back to 2000 for the clothes. if you remember the days when aaron carter was considered a "popstar" and you like high waisted jeans, ankle socks and knee length skirts, then this little trip down memory lane is perfect for you.
