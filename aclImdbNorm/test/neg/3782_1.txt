this is a very bad movie. however, i read that it was made by a high-school teacher so maybe i should give it at least a tiny bit of praise for it's ambitious (yet awful) special effects. here is the plot: a monster emerges from a pile of trash and pollution in the town of milpitas, california and embarks on a destructive rampage. i'm about to spoil the "big surprise" about what the monster looks like, so please read the rest of this at your own risk. you have been warned! the monster looks sort of like a giant, two-legged fly wearing a gas mask. in some scenes, the monster is an actor wearing a costume. in other scenes, the monster is created by stop-motion animation. the acting is terrible. the dialogue is terrible. the special effects are terrible. the plot is predictable. stay away!
