this episode was boring and was not even in the realm of horror, so far this season masters of horror has produced one really good episode...the damned thing...it is still early, i have faith that the episodes will get better. i admit that the vampire episode was okay but lacked a solid storyline. the episode about the couple catching the serial killer started out boring, but the last fifteen minutes was really good. though, i am just plain out disappointed with the lack of originality and horror that the first season's episodes possessed. please, save this season john carpenter! i have faith that pro-life will redeem the entire lackluster season so far.<br /><br />"you're an angry little elf!"
