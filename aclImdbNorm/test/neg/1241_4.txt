this show is like watching someone who is in training to someday host a show. there are some good comedy ideas and tons of mediocre ones. it doesn't look like the writers know the difference between what's funny and what's just weird or gross.<br /><br />it has its moments. when spike hosed down a neighbor who had been letting her dog soil his lawn repeatedly, it hit it's peak. but the hilarious moments are too few, and there's too many experimental comedy bits that miss the mark.<br /><br />the show's better than, say, watching a test pattern or the qvc network, but it needs some better writers.<br /><br />reading the glowingly positive imdb comments on this show, i am convinced that most of them were written by show staffers and by relatives and personal friends of spike.<br /><br />it just isn't very good most of the time.
