this film should never have been made! it stinks, it's awful, it's no good, it's bad, it's terrible. starting to see a pattern here? jackie mason is certainly no rodney dangerfield. gone were ted knight and bill murray, who, along with dangerfield, were essential to the first film. it seems that the three of them (the stars) all knew a stinker of a script when they saw one. the one who didn't have the good sense to bow out of this was chevy chase, who stuck around but was extraneous to both films in my opinion. this film is quite simply not funny. nor does it have any other endearing qualities. this thing relies heavily on anti-semitism to work and it works to it's detriment. i hated this thing. a waste of everybody's time.
