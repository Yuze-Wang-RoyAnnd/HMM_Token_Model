this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. the highlight of the movie is a comparison between the smell of natural gas and a dirty vagina. <br /><br />the acting is pathetic. i know acting is hard work and stuff, but that's why it should be left to real actors. watching these people act is like watching michael j. fox perform brain surgery. it's shaky at best. <br /><br />one of the other comments would have you believe that the movie is saved by the acting talents of dan gordon as chris. only dan himself or maybe his mother could believe that was good acting. <br /><br />the special effects in this movie were terrible. the worst special effects were for the gas explosion in the lighthouse. it looked like someone was shining an orange light up from the bottom of a model constructed from a refrigerator box. sure there was a little bit of computer animation layered over top, but it didn't help. i suspect that the special effects on this movie were created and rendered using a single amiga computer from the late 80s.
