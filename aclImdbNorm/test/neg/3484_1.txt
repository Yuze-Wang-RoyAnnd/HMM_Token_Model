one of the worse surfing movies i've ever seen. this movie is so bad i don't know where to begin-- okay, let's start with the premise - some dude from the mainland who barely knows how to surf travels to hawaii and enters a big wave contest which he more or less expects to win. a good analogy for those who don't surf would be a that of a grossly overweight chain smoker slapping on a pairs of running shoes and entering the la marathon with expectations of winning. no way! and, the contest is held on the north shore which conjures up images of 15+ foot waves, but contest day the waves are maybe 6 foot. the acting? what acting? if you must see this woof see it on tv, don't waste your money renting it. if you want to see a pretty good surfing movie - granted it is flawed, but that's another story - rent big wednesday.
