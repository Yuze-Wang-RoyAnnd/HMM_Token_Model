my suggestion..... this movie was really intended to be a "comedy",wasn't it?!!!! if not, the producers, directors, actors & "hair stylists" should really choose another career! now, the guidelines of my submission requires a minimum of "10 lines". how in the world can i add any more to this? hmm...let me see. oh yes, the beginning of the movie was quite hilarious with the "crash landing" scene. too bad that the plane didn't hit the tanker truck & a bunch of "martians" would have scrambled out from the wreckage (obviously hiding) and decided to take over the "world" planet and make a better movie. now, that would have been a great beginning!<br /><br />t
