quite possibly one of the greatest wastes of celluloid of the past 100 years. not only does it suffer from a painfully (and enormously predictable) disjointed script, but it's clearly a carbon-copy of alien ii. within five minutes i had correctly predicted who would die and who wouldn't (and in which order). the special effects are laughable; there is a scene where one crew member is mauled (unconvincingly) by two krites that look like a pair of teddy-bears, and the sparse humor is misplaced and dire. there are better things to do with a vcr remote than use it to watch this movie.
