once upon a time, way back in the 1940's, there lived an actress named veronica lake. a beautiful, talented young woman who was once in high demand for many big-budget, hollywood pictures. fast forward to the late 1960's, age, alcoholism, and all-around bad luck has tarnished everyones favorite actress. now a hasbeen, miss lake decides the time has come to follow in the foot steps of her peers(?), joan crawford, and bette davis, and fall back on good ol' reliable horror. but flesh feast? really? she couldn't have possibly been that washed up. to put it delicately, flesh feast is a lifeless pile garbage, possibly one of the top 5 worst films i've ever seen, and i've seen them all. lake plays a scientist, who is plotting, with nazi's, to bring hitler back to life, with youth restoration experiments involving maggots, that's right, maggots. unless you're a huge fan of heather hughes, run away and never look back!! <br /><br />i know very little about this veronica lake person, as well as 40's flicks, but to think that such a successful career actually became that dismal, is actually pretty sad. flesh feast is almost impossible to get through, and by almost, i mean absolutely. directed by brad grinter, director of nudist camp pictures, and the man who, coincidentally brought us the greatest b-movie ever made, blood freak, just a couple years later. one has to wonder, is this what blood freak would have been like if grinter hadn't co-directed with steve hawkes? if so, then god bless steve hawkes. you wouldn't think that a religious, dope-blood craving, turkey monster could be that much better than experiments involving maggots and hitler, but it really, really is. so forget you ever heard of this one and go find blood freak, it's just waiting to entertain you. fast forward a couple years later, veronica lake dies of hepititas, broke, and forgotten. the end. i hate you, flesh feast. 1/10
