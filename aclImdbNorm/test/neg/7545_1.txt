the unthinkable has happened. having first witnessed it a few years ago, i have had a film that has been my benchmark for awfulness and that film was called "mccinsey's island". a family adventure movie with hulk hogan and grace jones (i'm not making this up), it plunged to new depths of movie making and is still the only film i've seen that made me wonder what else the film's budget could have been spent on. like new schools or cancer-treating drugs. however, for sheer and unadulterated levels of crap, any film will be having to lower their standards even lower if they wish to trump "guest house paradiso" to the distinction of being one of the very worst movies i've ever had to watch.<br /><br />based loosely around the puerile but amusing tv show "bottom", this film introduces us to two of the biggest losers imaginable. richard (rik mayall) is a hotel manager, as unfriendly as anyone you can imagine and so twistedly lecherous as to almost ooze slime from every action. his buddy eddie (director adrian edmondson) is an alcoholic waste of human life and together, they try to run britain's worst hotel situated upon a cliff-top next to a nuclear power station. between them, they indulge in cartoony violence (with sound effects) at regular intervals, steal anything remotely valuable or interesting from the fools who stay there and stare longingly at any woman at all. the plot, such as it is, involves the arrival of fabled italian screen goddess gina carbonara (vincent cassel) who is fleeing from her wedding and attempts to lay low at the guest house paradiso, much to the astonishment of richie and eddie. and... that's it.<br /><br />i used to think that the carry on films represented everything bad about the uk film industry and god knows, we've spent so much time and money trying to escape that god awful legacy. we've had films like "trainspotting", "28 days later", "four weddings and a funeral" and the brilliant "shaun of the dead" (also starring simon pegg) but this... this drags those films screaming and kicking back to the days of sid james and barbara windsor's top flying off with the aid of a bicycle whistle. "guest house paradiso" is so low in its ambition that it insults you the minute you watch it. i kept watching, waiting in anticipation for the jokes to start but they never came. just an endless stream of trapped knob gags, unimaginative scenarios that defy explanation, slightly amusing violence with frying pans and fridge doors and almost nothing raising so much as a smirk. come the first ad break (it was on tv, you see) and i was ready to switch off but my loyal duties to you, my readers, kept me going. "i'm watching this so they don't have to" became my mantra so you guys better remember how much you owe me for this because this was about as much fun as having sand kicking into my eyes and being force-fed dog food.<br /><br />trust me, i used to love the "bottom" tv show. the combination of suitably grubby acting from mayall and edmondson with ott juvenile humour worked... for half an hour every week. certainly not for an hour and a half, as edmondson and mayall indulge themselves in their little private joke and bore and depress the rest of the audience. honestly, this makes mayall's "drop dead fred" seem like "the godfather" and should you happen to meet either of these two people (who are pretty much solely responsible for the chaos on screen pretending to be a movie), feel free to swiftly deliver a boot to their testicle region. they'd probably enjoy it. pegg and bill nighy (both as guests at the hotel) are dragged down with this sinking ship but at least they survived. mayall and edmondson should not be so lucky. the movie equivalent of chernobyl and should be avoided as such.
