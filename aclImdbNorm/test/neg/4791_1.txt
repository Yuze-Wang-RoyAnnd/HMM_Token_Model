have you seen all the big adventures of last few decades? if you have don't bother with this one as you've already seen most of the scenes already - and i can guarantee that those scenes were originally in much better movies.<br /><br />the story (i'm sure that true storytellers will never forgive me) is childish and stupid (stupid in a way that making it play in a mortuary would result in a bunch of angry walking dead). every character is based in a clich'e and... well, they're nothing but the clich'e. and yes, again all you need to be a hero is to be american.<br /><br />at least in finland they advertised this to be the kind of movie the dvd was made for. maybe i should sell my player then...<br /><br />1/10
