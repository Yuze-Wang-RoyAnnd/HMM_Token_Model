the makers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief, you grant them it in the hope that given a little time they'll convince you it's possible. alas, with tv movies it seems as though they specifically set out to make cheap cosmo questionnaire films. with a small budget and big claims you should spend every penny on the details to convince the audience. not here though. the film gets a few points for the good performance the two leading ladies give against the odds, but unfortunately it's not enough to save the day. oh, and the less said about the ending the better. happy film-viewing everyone !
