corey haim plays a kid who teams up with a dog to take out a giant troll and osa hit-man (michael ironside) with a 30/30 and homemade bombs (which plays plausible considering haim) oh and he also protects his mother and girlfriend as well in this watchable yet disappointing adaption of a decent story. corey haim is terrible, of course but the movie's sheer momentum as well as ironside's imposing presence make this at least a modestly effective film. still the plot is ridiculous and it would've been nicer if we could've seen a monster or at least more gore. at least it's something different. also it's fairly likely that this film will be the last teen movie for awhile to show a teenager making pipe bombs.<br /><br />matt bronson 2/5
