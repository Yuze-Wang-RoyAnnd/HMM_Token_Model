"direct-to-video" is a phrase that never sounds promising to the consumer unless its a direct-to-video sequel to something that went direct-to-video in the first place. despite this, studios have insisted on releasing numerous direct-to-video sequels over the years to cult hits. i don't think it even needs to be mentioned that these sequels rank among some of the worst titles of all time, including the hitcher ii, starship troopers 2, and cruel intentions 3. it's fitting that road house 2 was helmed by scott ziehl as he was also the man in charge of ruining the cruel intentions series. like his entry in the cruel intentions trilogy, ziehl takes elements that made the first road house a great guy flick, and rehashes them with no success whatsoever. this is no sequel, this is a remake all the way. various lines from the original are repeated, plot points cut and pasted, and scenes are replicated almost shot-for-shot from the first one. the one thing that could not be duplicated were the amazing fight scenes, which made road house what it was. here, we get clumsily directed fight sequences that are either too short or too long and seemingly planned out and shot within an hour. compare that with its predecessor's fight scenes that look like they took months and months to prepare. ziehl is capable of directing action as he did well with the 2001 remake of earth vs. the spider, but none of the talent shown there comes through in this mess. it's not completely his fault, as the screenplay is very, very poorly written and clunky. i don't care if something goes direct-to-video, a good script is still required. someone should keep that mind while continuously churning these low-budget, direct-to-dvd movies out. skip it entirely. 1/10
