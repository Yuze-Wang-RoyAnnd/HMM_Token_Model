i used to think that "it came from hollywood" was the worst movie i had seen that showed clips from horror, sci-fi, crime and drama movies. of course, i hadn't seen this beauty yet.<br /><br />what's wrong with "terror in the aisles"? four things:<br /><br />1) it assumes that most of the great moments in shock cinema history began in the '70s when directors like john carpenter and brian de palma came along. and what bones are thrown to the true classics (i.e. - the black and white films) like "frankenstein", "dracula" and "the wolf man" are either shown with martin and lewis or abbott and costello alongside or not at all!<br /><br />2) the clips are most times so brief and out of their originals' place that they just give a momentary shock to the viewer and, for those unfamiliar with these films, will make no sense at all (indeed, the moment where the shark jumps out of the water at roy scheider in "jaws" is shown much to the effect of a sight gag. whereas, in the original's context, it had power.)<br /><br />3) did we really need pleasance and allen in the audience reminding us that "it's only a movie" or that most of the violence in the horror movies "is, sadly, against women"? so, is that an indictment against the movie-makers for adding those scenes or the movie-goers who tromp into the theaters and watch the same kind of fodder time and again? sorry, that's a whole can of worms to open for a more deserving movie.<br /><br />4) and most importantly, why is the movie so short? it isn't like there wasn't enough of these kinds of movies to use. if they had just opened up their resources and used every available film, they could have had a "that's entertainment!"-style movie that would have been comparatively more entertaining. heck, even drag out christopher lee and peter cushing (cushing was alive then, mind you) and better yet, even vincent price would have been more than willing, i'll bet! what a cheer that would have gotten from the audience!<br /><br />but no... all we're left with is a dreary little flick that pretends to pay homage to these movies but all it does is leave the viewer feeling cheated out of less than 90 minutes with which they could have went and watched a real movie. don't get me wrong; it was good to see what clips they did show, but if they could have just done more with the goods!<br /><br />two stars. another good idea left laying "in the aisles".
