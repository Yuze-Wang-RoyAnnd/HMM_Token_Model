got to confess right up front that i didn't watch this entire movie. i missed the first hour during a sci fi channel broadcast. or was i spared the first hour? the other reviewers sum this one up nicely. it was badly conceived. badly scripted. badly acted.<br /><br />but the worst thing for me was the adr. the entire film, which appeared to have been dubbed, sounded like it was done in somebody's garage. there was a voluminous echo to the words, which just served to make the bad dialog hang. and hang. and hang. even a made for tv movie should have recognized this.<br /><br />and the idea that alternate dimensions are differentiated by color saturation went out in the 80s, folks.
