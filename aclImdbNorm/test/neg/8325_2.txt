this is a documentary about homeless women. it was interesting in the sense that this focused on women who are engaged socially - having jobs and lasting friendships - but are in situations where they can not afford housing.<br /><br />i found some of the women covered to be interesting, but there was little focus or progression in the story. the direction and editing failed to maintain my attention. there were differences in the stories of these women, of course, but the message was essentially the same and could have been told by focusing on any one of them in more depth.<br /><br />i made it to the end of the movie, but it was a rather boring journey.
