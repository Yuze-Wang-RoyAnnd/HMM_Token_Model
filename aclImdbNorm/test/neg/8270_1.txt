ohhhh man this movie is awful!!<br /><br />this kind of tripe is what gives canadian cinema a bad name, or no name. well, to be fair, i guess most canadian movies give canadian cinema a bad name.<br /><br />next to the characters (there's a couple that are the most grating in movie history), the most annoying thing is the editing and pace of the movie. it's like a drunken snail making its way to die.<br /><br />thank goodness melanie doane is nice to look at. she's the only thing that kept me watching. unfortunately, the rest of the movie kept interrupting.<br /><br />good for a laugh, though, if you're having a bad canadian movie night, though.<br /><br />did i mention melanie doane? the only good point (too bad they didn't have the sense to keep the camera on her for more than a blink at a time).<br /><br />another addition in the canadian hall of stinking movies.
