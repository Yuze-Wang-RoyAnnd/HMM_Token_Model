well, it is a monogram quickie from the dreaded period of the '40s when poverty row studios put out a good many "horror" films that are almost unimaginably dull... so i was expecting the worst. <br /><br />the story concerns a doctor who has been working on a way to restore life to the dead through the use of a room full of non-utilitarian electrical devices which spark nicely. there is a dog's heart hanging under a bell jar and twitching fitfully, which we are informed is proof that his method is perfected.<br /><br />a brief discussion of the metaphysical implications and mention of an important plot point precede the inevitable death of a young man who is revived in a rather undramatic sequence - undramatic even with the sparks. the important plot point is that a convicted murderer is being executed just at midnight, which turns out to be exactly when the young man is revived. it is no surprise that the young man is very different after his experience; apparently amnesiac and with a strange desire to visit the haunts of the underworld and become acquainted with certain gangsters...<br /><br />it's hard to explain why this all is not completely unwatchable, but perhaps it suffices to say that it's mildly interesting and contains several murders and a couple of interesting characters. towards the end it even begins to move along with a bit of real tension and a confrontation that is downright hitchcockian. spoiler<br /><br />i have to warn of a very, very bad ending. a tagged on unnecessary, pain in the ass sorta ending. after the plot resolves rather effectively...<br /><br />you know the sort of thing... it's all a dream. never happened.
