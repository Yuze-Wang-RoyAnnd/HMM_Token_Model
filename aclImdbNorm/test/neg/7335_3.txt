the film starts out great, with a mock instruction film about the habits of swedish housewives. after that we get a detailed reconstruction of post-war scandinavia with lots of amazing cars, electronic equipment and interior design; a minimal jazz score, nice cinematography and stylish titling. also there's some funny scandinivian rivalry like in von triers 'riget'.<br /><br />sadly, after the set up, "kitchen stories" collapses like the twin towers on 9/11.actors who try to portray the emotion 'jealousy" by just staring in front of them. corny dialog filled with stale gay symbolism in the vain of: "i don't like white swans, i prefer bears and wolves... u ever tasted bear meat?" the music becomes cheesier than yann tiersen at his worst.<br /><br />it's a pity the director put all the effort in this great set-up, just to screw it up after-wards.
