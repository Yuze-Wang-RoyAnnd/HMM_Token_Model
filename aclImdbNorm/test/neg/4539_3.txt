anyone who sees this film will notice that the makers threw a lot of money at this film. it's interesting they titled it "the hole"! the production values are good for a short film. the hole tries to look big budget and does in some ways but is hampered by the video format it was shot on. i speculate if this was shot on 35mm it would look incredible and would elevate the content somewhat. many hollywood movies look good and that's enough for an audience regardless of story and content.<br /><br />my honest opinion, 3 out of 10 for this effort. maybe ishimoto's next film will deliver.
