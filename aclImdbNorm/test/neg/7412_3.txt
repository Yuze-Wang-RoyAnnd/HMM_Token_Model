well, i read the other comments. didn't think it sounded any good, but decided to tape it anyway. perhaps not so smart to read all the poor reviews before watching this movie, because of course i would be noticing all the same weird things. excessive use of fade to black, a few weird camera angles and crosscutting dialog for different conversations with the same people taking place at different times! but noticing all that i thought to myself: well, this would probably be really boring if it was all going chronologically. the conversations aren't that exciting, but kind of mandatory. and the constant fading to black after really short scenes really makes it feel like the story is fast forwarding too the interesting part. skipping the boring bits. at the end of the movie it gets a bit exciting too. will they survive? <br /><br />so i actually liked this movie? no, not really. the director had some interesting ideas on how to keep the audience from being bored while he is trying to introduce the characters. but he is overdoing it. it gets annoying, and sometimes confusing. this was apparently only the second movie he directed, so maybe he will learn and make really good stuff in the future. and if you're sitting there (in the future) reading this wondering if the now famous directors second movie is worth a watch. well, if he is good in the future, sure, watch this crap and wonder how he ever got to make a third one. otherwise this movie isn't really worth watching unless you very interested in film-making, and want to see one way you can cut the mandatory boring introductory scenes into something watchable.
