i love brian yuzna's other work, even cruder stuff like 'necronomicon', but 'progeny' was too much even for me. my chief complaint is that it's needlessly exploitative of jillian mcwhirter's nudity, i'm no prude but these nude scenes just drag on and on and on... only to culminate (virtually every time) in a tawdry *wink, nudge* insinuation of sexual violence. the scene where she attempts a coat hanger abortion after several minutes of naked screaming is a prime example. arnold vosloo's 'performance' is utterly turgid, but even jeffrey coombs couldn't save this festering heap of a film. the aliens are boring, the uniformly dull lighting saps your interest, and the plot is absolutely predictable. the only highlights for me were an all-too-brief glimpse of the aliens' true form (very nice model) and the scene where vosloo finds his wife in the closet was ok too. but you've been warned.
