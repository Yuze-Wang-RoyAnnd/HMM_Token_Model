skip all the subjective "this is a great film" reviews and read the imdb trailer or the back the kino videobox (which includes both versions of this flick) which i'll paraphrase: "to the tune of sci-fi score by george antheil, the camera goes on a sleepwalk through b-movie hell, all photographed by will thompson (who did 'plan 9 from outer space' & 'maniac')." you don't know whether to laugh at the film or with it. so if you like self-produced b or c-grade noir-wannabe actors and effects with pretensions of surrealism, this could be for you! otherwise, get a copy of "screamplay", a modern low-budget expressionist masterpiece.
