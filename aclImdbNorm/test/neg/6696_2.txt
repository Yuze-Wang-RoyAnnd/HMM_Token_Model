a poor basketball movie. a gruff coach with a dubious background comes to a small indiana high school basketball team in the 1950's and coaches the boys to victory by "breaking them down first, and then building them up."<br /><br />not a bad subject. photography ok. but the plot is totally predictable. no real sub-plots. nothing added to make the movie exciting. you know what is going to happen from the very beginning. suitable for 4th graders.
