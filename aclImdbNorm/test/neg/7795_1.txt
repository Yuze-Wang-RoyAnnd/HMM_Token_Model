"marathon" has a very interesting premise, excellent ambient sounds, and good scenery. unfortunately, the movie, aside from these aspects, falls flat on its face. for a woman trying to complete so many crossword puzzles in a day, she spends an awful lot of time standing around, sulking, and not doing puzzles. i believe there is more walking shown in the movie than her work on these puzzles. also, while i understand the point of showing so much scenery, there is simply far too much of it. the movie is incredibly boring and unfocused. it's not worth buying, renting, watching on television, or viewing in any conceivable way. i lost interest so quickly that i'm not sure why i sat through the entire film in the first place.
