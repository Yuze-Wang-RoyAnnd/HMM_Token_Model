everything about this show is terrible. its premise even sets itself up to get cheap laughs with bad writing. a "disfunctional family"-theme has already been used too many times, most notably by the simpsons, which is an excellent show with great writing and many laughs. meanwhile, family guy has about five minutes of story in each episode, with tons of celebrity jokes and random flashbacks thrown in. now, if this was original or funny, sure, i'd think it was clever. but no, it's not funny at all. in fact, the only reason the episodes are like this is because it is the easiest way to effortlessly crank out episode after episode of this junk. much of this show is unoriginal, and what is original is just lame. it is also amazingly crude and irreverent, which again can be fine if it's still intelligent. animation isn't everything either, but from an artistic point of view, this show fails also, proving yet again that family guy strives for as many cheap jokes and easy shortcuts as possible. people enjoy this show, and i don't really care, because people can enjoy anything they want, no matter how much it aims for the lowest common denominator. but no, i don't recommend this, especially for anyone who wants to someday study film or become a writer. this is cheap entertainment that aims low and has found success in this. the fact that this is so successful says bad things about america.
