a group of four young men, attending a prestigious private school, belong to an old covenant that was formed by their ancestors during the time of the witch hunts of the late 1600s. they each possess a power that ages them whenever they use it and they suspect that a new kid at the academy might be from a family that was thought to have perished long ago. this new guy wants everyone's power for himself.<br /><br />this not a horror movie as it tries to present itself as. yes, there is magic and all that supernatural stuff, but this is really just an action movie. a very mediocre action movie. focusing almost solely on being cool and slick and paying only minimal attention to the plot, which has plenty of sadly unused room for interesting twists. but none were put in and even before the movie is half over you'll know what is being played and by whom.<br /><br />there are a few good scenes here and there, most notably an exploding car that is magically reconstructed after colliding with a big rig, but that's about it. what's worse is that director renny harlin, who has some very entertaining if not smart movies to his credit, relies heavily on blasting metal music and overly sexy leads to carry that film and that makes it quite possibly the silliest "horror" movie since the disastrous "alone in the dark." it is not as bad as "alone in the dark" since the few slick scenes are actually slick and not ridiculously incompetent, but in the end, the highest this film can hope for is a nice and cozy home on late night cable. 3/10<br /><br />rated pg-13: violent action
