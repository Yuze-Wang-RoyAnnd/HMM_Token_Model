i felt i had to add a comment after seeing the breathless gushing of the other comment. i was taken to see this film as a child by my unknowing parents, expecting a normal norman wisdom jolly romp comedy. instead, what you get is this insipid british sex comedy of the worst kind where norman (norman!) plays a swinger aiming to get off with as many 'birds' as possible. absolutely typical of the genre - poorly filmed and acted, no semblance of a script beyond the worst kind of double-entendre, and very vague hints of 'naughtiness'. and all seemingly on that special grainy film stock that is reserved for 1960's-1970's british low budget films. about the only memorable thing is the annoyingly catchy theme tune, which still pops up in my brain after 30-odd years.<br /><br />finally, in the last scene you also get to see norman naked - running across the sand and looking frozen. i think so anyway- at that point my mother hauled me out of the cinema. i saw it again, many years later, and guess what, it was still dire.<br /><br />if you're any fan or take any interest in the little man and his career, you'll apply the '10-foot-bargepole' rule to this. believe me, you do not need to see norman wisdom's backside.
