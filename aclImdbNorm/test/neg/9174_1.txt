"first snow" has an intriguing beginning. a traveling salesman has his fortune told by an old man, who's predictions turn out to be amazingly correct. from this point on the movie plays out like a bloated "twilight zone" episode. i mean nothing but car trips, phone calls and paranoia. william fichtner gives his usual interesting performance, but guy pierce is anything but a sympathetic character, disregarding other people's well being for the sake of his own paranoia. the ending is especially weak, with absolutely no payoff for the long suffering audience. do yourself a big favor and avoid this one. not recommended. - merk
