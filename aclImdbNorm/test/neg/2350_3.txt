first of all, let me make it clear. this movie is a real piece of garbage, but although it is a real piece of garbage, it is an better piece of garbage than it could have been. it could have sucked big-time, but it doesn't...<br /><br />what this movie didn't have, was for example scary moments, good acting and a good script. it wasn't very entertaining either. but the movie had cool music, fancy locations and hot girls. it also works great as a dracula spoof. (hope it was meant that way, although i really don't think so)<br /><br />the story focuses on three girls in transylvania, awaking an ancient vampire, which then terrorizes and kills the girls, one by one. sounds familiar? yes, so it does!<br /><br />after reading through this, you may think that i should have given it a better vote. the reason i don't, is because i almost felt asleep at some points...
