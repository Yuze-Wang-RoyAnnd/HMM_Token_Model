this film is in a dead tie with the original for worst film ever made. i think this one may be slightly worse, if anything. spoiler alert!!! here are these survivors on a ship that's been capsized for a long time. improbable? no - impossible. the whole premise is so laughable as to not be funny. there are some pretty big names in the film, and even they couldn't save this sorry thing. i find it truly a waste of good celluloid. after seeing this, i also unfortunately decided that it had been a waste of my time. don't bother with this one. or the original for that matter! i gave it a 2, mainly because they throw votes of 1 out.
