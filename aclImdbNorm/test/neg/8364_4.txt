last night i got to see an early preview screener of prozac nation. because i love everything that christina ricci does i was very excited at first, but as the movie continued i started to wonder where it was going. based on a true story, it is simply about christina ricci's character and her struggle with depression, drugs, friends and family as you can probably tell from the title. in my opinion this movie moved too fast, and it was way too dramatic. i would say there was a dramatic moment every five minutes, and the movie moved through her life extremely fast, and this left no room for us to connect with christina ricci's character. christina ricci's performance was fantastic as always but jessica lange stood out throughout the whole movie, and i believe this movie's success will be all because of her and christina ricci. i would rate this 4 out of 10 and i would suggest you rent this one or read the books by elizabeth wurtzel they are good and definitely worth checking out.
