when one of the stars of a movie is named sticky fingaz, you should know enough to stay away. stay away. house 2 is just more of the same, this time with zombies overrunning a college campus (man, how that must have saved on money). as usual, the "zombies" are given no direction so speak of, and provided very little makeup or costuming. they look like the zombies in one of those endless italian zombie cheapies from years ago. which is to say, they don't look like the kind of zombies we know and love from george romero and dan o'bannon zombie flicks. the folks battling the zombies are all nonactors who get to shoot guns and do little else. some who have written here feel the sequel is slightly more focused than the original. all i have to say is i'm glad the sequel's director did away with the 360-degree pan shots that helped to ruin the first movie. house 2 is still just more of the same, which means a lot of nothing happens for 80 or 90 minutes. there is one set piece, involving soldiers tussling with a zombie football team, that might at least have been funny. it's not.
