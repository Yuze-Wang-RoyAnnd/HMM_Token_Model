terrible psychological thriller that is almost painful to sit through, every aspect being awful.<br /><br />the combined talents of top actors kevin bacon and gary oldman are totally wasted, and though they give good performances, one wonders why they bothered. the script from mark kasdan is a complete mess, and martin campbell has the narrative jumping all over the place, but if you're unable to follow it, take it as a blessing. there are far too many pointless, crazy scenes that just don't make sense. jerry goldsmith's music is not much help either.<br /><br />even if there was potential in the plot, director campbell's approach has utterly ruined it. avoid at all costs!<br /><br />monday, february 26, 1996 - video
