this show has been performed live around the country with a wide variety of casts. i saw it first in the provincetown production the first summer it was in p-town (2001)--before it was, curiously enough, banned in that overwhelmingly gay resort (the codes which resulted in its closing have since been amended). i saw it again later in the off-broadway, long-running production in new york. oddly enough, the p-town production was far better than the new york one--fresher, cuter, more spirited and funnier--but that was only in the 2001 showing; subsequent attempts to clone the production ("bare naked lads" in 2007) were definitely third-rate. this filmed production features a los angelos production cast, and it is, as other comments have suggested, not the best. i would rate it somewhere in between the top-notch 2001 p-town production and the third-rate "bare naked lads" p-town show from last summer.
