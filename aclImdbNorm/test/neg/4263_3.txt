good attempt at tackling the unconventional topic of may-december romances. however, the treatment is totally unrealistic. sure, sixty-year old men can and do fall for younger women, but they're usually adult women with whom they share common interests and values and viewpoints ... not neurotic, immature near-underage girls. of course there are exceptions, and they come close to being called pedophiles! sorry rgv, but it's not credible that a sane and accomplished sexagenarian would throw away a comfortable family life and become a joke to his peers ... all for an 18-yr old that doesn't have a practical thought in her head and that behaves like an unstable escapee from a mental institution. you don't have to have a phd in psychology to see that amitabh's character is seduced by sex, and that the young woman has unresolved abandonment and daddy issues.<br /><br />as for the recurring scene of vijay perched on the edge of a cliff, contemplating suicide, that's about as close as he comes to having anything in common with jiah, by behaving like a smitten teenage boy.<br /><br />on a positive note: the actors did a good job, and cinematography good.
