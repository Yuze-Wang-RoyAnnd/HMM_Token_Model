there is no real story the film seems more like a fly on the wall drama-documentary than a proper film so this piece may in itself be a spoiler. teen drama about 3 young singaporean kids (very similar to uk chavs) who play truant from school, run with gangs, get into fights, insult people on the street, get tattoos, hang about doing nothing, etc. etc, they generally imagine themselves to be hard and every so often shout challenging rap chants into the camera. filmed in mtv style, fast cuts, crazy camera angles, tight close ups and animation interludes. the dialogue might have been crisper in the original languages of mandarin and hokkien than in the subtitles and i have no doubt that some of the contemporary singapore references will slip over western heads as well as the cultural and political context unless of course you are familiar with singapore. this kind of teen film may be a first for singapore but it has been done before and done better in other western countries, la haine (1995) for example.
