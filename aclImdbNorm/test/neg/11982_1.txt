barely came trough the whole movie... acting is bad, dialogs are even worse. felt kinda st00pid 4 watching it, but it was named the same as one of my favorite games, so i struggled trough. they even screwed up the sound. at certain parts of the movie the background music is so loud, that i had to turn the volume down. it would be great, if this was a competition about who can screw up more.<br /><br />oh and ps: i don't know what's this guy "uwe" capable of creating... i certainly don't think this movie is bad just because he's the director. i checked the list of his work, and this is his first(and probably the last) creation that i've seen.<br /><br />over&out.
