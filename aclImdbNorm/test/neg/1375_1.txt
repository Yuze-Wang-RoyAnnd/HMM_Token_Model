carlos wants to make fun of affirmative action, racial stereotypes and related topics on his show which makes him a lot like supreme court justice thomas. he's there because of his race and then denigrates it. he can supposedly make fun of mexicans to no end because he is himself mexican, and i would also contend he can get away with making fun of the mentally challenged because any lay person can tell he's not the sharpest tool....though he is definitely a tool of some sort. <br /><br />he is a hack comedian who, even with a staff of writers, can't put together 3 minutes of genuinely funny material in a 30 minute show. i can't think of a single comedian who is regularly on tv that carlos can hold a candle to except maybe larry the cable guy (not too surprisingly, he also has a show on comedy central to cater to the exact same audience no doubt.<br /><br />if you ever see the greats, jerry seinfeld, chris rock, jon stewart etc. talk about comedy you really get a feeling for the amount of work and thought that goes into developing a funny interesting comedic voice. all that work was completely skipped by mencia; his comedic voice is, in part, stolen from other better comics and in part hidden by his propensity for yelling his unfunny rehashed racist tripe. mencia's show is beloved by some of the "at least i don't suck that badly crowd" who i firmly believe watch it to feel better from his rants about the dumbing down of society; unfortunately carlos and his fans are part of the problem not the solution on that topic.
