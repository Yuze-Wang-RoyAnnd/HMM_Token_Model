a horrendous film, ill-conceived and crude. the acting of anne heche and vince vaughan is so inferior to that of perkins and leigh in the original version they have to be seen to be believed. there was no reason to make this picture, which only highlights how accomplished and brilliant hitchcock was, and how inimitable. also, there's a creeping, pervasive insensitivity in the film that isn't there in the first film. hitchcock's psycho was scary and shocking, but one could genuinely feel for all concerned, even the pitiful norman bates. there were moments of pathos, irony and fey humor the remake doesn't have. one of the best things about hitchcock's film was its incredible and intuitive depth and sense of nuance, of when to cut away and when to show something, on whether to use a close-up or long shot, on whether to make an actor sympathetic and when to make him frightening, and so forth. the remake has none of these qualities and doesn't even try for them. it's an idiotic exercise that i'm amazed even got released.
