you'll feel like you've experienced a vacation in hell after you have sat down and watched this horrible tv movie. this movie is an exercise in over-acting (very bad over-acting) to situations that made out to be more than what they are. i won't give away the plot, but once you realize why the people in this film are running from the native man in the film you will demand the two wasted hours of your life back. the only plus is seeing marcia brady running around in a bikini!
