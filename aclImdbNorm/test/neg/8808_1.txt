there are bad movies and then there are movies which are even worst. saw is just that.<br /><br />the movie is simply bad on all points. the plot, the acting, the camera work, the music and everything else is absolutely terrible and i cannot begin to comprehend how such trash made it to the big screen.<br /><br />the simple fact is that saw is riddled with plot holes. the beginning is enticing and leaves much to be expected but it does not hold up and the plot becomes absolutely ridiculous and absurd. the film is not creative and will not leave you with a single bit of credibility. people that claim that this movie is gory, violent, sadistic and scary are sissy girls who have nightmares after watching csi because it is far from that.<br /><br />so i am warning you know, do not attempt to watch this if you have any form of intellect, because you will be disappointed. a true bore and a mediocre film as can be.
