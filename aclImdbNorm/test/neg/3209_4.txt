during my childhood time i have seen the first three "critters" movies and enjoyed 'em.they were fun and entertaining horror comedies perfect for adventurous horror loving kids.i have never seen "critters 4",so i finally decided to check it out.my verdict:forgettable and pretty bad flick with strikingly low body count.the script by joseph lyle and david j. schow is both predictable & clich'ed,the plot rips off "alien" and "star wars" and the sets look bland and murky.the tone of the film appears to be deadly serious throughout making it slow and dull."critters 4" was apparently so low budget that the filmmakers couldn't afford any optical effects;the ones taken from "android" look seriously dated.4 out of 10.one to avoid.
