a man is pulled off a london street and taken to some foreign country where he is tortured as a terror suspect. dull, banal film bored the hell out of me. more an idea then a film. i was half way into this 77 minute film when i realized i had no idea who anyone on screen was. it was as if they took every other similar film and pulled out all of the ideas and put them in one place with out the real notion of character. certainly its well acted with passion but there is no emotional center, there is just an everyman of sorts which the filmmakers feel is enough. its not. and while the story presented id in theory important as a warning the film is too dull to convince anyone of it, especially if one has seen the other, better films of a similar ilk (rendition with reese witherspoon for example)
