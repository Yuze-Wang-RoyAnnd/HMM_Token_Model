an insult to both poker and cinema, this movie manages to make the most dynamic, brilliant, and fascinating figure in poker history into an utter bore. still a fun film to make jokes about, from the lame gangster movie clich'es of the first half to the incomprehensible nonsense of that second hour. hilariously, stu ungar wins all three of his world series titles without playing a single hand on screen. his infamous dealer abuse? 1 scene. his coke habit? 1 scene. his incredible memory? 0 scenes. they couldn't even get any real poker players. what did they cover? a lot of high angle shots from inside a house in the suburbs. oh, and a montage of stu waking up every day and shopping for meat which doesn't come anywhere close to making sense. why do i care so much about this little sopranos summer camp trying to cash in on the poker craze? because i think there's still a great film to be made about stu ungar waiting for someone willing to do it right.
