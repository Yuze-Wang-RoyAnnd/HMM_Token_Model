i can't believe this movie is getting the rating that it is here on imdb. of course, i've come to conclude that imdb is somewhat worthless for actually finding out if a movie is good or not as 99% of films are rated from 6 to 7. it's the conclusion and failure of crowd-sourcing on the internet. for this purpose an average is taken of most people, and unfortunately, most people are simple minded easily entertained fast food lifestyle morons. but i digress. the movie. i really don't want to waste my time writing about it. let's just say i found it to be tailor made for seemingly two groups of people, young teens, at the age where violent action movies of any sort just hit the spot, and goth types that just love to choke down whatever gothic vampire fantasy they can get their hands on. if you aren't in one of those categories, you will find this movie absurd. i did enjoy the first underworld. it was fresh at the time and held a sort of edgy quality. the second was a bit trying in plot, but i did enjoy the direction and cinematography at times. but this whole movie felt like a sci-fi channel production or even a tv series. i found the actors to be over-directed. their body language stiffened into un-natural idealistic poses that seemed contrived. lines were spit out like young actors would spit out lines of shakespeare, reveling in their own egoistic glory at being in such a role, but in doing so, crudely bludgeoning the role. the plot was dry and predictable right from the start. i found myself wishing things to just "move along" as it was so easy to tell what was going to happen. i tried to care at first, but my brain was forced to shut off. by the end climax, i actually caught myself falling asleep. there were so many parts that were inconsistent and didn't make sense that it's not even worth listing them all. if you're a pimple faced teen or a chronic goth, sure, have at it. for the rest of us, forget it, like i'm about to do right now.
