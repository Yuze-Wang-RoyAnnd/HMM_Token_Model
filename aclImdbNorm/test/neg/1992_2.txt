cowardly and cynical, `the hospital' represents the nadir of paddy chayefsky's special brand of celebration of the status quo disguised as satire.<br /><br />thanks to ham-handed director arthur hiller, this ludicrous script gets the visually ugly, poorly paced presentation it deserves.<br /><br />only a great performance by george c. scott, in the sort of mean-spirited role he was born to play, keeps `the hospital' from being a complete disaster.<br /><br />ironically, though, scott's performance does viewers a disservice. his magnetism keeps them watching when they might more profitably turn off the vcr and clean out the closets, stare at the clouds, or watch re-runs of `baywatch.'<br /><br />certainly, anyone who emotionally invests in the set-up _ modern medicine apparently gone amok _ will feel cheated by the dismal payoff, where chayefsky reveals that the system works just fine, so quit your carping.<br /><br />while the first half of this film provides some entertaining black comedy, it all turns out to be a red herring. before that becomes clear, though, chayefsky gives some good lines to scott as his middle-aged, middle-class, white male stand-in.<br /><br />bitter, alcoholic, impotent, scott's dr. herbert bock has alienated those who know him best, and he has the bile to keep alienating them. in chayefsky's worldview, all that of course makes bock a magnet for a hippie chick half his age.<br /><br />playing a collection of adjectives, the long-haired, long-legged, braless and almost bust-less diana rigg struggles in the part of `the girl.' the british rigg is miscast as a southwestern free spirit, but any other actress would struggle as well. like the rest of a good cast gone to waste, rigg can't overcome a script that isn't interested in any character except bock, or any philosophy beyond banality.<br /><br />for fans of george c. scott, this is another star turn and worth watching. for fans of black comedy, turn it off after the first 45 minutes. for anyone else, don't bother.
