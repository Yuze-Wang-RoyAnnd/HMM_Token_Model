i'm really disappointed by this piece of work. it is quiet shallow, keeps repeating itself, is mostly not exact and sometimes on the verge of being wrong. i think it's made for elementary school, especially because it keeps repeating itself over and over again while leaving large gaps. a young kid might actually enjoy it and learn from it, but a better way to make a kid appreciate theoretical physics are books like "a short history of time" or "the tao of physics". if you are familiar with the topic on a very basic level, you won't gain any new information or views from this series. don't waste your time with it. nice eye candy though.
