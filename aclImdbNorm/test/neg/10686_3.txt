the animal-eating (geek) scenes were not as bad as you would think. after having watched mondo cane and mondo magic, these scenes are average. the grossest one was when the guy ate the head off the mouse. but they were so fast and few that they didn't bother me.<br /><br />otherwise, the film was just sort of interesting. i always like hearing the silly voice-overs. they never sound like what you think the actor/actress would sound like in real life. i liked the bright colors worn by the princesses. the shots of weird looking bugs were cool too. the youngest princess looked really young, almost 14 or something. the fight scenes were not as long and boring as most fight scenes, so that was good.<br /><br />3/10.
