i was giddy with girlish-glee when i found out about this movie shortly after seeing spirits within.<br /><br />after years of anticipation, they gave november 2005 release date. well, november came. and went. followed by december. oh, look, today's january 31, 2006. no us release as of yet.<br /><br />oh well, i'm so glad i had a friend with a bootlegged subtitled copy. ;d<br /><br />well, the cg was great. not as good as expected, but near perfect. i cringed, however, at the unnatural movements made by the children throughout the movie. i had thought that we were passed this by now. also, i didn't really care for the anime look given to their faces. i was under the impression that they were shooting for a realistic look to the film, and yet most of the characters have larger-than-norm eyes, especially the girl characters. they had personality, though, i'll give them that.<br /><br />even though i'm not a big fan of anime, i do have to say i was impressed with the wild fight scenes. they were animated beautifully and had me hanging onto the edge of my seat.<br /><br />for about the first two.<br /><br />and there-in lies advent children's biggest flaw. it's mostly just a bunch of hyper-stylized fight scenes.<br /><br />a ff7 sequel of epic proportions had been promised for years. instead, they gave us a pretty piece of cg with barely a plot to excuse it's just-under-two-hours running time.<br /><br />where final fantasy is famous for its intricate stories, this movie falls short. you don't really get to know the characters. the only way you'd have any understanding of most of what occurred in the film would have been if you had played the game. we barely got to see them before they were battling it out with whatever current threat.<br /><br />what hurts the fans even more is the awful cameos that the majority of ff7 characters were given. they were nothing more than cloud's "i'll call if i need you, but i probably won't" back up singers. and, to add to the hurt, they had each character individually throw cloud higher and higher. this little part here was so cheesy i almost turned it off. i would have been much more impressed if he had just simply jumped up all on his own, ricocheting off of walls to get himself up higher.<br /><br />it hurt even more when they reduced the turks to less-than-just comic relief. that was fine for the game, but this is cinema. people do not act like cartoon characters in a harsh battle. they took away their dignity :/<br /><br />and, spoiler (yeah right, most of you probably already know, anyhow). who remembers darth maul being hyped up in sw: episode 1? yeah, now, picture that, but with sephiroth. that's right. he had maybe 5 minutes of screen time. maybe that. end spoiler :p<br /><br />if this movie was made for the fans, then way to go square. if this is any indication of the direction you're taking the ff series, i doubt you're going to be seeing much of my money. i played your games for the wonderful story and the excellent characters.<br /><br />you had a chance to make something epic. something truly beautiful, a masterpiece that flies in the face of all of the disney cg films.<br /><br />instead you gave us a pretty piece of flesh with hardly anything underneath to hold it together. way to go.<br /><br />and i'm sure if the rest of the fans paused for a moment and tried to just pay attention to everything but the cg they'd know what i'm talking about. well, i was gonna rate this a 5/10, but after thinking about it while righting this, i'm giving it a 3/10 because they could have done better. they have done better. and this is just sad.<br /><br />if they're gonna remake anything ffvii, they need to do this one first.
