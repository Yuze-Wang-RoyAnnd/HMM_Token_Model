being a huge fan of the bottom series i was really looking forward to the release of this film.i was eagerly anticipating a laugh a minute roller-coaster ride......alas.<br /><br />where to start on this mess?i think its a good start to say that its hardly richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funny.i was still waiting for the first laugh after a good 20 minutes of viewing.many aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they rehearsed and decided to leave out of the final cut.<br /><br />the overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and dingy which i suppose is good if they want to portray the 'terrible' guest house the 2 buffoons attempt to run,but to me its just puts an even higher dampener on a sorry state of filming that should never have been created.<br /><br />the acting,at times,is pathetic.fenella fielding is wasted as the loony mrs foxfur and i've seen simon pegg have much better outings.<br /><br />i'd recommend guest house paradiso to anybody who is blind drunk because they might appreciate the terrible puns much more.but to any bottom fan who hasn't seen this film and is expecting true richie and eddie action you have been warned
