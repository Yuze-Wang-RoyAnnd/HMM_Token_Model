1st watched 12/26/2008 -(dir-eugene levy): corny comedy murder mystery with very few laughs. the movie appears to be based on an earlier italian movie according to the credits but was re-written by two fairly popular american romantic comedy writers. but this one by charles shyer & nancy meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts. the story is about a couple of down-and-out traveling americans, played by richard lewis and sean young, who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the dachsund's return. upon trying to return it, they see a hand sticking out of a garage door at the lady's residence that they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of the woman who is supposed to give them the money. they freak out and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth they make out like runaways from the scene expecting to be framed for the murder. the other characters in the film are met on a train prior to this and hang around a monte carlo gambling resort doing various things to be pulled into the story. the other cast members include character actors john candy, james belushi, cybill shepherd, george hamilton and others. after the police find out about the death, they start questioning the main characters and, of course, they have to work thru their goofy lies to figure out what really happened. none of the character actors mentioned earlier can bring this movie out of it's mediocre state despite some funny moments mostly provided by the belushi/shepherd couple. this isn't a horrible movie, it just isn't that good. there are plenty of average movies out there and this is just another one for the pile. try it, maybe you'll like it, probably you won't.
