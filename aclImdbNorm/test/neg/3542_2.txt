this is horrible even for a tv movie. i can't believe it took three people to write this movie. i am not familiar with the novel on which this film was based, but it has got to be better than this. i'd rather watch a "full house" marathon than this stupid movie. i gave it 2 out of 10 stars only because it was made better by commercials.
