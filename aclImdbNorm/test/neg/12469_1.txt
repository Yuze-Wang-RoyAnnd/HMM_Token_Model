basic structure of a story: beginning, middle, end.<br /><br />sometimes this structure is played with, and we get memento or irreversible and the story plays backwards. sometimes it's just not linear, a la pulp fiction. regardless, they all have a beginning, middle and end.<br /><br />this is the first film i have ever seen that doesn't have an end.<br /><br />beginning: girl's best friend is expelled.<br /><br />middle: girl needs to cope without best friend.<br /><br />end: non existent.<br /><br />not that having an end would've saved this film, but at least it would have been complete.<br /><br />it's an exercise in apathy; we get a party-mix of characters, and they all turn out to be duds. boring, vain, vapid and pallid imitations of people.<br /><br />and here's the action within this film: nothing happens. nothing at all happens. mischa barton tries to talk with a plummy english accent, dominique swain whines a lot and brad renfro receives a blow job from some old guy. end of movie.<br /><br />by the time the credits rolled, i had a horrible feeling that many prisoners must feel: periods of time, those precious minutes of our life, have just been wasted.<br /><br />the only passable point (and that is a very emphatic only) is brad renfro. he acts well. lacey chabert i tend to like, but no luck here. due to good work in other films, i will forgive mischa barton this travesty, but i hope all cast members were slapped in the face for their involvement.<br /><br />please, i implore you. avoid. don't fool yourself into thinking "i'll make up my own mind". my sister told me to never see this, and i ignored her, wanting to make up my own mind. that was a bad decision.<br /><br />i have never hated a film. there are many i don't like, but i have never hated a film. until i saw this.
