i'd heard this japanese flick is edgy, creatively interesting, a "cool new thang" on the asian movie-making scene ... maybe even something as innovative as hideo nakata's "ringu" or chan-wook park's "oldboy", especially the latter.<br /><br />you can imagine my disappointment when, instead, i found the movie disjointed both narratively and cinematically (though not in a way that a film aficionado appreciates), clich'e-ridden, even sadly silly instead of funny --- on the whole, a very bad knock- off of the "pulp fiction" style.<br /><br />i stopped watching after 30 minutes, when i gave up on it becoming something more than it is.
