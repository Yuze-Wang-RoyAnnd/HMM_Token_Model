it is not uncommon for a celebrity to be faced with the proverbial "wake-up call". and, should they survive this event, they come to a deeper understanding and appreciation of their particular good fortune. however, in the case of comedian's, they are rarely as funny after their epiphany as they were prior to it. such is the case with martin lawrence. frankly, i pay little attention to celebrities as i have much better things to do with my life than to spend it monitoring others'. so, i was unaware of the majority of what lawrence had gone through prior to this film. it was interesting but, unfortunately, all to common. i was left with the larger impression that this guy's stand-up act just wasn't very funny. save the big life messages for a book, just be funny on stage. if you want to see a funny martin lawrence, go rent some of the old def jams for which he hosted. don't rent runteldat.
