would be promising if it were a student film. never seems to know where it's going next, as if they decided on each next scene as they were making the film. as a result, much repetition and a deadening pace. there's an absolutely confusing procedure by which the ghosts affect people in this world: it involves the internet, phone calls, a computer science experiment, a suspicious grad student, withdrawn behavior, red rooms, dark stains, and _then_ suicides. good luck figuring out the connections, or when a character is a ghost yet or just acting strangely. characters are barely sketched, which could be ok, but they're completely uninteresting. it's far too long and ends just when it reaches a promising scenario, although the conclusion is nonsensical. weakest moment: when "the boss" sits down to give some incoherent advice.
