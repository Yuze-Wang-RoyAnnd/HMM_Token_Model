at a saturday matinee in my home town. i went with an older friend (he was about 12) and my mom let me go because she thought the film would be ok (it's rated g). i was assaulted by loud music, strange images, no plot and a stubborn refusal to make any sense. we left halfway through because we were bored, frustrated and our ears hurt. <br /><br />i saw it 22 years later in a revival theatre. my opinion had changed--it's even worse! basically everything i hated about it was still there and the film was very 60s...and has dated badly. i got all the little in-jokes...too bad they weren't funny. the constant shifts in tone got quickly annoying and there's absolutely nothing to get a firm grip on. some people will love this. i found it frustrating...by the end of the film i felt like throwing something heavy at the screen.<br /><br />also, all the monkees songs in this movie suck (and i do like them).<br /><br />for ex-hippies only...or if you're stoned. i give this a 1.
