i'm a big fan of sleaze and horror movies, when you put them together that's my sweet spot: horrible sleaze. you're not going to get it in this film, though.<br /><br />there is certainly sleaze, in the form of girls being kidnapped and tortured, tied naked to various things. the sleaze isn't very sleazy, though. it didn't register very high on my sleaze meter, mainly because none of the girls were in the least attractive, nor did they attempt to act as if they were even threatened. they seemed to be thinking more about what was for lunch, or maybe when they could score some crack.<br /><br />forget the effects, they were lame in the extreme. the lameness was contributed to by the bad acting; effects are harder to believe when even the actors and actresses aren't buying into them.<br /><br />cinematography was pretty bad, they could have hired a couple cameramen from a porn movie and done better. in fact, that might have raised the sleaze factor enough to make it enjoyable. as it is, there are a lot of dark shots where you can't see very clearly, and what you can see isn't looking too good.<br /><br />the horror factor is nil. null. zero. nada. zip. zilch. i've seen kids movies that were more frightening. there's no camp here, either. it's just a movie that attempts to be shockingly sleazy, but doesn't even come close.
