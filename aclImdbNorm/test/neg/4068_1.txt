i can't believe that someone actually paid to have this film made. stupid, unrealistic, and stereotypical. right from the take off of the massive 747 the pilot pulled the throttles back to increase speed. then you have 5 armed persons with semi to fully automatic weapons firing without so much as one bullet breaching the walls of the pressurized cabin at 38,000 feet. then once below in the belly of the plane a stray bullet hits a fuel line and we see the fuel leaking from the side of the plane. the acting was just horrid and forced. there just didn't seem to be any direction. i have seen some pretty horrid b movies in my lifetime but with the names that were in this film i was extremely disappointed.
