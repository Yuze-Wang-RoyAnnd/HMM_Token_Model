this is definitely a "lesser known" comedy short from the 1920s. the only reason i saw it was because it was on a dvd by kino films featuring non-laurel and hardy shorts featuring ollie. they are interesting and historically important, but also generally average to below average for the style film. compared to shorts by chaplin, keaton, arbuckle and lloyd, they are definitely a step below them in quality and humor. also, the accompanying music was pretty poor by the standards of other silent dvds. i ended up turning off the sound due to the inappropriateness of the music to set the proper mood. but, despite this, they are still worth seeing.<br /><br />i've gotta be honest about this short. it was the last of 8 on this dvd and by the time i got to it, i was pretty bored with the mediocrity of 7 of the 8 shorts. so, it is possible the film might be a little better than a 4--but certainly, if this is the case, no better than a 5! the film is a pretty standard short about an incompetent bellboy. nothing especially interesting and there are certainly much better silent shorts out there.
