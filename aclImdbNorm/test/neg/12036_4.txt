mary, mary, bloody mary is an ok time killer. it has a uniformly attractive cast, the action is rarely dull. there are a lot of killings. and the production values are not bad. but in the end, it plays like a standard tv episode from the 1970s with some nudity thrown in. the film is the end product of an "author" trying to make a purely commercial film. there's very little depth here and the film spends too much time with chases and action scenes. except for the scene on the beach with the old man, mmbm is almost devoid of any scares or suspense or dread. the director has very little understanding of the horror genre.<br /><br />it's watchable even though it doesn't leave a lasting impression.
