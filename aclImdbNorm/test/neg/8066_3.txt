this movie was quite a mess. there wasn't anything really going for it. the only character that had any appeal was bobbie phillips' maya and she wasn't even worth it.<br /><br />the plot is standard, double-cross the double-crossing double-crosser. with a few too many double crosses to make any sense. sometimes that means it "keeps you guessing" in this case it "keeps you waiting". by the end i just wanted everyone to get thrown in jail or shot.
