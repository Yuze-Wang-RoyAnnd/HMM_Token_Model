i walk out of very few movie screenings and this movie managed to become one of those that i couldn't bear to watch any longer. as far as the awards it won goes, the ones awarded by turkish festivals are not credible in my opinion. my only explanation for the queens festival award was to think that somehow a layer of comedy was "gained in translation" as the subtitles helped distract attention from the horrendous performances.<br /><br />at the beginning of the screening i attended, the presenter briefly talked about the history of turkish cinema and at one point mentioned that early turkish cinema was appropriately named "stage cinema" since many of the filmmakers and actors involved were people from the theater scene.<br /><br />ironically, this movie falls right into that category. english speakers reading subtitles may think that turkish is a naturally loud language and attribute all the yelling in the movie to that, but observant native commentators will immediately notice that all the actors are performing with exaggerated loud voices. you could attribute this to the amateur nature of all actors, but the biggest source of "yelled-out-dialog" is the main character, played by the only professional actor in the movie. not surprisingly his background is in theater. my guess is that in response to his loud delivery of lines, all other amateur actors raised their voices as well, hence turning the whole movie into a series of unnatural performances.<br /><br />put on top of all of this a storyline that develops at a snail's pace, you get an extremely boring movie.<br /><br />i have to say i also have a personal problem with turkish movies that depict entirely rural life with shallow uneducated characters. ever since "zugurt aga", one of the best turkish movies ever made, turkish filmmakers seem to be not able to avoid the appeal of the rural part of the country. this is only interesting in small doses and if it is as beautifully orchestrated with excellent writing and directing as in zugurt aga. most often, however, it is extremely boring and frankly somewhat embarrassing to native "urban" turks. rural communities make up a neglected, undereducated part of the country, and while this provides good material for comedy, it comes at a huge cost to turkey's image.<br /><br />a western audience member whose only exposure to turkey is this movie will undoubtedly think that turkey is like afghanistan. i wish filmmakers would realize this and let go of their passion for the stories of the "rural man" and stay loyal to the majority of the country, who live in cities that put metropolitan areas in europe to shame.
