what to say about "dead end road"...<br /><br />lets just say that edgar allen poe would have been so ashamed. the acting, writing, effects, and everything in this movie was just horrendous. that doesn't even do justice! this movie was the biggest piece of garbage i have ever had to sit through. that is also why i stopped it about 20 minutes before the ending because personally i didn't care what happened to the characters. i have seen bad but this was definitely the worst. i got hyped up for this because i am a fan of poe and this was just bad. just bad. <br /><br />what upsets me more is that you can't rate films with negative numbers.
