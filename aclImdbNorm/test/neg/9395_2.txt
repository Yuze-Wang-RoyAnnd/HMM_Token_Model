this movie was thoroughly unwholesome, unsettling and unsatisfying. apart from a few nice shots of italy, there's nothing to recommend this movie. as usual, hollywood draws the wrong conclusion from a fractured existence--the _next_ guy you meet, whom you sleep with after knowing for a few hours, _he_ must be mr. right. as for humor, there is some in the movie, but i can't see how anyone could possibly label this a romantic _comedy_ since about three-quarters of the movie is totally depressing! my recommendation? skip it in the theaters, wait till it comes out on dvd, then skip it there also. i want someone to give me back the two hours i wasted watching this dreck, drivel, dross.
