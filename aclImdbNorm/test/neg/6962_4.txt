i approached this movie with the understanding that it was one of the worst flicks ever made. i sat down to watch it with this mindset, and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />it's not great. it's not even that good; in fact, it's pretty poor. however, it's not as bad as i had been led to believe, by a long shot. it's pretty inept, and, evidently as a cost cutting measure, a lot of stock footage is pressed into service, a lot of which has no apparent relation to the narrative.<br /><br />what it is, however, is an intensely personal movie made by a man who evidently did not have the skills or the funding to do his idea justice. before you discount _glen or glenda?_ out of hand, examine your own artistic skills. me, i'd love to be able to draw, but anything i try to sketch comes out like stick men. i'd love to be able to sing, but all i do is frighten young children.<br /><br />wood had an idea, and unfortunately he didn't have what it takes to make it work. however, this was an incredibly daring movie for the puritan 50s, however exploitative or incoherent it may appear at first glance.
