having had more than a few mates suggest i check rise of the footsoldier out, i eventually got round to it last night. undoubtedly the story colton leach has to tell (and did so in his autobiography) is a compelling tale of one mans ascent from terrace boot boy to connected underworld villain. this film sadly compromised in quality by miscasts, appalling accents and woeful acting.ricci harnett in the lead role of leach does a reasonable job of conveying the transition from thuggery to serious criminal but his accent is all over the place. as his voice provides the stories narration it is something that after ten minutes was driving me nuts. terry stone as tony tucker provided the unintentional comedy with an ill fitting wig (or the worst barnett going)dialogue that was so expletive riddled it bordered on juvenile and an over the top vehemence in line delivery reducing tucker to parody.what troubled me most about this film was that the events leading up to the shooting in rettenden, essex and the formative years of leach are of genuine interest to crime fans and fans of football hooliganism so, to have this story sabotaged by a lack of credible accents and acting left me feeling an opportunity had been missed. roland manookian and frank harper provide the films only source of authenticity. on the positive side some of the films pacing and construct flowed well and kept the attention. the violence was well choreographed and aside from an over reliance on projectile red syrup for blood spatterings was on the whole realistic. if you enjoyed the film then it is worth checking out essex boys telling a similar tale from fictionalised viewpoint and also featuring billy murray.
