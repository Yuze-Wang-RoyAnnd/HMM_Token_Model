i knew that i was not about to see a quality film when this title was included in a 'b-grade video night' at a friends place. despite the warnings, i was still surprised at just how bad this film was. it was fortunate that there were a lot of us there to share the pain with each other... the film attempts to tell the story of a dark future, one in which hawk (a mad max type of character) heads off to rescue a damsel in distress. in reality, the plot is a thinly disguised excuse for the producers to promote their own philosophies on life (watch the end credits and the 'these people are not real' disclaimer at the end for a real laugh). the movie is frequently lacking direction, and fails to develop its characters to any degree whatsoever. what's even worse though is the editing of this film. the film repeats scenes (often 10 to 20 seconds long) up to 4 or 5 times in a row. i think that this was an attempt to emulate things like jean claude van-damme fight sequences, but if it is it fails utterly. the film would probably be about 1/3 of its length if we weren't forced to watch the main character move his head in front of the setting sun half a dozen times (yes, that's all that happens in that repeated scene). i give this movie my 'worst film i've ever seen' award. i doubt that it will be topped any time soon.
