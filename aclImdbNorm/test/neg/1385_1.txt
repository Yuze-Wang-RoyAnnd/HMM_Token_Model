thats right i can't watch comedy central anymore just because i can't bear to watch the repeated commercials for this show. i'll tell you the truth, this is a terrible show not because i'm offended by it, but because carlos mencia is one of the worst comedians i have ever seen. i rather watch carrot top do a george bush impression than watch this no-skill hack. and to believe he calls himself the greatest. even if he didn't steal the jokes, he is still bad at telling them, he's way off-timing and unoriginal. i remember in one joke he said "why do white people go camping? to pretend there poor for a week?" now what is that suppose to mean? that all white people are rich? another one i didn't understand was when he did a skit of the price is right and he told some fat guy "you should know how much a fridge cost, you're fat" and the fat guy had the saddest look on his face. but what does that mean? that "fat people" are always looking for refrigerators? those are just the two i seen in his commercials, god knows what his show is like..<br /><br />this show falls in the likes of epic movie and date movie..
