wow !! i didn't even know about this movie until i was searching for the name of another mark hamill classic (time runner). some things are better left unknown. mark hamill's role is quite ... limited. i would compare his appearance in this movie to all those appearances of vincent price and christopher lee in those bad horror b-movies of the 60's and 70's. in those movies, they appeared in the the first and last 5 minutes of the movie. memorable acting by mark with such great lines as "don't try to run. you're under arrest." did i mention he says that exact thing more than once. bill paxton fell into an uzumaki type spiral of drugs and booze after aliens, because he ended up in this movie after waking up on the set after a binge session. the hair .. the hair !!! .. priceless bill. truly should have been "game over" for bill .. but somehow .. he got treatment .. and went on to better??? movies. this movie blows. it is more dull and boring than the crazies. at least that movie was crazy... this is just boring. do not watch this movie sober.
