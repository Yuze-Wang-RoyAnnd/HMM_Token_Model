i remember watching this mini-series the first time in 1984 with a growing sense of anger and indignation. having read the comments on this title, i must agree with those from the people in greece. this was produced to coincide with the 1984 los angeles olympic games and, to me, it seemed like nothing more than an exercise in jingoistic, flag-waving american nationalism in which the american athletes are glorified at everyone else's expense. some other nationalities would have every right to feel deeply insulted at the way they were portrayed in this series. it may, however, help to explain the way in which many american spectators behaved at the 1984 los angeles olympics and the tv coverage which seemed only interested in events that americans were likely to win.
