if you like the three stooges you'll undoubtedly like this 17 minute short. there were certainly some amusing moments in it, but like all the stooges' work, this revolves around their particular style of slapstick comedy, and i have to confess that somehow the stooges just never really did it for me. their slapstick always seemed angry rather than funny, and even though it was obviously fake, their antics always seemed more likely to cause hurt rather than to cause laughter. in this short, the slapstick revolves around the attempts to find shemp (who is a professor of music in this) a wife, because he's just inherited half a million dollars on condition that he marry within 48 hours of the will being read. one of his students is interested, but once word of the inheritance gets out , there's suddenly a long line-up of potential brides, and a pretty good cat fight emerges between them. fans of the stooges will enjoy. for me, it has all the elements that drive me nuts about them. 4/10
