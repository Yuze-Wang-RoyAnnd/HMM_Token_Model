notable only as the acting debut of future big-time hollywood starlet, sandra bullock, this ludicrous action flick is so full of holes that one might easily suspect termite infestation. the storyline is incomprehensible and very poorly thought out. the production values stink of cheese. in fact, a total lack of production values would have been better...at least the film might have seemed grittier that way. the adr is laughably bad and omni-present in the film. it's debatable as to whether or not any of the dialogue tracks from the actual shoot were used.<br /><br />the performances are, for the most part, horrible, though there are a few exceptions. in those exceptions, however, the performances are undermined by the fact that the director was obviously giving the actors poor direction and making them act completely out of character at times. (i.e. characters going from passive to panicked in the blink of an eye. bad direction.) also, the constant "weapon sound effects" (magazines being loaded, slides being cocked, etc.) are completely overused and, more often than not, totally out of sync with the on-screen actions. add to this cheesy "bad guy" vocal distortion for the lead villain (mainly so that you know he's the villain in this incomprehensible mess of a film), and you have a recipe for disaster.<br /><br />the situations in the film go well beyond standard "suspension of disbelief" and become downright laughable. one lead character spends a good portion of the film tied to a chair before he decides to use the butterfly knife tucked in his sock in order to free himself. so, my questions are...why didn't he do this sooner, and why does he even have the butterfly knife. he wasn't searched? right. this is one of a hundred examples of completely ludicrous situations which have somehow been crammed into this 90-minute package.<br /><br />in whole, "the hangmen" plays like an unbearably bad r-rated tv movie from the '80s. if not for the subsequent success of sandra bullock, this would have never found its way to dvd. but it has, so my only advice is to steer clear. watching this film may actually impair your iq.
