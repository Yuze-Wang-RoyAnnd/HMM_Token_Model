the three stooges are arguably the greatest comedy team in film history. for that reason alone, they deserved a much better ending at columbia than they received with this short.<br /><br />"sappy bullfighters" is just not good. granted, this is not all joe besser's fault. i personally feel that some of his shorts are fun enough, simply because of the departure from the stooges usual fanfare that they contain, and for the fact that larry is sometimes showcased more. however, this short just will not do. and the fact that one knows that it is their last short that was ever shown, well that just adds to the overall disgust.<br /><br />this film just epitomizes how short subjects were on their last dying breaths during this time and how little effort went into making them. this short is so sloppy. it is a simple re-make of a curly short, "what's the matador?", filmed years before. as if this fact wasn't bad enough, the studio actually threw in footage of moe and larry from the original (which was filmed nearly 20 years prior). are these things not obvious? laughable or sad? you be the judge.<br /><br />another part of this short that makes it miserable is the fact that it is basically a joe besser showcase, with him showing that all he is (at least in this film) is a curly-wanna-be-gone-completely-wrong! moe and larry have little to do in this short. as a larry fan, i also must say that i feel it a bit disgraceful to have besser get to use the joke that larry originally popularized in the short "ants in the pantry". to see besser say "i can't see, i can't see!" and have larry say the simple "why can't you see?", while besser gets to quip "i got my eyes closed", is just wrong on all levels.<br /><br />the two brave soldiers who stuck it out for all those years, howard and fine, have so little to do in this short. there are hardly any funny bits with them. the only thing that qualifies is larry hiding under the bed of a jealous husband, attempting to be "pepe", his dog.<br /><br />one can't blame the dynamic duo. larry and moe give it their all. no matter how ridiculous things could get (and i'm sure they had their opinions by this point in their careers) howard and fine never gave anything less than their best. their efforts do not pale from 1934-1959.<br /><br />i often enjoy many shorts that some will dismiss as horrible. i'm all for their more "experimental", unusual shorts. at least those contain new ideas. however, this short, i think everyone can agree, is just not good.<br /><br />thank goodness tv later discovered the boys after the shorts department closed. had they been forced to go out in this fashion, well that would have been a gross injustice to all the years they invested in making audiences laugh.
