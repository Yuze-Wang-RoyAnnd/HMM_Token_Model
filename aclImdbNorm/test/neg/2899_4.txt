wow, this movie is bad. think "flashdance" with ninjas. the worst part is when a sword is supposed to be floating in midair, but you can see the strings. or maybe the worst part is the gigantic eye patch (that looks like a coaster) that the good ninja wears. actually, there are so many bad parts, i can't make up my mind which is the worst. i can't believe anyone actually put up the money to have this thing made. the only redeeming value is that it is good to laugh at.
