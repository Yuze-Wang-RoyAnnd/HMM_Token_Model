nothing more than a soccer knock-off of the mighty ducks, this film proved to be annoying in most aspects. this was one of those times where you're parents ask you to take your younger siblings just so they don't have to deal with them for a few hours. to say the least, my younger sisters liked it, but it proved to be too much like the far superior mighty ducks. oh well, at least olivia d'abo was hot and steve guttenberg still had a job at that point in time.
