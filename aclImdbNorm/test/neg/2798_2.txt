dark harvest is about a group of friends that go to a farm(it belongs to one of the friends relatives or something) for a getaway. but there are killer scarecrows lurking there(there was something about a curse in there too but i forgot what that was about).<br /><br />the acting in this movie is awful, i don't know what the director was thinking when he was casting actors and actresses. the script is the same story as the acting "awful"(this statement coming up is very obvious but..) if there was better acting and a better script this could have turned out "okay".<br /><br />the directing stunk too, i see no potential in this guy's future. after all these negatives this movie still maintains a "fun" factor that bumps it up to a two. the last plus is they don't use cgi! my overall thoughts on this film are it's bad, real bad, but so bad it's "fun" so it gets a 2/10
