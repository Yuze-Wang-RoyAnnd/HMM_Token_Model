one commenter said if you like austin powers you will like this movie. i liked autin powers and was disappointed with this movie. the film works hard, maybe too hard for laughs. maybe it was that all the villains in this movie were shouting as if the shouting in itself is suppose to be funny. i get where they were trying to go with this flick. a cross between zorro and the scarlet pimpernel but it just doesn't work. austin powers if silly but intelligent, zorro the gay blade lacks the savvy of austin powers, the big lebowski or kingpin.<br /><br />i kept waiting for a laugh and while waiting found myself amazed that someone actually got paid for the script. my 15 year daughter also thought the movie was flat. my 17 year old who selected this flick on it's title, walked out after 20 minutes.<br /><br />it seems many people on imdb liked this film, but for me it lacked the good timing or jokes of a good comedy.
