i really wanted to like this film however after an amusing opening few minutes i hardly cracked a smile. i agree there was no chemistry at all between the two leads and the other characters were cliche ridden. the script totally wasted the talents of bud tingwell and kim gyngell.<br /><br />it must be said however that there was plenty of laughter around me and even a smattering of applause at the end. perhaps i just couldn't relate to it enough. i'm just glad i went on cheap tickets.
