6 out of the 8 comments on this subject rated this film as worth watching, so let me redress the balance.<br /><br />if this is the best that british independent film makers have to offer then they need to pack away their cameras right now and find jobs in another industry. unfortunately for me that was 82 minutes i'll never see again and hopefully i'll save some of you from wasting 82 minutes of your own. <br /><br />whilst the idea behind the film is interesting, it is not developed enough to keep the viewer attached. the student characters are bland and uninteresting and quite frankly you won't care about what happens to them. the soldiers are practically caricatures of every baddie ever seen in film, i kept waiting for captain markovic to twirl an imaginary moustache. some of the effects were quite good and showed some imagination, but these were ruined by the shockingly bad acting, poor script writing and patchy camera work. the budget may have been better spent sending the "actors" (and i use that term loosely)to acting classes or the thomas brothers to film making school or maybe on a spell checker because the subtitles were incorrectly spelt. the fact that the mis-spellings were not picked up on and rectified speaks volumes about the immaturity of the whole production.<br /><br />i can only assume that the positive comments are staged by the film makers, either that or they were watching a completely different film. i implore the thomas brothers to never give up their day jobs for if they continue in this field, they will surely starve to death.
