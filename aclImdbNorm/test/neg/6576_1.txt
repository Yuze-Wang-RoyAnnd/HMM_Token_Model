i find it almost touching how star trek fans try desperately to like this film in spite of its unbelievable number of flaws.<br /><br />to begin with, none of the familiar characters are really in character so to speak. scotty is depicted as a bumbling tinkerer instead of the competent engineer he was in the original series. uhura...gods, i can't even think about what they did to her character. all of her dialog was painful to listen to. mccoy seemed like a neurotic stepfather to kirk instead of his trusted friend. spock...well, let's just say that leonard nimoy was terribly wasted. he was given bad dialog ("i do not believe you have grasped the gravity of your situation captain." gravity, get it? get it?) and made almost into a buffoon. kirk...oh man, don't get me started. william shatner is a hammy actor to begin with, so to allow him to direct really is to invite disaster which is what we got.<br /><br />the plot is beyond ridiculous. giving spock a brother is a pretty desperate story line and unnecessarily soap operaish. but hey, let's go with it. the search for god. again, a weak plot basis. you don't think so? ok, let's go with that too. so assuming that the two aforementioned plot elements are sound, what's wrong with the script? well, for one thing, it recycles way too much. the enterprise, for example, is yet again, not working properly. are we to assume that starfleet would send a grossly malfunctioning ship with a skeleton crew into a potentially dangerous situation just because they want james kirk to handle the situation? if that's the case, then why not put him on a better ship as an adviser? adding to that...the crew is grossly incompetent. scotty has the ship in pieces (and apparently is cloddish enough to bump his head knocking himself into unconsciousness while there are hostiles on board!), no one seem to notice the klingon ship decloaking at a crucial moment (despite the fact that the sensors are clearly showing the ship in weapons range) and the crew all seem way too familiar with each other. in other words, there is no sense of discipline. if this is the flagship of starfleet, then it's a wonder that the klingons hadn't already overthrown the federation.<br /><br />as to the personal struggles with pain, it was crap. lawrence luckenbill is a competent actor, but even he couldn't save this turkey. in short no one could. of all the people involved, i imagine leonard nimoy is the most embarrassed by it. i hope he is, anyway.<br /><br />thank god the original cast didn't bow out on this cloddish opus.
