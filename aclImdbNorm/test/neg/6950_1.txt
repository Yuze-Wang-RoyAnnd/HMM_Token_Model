i have to preface this by saying that i love watching bad movies that are entertaining. this movie delivers 100%. it is hands down the worst movie i have ever seen. it is full of crappy stock footage of random stuff in a city (people walking, traffic, the skyline, etc.) that doesn't tie into anything. then there are the overly long 'sex scenes.' these involve lots of petting and frequent rubbing of socks on each other's bodies. these are in no way erotic and are the closest thing to horror you will find in this movie. this is especially true for the shower scene where two of the so called 'barely legal' girls who couldn't be a day over 40 are spraying each other with blood but there is also a crew member squirting blood in the from the outside while one of the girls keeps smiling at him. no one had to memorize any lines for this movie, if they aren't clearly reading cards then they have a magazine in front of them they keep glancing at while they struggle through awkward dialogue. then there's mr creepo. he throws ed wood's name around like he can somehow compare, but he is far far from anything of that quality. he walks around a cemetery babbling about random things that went wrong in the movie which really helps the complete lack of flow the movie already had going on. we couldn't stop laughing during this movie (except during the sex scenes where we were grossed out and occasionally horrified)<br /><br />i give this movie a 1/10 for going so far above and beyond all my expectations for a horrible movie.
