two years after this movie was made, "the juror" came out. don't waste your time on this one. see "the juror" instead. "the juror" is essentially the same story as "trial by jury," with better acting, better directing and a far more gripping aura about it. william hurt was not believable as a cop-gone-bad, and armand assante couldn't be more unlike a mob boss if they had dressed him in a clown outfit. you didn't become involved enough with joann whalley's character to be that upset by what was happening to her. also, the way in which she interacted with the jury wasn't compelling or interesting in any way. kathleen quinlan's role as a hooker/killer wasn't fleshed out enough and quite frankly was unnecessary for to the plot.
