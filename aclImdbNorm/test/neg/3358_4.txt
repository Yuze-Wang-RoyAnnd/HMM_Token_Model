below average blaxpoitation action / melodrama in which the lovely ms. grier plays a private eye who comes to the aid of her father (rudy challenger) and his partner (austin stoker of the original "assault on precinct 13") whose loan business is being threatened.<br /><br />i'll be frank - i agree with the few other user comments for this movie. "sheba, baby" has a less than satisfying script, direction that isn't particularly distinguished, action scenes that are moderately entertaining at best, and one of ms. grier's more nondescript supporting casts (although there's an important supporting role for d'urville martin, also a familiar name in blaxpoitation). i get the feeling that this routine movie may have been put together quickly merely to cash in on her then enormous popularity.<br /><br />it sure was cool seeing stoker again, although ms. grier doesn't have as good a role - or dialog - as she has had in other films, although she is doing what she does best, and that's playing a sassy, sexy sister on a mission of vengeance.<br /><br />non-stop soul / funk soundtrack is enjoyable, at the very least.<br /><br />mostly recommended to those who wish to see everything in the pam grier film repertoire.<br /><br />4/10
