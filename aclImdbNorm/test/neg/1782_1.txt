there is so much bad to say about this movie and so little that's good!<br /><br />the plot has enough holes to sink the titanic, the characters are completely unbelievable, the monsters are so unrealistic, and i'm sick and tired of seeing movies that involve an ex-husband and ex-wife being thrown together in some bizarre emergency - it happens far too often in films and it's become another bad clich'e.<br /><br />i find it hard to believe that anybody would have invested $1 in making this garbage, never mind the $100 or so it must have cost.<br /><br />you could make a better movie with more convincing special effects on your home computer! i didn't think movies could get this bad! avoid it at all costs - do something that's more fun and enjoyable, such as having a tooth pulled, or an enema!
