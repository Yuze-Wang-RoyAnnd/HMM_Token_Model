contain spoilers! these guys are total scam, they did the lost scrolls of judas, saying judas was a huge friend of jesus... and now this? this is clearly a tryout to destroy a religion, and should be illegal. they have no proof, it could be clearly a setup. how can we know and trust these people? what if they carved the tomb and "said so"? and at the end they seal the tomb forever so no one can go there investigate? how stupid they think we are, really? are we supposed to trust that they are trustworthy people? who really found a tomb of jesus? and how can you stab all the christians like this? i think this documentary should never be made by a non religious man. it can only be made by a christian and i mean the direction and script. it should be illegal for jews to film a christian related documentary, specially if the documentary makes accusations about jesus not being a "son of god who resurrected" (nothing against this, they could be buddhists or atheists, anything but catholic).<br /><br />to me this is a total hoax, a pure documentary-scam. they sealed the tomb so people "wouldn't" think about checking things out. this documentary is a total failure, how stupid they think the christian people are? and what about the lost pages of judas... that was a total scam as well, they seriously said at the end, something like: "we know a few people that could do a fake scrolls just like these, and no one would know it was a fake"... oh my god, they just said it.. "dude we might have done these"... this kind of documentary should be illegal, it is a stabbing on all christians and catholics they should be behind bars!!! i am not a fanatic, i am an ex-jew, now atheistic, but i have valors and will always respect others people religion, the part when israel orders the tomb to be sealed forever was precious!! precious!!
