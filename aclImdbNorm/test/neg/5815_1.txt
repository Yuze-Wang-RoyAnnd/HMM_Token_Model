i saw this film when it came out. let me see now--this guy who had earlier skied down mount fuji manages to accumulate the funding and hire personnel to document what sounds on the surface like a bold and daring act---to ski down the world's highest peak. well--and here comes the spoiler--what happens, see, after a large crew of people manage to help him get near the top--and a life is lost in the bargain--he gets on his skis, manages to make it down a very very short way, at which point his parachute opens...and that's that. and instead of burning the footage to hide this amazingly anticlimactic ending to an embarrassing debacle, the guy goes ahead and releases it. spoiler ends i do admire the amazing courage and effort it must have taken the film crew to get some of the stunning shots they got. another spoiler--oh yes, one of the sherpas is killed by falling into a crevasse. the narrator, who is quoting the "daredevil skier, casually remarks that, according to the sherpa religion, since this man's body cannot be recovered his soul will roam the world forever and never know rest. is it worth it, the narrator muses. yes he answers--because it served the purpose of letting this clown "ski down everest." i can't remember ever seeing a more meretricious piece of celluloid. this is one to miss at all costs.
