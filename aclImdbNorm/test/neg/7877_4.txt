this isn't a good movie. plain and simple. take out the hardcore sex scenes and what you have is a mediocre plot, average acting (at best), plodding direction, and dull dialogue. add in the grot and you've got mediocre plot, average acting, plodding direction, dull dialogue, with lashings of hardcore porn. trouble is the porn's nothing special either. so it's not a good movie, and nor is it a good porno. it fails on both counts. they can say that women made this movie and they were intending to do this with it, and that with it, etc. but talk's cheap, the end result is what counts, and what we have here is a mediocre movie with some sex thrown in for shock value to try and con you into wasting your time watching it. one of those movies where you'd rather have the time you spent watching it back.
