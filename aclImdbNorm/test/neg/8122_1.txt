according to milan kundera, a porcelain-cat holding a red rose is denying the crap. well, those criminals guilty of making this series probably wanted to show how to make a total opposite of the porcelain-cat holding a red rose. because teenaged sleazoids beavis and butthead are enthusiastically from the place where the sun doesn't shine and their crappiness infects the whole stoopid series. mtv has received a lot of bad-mouthing from it's half-nude stripper beauties, while this is gathering positive reviews in imdb. well, newsflash to everybody - your butt is cool too, if you go out showing it in the middle of the winter - something these two probably would do. still, there is no need to make a film about your butt - and yes, these two probably would do that, too.
