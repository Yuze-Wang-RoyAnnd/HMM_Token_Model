after starting watching the re-runs of old columbo movies, i thought they would all get about the same vote from me (6). but apparently i'm now starting to see differences in the movies. it happened in some of just previous episodes, that showed some pretty genius directing, and it shows in this one, but in the negative way.<br /><br />the movie was so boring, that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a columbo movie before!), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away. the directing seems too pretentious. the scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace. and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode. then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.<br /><br />some applause should be given to the "prelude" however. in this episode, a lot of focus is given on how the murderer tries to secure his alibi and hide the evidence etc. i really liked that. but alas, no focus on how columbo reveals all this. and the "proof" that in the end leaves columbo victorious is the silliest ever.<br /><br />rating: lies between 4 and 5
