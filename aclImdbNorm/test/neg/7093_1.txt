the moral of this show is that bad eating habits give people bad hair, bad taste in clothes, bad posture, bad jobs, and on and on. they are obviously miserable and loathe themselves. however, if they learn to eat broccoli, they will be wealthy, successful, and attractive. <br /><br />tlc ought to be ashamed of themselves for this blatant exploitation of parental fears and guilt. if nutrition is really that important, they should be able to develop a show using honest and truthful methods. if they really believed in their computer simulations, i'd like to see them do a double-blind test by finding some 40-year-olds, finding out what their eating and exercise habits were as children, and age-progressing the kids' photos. then compare to the real things. hey, that sounds like a project for mythbusters! discovery channel--are you listening?<br /><br />tlc must stand for tabloid lies and cons.
