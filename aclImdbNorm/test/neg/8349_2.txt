as a geology student this movie depicts the ignorance of hollywood. in the scene where the dog grabs the bone from inside of the burning house, it is less then a foot from lava which has an average temperature of 1,750 degrees fahrenheit. this stupidity is witnessed again when "stan" goes to save subway 4. his shoes are melting to the floor of the subway while the rest of the team is standing just feet away from the flowing lava. and to finish off this monstrosity of a film, they come up with the most illogical solution, stopping a lava flow with cement k rails. earlier in the film a reporters voice can be heard saying that nothing can stop the flow fire fighters have tried cars and cement. common sense dictates this film is a preposterous and gross understatement of human knowledge.
