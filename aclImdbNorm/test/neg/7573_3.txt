this film has me seriously doubting again whether armando de ossorio was a good filmmaker or not... his blind dead films are praised by many fans. this i can understand. but wanna-be gothic vampire trite like malenka doesn't show any signs from a gifted filmmaker. and that also goes for serpiente de mar. it features horrible acting, a dumb plot, stupid events, a lot of other things you can expect from a bad monster-movie and also veteran actor ray milland, who does his best to mumble his way through this film while not having much of a clue about what he's doing in it. apparently milland was already very ill while shooting serpiente de mar (his last theatrical feature) and going out with a ridiculous stinker like this, makes it all the more sad. one last appearance alongside peter cushing in a made-for-tv film directed by roy ward baker (also in 1984) doesn't change much about it.<br /><br />but the sock puppet/sea serpent is a hoot to behold. watch it swirl up a lighthouse and crush it. see it destroy a harbour with miniature boats. look at it demolish bridges and munch on charming miniature trains.<br /><br />good badness? yes. 3/10 and 7/10
