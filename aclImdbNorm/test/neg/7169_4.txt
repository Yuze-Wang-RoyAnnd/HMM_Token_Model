george burns returns as the joshing almighty after enjoying a big success with 1977's "oh, god!", an upbeat fantasy made successful by a sudden need in the 1970s to switch from devil-driven thrillers to comedic redemption (although it made money, the original was more in line with the "topper" comedies of the '30s than a return to feel-good religious cinema). here, god appears to a young girl (louanne, who had earlier starred in a stage production of "annie") and asks her to spread his divine word, causing her nothing but trouble from grown-ups in the process. peculiar, family-oriented film appears to be warm-hearted enough, and burns gets to chime in with a nice barrage of wry jibes, but the writing is half-slapstick and half-seriousness, with the adults of the piece considering putting little louanne away, all of which makes god seem more like a troublemaker than an elderly friend. louanne is another problem: a perky kid with wizened little eyes, she is untrained for screen-acting and occasionally seems awkward. the medium-budget production has a gloppy, tv-movie appearance, with few graceful touches. the final scene mimics the climax of the first "oh, god!" in that it brings a wistful sentiment to the mix, which is welcomed. it's the most subtle moment in the movie. ** from ****
