i'm no jane austen purist but why make a film like this if you have nothing to say.<br /><br />billie piper was so wrong for the part it is difficult to know where to begin-wrong personality,modern make-up,completely wrong hair (there is no way a young lady of her age would have romped around in public with her hair loose and unbrushed like that),she didn't seem particularly meek nor put-upon by the family and i didn't understand why everyone seemed to think of her as particularly saintly or kind.<br /><br />the picnic(substituted for the ball) was so low-budget it was embarrassing to watch and missing out the portsmouth section completely destroyed the point of the piece (as well as losing scenes which could have added a gritty counterpoint to that oh-so-claustrophobic pink sitting room.)<br /><br />to those responsible:-if you haven't the imagination (even the budget doesn't matter so much as the imagination) to do something meaningful with an adaptation please don't pretend to be producing jane austen.<br /><br />it was about 10% mansfield park and 90% nothing much at all<br /><br />ps edmund was very good
