you have to hand it to writer-director john hughes. with enormous success behind him in the misfit-teenager/high school vein, he managed to branch out into other areas of comedy, finding in the bargain a great ally in comedian-actor john candy. here, goof-off adult candy becomes a better person after agreeing to babysit his brother's wiseacre kids; it's a surefire formula designed to please both cynical teens as well as their parents, and it isn't any wonder the film was a winner with theater audiences. still, hughes relies almost completely on candy's charm to put the scenario over, and one may eventually grow tired of the repetitious gags with the star front and center. the kids are sitcom-smart, the other adults shapeless blobs, and amy madigan is too intense, too hyped-up playing uncle buck's girlfriend. later became a tv series, which is befitting since the material was already television-perfected. *1/2 from ****
