michael allred's comic book stories, particularly his work on madman, usually are a great deal of fun. "astroesque," allred's no-budget indy film, is the opposite of fun.<br /><br />worst acting ever coupled with truly horrible dialog makes for a brutal cinematic experience. pretty certain allred understands wtf's going on, but he's the only one. daring you to watch the entire mess isn't enough...defying you to watch the entire mess is more on target.<br /><br />"astroesque" is some kind of movie tie-in to allred's "red rocket 7" comic book, which, ironically, is mostly unreadable. so if your "astroesque" experience isn't terrible enough definitely track down the over-sized comics and continue the fun.<br /><br />felt sorry for allred, who was totally out of his depth attempting a film. also felt sorry for myself, what an incredible waste of my time and money. please buy my vhs copy, which is available right now on ebay. hurry up.
