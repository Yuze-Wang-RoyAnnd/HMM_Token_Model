this movie is bad, so bad that my mother who can barely stand the "suspense" of disney's snow white, was chuckling through out the entire movie. my first warning should've been that it was in the $5.50 bin at wal-mart. but i have actually found some good movies in that bin, so i can't fault if for this debacle. the second warning should have been that when the cashier rang up the dvd, it was actually $3.88. again i have never been one to ignore the cheapies. this movie is definitely not for people looking for something good to watch, and it most certainly isn't for everyone that enjoys the occasional bad movie. if you need background noise while you are doing something like playing cards with some friends, then get this but if you are looking for something to actually watch don't even bother. it was really disappointing because there were a lot of good actors. i felt like i was watching a chocolate version of willard.
