go up to any film fan and ask them the title of the film which was directed by robert wise, with second-unit direction by yakima canutt and sergio leone, was designed by ken adam and scored by max steiner, starred sir stanley baker, sir cedric hardwicke and brigitte bardot, was filmed in colour, scope and stereo, at cinecitta in 1955, with a thousand extras - and they'll tell you to go away and stop being silly.<br /><br />they'll tell you that no such film exists. that the names you've quoted never worked together - they weren't even contemporaneous. and that you've just picked the names out of a movie publication at random and are attempting to befuddle them.<br /><br />at which point you can direct them to imdb and show them the cast and crew of "helen of troy". they'll be amazed! this lesser-known sword-and-sandal epic has all these names and more - niall macginnis, janette scott and good old harry andrews.<br /><br />and it is certainly an oddity. after the war, 1,000 italian extras cost about $25 a day and toga dramas were a staple of italian cinema. the orgy scenes were shot twice - one with tops, the other without (you can guess which version britain and america got). i believe even la sophia is an extra in this one.<br /><br />either way, the names stagger the mind. but it's really just a coincidence. all of said names were either just reaching the ends of their careers (canutt, steiner) or beginning them (everybody else).<br /><br />only robert wise and niall macginnis were in the middle of their careers.<br /><br />for the record, leone was uncredited and learning his trade - adam still had to invent the descending circle in the ceiling of sets (a trademark he'd go on to put into all the early bonds) - baker had yet to star in and help produce the likes of "zulu" and "robbery" - and go on to direct a welsh tv company called harlech - then die tragically young.<br /><br />while harry andrews would go on to become one of britain's favourite character actors - janette scott (thora hird's daughter) would never make the really big time, but who can forget her in "day of the triffids" (even though her bit was added later - for padding and a happy ending) or "crack in the world"?<br /><br />sir cedric was theatre, but knew how to mug on film - and bardot... was bardot, for gawdsake!<br /><br />but what were these stellar people doing in this camp old nonsense? don't ask me. the two main stars were no-name italians - helen had a moustache and paris was pretty - while the brits were only there for support.<br /><br />to summarise, i think you can just mark this one up as a major fluke. in stereo. to be honest, if i hadn't seen it - i wouldn't believe it either!
