harry knowles has a quote right on the front cover of the dvd stating"the next icon of horror" really?!?!?!? i have heard a lot of hype surrounding this one but wasn't totally convinced. however i am a die hard horror fan and will give just about any horror movie a chance. no matter the budget or the rating cause ya never know where your gonna find the next gem. not here.not hatchet. hatchet is poorly conceived,poorly acted and un funny. just because you have the actors who played freddy jason and candyman and a buffy chic topless with tons of gore does not make you an expert on horror.sorry. i don't even want to describe the plot because it is so idiotic. honestly my money is on rob zombie. there is a man who knows old school horror. forget this trash.
