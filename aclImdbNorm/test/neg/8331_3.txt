the world now seems to be in an odd stage of downsizing, in which objects such as dvd and cd players are steadily decreasing in size. it is obviously much cooler to have a smaller ipod than a larger one. this is not so with theater screens, as is the case with the imax, the enormous, widely-known theater system that has stunned audiences upon its release, and to this day. as long as the material's right.<br /><br />the main problem with 'magnificent desolation: walking on the moon 3d" is that it uses the huge screen as its main advantage. it is dull, uninformative, and relentlessly eager to please and amaze us with its corny special effects and inspiring quotes from famous names such as neil armstrong and buzz aldrin. another problem with the film is that it doesn't even take the time to sit down and interview those lucky few who have had such an extraordinary experience as to have been to the moon. instead, the writers have simply pressed copy and paste and hired famous voices such as morgan freeman, bill paxton, and matt damon to imitate their famous quotes. this tactic is unrelentingly repetitive and tedious.<br /><br />i'd say without one moment's hesitation that i didn't learn one piece of information from the film that i didn't already know.<br /><br />and it repeatedly insisted on irritating the crap out of me with its insistent sentimentality. every three minutes there seems to be a cue for tom hanks' voice to say something like "without the contributions of these brave men and women..." watching the film is like watching a bad commercial. for forty agonizing minutes.<br /><br />1/4
