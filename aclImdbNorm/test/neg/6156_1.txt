the quote above just about says it all for "slipstream". i should have bailed out of this film after the first half hour, but decided i ought to be fair and give it a chance. i won't watch it again, so if anyone with the temerity to do so can get back to me with the number of clich'ed lines in the movie, i'm sure it will set a record.<br /><br />some otherwise fine and talented actors got mixed up with this clunker; mark hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and bill paxton is his quarry. paxton's character has hijacked hamill's prisoner, an android taking his name from the poet byron (bob peck). tasker (hamill) shoots owens (paxton) with a dart containing a tracking device so he and his companion belitski (kitty aldridge) can keep tabs on the pair. the real question though is why didn't he just fire the device at byron thereby cutting out the middleman.<br /><br />if you enjoy scene after disjointed scene with tedious characterization and artsy fartsy pretense, then i suppose you'll find something of interest here. but you can't convince me that the film makes sense on any level. scenes of a futuristic stone age make way for high society snobbery, but the pinnacle of poor taste is reached when paxton's character is displayed following a night of revelry with hickeys all over his torso. if anyone thinks there's some hidden meaning here, you're really stretching.<br /><br />patiently waiting for the frame proclaiming "the end" to come into view, alas, even that was denied. if beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then so is understanding; this movie had neither. yet there was a single redeeming feature as the closing credits began their run - an awesome view of a half dozen hot air balloons. apparently the film was keeping them afloat.
