why do i hate this? let me list the ways:<br /><br />i have nothing against mary pickford but a 32 year old woman playing a 12 year old is just stupid.<br /><br />there's a fight scene in which kids are throwing bricks at each other and it's considered funny---and it goes on for 15 minutes <br /><br />strange how none of the kids are even remotely hurt<br /><br />the title cards contain plenty of racial and ethnic slurs<br /><br />for a "family" film the fights were way too violent (loved it when pickford was punching it out with a little boy!) and the humor was just stupid <br /><br />seriously, 40 minutes in i gave up and turned it off. the slurs, racism and little kids throwing bricks at each other got to me. also there was no plot that i could see. the only thing worth seeing in this film was william haines who was a top leading man in the silent era.<br /><br />just painful. avoid.
