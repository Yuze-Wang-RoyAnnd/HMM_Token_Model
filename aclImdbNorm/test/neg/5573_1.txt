i see that the majority of the comments so far have been if not overly positive, then at least positive. i can not understand that. the only explanation i can find is that the people who commented had something to do with the film, because this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. it makes "boggy creek ii" and "mutant" look like masterpieces of horror. the acting is shaky at best, and awful for the most part. the entire movie is almost pitch black, probably so they could shoot it all in the same location. the monster looks like something from one of roger corman's worst films. and the plot...well, the less said about it the better.<br /><br />one to avoid at all costs.
