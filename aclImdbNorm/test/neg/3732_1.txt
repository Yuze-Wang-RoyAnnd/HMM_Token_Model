j.j. jameson (from spiderman 2) quote ... crap, crap, ...<br /><br />mega-crap it pretends to be an homage (un/intentional) to the coen brothers ... done poorly.<br /><br />there is no real mystery to the plot.<br /><br />diaz's performance is totally uninspired.<br /><br />the quirky characters don't really work.<br /><br />there are a lot of "duh" moments.<br /><br />i love black comedy, but this film isn't funny.<br /><br />in my view, it wasn't worth the electricity.<br /><br />there are many films in this genre which are much more entertaining.<br /><br />i hope you find this review helpful.
