i really tried, but this movie just didn't work for me. the action scenes were dull, the acting was surprisingly poor, and some of these characters were too stereotypical to even be funny. pam grier tries, but when you have nothing to work with, even her considerable talent cannot prevent a disaster. even by the standards of this weak genre, this film is pretty bad.
