how did this film get into the berlin film festival? i understand it got into the panorama section, but still. <br /><br />this film featured:<br /><br />1. no plot. 2. horrible acting. 3. atrocious videography. 4. some of the worst graffiti ever captured on video.<br /><br />the one clincher that accounts for most of its festival acceptances is the presence of that old standby: homosexuality. that's right, about the only thing that does happen in this film is that one graff artist makes out with another one and jerks him off. then he feels weird about it and they have a boring old "breaking up" conversation that you might expect to hear from your first crush in middle school (featuring lines like "you kissed me first, dude."). oh, and by the way, this is no crying game...you see the gay angle coming in the first ten minutes of the film. aside from that it's mostly just bad tags, badly costumed "undercover" cops, some skateboarding, and a train ride. <br /><br />if the subject matter is of interest to anyone i recommend looking around the web for some underground graff videos taken by real graffiti artists. there's plenty out there...and they are a hell of a lot more entertaining than this crap.
