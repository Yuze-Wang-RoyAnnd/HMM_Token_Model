this movie was a big disappointment. the plot sounded great, about a half-human, half-leopard creature in africa that becomes the subject of a documentary by young american adults. when many of the crew members are found dead, the 2 survivors are taken into questioning. i wouldn't even call this a horror movie, since most of the movie is actually about the (mis)adventures of the aforementioned, narcissistic 20-somethings, which include sex and smoking animal dung to get high (isn't as entertaining as it sounds--trust me). you rarely get to see the creature, and the main actor (who also happens to be the director, screen writer, editor, and producer!) is incredibly annoying.<br /><br />i was finally so annoyed by the never-ending dialogue that i fast-forwarded to the end. i had guessed the ending in less than 10 minutes into the movie...and i was right. thus, this awful movie is utterly predictable, too--as if it wasn't bad enough. moral of the story: avoid movies that are acted, directed, edited, produced and written by the same nobody. and avoid this movie, unless held at gunpoint.
