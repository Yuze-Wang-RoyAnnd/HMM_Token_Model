i really don't know why i agreed to watch this movie, but like a complete fool i did and for that i deserve to be shot! i had seen the original killjoy, well i say i have seen it.... i started watching it but found it that bad that i ended up watching it in 4x speed to get it over with and get rid of the annoying dialogue, but i said i would watch it and i did even if it was in 4x speed.<br /><br />to cut a long story short killjoy 2 kicks off where killjoy left off. by this i don't mean the plot, i mean the complete and total bag of dirt known as acting and cheapness. i have nothing against low budget movies, in fact i kinda enjoy them, they are something different from mega budget blockbusters, but this film is just terrible! the acting is diabolical and the script... well i think you could of given stevie wonder a pen and paper, and he would of produced something much better! this movie is just annoying, not to mention the annoying laugh the clown has which is so obviously dubbed! i didn't make it through this movie anyway, about three quarters of the way through it was time to turn it off and throw it through the window. it may of been a rip off to buy as a dvd but as a frisbee it was a mega bargain! <br /><br />please for the love of mankind itself do not watch this muck, it is possibly the worst thing i have ever seen and considering some of the muck i've seen thats saying a lot! <br /><br />my rating on this movie would be.... nailgun to the head/10
