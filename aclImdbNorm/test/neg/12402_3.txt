i've read other hacks' reviews of this movie, and while it certainly isn't the best movie ever made in the sci-fi / horror genre, it isn't that bad if you accept it for what it is - low-budget, b-movie fare that (shall we say) "borrows heavily" from the likes of 'alien' (nasty extraterrestrial monster that cocoons its victims) 'species' (gorgeous and confused "space girl") and 'incubus' (the beastie-breeding-with-captive-girls angle). this is one seriously cheesy movie, and the whole thing was obviously done on a shoestring budget, although the alien isn't too bad (i've seen far less convincing men-in-rubber-suits at any rate). none of the acting is oscar material and the isle of man doesn't really double for boston massachussetts very convincingly. the plot is fairly predictable too and the premise that an alien craft would travel squillions of miles and crash land smack bang in the middle of an all-girls college campus - thus conveniently providing a rich source of perfect breeding victims - is utterly laughable. however, the movie does have its suspenseful moments, there's a few helpings of nudity and semi-nudity and the film does feature one of the few movie appearances by the beautiful and tragic model / actress kadamba simmons (as the "space girl") who, at the age of only 24, was murdered in london by her jealous boyfriend shortly after making this film.
