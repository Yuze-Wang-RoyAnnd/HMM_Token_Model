i know that many people will/have automatically given this film a rating of 1, just because it doesn't have the huge budget and top-of-the-line special effects that they are used to. i, however, knew what i was getting myself into when i popped this into the vcr.<br /><br />i don't think we get much more low-budget that this, unless we are filming a family reunion. the lighting is awful, sound quality is at times incomprehensible, and the acting is ultra-bad by almost all involved. but, this is still a fun movie and the plot is interesting enough. it centers around a fellow named tom russo (asbestos felt), who has been down on his luck with his job. he is very protective of his wife and does not allow her to work, putting even more pressure on himself. as he begins working more hours, we see him slowly transcend into madness and obsession and he becomes suspicious that his wife cheating on him and begins to brutally murder the various men (most repair guys) that he feels are responsible. <br /><br />i must say that the gore effects are extremely cheap, but fit with the overall tone of the film.. the brutal ways that tom russo comes up with to murder these men gives us an idea of just has mad he has become. the pacing of the film is also very good and there is rarely a boring moment. the ending really doesn't follow the rest of the plot of the film, as it seems to want to go from a psycho-slasher film, to a "dawn of the dead" wannabe, but it is entertaining nonetheless and i must give tim ritter credit for wanting to use an unconventional ending. <br /><br />i can honestly say that i enjoyed this film, but it is by no means a good film, if that makes sense. it's budget is its main stumbling block and the consequences are almost too much to overlook. i do not recommend this to people who are totally spoiled by the big-budget movies and who can't have an open-mind to ultra-low budget films. you simply won't enjoy it. for others, and fans of gore--i say give it a shot. you will find at least something redeeming in it! <br /><br />my grade: d
