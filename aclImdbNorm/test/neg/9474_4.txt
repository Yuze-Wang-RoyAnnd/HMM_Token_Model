firstly let me get this of my chest i hate octopussy with an absolute passion. what is so frustrating is that it had so much potential and had a very good opening sequence, unfortunately post the opening sequence it all goes downhill. firstly there was absolutely no plot to begin with, just an excuse for moore to tell his corny jokes. next there are several sequences that would make a bond fan cringe,for instance the sequence in which bond turns up to diffuse a bomb dressed as a clown. the villains are pretty poor, louis jordon fails to make an impact as kamal khan and bollywood veteran kabir bedi is equally poor as his henchman. it's funny that when people debate over what the worst bond movie is and octopussy gets overlooked when it can easily give them a run for their money.
