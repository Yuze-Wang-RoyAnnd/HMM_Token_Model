a swedish splatter movie? has the world gone insane?<br /><br />probably not, but it's still not a common sight in these days with swedish gore-flicks, the b-movie business in sweden seems to have troubles these days, long gone are the golden days of "rymdinvasion i lappland". and this movie seems to have some troubles on its own: it's just too much talk in it, it still manages to be somewhat amusing mainly for the good fx, which are great for a b-movie. the script and most of the acting is still pretty bad though, but that actually don't matter that much, it's supposed to be a gore flick and nothing more, that's where it goes a bit wrong for some reason. there's is simply not enough blood to fill the void. <br /><br />every person who know about gert fylking will have a good laugh over his role as a sgt. though. i nearly laughed my ass off. it's really that hilariously bad. <br /><br />besides the good parts i've listed there's really nothing else to recommend here unless you're starved for swedish b-movies.<br /><br />4/10
