this review contains spoilers.<br /><br />i was searching through horror movie dvds on amazon when i came across flight of the living dead. i already knew from the name that it was going to be abysmally naff and most probably a rip-off of snakes on a plane, but it was selling brand new for 69p so i figured i didn't really have much to lose.<br /><br />the music played over the opening credits didn't fit at all, although i did like the song itself a pop-rock song isn't really suitable to appear on the soundtrack of a zombie horror movie. it started off surprisingly well, the opening scenes weren't too bad, some of the acting was a little cringe-worthy but not as bad as i initially thought it would be.<br /><br />it all goes well until laura cayouette (rocket from kill bill: vol. 2) enters the picture. she is supposed to be playing a scientist. if she is, she's not a very bright one. luckily she's polished off pretty quickly.<br /><br />i actually physically laughed out loud when the camera panned over the passengers of the plane during some turbulence. there was a nun. have you ever been on a plane with a nun!? i was surprised she wasn't clutching a crucifix.<br /><br />finally, after 35 minutes, we get to some zombie action, and use the word 'action' loosely. the special effects are pretty below standard, but that's to be expected from a movie with this budget. being covered in blood and having yellow contact lenses does not make you look like a zombie though, it makes you look pretty amusing. using slow motion doesn't work particularly well either. i think this movie is probably guilty of trying to add too much story. trying to pass off the problem as a variant of the "malaria virus" wasn't an especially good move either considering malaria isn't a virus.<br /><br />the rest of the movie pretty much plays out like any other zombie movie. most of the characters are killed off and it eventually ends up with a handful of people fighting to stay alive. possibly the worst part of flight of the living dead is the utterly inconceivable ending. i know it's a movie about people who come back to life and feast on the living, but the ending was just ridiculous. rating:
