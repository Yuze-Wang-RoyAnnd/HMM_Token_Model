"dr. cameron, a discredited scientist succeeds with his experiment in creating serum the transforms men into wolf-like creatures. originally developing this formula to help the world, the scientist decides to use his newly created subject to exact revenge upon the scientists who were responsible for his ouster from the scientific community. the scientist's daughter lenora grows wary of her father's actions and shares her suspicions with a newspaper reporter. when the scientist loses control of his creature, it falls upon the scientist's daughter and the reporter to stop it," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />mad scientist george zucco (as lorenzo cameron) creates his formula rather unimaginatively, by mixing human and wolf blood. this brings the beast out in hulking glenn strange (as petro aka pedro), who is directed to act like lon chaney jr. in "of mice and men". johnny downs (as tom gregory) and anna nagel (as lenora cameron) are a likable werewolf hunter and damsel in distress. certainly, "the mad monster" is no substitute for "the wolf man"; but, it's a serviceable addendum. the grainy black-and-white photography enhances the foggy, cow-webbed atmosphere. "god" (uncredited) strikes up a well-done ending, too. like blaine (robert strange) said, "mingling the blood of man and beast is downright sacrilege!" <br /><br />**** the mad monster (1942) sam newfield ~ george zucco, johnny downs, anna nagel
