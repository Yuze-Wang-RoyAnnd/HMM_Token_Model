i wrote spoiler alert, but there's not really much that can be spoiled. it's like spoiling rotten meat. this movie is probably the worst i've ever seen. not because of the actors or the special effects, but because of the sheer number of mistakes, both factual and physical. first of all, the migs aren't actually migs at all. they're mirages, and they're french. and how the heck can doug's dad withstand the maneuvers his son makes to fight off the "migs" without a g-suit? and why would chappy try to board his plane without a g-suit? and how could doug defeat the enemy pilot ace with such ease? anyway, i did not like this movie. and the worst part is that it has 3 sequels, the latest one from as late as 1995. now that's scary.
