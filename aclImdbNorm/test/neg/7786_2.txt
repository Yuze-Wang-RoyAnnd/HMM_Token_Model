when a bbc murder thriller is this rife with heterosexual dysfunction, you know who the killer must be: the homosexual.<br /><br />who murdered the sexy blonde teenager (who's also a pathological liar) on her way home from school? let's see, could it be the mother who (against all common sense) is letting her teenaged son make unchaperoned visits to his serial-killer father behind bars? could it be the moody son, who's impressed by his dad's no-nonsense attitude about women? could it be the serial killer himself, who seems able to manipulate events from behind bars, a la hannibal lecter? could it be mom's boyfriend, a teacher at the school whose affair with an ex-student led to his wife's suicide? or could it be boyfriend's daughter, who goes blabbing everyone's secrets at school, causing untold misery? no, it's none of these likely suspects. it's...the homosexual!<br /><br />the only mystery for the viewer is guessing who the homosexual is. of course, it could be anybody, since the only characteristics of the homosexual are shameful secrecy and a propensity to murder and otherwise make life complicated for the "normal" folks. the homosexual is the invisible root cause of society's ills; only when this person is exposed and eliminated can the fractured family come back together, and things can return to normal...whatever that is.<br /><br />as for the cast, both jemma redgrave and robson green are now officially past their sell-by dates. the world could get by marvelously without ever seeing either on screen again, but as long as the bbc has roles for the aggrieved woman and the misunderstood man, i suppose they'll keep coming back in movies like this one.
