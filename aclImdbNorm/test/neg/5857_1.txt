i saw this film last night, a satire of the reality style programs that seem to be making the rounds at the moment.<br /><br />what can i say. i absolutely hated it. about as interesting as watching paint dry and with maybe one or two only slightly amusing moments.<br /><br />maybe it had something to do with me definately not being a fan of the survivor and big brother type shows, but if this had been a video/dvd or if i'd been watching at the cinema on my own i would have definately not endured more than the first 5 minutes.<br /><br />
