this movie is so irredeemably bad, nothing about it makes it worth seeing. no effects, no suspense and poor dialogue poorly delivered. oh, and neither a camp or any fear does it contain. do yourself a favor and go see the original friday the 13th or (preferably) sleepaway camp, but what ever you do, do not see this movie. <br /><br />even michele bauer's appearance at the very beginning can't save it. usually, in these kinds of films you expect violence, suspense, and a little gore and some t&a. the violence was poorly executed, the "suspense" was laughable, there was no gore, and the t&a is plentiful in the first 5 minutes, then, nothing. at least one of these things, properly done would have at least made it watchable. <br /><br />to say at least one nice thing about it, buck flower is great, he seems to be the only one who understands they are making schlock and rightly hams it up. if everyone else had fit that tone it would have been campy fun, no pun intended.
