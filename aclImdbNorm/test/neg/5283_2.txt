ugh, bad, bad, bad, but i have seen worse which is why i gave it a 2 instead of a 1. just got finished watching this movie and i thought it was about as rotten as the flesh on dr. chopper's face. the worst line of the movie had to be "i like to introduce you to someone... meet my inner b*tch" which consisted of the lone survivor of the fantastic 5 group throwing a trash can at dr. chopper and then falling on the stage. second worst line, "i'm the park ranger that's gonna f*ck you up" what, this freak ain't even a cop????? did anyone else notice how everyone instantly dies from the magic gut stab (no one dies that quick from a gut stab, i know this cause i see them frequently in the operating room) except super park ranger. dude had like a bucket of blood poor out of that wound, writhes around on the floor some, and then comes in for the finale to take a parting shot at dr. chopper while inner b*tch lies cowering on the floor. and if that don't beat all, he doesn't even have the decency to die then like everyone else. inner b*tch helps him limp outside and proceeds to tell him not to die while she runs for help cause he's like her only friend left alive now. since when did these two become friends? i don't think a frantic meeting in the woods where he tells you to head for the city qualifies as getting to know you time but whatever. <br /><br />only watch this movie if there's nothing else own and you have nothing else to do with your time.
