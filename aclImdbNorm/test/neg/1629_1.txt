even mst3k couldn't make this painful, long, and ultimately mind-bending drek funny or entertaining. while most bad movies in and of themselves are hilariously bad, this one is one of those few videos that uses the word bad in its literal sense.<br /><br />the element that makes this so painful to watch is not the lack of story, but the fact that soooo much background is crammed into the first half-hour that it is utterly ridiculous and harder to follow than a highway while driving with no headlights.<br /><br />the hero of the film, ator, is no more than eye-candy for this literal energy-sucker of a film. dressed in a loin-cloth and sporting "pecs like melons," as joel put it, he belongs more in a fitness magazine than here.<br /><br />i would recommend this only to die-hard, and i mean die-hard followers of cheese. if you have an enemy, recommend them this film. if you make it through this, i commend you. you should be able to make it through anything.
