i saw this movie when it first came to the theaters in 1988 and though i knew it wasn't of award winning caliber...i kinda liked it. it tales the tale of 5 former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids - which is to climb mt. whitehead. of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways, but none too differently than they were as children. richard lewis is still neurotic, richard belzer is still a playboy, franklyn ajaye is still sort of the dear abby of the group, and tim thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group. of course the top billed star is louie anderson, a "true believer" in everything cub scout related. he still lives in the same house with his mother, still goes over the cub scout manual daily, is brave, reverent and clean, and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in scouting. compounding their task, however, is the grunski brothers, two bullies drummed out of the cub scouts by the above mentioned. by coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit, albeit harmlessly. not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts, who think pack 7 is from the fbi and are intent on wiping them out. all in all, the movie still has bits of charm. observe richard lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot, for example, and you have a really funny bit going for you. upon further review, the entire film needed more of that type of observational humor. it doesn't hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure.
