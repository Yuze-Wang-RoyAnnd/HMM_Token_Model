certainly expected more after seeing the cast list, but wow!<br /><br />i think a first time director could have done a better job with this project, and the fact that a veteran like john buechler made it, puzzles me to no end. somehow, the budget allowed them to secure a bevy of d-list actors, whom they succeeded in embarrassing for an hour and a half. the unknown actors were just plain awful, less steve wastell who does a decent job as axl. the story is so bad, that it really needs no mention. the overall production value seems standard, with some above average camera work, if you can make it through the god-awful "slo-mo" scenes and the painful "person on fire" sequences. i knew it would be dumb, i just had no idea how dumb, and unfortunately it's time spent that can never be returned to me. i suppose if you enjoy really bad "b" films, this might work for you, but if you value any story at all, this one is simply dreadful... a complete waste of time.
