why does this piece of film have so many raving reviews? <br /><br />this is amateurish, unfunny and annoying.<br /><br />the only memorable thing here is the corny title song. <br /><br />the production values are low and the "comedic" (if you want to call them that) ideas are weak, they seem like leftovers of leftovers from snl that even they would not dare to have put on the screen.<br /><br />i'm beginning to thoroughly mistrust imdb ratings. <br /><br />this is light years away from kentucky fried movie - not even in the same galaxy.<br /><br />it's not even possible to write 10 lines about it.<br /><br />ok, another good thing: ugly street scenes and ugly people - something one doesn't get to see a lot in todays tv and movies.
