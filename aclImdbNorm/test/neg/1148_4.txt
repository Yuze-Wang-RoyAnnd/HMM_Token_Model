arthur miller has always been known as one of america's great playwrights for works such as "death of a salesman" and "the crucible". "focus" is one of his lesser known plays brought to the silver screen. however, knowing what a great playwright arthur miller is, i doubt that his original play was very much like the movie. the movie comes across as empty and formulaic, with william h. macy as a non-jew mistaken for a jew by anti-semitic neighbors in wwii brooklyn. don't get me wrong: the acting is ok, and i presume that the people behind this movie were probably trying to make a point about racism, but the movie just doesn't work. macy, laura dern and david paymer just can't create an effective story with the material here.
