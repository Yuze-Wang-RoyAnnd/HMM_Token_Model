i didn't see this movie when it originally came out, but there has been a couple songs sharing the title and the term still gets used from time to time and i figured there must be something to the flick, so i dug it up and gave a view. now i would like the approximate hour and forty five minutes of my life back(it seemed much longer). there was nothing particularly bad about the movie, the acting was good, no large plot holes, of course there wasn't much plot to have holes in. there just wasn't a lot to the movie. there was some chemistry between the two but nothing compelling about their relationship; nothing interesting about their story. near the end when he attempts to chase down the train to catch his fleeing romance, neither my wife nor i wanted him to catch her. honestly we figured they were better off with out each other and if they did get back together we really didn't care. so what's that say about this love story when even a 25 year old sappy romantic like my wife had no emotional investment in the relationship. i should have left this one in the "missed" category.<br /><br />logan lamech www.eloquentbooks.com/lingeringpoets.html
