blame guy ritchie. the late 90s success of ritchie's clich'e-ridden lock stock and two smoking barrels triggered a series of pitiful gangster movies from which the genre never really recovered. sadly rise of the footsoldier - the true story of essex hardnut carlton leach - isn't likely to reverse that trend. despite a decent lead performance from hartnett, the film falls victim to all-too familiar east end stereotypes. they're either busy blowing someone's brains out or shagging a scantily-clad blonde.<br /><br />from fearsome football hooligan in the eighties to a key figure in the criminal underworld during the nineties, footsoldier charts leach's rise through the ranks of thuggery. leaving the terraces for nightclubs, leach becomes a bouncer where he's given carte blanche to kick the crap out of anyone. here he gets in with notorious gangland leaders pat tate (fairbrass) and tony tucker (stone), and begins to realise gang-warfare ain't what it's cracked up to be.<br /><br />there is fun to be had deconstructing writer-director julian gilbey's laughable join-the-dots yob patois, as every sentence seems to start with an, 'i'm gonna fackin'
