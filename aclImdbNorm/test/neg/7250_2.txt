if i'm to like a movie, i need to care about the lead characters and what happens to them. in this waste-pod of a film, i found myself hoping that they would all die in the end. none of the characters are people that you'd ever want to meet, they all made me sick. if not for a few nude scenes, i would have given this wretched movie a 1.
