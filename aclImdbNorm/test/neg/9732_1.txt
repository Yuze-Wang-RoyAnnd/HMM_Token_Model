it seems whenever a mainstream film company wants to make a movies for teens it concentrates on only one thing: sex. don't get me wrong, i'm no prude but the fact that these people seem to think getting my rocks off is all i'm interested in is highly offensive. take the convenant, a film that relies so heavily on you finding the main characters attractive it thinks it can get away without a plot and/or a script that wasn't written by a six year old. this is essentially the craft with (supposedly) hot guys. and, yeah, that's it. it bored me to tears. even my friend, who usually laps us crap films, hated it. it is really stunningly bad, to the extent where it can actually be funny. i would have laughed if it wasn't for the fact that several other females in cinema attendance seemed to be enjoying it. they were accompanied by several shifty looking guys who positively curled up and died when the (really clich'e) boy on boy kiss happened towards the end. watching them squirm really was the highlight of the film. i don't think mainstream, hollywood cinema will ever put out good films for teenagers (or, indeed, for anyone) so i think i'll give up. unless you're a teen who likes the pussycat dolls, thinks paris hilton is "hot" and watches mtv it's like some sort of wasteland. life's hard when you're a fifteen year old who likes art house. :( p.s. someone should have told the director that not all teenage girls find would be boy band members "totally hawt lol!!!111!!"
