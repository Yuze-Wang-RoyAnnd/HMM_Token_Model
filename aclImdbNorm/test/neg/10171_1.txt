like a lot of the comments above me, also i though this was the average scifi movie, but unfortunately it was not. i found it rather patronizing, and indeed, preaching.<br /><br />but that is not the only comment. the scenes are very 'artificial' (not as in scifi, as i will explain a in a few moments). (the next sentence is a small spoiler.) the movie more or less represents a discussion between two groups. the physical setting of a discussion typically involves two or three men standing next to each other, the middle one typically speaking. in the worst case, the other party is represented by one person.<br /><br />also the interviews the reporters have are very artificial, sometimes even unprofessional. for example sometimes the discussion is between the reporters (i mean, from a point of the interviewed, 'akward'). moreover the interview persons always stay calm, they say everything without normal emotions. i.e. you cannot tell whether they lie or not, are mad or not. they show almost nothing.<br /><br />this is also very unprofessional, the 'christian' reporters always believe everything they are told by the people they interview.<br /><br />bottom line:<br /><br />all conversations contain:<br /><br />- facts<br /><br />- pro/con arguments<br /><br />there are no lies. nobody lies. (the next sentence is a spoiler, ignore if you still plan to see the movie) the only lie happening is to demonstrate how 'bad' non-believers are.<br /><br />this makes me conclude that the movie is a b-movie. it is very similar to 'plan 9 from outer space' (from the 50's), but this movie also has an annoying, wrong set discussion about aliens and christian belief.<br /><br />note: i have no intention to insult christians, people who believe in aliens or whomever else. this is a thought i have about the movie, not about people.<br /><br />moreover i would like to note that i don't know whether the actors are bad or were just given terrible scripts.
