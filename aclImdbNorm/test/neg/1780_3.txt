some giant scorpions are on a submarine and kill everybody. two months later, some marines and the scientists in charge of the scorpion project go to the sub to retrieve their cargo. after finding 200 dead bodies, the marine commander tells the doctor "i need to know if there's anything down here that could be a danger to my men". uh, gee...ya think? she refuses to tell him what is down there, citing "need to know". yup, that pretty well sizes it up. one of the scientists is apparently some sort of idiot savant - real heavy on the idiot, light on the savant. he's given the task of fixing the lights. he finds the control panel for the lights, cuts a wire, and shrieks like a banshee. then he does it again. then he takes a hammer and smashes the control panel to pieces, which causes all the lights on the submarine to start working.<br /><br />and so it goes. apparently this was made in sweden; i'm not sure if the swedes have a really weird sense of humor or if they're just really awful movie makers. i'm inclined to think they're awful movie makers. if you guessed that there's a huge explosion at the end of this thing, well, sorry, but that's on a need-to-know basis, so i can't tell you.<br /><br />if you've absolutely got to see a giant scorpion movie, let me suggest tail sting, which is a cheesy and fun movie about scorpions on a plane, or bugs, which is a fairly descent b movie about scorpions in a tunnel. look at this movie as an absolute last resort. oh, it's watchable, it's hard to turn it off just because of the sheer lunacy of it, but that's about all it's got going for it.
