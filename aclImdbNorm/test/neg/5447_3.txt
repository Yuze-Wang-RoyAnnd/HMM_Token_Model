i'm really not too sure why people are being so complimentary about this odd movie. having said that - i did actually sit through the entire 2 hours and can't say it wasn't entirely un-entertaining.<br /><br />i think the key problem is that frank marshall is not a true director and this is clear in the film - he is an experienced producer, so will have seen a movie made many a time, and will understand what goes into the process. but i think this is quite different to being able to truly direct a movie - the direction was competent, but somehow flat and direction-less. marshall has more experience as a unit or second director, and this came through, i feel, in the finished product - it appeared to be a group of sets that failed to really have any continuity in its feel or its character.<br /><br />fun, watchable, but good? no.
