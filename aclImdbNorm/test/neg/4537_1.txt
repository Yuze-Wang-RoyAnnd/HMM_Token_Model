comedy is a hard beast to conquer. ishimoto fails on all accounts, as a writer and director. some things, like making movies that are funny, just need to be left to the professionals. 1 out of 10. awful. it wasn't funny. i tried to laugh but it just wasn't funny. i wasn't the only one, no-one else at the chicago festival was laughing either, at least at the showing i saw. simply very bad, sorry :(
