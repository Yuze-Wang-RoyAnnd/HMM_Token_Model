<br /><br />as a fan of bad movies (and mst3k, and a member of mft3k), i must say i've seen my share of them. but geez! even the worst i've seen at least had a soundtrack. as george lazenby stiffly wanders around hong kong, doing who knows what, you can guarantee that you won't be distracted by any of that background music that fills todays cinema. or any of that music that fills elevators. i don't think anyone in this film even hums.<br /><br />now, this isn't entirely true -- there *is* a sound track. if you listen closely, you will hear it chime in about a half-dozen times through the course of the film. of course, the timing will be entirely inappropriate, and it doesn't last very long, but something that could be classified as "music" does occur. your best bet, though, is to sit your toddler armed with a wooden spoon down in front of the tv with a collection of pots and pans while you watch. the rhythm and flow would be better than anything the film offers.<br /><br />keep an eye out for sammo hung as a minor villian in this film. aren't we all glad he found jackie chan to work with?
