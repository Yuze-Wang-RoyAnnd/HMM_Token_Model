this movie is bad.<br /><br />this movie is really bad.<br /><br />this movie is might as well be half a minute long and shown 200 times in a row, because you'd get the same effect.<br /><br />the phone rings. man a answers the phone and gets annoyed by man b. man a curses off man b, and then hangs up the phone. repeat.<br /><br />this is the entire movie.<br /><br />do not watch this movie. trust me.
