they used footage of some real protest spliced with some woman talking about a society with no men to make it seem like these people were cheering for the 'gendercide' of men. the funny thing is, you can see a man cheering on his own death in the background.<br /><br />ok, the plot. some lady says there should be a society with no men, and the crowd in front of her (which contains some men) think its a great idea. so then all the men are killed or something. so there are no more.<br /><br />then this blonde scientist creates a man, but removes some chromosomes so he can't be violent. the male grows very quickly and soon is a full grown man. not long after, he takes the blonde's' volkswagen beetle and drives into the city where he's discovered. now you would think the lone man in a city full of lesbians would be the happiest guy ever but no way. the police chase him.<br /><br />i didn't watch the rest but it probably ends up that they've got to race against the clock and some people, or something bad will probably happen. somehow the man ends up in a stadium with some other men who want him to lead the rebellion. these brave warriors hiding in a stadium might have had some sort of plan which laid out the details of how they'd single handedly get rid of a planet full of women, but i didn't watch. and neither should you.<br /><br />if you're up late and channel surfing and this happens to come on, don't watch. watch anything but this. you'll find those ads for bowflex or the ones with women in bathing suits asking you to 'pick up the phone to meet women just like these' in your area will be more satisfying entertainment.<br /><br />(oh yeah, there's this funny thing when they're pulling in with their cars. i don't know what they did, it looks like they drove in real slow and careful but then tried to speed up the film to compensate but it just looks really weird.) <br /><br />the blonde girl was kind of cute and i'm feeling generous, so... 2/10.
