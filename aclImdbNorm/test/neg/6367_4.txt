this year's eurovision was to me a big disappointment. i've watched the eurovision song contest every year since 1986 (well, at least that's the earliest one i can remember, and i was only 2 at the time). as any other year this one contained both good, bad and horrible songs - nothing new there. however this year's show was the worst one i can remember. only very few good (decent's probably more like it) songs and a lot of absolutely terrible songs.<br /><br />turkey's winner song "every way that i can" sounded to me like a rip-off of turkish singer tarkan's hit "simarik", just sounding a lot worse. it didn't deserve to win from my point of view. belgium's song "sanomi", coming in second, was a no-language song. wonder what's next? animals singing? nevertheless the music for the song was quite catchy, giving the song a kind of dreamy feeling, to which the "lyrics" seemed appropriate. one of the better songs, but that's not saying much.<br /><br />after one of the closest races in eurovision history russian duo t.a.t.u. ended in third place just three points behind turkey and behind belgium, with "ne ver', ne boisia" ("don't trust, don't be afraid"). to me t.a.t.u. was one of the very few highlights of the show, surprising just about everyone by being some of the most covered up girls of all the female contestants. they let their song do the talking and if we ignore the fact that they failed to pitch a few times in the first chorus, they let the song speak very well indeed.<br /><br />the biggest surprise when looking at the scoreboard was austria. the bookmakers here in denmark had the biggest odds on that song - a song that indeed was beyond horrible - but ended up in 8th place. could it be that bum of his being shaken to the rhythm of the song? that performance was the one that made me and my family laugh the most, not because it looked good, but because it looked so stupid that it was actually fun.<br /><br />sweden did what they do the best; abba. in 1999 they won with "take me to your heaven", by sounding like abba. in 2001 they made the top 10 with "listen to your heartbeat", again sounding like abba, and once again this year they did it abba-style, again ending in the top 10.<br /><br />england was finally punished for making those absolutely horrible, non-catching songs, that they've been the past years.<br /><br />ireland ripped off the winner from 2000, "fly on the wings of love". and i could go on and on about how bad the songs were.<br /><br />i feel a bit sorry for the aussies, who this year finally got the chance to see the eurovision song contest. they deserved better than this.<br /><br />i wasn't surprised by the show though. the eurovision from 2000 to me stands out as one of the best in recent years. 2001 was quite good, but not as good. 2002 was okay, but certainly no more. this year was quite simply disappointing.<br /><br />let's hope it'll get better next year. if not for us, then at least for the aussies.<br /><br />4/10. one for t.a.t.u., one for the close race, one for the butt-shaking and one for all the rest.
