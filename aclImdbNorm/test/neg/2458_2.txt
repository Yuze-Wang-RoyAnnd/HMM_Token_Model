what i came away with after watching this movie was a guilty conscience. the film itself has a rather intriguing plot line and premise to it, but unfortunately it is a movie that you cannot watch with out being bombarded with pornography. if you plan on viewing this and have a moral problem with the degradation of the marital act for the viewing pleasure of an audience then you are making a big mistake. this is not the type of movie with the token sex scene that you can skip on your dvd player. near the beginning of the film baldwin's character is video taping his sexual exploits without the knowledge of his partner. this tape and others like it continue to pop up throughout the movie at unpredictable times. it appears that the film is attempting to make a statement about the dignity of women. ironically in doing so they made multiple women into prostitutes. i only gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because had they handled baldwin's promiscuity better it would have been an interesting film.
