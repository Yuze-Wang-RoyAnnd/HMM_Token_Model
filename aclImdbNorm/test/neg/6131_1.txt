jesus christ, what the hell happened here?. this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen, how is it possible that they screwed up such a nice idea for a movie. to tell you the truth i was so hyped for this, i though it was like blair witch but with actual alien creatures chasing the camera guy. goddamn it, i have been reduced to fast forwarding this pile of sh*t, and i never do that while seeing movies. the high rating here on imdb makes me believe that actual aliens are giving 10's for this piece of crap.<br /><br />invasion is about well, an invasion. the movie starts by saying that everything you're about to see is real, blahblahblah. then they go and tell me about a special camera system used in cars, as if i need to believe their bullsh*t to enjoy this movie. next thing you know i'm seeing the most boring car driving ever filmed, in a forest at night mind you. is this a movie, or a disney theme park ride? the first 20 minutes is all boring dialog between cops while seeing grass and one straight road with a flashlight. where the hell were the aliens?! they were sleeping of course! then we learn that bad acting is not only reduced to high school plays, as the cop behind the camera goes out of his car to look for a missing man who was 'nightfishing' and had stumbled upon a mysterious meteorite. i wonder what happens to him? out of nowhere, we see the 'nightfishing' guy walking like a zombie. the cop is apparently too dumb to notice that something is wrong with this man. apparently he was indeed dumb, as the zombie/alien guy injects in the cop's ear some sort of alien parasite, thus changing him into an alien. then the cop/alien goes back into his car, looks for a young couple that were having sex a while back in the forest, gets to them, changes the guy into an alien, and then the girl runs to the cop's car and escapes. if this quick plot introduction didn't get it in your head that this movie was bad, then the following 40 minutes will. watching this movie is as painful as stabbing yourself repeatedly with a plastic fork. the script, while it may sound interesting on the back of the dvd box, is badly directed and sadly, we are left with another boring straight to dvd atrocity.<br /><br />the only thing that kept me awake were the constant flashing and loud sound effects (lamentably). if seeing the same forest trail for 63 minutes is not enough, we must endure crappy flashing techniques to "scare" the viewer and constant wailing of a bad actress that gets old and annoying pretty quick.<br /><br />if you feel you must rent this, i say to you, why? there are better scifi/horror films out there. even the dreaded remake of the invasion of the body snatchers is more entertaining than this. for the love of all things good, don't bother with his crap. my eyes bled, and for the first time, i wanted suicide. a 1/10, avoid this like a disease.
