the story was disjointed, the acting was not of any callibre you can catagorise. more of a serial pilot than an actual movie. i wanted to like this movie but just could not find anything to like about it. whatever it was that made the lost boys so likable was obviously absent here. altho it tried hard. plot hooks were clumsily placed amidst what could have been an episode of dawsons creek with dark clothes, and the story arc was going nowhere soon. very disappointing for me. the end scenes were special effects driven convenience and how the villain of the story planned his whole scheme.. who was he (or she) trying to kid, talk about naive. stick with films of this kind of genre from the eighties, when they had more of an idea.
