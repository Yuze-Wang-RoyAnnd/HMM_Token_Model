i saw this movie over 20 years ago and had rather fond memories of it. catching again on cinemax this month, i realized how little discernment i had about films back then. this is an utterly ordinary spaghetti western, with absolutely nothing noteworthy about it. script, direction, acting, photography are all a big blah. stick with the sergio leone westerns!
