first, i must point out that the role wendell corey played was exceptional. usually, corey was relegated to supporting roles but here he is what helps carry this very limp film. without him and the character he played, the film would have been a lot worse--hardly meriting a 2 or 3.<br /><br />so why did i hate the rest of the film so much? well, one of my pet peeves is when characters act "too stupid to live". you can't base major plot points on the assumption that your major characters are completely stupid (unless having a brain injury is part of the plot, of course). but this is exactly what happens in this film. wendell corey is a crazed man who has murdered three innocent people and they know his next target is joseph cotten's wife. so what do they do? yep, they provide really inadequate police protection and a plan that makes no sense at all (no marksman and guys with shotguns that are so far away they probably won't stop this madman). and if this isn't bad enough, the marked woman inexplicably runs away from her hiding place and walks right into the worst possible place she could be! is anyone that stupid?!?! arrrggghhhh---i hate when movies have such dumb characters. in fact, i found myself rooting for corey since i felt the idiots deserved to die for their behaviors! in addition to these clich'ed characters, there was also a bit player who fainted. sure, seeing your husband shot might cause someone to faint, however in real life this is a rare occurrence--people rarely faint unless there is a medical reason. so, combining this with the above character problems is a real nightmare for people who are looking for realism--something film noir movies must have.<br /><br />all these serious problems are even more infuriating since wendell corey's character is amazingly well-written and conceived. it was his chance to shine as an actor--too bad the rest of the movie was so limp that corey and the basic plot idea are sunk. this is one film that could really use a remake--but this time without brainless characters.
