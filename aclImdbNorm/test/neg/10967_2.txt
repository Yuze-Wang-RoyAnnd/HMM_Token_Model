one look at the rating ought to tell you this movie was voted on by shills, in an attempt to artificially boost this film's ratings.<br /><br />this film brings nothing new to the zombie genre. in fact, it is laughably bad (in acting and cinematography) and derivative in its plot. the make-up looks horrible and the zombies look even worse when shot. lines are stiffly delivered and badly timed, with the exception of the female bounty hunter, who is the only good actor in this mess of a film. the worst offenders are the italian guy (hans), ryn the protagonist, and the lead bad guy. i've seen better delivery from pizza truck with a flat tire. <br /><br />this is a self-proclaimed "zombie western", but about the only thing that makes this a "zombie western" is the fact that people wear cowboy hats and the lead actor's real name is clint. the protagonist isn't cool and mysterious like a traditional eastwood hero, and as an anti-hero, he doesn't have the wise-cracking attitude to pull it off either.<br /><br />don't be fooled by the fake glowing reviews. this is just another b-grade zombie movie that's competently made for the budget it had (it does have some decent lighting), but it reeks of low-budget, first-time directing and bad acting. there are a lot of really stupid scenes that make this look really amateurish.
