was really looking forward to seeing a continuation of lonesome dove but this was total garbage. cinematography was terrible. shot way too tight. was almost viewing the grand canyon through a stationary telescope. editing was cut, cut, cut. not even smooth. more like a bad student editor. don't know if mcmurtry did the screen play but the dialog was terrible. really like val kilmer's portrayal of doc holiday in wyatt earp but what in heck was he doing with this character in comanche moon??? i have no idea. even looked like it was shot on a sound stage using the old bonanza sets. how can the director of the original lonesome dove gone so wrong with this? where was his head.............. can't say much for the acting either. it's a shame to have messed up such a beautiful western that could have been but more like they rushed this one just to get it in the can. have read other reviews and see that others felt the same way. not even curious to watch the next few nights cause it would be just a waste of time like the first night was.<br /><br />(2nd post)..................ok, since nothing else was on tv i must be honest and admit that i watched the last 2 nights of comanche moon. and i will be honest to tell you that i didn't make it to the end of either of the last 2 episodes because i fell asleep! i can only admit that i was watching the two main characters very closely and i could pick out some mannerisms that steve zahn did while portraying the character that duval did such an excellent job with. so i must give zahn credit for that. as for karl urban's portrayal....simple dead meat. can only say again that i was very disappointed only because i cared so much for the original ld and like others .......have defended my feelings for a truly great western.
