the best thing i can say about "quintet" is that it's not quite as bad as i remembered it being on my first viewing.<br /><br />but that doesn't mean it's good.<br /><br />this weird, sci-fi thriller is not quite like any other movie i've ever seen, which i guess at least gives it the stamp of novelty. but it's a borderline disaster of a movie, and one of the worst robert altman ever made. on the dvd special feature about the making of "quintet," it's clear that even altman didn't know what the hell the movie was supposed to be.<br /><br />it's set in some distant future when the world is in the grip of another ice age. the film was shot at the abandoned site of the montreal expo '67, and i do have to admit that this gives the movie some interesting production design elements, even if much of it looks like it's being filmed in an iced-over shopping mall. paul newman, looking zonked out and absolutely disinterested in anything going on around him, and brigitte fossey, play drifters who wander into this futuristic city looking for newman's brother. soon newman is caught up in a deadly game of "quintet," which all of the bored inhabitants play for lack of anything better to do, and the rules of which are never made clear to the audience. all we know is that the object of the game it to kill everyone else you're playing with and remain the only person alive. this gives these nihilistic inhabitants their only thrill, because as one of them says at one point in a psychobabblish soliloquy, only by being near to death can one appreciate being alive.<br /><br />the movie is slow, ugly and actually uncomfortable to watch due to its unrelenting gloominess. it's almost as if altman was purposely setting out to make a movie no one would want to sit through. there aren't characters -- oh sure, actors walk around speaking lines, but none of the lines really means much and the impressive list of international actors altman assembled for this register not a whit. only bibi andersson gives the closest thing to a memorable performance as could possibly be found in a movie like this. but nevertheless, it does succeed in establishing an atmosphere, even if that atmosphere is one of pure awfulness, and it is oddly fascinating in the way that watching a man slowly starve himself to death would be fascinating.<br /><br />altman really hit a dry spell after nearly a decade of superb films. "quintet" followed close on the heels of the atrocious "a wedding" and was followed in short order by the not bad but mostly forgettable "a perfect couple," the by-all-accounts terrible "health" (which i've never seen because it's not available anywhere to see) and the disastrous "popeye." thank god he rebounded.<br /><br />grade: d-
