while traveling with a team of misses for the dispute of the miss galaxy, the airplane piloted by maximus powers (eric roberts) and mike saunders (charlie schlatter) crashes in an isolated, where lays noah's ark protected by the jurassic pork. while the group fight to survive, alien apes plot to use the ark to destroy the human race and dominate planet earth.<br /><br />i like parodies, but "miss castaway" is an offense to human brains. the awful story and the special effects are very, but really very bad. there are spoofs with "lost", "castaway", "jurassic park", "sixth sense", "titanic", "planet of the apes", "raiders of the lost ark", "congo", "mib", "perfect storm", "austin powers", "jaws", "mission impossible", "close encounters of the third kind", "star wars" and "hulk", but the problem is that most of them are very silly and not funny. in the end, the trailer is better than the film. my vote is four.<br /><br />title (brazil): "miss~ao quase imposs'ivel" ("mission almost impossible")
