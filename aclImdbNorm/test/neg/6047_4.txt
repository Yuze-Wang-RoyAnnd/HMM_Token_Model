in chicago, four electricians leaded by dean (richard grieco) come to an old building to disconnect power. they accidentally activate a portal and arrive in another dimension, where chicago was destroyed by a spider queen and inhabited by mutants. the group meets survivors leaded by crane (david nerman) and elena (kate greenhouse), and finds the inventor of the portal, dr. richard morelli (colin fox), who has been living in this dimension for thirty years. they join forces, trying to rebuilt a portal to bring them back home. "webs" is a watchable plagiarizing of "sliders", only worse. most of the dialogs seem to be written by a person who has not concluded the elementary school, so imbecile they are. further, the story is illogical, and seems that chicago is the only city in the world. the scientist trying to start his sophisticated machine with broken wires as if he were stealing a car is very funny. the face of richard grieco looks like a white version of michael jackson and is horrible. if the viewer shuts-down his or her brain, he or she may like this forgettable tv movie. my vote is four.<br /><br />title (brazil): "na teia do terror" ("in the web of horror")
