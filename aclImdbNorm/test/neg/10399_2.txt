i was surprised to discover michael moore or bill maher wasn't involved with this "movie". an american leftist laundry list of axes to grind, with a distinct sparseness of democrats in hell. mao zedong and karl marx didn't make an appearance in hell, but ronald reagan is in the same room with hitler? perhaps we'll have to wait for these california spin doctors to butcher paradiso for them to show all of their pet ideologue political figures.<br /><br />cheap shots at religion, right-wing politicians, corporations and their lobbyists, fox news, even suvs. all the radical leftist talking points were too completely covered - while conspicuously omitting references to wrongdoing from the "other side of the aisle" - to not have been a conscious effort. the singular exception i noticed, in the hour and a half, is jfk has to have sex with marilyn monroe for eternity: the token inclusion in these propaganda pieces in a pathetic attempt at appearing non-partisan.
