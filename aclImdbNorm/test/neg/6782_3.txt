some folkie friends recommended this, but as a film it's really lacking in originality. i found the characters to be unflattering stereotypes, and the plot is predictable almost from the beginning. however, if you like traditional english/appalachian ballads, it will keep your interest long enough to hear the next one. i've also read that the soundtrack is nothing like the music in the movie, with professional musicians filling in for the actors.
