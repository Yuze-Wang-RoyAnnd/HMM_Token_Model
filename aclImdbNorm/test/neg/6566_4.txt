i don't think i can add much more to what has already been said about this film. however, i can offer a small recollection from seeing st-v in the theater. in the last (dreadful) scene, as the camera is pulling out from the camping shot and it seems likely that the credits will start rolling at any second, the audience seemed to rise in unison. normally, for a movie like this, at least -some- die-hard fans stay to watch right up until the final disclaimer. as the people filed out, i remember hearing no laughing and cheerful banter, only low murmurs.<br /><br />i remember reading a movie review in the local paper in which the critic said that it was so bad that only trek fans would like it. what an idiot. the fans were the ones most apt to tear it apart first!<br /><br />favorite worst scene: target shooting on a voyager space probe, through a periscope no less! space must be a much smaller frontier than we thought.
