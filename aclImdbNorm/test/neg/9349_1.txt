i like the "star wars" series. i like a good, cheapo sci-fi flick every once in a while, too. heck, i even like the roger corman-produced nickel-and-dime jobbies.<br /><br />i do not like "the ice pirates", though. <br /><br />for one, it just looks too cheap, you know? for a movie that's supposed to take place in outer space, it feels cramped and closed-in like it's being filmed in the front seat of someone's mazda. and the special effects, while appropriately cheesy, look more than anything like foam rubber painted metallic gray.<br /><br />usually, i don't let things like that bother me, especially if the story and the characters are worthwhile.<br /><br />they ain't.<br /><br />the whole storyline, about these ne'er-do-well space pirates who decide to find a planet loaded with ice they can melt down and sell as water (a hot commodity in the future, i guess) is about as original as the jokes, which is not a compliment.<br /><br />the humor comes in at about crotch-level (like that castrating machine you'll see early on), and everyone seems to have a cranky attitude. and who told john matuzak that he was funny? whoever did, shame on them. good old robert urich tries, but he's a reliable actor on board a badly sinking ship (or starship, in this case). <br /><br />i watched this one about three times and ended up feeling the same way every time - shanghaied.<br /><br />no stars. in spite of of the presence of huston (one year prior to "prizzi's honor") and carradine (at the tail end of a once-lofty career), these "pirates" should walk the plank.
