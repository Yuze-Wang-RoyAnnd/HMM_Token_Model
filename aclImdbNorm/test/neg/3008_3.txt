there is nothing i hate more in a movie than pretentiousness, and this is one of the most pretentious films ever made. it's self-consciousness is obvious in every frame: "see what a profound, sophisticated film we are making," the director and screenwriters seem to be saying to us, and to themselves they say, "lets's see how we can bore and confuse the audience even more." i would rather watch the worst film by ed wood or edgar g. ulmer than something like this. at least they were giving us honest trash, and at least their films, in their own atrocious way, were entertaining. this film is about as entertaining as a root canal without anesthesia, and thus is tantamount to torture.<br /><br />have these screenwriters ever heard the word 'story?' it doesn't appear so. they have a concept, they are able to create an atmosphere, and they were able to assemble an excellent cast and elicit good performances from them. and for what? to bore us for an hour and 45 minutes? nothing really happens in this film. the only exciting part, and this lasts only about two minutes, occurs when one of the soon-to-be-evicted homeowners starts shooting at the state employees who come to tell him he has to leave. but nothing comes of it. too bad he didn't keep shooting until he hit the screenwriters. the only redeeming features of this film are the acting and some beautifully photographed scenery toward the end. 3/10
