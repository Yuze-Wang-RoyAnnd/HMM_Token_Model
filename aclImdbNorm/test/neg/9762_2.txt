i have always wanted to see the movie because i loved the novel, but was warned away because i'd heard that the movie was a stinker. it is. fowles wrote the script and i could follow it fine, despite the fact that i read the novel over thirty years ago.<br /><br />the soundtrack is execrable--jarring, jangling, and utterly inappropriate--breaking any attempt at mystery or mood in the movie. i suspect that the director must take a lot of the blame as even michael caine is terrible in it and he was already doing excellent work in alfie a couple of years earlier.<br /><br />the "mysteries" evoked by the book are not well-translated onto the screen. i'd love to see someone remake this one.
