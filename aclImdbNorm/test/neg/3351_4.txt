when you look at the cover and read stuff about it an entirely different type of movie comes to mind than what you get here. then again maybe i read the summary for the other movie called "mausolem" instead as there were two movies of this title released about the same time with both featuring plots that had key elements in common. however, reading stuff about that movie here i know i saw this one and not that one and that movie is even less what one would imagine a movie with that title would be about. i will be honest, i expect more of a zombie type picture and you get that in this movie to some degree. however, there is more stuff involving the occult and strange powers as the opening scene of the people being taken away by the coroner at the beginning of the film will attest to. the movie also has the old theme of kids going somewhere they do not belong to have some crazy party, in this case it is in fact a mausoleum. the other movie i do not think really has that key feature playing that prominent role in the movie and i see the score for this one is higher too, still it was just not the movie i was expecting.
