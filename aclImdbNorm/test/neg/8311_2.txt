as bad as this movie is, i really like it. the poor acting, dialogue and action made it so funny. i loved john travis from omega cop and stayed up all night working out how the death machines checked in at the airport if they can't speak, probably had to shake/nod at the security questions. actually why can't they speak!? it fails to adhere to any sort of movie making convention which makes it strangely interesting to watch- just lots of people getting killed around a very loose plot surrounding hired killers - no "machines" as such and those weird face/mountain things on the front cover and the trailer do not appear! i love the fact that there is no good guy in this film until about half way through and i love the numerous pointless scenes of that aeroplane landing - lots of people get killed who have nothing to do with the "plot" and no explanation is given about anything - do not expect to understand this film. instead admire how the main good guy can't even handle a random old guy in the bar - who is presented as the bad guy yet speaks out against the barman's decision to hire a scantily clad woman to dance badly in the corner for "entertainment" - all the good guys seem to enjoy this! why did old guy get to beat up our hero - and why did the random bloke decide to help old guy in the fight?! why did the hero collapse under one punch from old guy onto the bar where a stream of water jets out in the background so it looks like it's coming from his mouth? definite top 20 b-movie, must check for a part 2.
