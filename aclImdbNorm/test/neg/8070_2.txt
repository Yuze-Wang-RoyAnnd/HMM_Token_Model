rollerskating vampires?! i'm sorry but even for the 80's that's just way too cheesy to be remotely scary... you can excuse the original the odd kitsch moment because it was parodying old movies and tv shows, but that's been done once, so the sequel needed to be a little less camp, not even more outlandish! plus, the first movie had the presence of chris sarandon - a man who could even make stalking discotheques in casual knitwear seem seductive! - that this one sorely lacks, so there was no 'danger' in anything that happened, it just seemed silly.<br /><br />admittedly i only saw this once when i was 7, but by then already being a huge fan of the original i remember being disgusted. to me, there is no sequel to fright night, just a tacky spoof that doesn't deserve any appraisal whatsoever.
