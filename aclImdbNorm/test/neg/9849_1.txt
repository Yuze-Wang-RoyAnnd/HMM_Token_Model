there are so many things wrong with this movie i don't even know where to begin. the story is not cohesive at all. i guarantee that five minutes into the movie the average viewer will be scratching his/her head in confusion.<br /><br />here's what i remember of the movie before i was bored into unconsciousness: a quasi-abusive dad chases some pre-teen sisters through a house but turns out to be not that abusive after all. in the next scene, the girls are about 15. they're driving with their parents and hit a deer. the deer must have been explosive because their car blows up, one sister drags the other from the burning wreckage. then, the girls are drifting in a boat on a lake and make a huge plan to go to kentucky (??) and start a new life. in the very next scene, the girls are hitchhiking toward a military base. and what a military base it is. actually, it's more like a hog farm converted to look like a military base with plenty of confused extras playing "soldiers." the base commander's office is particularly awesome because there are random things like an ak-47 hanging on the wall and a drill sergeant hat mounted to a plaque (????) so the audience is sure to know that this is a military guy's office. then some random dude pushing a motorcycle shows up and the base commander orders him to go "into town" to buy some porn mags, and to make sure the soldiers don't think that he's on the "pink team." so our character takes a pickup converted to look like an army truck "to town" and loads up a box from a nondescript "book store" with a blowup doll by the front door. the girls hide in the guy's truck when he stops to gas up, and look through the porn stash to find items inside like the "anal invader." i guess that's enough of the plot to scare most people away. plot aside, the sound quality is terrible and the movie is full of cheesy attempts at symbolism, like a radio preacher talking about forbidden fruit during the scene where the "slutty" sister meets the main character for the first time, or how the camera lingers way too long on certain shots to try to convey a "message".<br /><br />if you ever see this for sale or rent or whatever, stay away. it's not worth the money in either case.
