there is somewhere in here the makings of a decent if routine sf story. it is thwarted by several factors. first, the actor is just awful. even the competent actors are awful. the dialog is wooden and stilted. the plot plods along predictably. this seems less like a finished movie than actors going through a walk through. extremely disappointing.
