i'm not surprised that so many people fell for this one. when i was watching this movie, a couple viewers next to me sobbed whenever you're "supposed" to sob -- or at least feel "touched". like when hunting said he didn't love the girl. like when robin williams' character (sorry i forgot his role's name) was telling hunting repeatedly "it's not your fault" (oh lord, just thinking of that scene gives me the goosebumps). i couldn't have cared less for what would happen to the characters. many people sob for hollywood manufactured characters they can't even relate to (think titanic; yuck!)... but it really only made me cringe and want to get out of the theatre. i guess i simply refuse to be psychically and emotionally manipulated by all this.<br /><br />folks it's not me who's being condescending ... those characters are, and for no good reason because they're unreal. worse yet, nothing is new or surprising. even robin williams' character is all cliched.<br /><br />i gave it 1 out of 10. it's probably not that bad; it's just quite mediocre... but so many people went to the other extreme and gave it a 10 so i figured a single balancing vote won't hurt.
