another movie from swedish hillbilly country, which is always the northern part. if black people were shown this way, there would be shouts about racism and for good reasons.<br /><br />this is a farce and you are supposed to laugh at the "clever" farce clich'es. but it's mostly tiresome. a gangster comedy, with the bad russians (as always) and the bad (and stupid) finns. and most stupid of all is of course the norwegian, according to stockholm prejudice.<br /><br />andreas wilson is the only one who tries to make a performance reminding us of reality. this is not funny. this is not even exciting. a burlesque too raw to make you interested in any way.
