what starts off fairly well (and quite disturbing) quickly sinks into an annoying mess.<br /><br />dee snider (of twisted sister infamy) apparently penned the screenplay from his own idea, and while the idea of a cyber-stalking pierce freak has potential, they really blow it here on uneven pacing, bad dialogue, and one of the greatest non-endings you'll ever see. despite some lifeless performances, the director manages a genuinely creepy first reel. this really looks like it's going to be a good low-budget effort.<br /><br />no such luck. the plot goes all over the map, and snider's character relentlessly spits out tiresome psychotic fortune cookie lines that are supposed to pass for meaningful dialogue. worse, the supporting cast barely registers, and the only halfway believable dialogue comes from a young girl who helps a detective navigate the internet.<br /><br />what a waste of a great idea. oh, and there is a new twisted sister song, if you care.
