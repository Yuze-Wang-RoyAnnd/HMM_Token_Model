i saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper. sometimes i can get into intellectual romantic movies. this movie just did not move me. i felt like it was about one hour too long. camille is portrayed as a very sympathetic sculptor, who loses just about everything. i thought the whole movie was just sad, and downcast. if you like tragedies, you might like this. i just thought it was too long, which meant it has many unnecessary scenes, which ultimately lead to about one hour of boredom. i would not recommend this movie. if you want to see a good romantic tragedy go watch titanic.
