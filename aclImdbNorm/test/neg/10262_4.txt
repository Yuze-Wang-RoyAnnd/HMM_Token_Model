saw this last night and being a fan of the first demons, i had hoped that the sequel would have the same fun, spooky spirit of it's predecessor. this is unfortunately not the case. the set-up is similar as the first, in which a horde of flesh-eating demons burst forth into reality by being released from a horror movie being played... (the first had been a movie theater, this one takes place in an apartment building and on tv.) once the demons are released, madness and mass carnage ensues. that's pretty much it as far as plot development goes. it worked nicely in the first part because of the ghoulish make-up fx, fast pace and unpredictability. the sequel, however, doesn't cut it. the first problem seems to be that there are way too many characters who we don't really care about one way or another. if they were annoying or idiots, then there would at least be some kind of gratification when they are inevitably butchered/demonized/eaten alive...but these people are just kind of there waiting to be slaughtered. plus, the fact that most of the characters are in different parts of the apartment building (and out of it), they are constantly cutting back and forth between them, which kept pulling me out of the story. there are some amusing bits, courtesy of the splatter fx and campiness. such as a constant flow of dripping blood eating through one floor's construction after another as if it were alien acid... the first demon possession of a crabby birthday girl leads to the destruction of her entire party, and a creepy demon child clawing his way into the room of a tenant who is pregnant with child. however, that sequence parlays into a ridiculous-looking rubber demon baby puppet thing that bursts from the chest of the human child that constantly flies across the room at its intended victim. i got a couple of chuckles out of that scene, but i don't think that was bava's intention. the scene probably would've worked better if they just kept the child demon around to attack the woman, but hey... other little things like the over-zealous acting of most of the characters and the bad dubbing don't help matters. in summation, i managed to see the unrated version on dvd, and can't imagine having to sit all the way through the previously only available r rated version, because the make-up fx and gore were the only thing i got out of it. also notable is an early role of producer argento's future hottie daughter, asia. in fact, she probably gives the best performance of the whole cast and she's barely on screen. argento/bava fan's might want to check it out just to see it, but will probably find themselves looking at their watch, like i did. gore fans might get a kick out of some of the fx, but will be laughing themselves out of their chairs at the most goofy-looking evil baby puppet since little selwyn from dead/alive. you could do worse, but it certainly doesn't live up to the original.
