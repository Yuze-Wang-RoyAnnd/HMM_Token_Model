some people think of sweden in a negative way: too neat, too clean, too serious, too organized and too northern. a people tortured by their own religious fate and history, sometimes leading to depression and compulsive heavy-handedness. this need not be a problem for a filmmaker, as for example the late bergman has shown us what can be cinematic possible under these conditions. bergman used his identity as a starting point and did not explicitly comment on this identity as such.<br /><br />andersson however does the reverse: he comments only on this identity hereby dissecting his people to the bone: in his world sweden is equivalent for hell on earth. but he does not take this any further and for me this is just not art but merely annotation. despite the exceptional amount of time it took to make this filmmaker has serious limitations he clearly cannot step out of.<br /><br />compared to his previous movie sanger fran andra vaningen / songs from the second floor, there is also not much progress to be observed. the intention was that this was more accessible, but the difference is minimal and the few scenes that try to please a larger audience aren't the best in the movie. the same absurdism and minimalism also still apply, there is the one-shot camera position and the (lack of) action in front of this shot. yes, the stills are well done, some of the scenes actually work and the coloring and positioning is amazing. but does that make an interesting movie? thinking in a negative way, this is cinema taken a step backwards.<br /><br />andersson's background as a maker of commercials shines through in the elaborate setup, but i find his movies about as empty as those commercials. there is a message about mankind, but it is trivial and without much depth.
