idiots go camping and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots, yes camp blood (or if you're wanting an awful, badder than bad pun that suits a badder than bad film, "camp bloody awful"), is so bad it's actually quite depressing to watch. and it has all the ingredients to be a perfectly bad film... <br /><br />awful acting-check. bad script-check. tacky effects-check no originality whatsoever-double check. <br /><br />it doesn't even attempt to be different, and is riddled with every predicted clich'e imaginable. for example, the film opens to a couple having sex in the woods, so of course they end up dead. <br /><br />one of the most disturbing things is that this film actually spawned two sequels, how and why only baffles the mind. <br /><br />just stay away from this one.
