remember the wooden, undramatic literary adaptations of the 1970s at their worst? you will when you see this broadly acted, unintentionally hilarious piece of chocolate-box adaptation. most culpable of all is catherine z-j who, while undeniably easy on the eye, substitutes swishing a big dress and looking sultry for actually turning in a performance. played po-faced like a melodrama, or cold comfort farm without the jokes, this effort is not helped by a scriptwriter with a tin ear for dialogue who misses entirely the novel's sense of irony or tragedy. a shame, given the quality of the acting talent on offer - joan plowright, claire skinner, steven macintosh all deserve better than this.
