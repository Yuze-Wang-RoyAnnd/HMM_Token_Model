i can't believe i bought this movie on dvd. i don't even remember it being shown on tv last year. why in the world couldn't they have just done a real sequel to one of the best christmas movies ever made? damn and randy quaid looks like he's been on the same drugs as jerry lewis. i didn't know about this movie until i bought it tonight and thought i would check it out on imdb and see how it was rated. boy did i make a mistake. if your reading this review be warned stay away from it and just stick to the first christmas vacation. well at least i didn't pay more then 10 bucks for it. maybe i can trade it in and get half of that back at tower records. then again maybe not. ps i still haven't watched it yet, my dvd player went on the fritz tonight watching another wonderful movie, the chronicles of riddick (unrated director's cut) woo freaking hoo.
