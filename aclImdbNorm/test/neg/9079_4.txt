"the evil that men do" begins with a truly repellent torture scene, followed, a little later, by graphic verbal descriptions of equally repellent torture methods that the sadistic, heartless villain likes to use. but despite the use of such strictly-for-shock effects, the filmmakers can't really cover up the fact that this is just a dull, low-grade bronson vehicle. bronson himself is solid here, but he should have chosen a better script.
