was a college acting class exercise filmed and released as a movie? the formulaic posturing and stylized drivel of a "horror" soap opera for people who don't like horror films but wish to be able to tell that friends that, yes, they did see a horror movie. it even features soap opera music.<br /><br />do books falling off library shelves scare you? do doors shutting terrify you? then this flick is for you. have you ever been kidnapped? yeah, most of us have. when you were raped, was it simply ignored, because the rapist was the cool kid? what's scary is not this movie but this filmmaker's view of the world. <br /><br />and then the little twists aren't even original. this is a film for people who've never seen a horror film before, who don't want to see one now, and who want to see another flick about everyone conspiring against the weird kid.
