first of all, let me say that i am in no way denying the importance of the subject - quite the opposite. i am polish and i have been aware of the katyn massacre for quite a long time (in fact, two of my family members died there), so i was looking forward to this film. unfortunately, i was disappointed.<br /><br />i think the main problem lies with the script, which encompasses too many subplots and characters, none of which are properly developed. the characters are painfully one-dimensional; their stories are intertwined, but lack overall meaning. in my opinion the cast doesn't really have a chance to show their ability. the exception is andrzej chyra, portraying jerzy - the only interesting character. i wish the story was more focused on him.<br /><br />as a result, the film lacks emotion. before seeing it i thought i would be moved, if only for sentimental reasons - but in fact i was watching it with an odd sense of detachment throughout, except for the final execution scene. it is done well and its placing is interesting and provides a climactic ending, although the idea of the lord's prayer being recited in unison by the executed officers seems a bit far-fetched.<br /><br />to conclude, i suppose the film may have some educational value for those who are not familiar with the portrayed historical events, but in my opinion it fails as a work of cinema.
