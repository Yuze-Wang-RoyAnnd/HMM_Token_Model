gordon scott made some good tarzan movies, but this is not one of them.<br /><br />as i watched it, wincing at the bad, obviously interior sets and the hollow wooden "clonking" sounds as they walked across supposedly dirt trails, and cringing at the bad dialog and worse acting among the supporting cast, i kept thinking, "sheesh! this is tv show level!" then i find out it was, indeed, three tv show pilot episodes woven seam-fully into one.<br /><br />it's nice to see scott get outside (alone), away from the lame sets, in a few of the scenes; and the fights do have some pretty nice moves... but oh, ow, and ouch as to the dialog. and did i mention the acting? heck, cheetah (or "cheta," in this version) was a better actor than most of the humans.<br /><br />and that's not saying much.<br /><br />it is kind of a stitch to see a younger sherman (i.e. scatman) carothers acting as a native. but probably not worth the overall time-investment.
