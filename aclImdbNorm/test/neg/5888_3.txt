i'm at a loss. this entire movie made absolutely no sense. it was like watching a soderburg film for football. the camera cutting, the pace, all so copied. i thought the subject was too not serious for them to treat it like it was. yes, we all know southerners like football and beauty pageants. must we be inundated with it as an audience? i watched because of lee and jay. i was expecting young talent assembled in the style of dead poet's society or similar to remember the titans. i was completely put off by the film. you didn't get the characters. it was character driven, but you didn't understand anyone's motivations or their actions for the most part. the one kid who's mom is obsessed with him being a football player. why is he so silent? what's his deal? did we really need the scene with him "proving" his heterosexuality? why should we care? the movie gave us insights into these kids lives, and offered no pay-off for caring. it just made no sense. <br /><br />and why show a movie about a team that lost? i know it's real life, but who makes movies about losers? give us some pay-off for these guys working as hard as they did with all their "conceivable" problems, darnit. we got nothing. we got a little blip at the end of the film telling us that mojo won the next year with the 3rd stringer (lee). why didn't you follow that story? what were we to get out of this one? the movie led you along, but didn't lead you anywhere. i just felt like something was missing. it felt like a bad genetic cross between varsity blues and remember the titans. at least those two movies led you somewhere. friday night lights was about a loser team that lost their star player early in the movie. the actor who played him was great. you were completely annoyed by him, which was the point, but at least you understood why. they made sure you understood him, but he couldn't play, so why make sure we get his issues? <br /><br />and the other team in the play-offs...are we to believe those are high school teens? those men looked like college seniors or professional player in their 30s. who were they trying to kid? i know the other team was to look intimidating, but that was crossing the line a little. i liked the gritty element of them negotiating with the black team, but again, how did this fit into the overall theme of the film. nothing pieced together. the characters knew more about each other than we did, and that settles weird with me. jay's characters had absolutely nothing to add, but he was showcased. it was all just a mess. not worth a movie ticket or a rental fee.
