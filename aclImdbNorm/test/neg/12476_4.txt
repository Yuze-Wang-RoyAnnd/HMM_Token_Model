i've been surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film. it seemed dull to me, much as i enjoyed looking at penelope cruz, and the plot details often poorly worked out. it also seemed like an intensely sexist film: if the gender roles were reversed, almost everyone with any sense would be up in arms complaining the movie is intensely misogynist. it's not just that both the principal males are portrayed as complete jerks and sexual predators, but also that the women are portrayed as almost flawless, forming a utopian community which lacks conflict of any kind and which rests on relentless generosity and good humor. utopias are notoriously dull and this one turns out to be no exception. but it's also interesting to notice what happens (and here comes the plot giveaway, though it refers to a very early scene) when the teenage daughter kills her father. (1) her mother rushes to take responsibility for it and(2) the daughter seems to suffer almost no remorse (and in fact her emotional life then disappears from the film). it's not quite a glorified killing, though aldomovar's camera lingers on the blood in a bloodthirsty way, as though it makes an attractive painting, and then it's soaked up and out of sight without bloodying either daughter or mom, neither materially nor emotionally. later the film reveals another killing, again by a woman of a man, , and once again it is a killing which the film implicitly endorses.in short, volver is an ideologically-driven film with an unpleasant and in fact a repugnant ideology, and so i write an ideological critique. but apart from that, it's just not very interesting. it has none of the depth of, say, aldomovar's talk to her, which i loved.
