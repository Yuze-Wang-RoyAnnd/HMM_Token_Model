this movie is available as a special "bonus" feature on the double-disc of horror 101 & horror 102: endgame. it has nothing to do with those movies, except it does show that producers/directors dudelson and clavell are in a rut. like those other movies, this one features young people who go to a building where they get trapped inside, and run down the hallways a lot, while they get picked off one by one. in the end one or more characters are revealed to have another identity. this is by far the worst of the three.<br /><br />here, people are invited to a halloween-night only opening of the museum of the dead. the museum doesn't have very many exhibits, and they're all sort of ancient central-american related. there are also flesh-eating, infection-spreading zombies in the museum as well as an ancient cannibal warrior and two female warriors.<br /><br />the movie is very repetitious. it kills people off fairly quickly, to the point you wonder who they're going to have left to kill off - at which point some more people show up without explanation, so that they can be killed.<br /><br />amazingly, one of the characters does have a cellphone, and is actually able to call the police, who actually take it seriously and show up at the museum. when one tries to pick the lock to get in, the other tells him that would be "forced entry." if you've got people trapped in a building who are injured, i think that's irrelevant. the cops are also stupid in that when they shoot a zombie in the head, it goes down, but then they shoot other zombies in the chest and they don't go down. they happen to shoot another zombie in the head, and it goes down. they continue to shoot the rest of the zombies in the chest. stupid.<br /><br />the opening credits and a nightmare sequence are done in a sort of animation-effect over video, a poor-man's waking life sort of thing, but not so cartoonish. it is sort of interesting, however, parts of some of the attacks are done the same way, so there's no logic to it.<br /><br />dreadful.
