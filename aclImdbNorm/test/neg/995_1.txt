i think downey was perhaps inspired by french new-wave.<br /><br />who wasn't?<br /><br />unfortunately, what he ended up creating here was more along the lines of crackhead new-wave.<br /><br />a synapse is obviously a terrible thing to lose and downey appears to have lost plenty. <br /><br />just say no, indeed. in more ways than one. including to watching this film.<br /><br />i couldn't bear it after a while and began fast forwarding through it. it would have been wiser to have just skipped it altogether.
