i could not watch more than 10 minutes of this movie. it has set the standard. i will never again give a movie a 1, unless it was as horrible as this one. i fully agree with the other comments about this film. but, since i'm dutch, i watched it with dutch translation. apparently, they didn't have money for a proper translation, so they decided to babelfish it. with sometimes hilarious results.<br /><br />don't smoke, don't drink, don't do drugs, don't watch demon summer.<br /><br />i was surprised that the actors (wow, i can't believe i just said that.) didn't hold the script (was there any?) in their hands while shooting. i think they also did a good job on... well... uhmm... no, they didn't do a good job at all.
