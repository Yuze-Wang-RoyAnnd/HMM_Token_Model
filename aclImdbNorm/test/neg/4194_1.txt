completely agree with other review.<br /><br />i watched this movie for about 5 minutes. i looked up the one review on another site and found that it wasn't even a real sequel. this was after i slowly backed away from the tv with remote in hand, jaw dropping lower and lower. <br /><br />the quality of the filming is beyond low budget. it doesn't even look like a freaking movie. if i were watching 'home video' footage from a documentary i would expect it.<br /><br />in summary: avoid, avoid avoid. boooo lion's gate!<br /><br />completely ashamed of myself for watching 5 minutes and i hope that i've saved others from renting or owning it.
