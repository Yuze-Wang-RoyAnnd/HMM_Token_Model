misguided, miscast, murky, interminable lunacy given the high-gloss mgm a-budget treatment. kate hepburn plays a bride who comes to suspect her rich, handsome husband (robert taylor)is not the dreamboat she married but a psychotic killer. mgm's attempt at a hitchcockian thriller is doomed from the start by a turgid, muddled, ludicrous script, and the idiotic casting of hepburn as a jeopardized woman fearing for her life (who could ever imagine hepburn afraid of anything?) louis b. mayer forgot to tell vincent minnelli he was directing a thriller, not a musical. taylor is embarrassing. only robert mitchum, also cast-against-type as a good guy, retains his dignity in a quiet, low-keyed performance. karl freund's ravishing cinematography creates images of eerie beauty--and was wasted on the wrong film. end result: metro's "parnell" of the 1940s.
