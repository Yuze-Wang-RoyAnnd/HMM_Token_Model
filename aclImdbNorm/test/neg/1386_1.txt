to put it simply, mind of mencia is the worst, unfunniest show on comedy central, and quite possibly all of television... ever. i love comedy central and watch many shows and movies there all the time, but every time the intro for this show even starts after some good comedy, i can't find the remote fast enough.<br /><br />mencia tells used, worn out racial jokes in a bad attempt at being controversial, then will point out the ethnicity he just talked about in the audience as if to say 'they liked it, so all of your race likes it, and by extension me too'. give me a break mencia, i don't know if those people are plants or not, but just because you go to a black guy and high five him after one of your ridiculous jokes, doesn't mean he thinks you're funny, it just means you put him on the spot and what else is he going to do, smack you on tv? he gives the impression that his jokes are deep, meaningful, and thought provoking, which is apparent in his commercials, but when you actually watch the show almost 100% of what he says is common sense. he also claims that only smart people get some of his jokes, but you don't have to be any smarter than a monkey to understand what he just said when he says that, maybe you need to go finish 3rd grade carlos. the guy goes on to say that he says what others are only thinking, but i think you'll find that if anyone was thinking what he says, they figured out all on their own that it was ridiculous, and that's why they never said it in the first place.<br /><br />all in all, watch 1 episode and be done with it if you must, because after you've seen 1 episode, you've seen them all. why comedy central keeps renewing this horrible show is well beyond me. if you're looking for good comedy, look elsewhere, because you will find very little of it here.
