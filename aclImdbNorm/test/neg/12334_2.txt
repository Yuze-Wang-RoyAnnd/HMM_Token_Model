it might be that the film i saw was entirely different from the one that the others saw, however as the actors are the same i can only think that the cut i saw in europe differed from the one circulating in the us.<br /><br />anyway, this was the worst movie that i saw the past five years. (closely followed by the waterboy...)<br /><br />why: because in my opinion this director has taken elements from every thriller preceding this one, mixed them, put the in the wrong order with the wrong music and published it.<br /><br />(examples: nothing happends, the music gets scary, and still nothing happends. the "grumpy" officer us grumpy in a way that would let the actor flunk any acting class. there's a buddy-moment which comes out of nowhere at the end. there's an inescapable scene and in the next scene all the problems are gone.)<br /><br />if you want to see a smart movie: see memento. if you want to see a better thriller: see any thriller that comes to mind. if you want to see patrick swayze: see dirty dancing.
