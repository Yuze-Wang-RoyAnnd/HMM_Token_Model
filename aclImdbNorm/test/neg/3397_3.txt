i've read through a lot of the comments here about how this movie sticks to the book.. i don't think any of them have actually read it. edgar rice wrote about a dangerous african jungle and apes were killers and hunters. we know differently now and this movie portrays apes in a more modern view. i've never seen a tarzan movie that even comes close to edgar's vision. maybe one day hollywood with trust talented and respected authors to tell the story. so, if you've never read the book and enjoy a good story about feelings and a fluffy bunny view of wild animals, maybe a good cry, see the movie. i hope john carter of mars get's more respect than tarzan has. we miss ya, edgar!
