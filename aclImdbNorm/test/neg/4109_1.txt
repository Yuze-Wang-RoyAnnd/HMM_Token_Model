i wish i could use the time travel machine to jump back to the moment i considered seeing this movie and make other plans instead. i saw a free screening of a sound of thunder, so i can't complain about the price, but i wish i could get my 103 minutes refunded. the acting was mediocre, and the special effects were deplorable. people shouldn't make movies about dinosaurs if they can't afford to make the prehistoric creatures look as good or better than those in jurassic park. spielberg spoiled us. edward burns as travis ryer was the movie's only saving grace. i noticed that females under 18 rated the movie the highest, and the only explanation is that they ogled over burns the whole time. the whole long 103 minutes. this movie should have been over in about 80 minutes. it just dragged on and on and on. don't waste your time or your money on this far-fetched flick.
