"wagons east" was a big disappointment for me. but the saddest thing about this movie is that it turned out to be john candy's last film role (he died just before shooting was completed on this). there are only a few laughs throughout this western spoof, and for a comedy that doesn't cut it. if you want to see a uproarious spoof of western movies, the answer is obvious. see mel brooks' classic "blazing saddles". or if you want to see candy in much better material, see "summer rental", "spaceballs", or "uncle buck" (just to name a few). these three movies (as well as others) shows us what a great comic actor he was. unfortuneately, "wagons east" does not. what a shame!<br /><br />* (out of four)
