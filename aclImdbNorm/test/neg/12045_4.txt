i saw this film when it first came out and hated it. i just saw it again 27 years later. i actually liked some of it... although robin williams was totally wrong for the role... what i remember most about hating the film is that it was almost the complete opposite of what i had understood when i read the book. since i haven't re-read it, i can only give you my impressions from the past - but i am sure of one thing - the film is a paean to family life, whereas in the book, almost all traditional institutions - including, and perhaps especially, marriage - are shown to be strait-jackets that we would be well rid of. the only positive in the book is the wondrous nature of children...something that only the very beginning and ending of the film really captures (with that incredibly gorgeous baby floating in the air. too bad williams doesn't have a tenth of his charm!) my low mark is therefore from the fact that the film misrepresents the book. as a film on its own it fares better - but only for a few key performances. mary beth hurt is wonderful - i think anyone watching it would fall in love with her. and john lithgow as an ex football player who has had a sex-change operation is fantastic... he never once camped it up or made the character anything but commendable - and as such his performance had an incredibly integrity. i watched him closely during all of his scenes, and never once was he anything except womanly. nothing in his performance ever came near the performance of a drag queen... and that made all the difference. in fact, of all the people in the film, his is the only one which is irreproachable. it is worth seeing this film only for his performance.
