i saw this movie in blockbuster and thought it might be a good sunday evening movie when there is nothing else to do. so i bought it used, 3 dvds for $25. although it was cheap, my money would have been better spent on a nail to drive through my foot.<br /><br />the film started out nicely. kinda dark and mysterious. i was always enthralled with vampire and samurai movies as a kid. i thought the combo would be really cool. the first fight scene was pretty cool. i was excited for the rest of the movie. then the movie took a serious nose dive.<br /><br />i understand that this was a big hit in the east. i guess because of the twins. i don't see it though. this movie, aside from the first 10 minutes, was absolutely horrible. so many movies in this genre have the potential to be great, and blow it terribly. this is just another casualty.<br /><br />jacki chan's role in this film doesn't make any sense at all. whyyyyyyyy? complete silliness. he probably made a few bucks off it though.<br /><br />the only cool thing in this movie are the swords they use. nice idea.<br /><br />i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
