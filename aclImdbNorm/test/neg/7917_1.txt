i loved all dogs go to heaven so much that i went to see the sequel in the theater, and i can't remember being more disappointed by a movie. the story stank worse than an over-aged sack of manure. i mean, come on! how could carface possibly imagine being able to get revenge on an animal so much bigger than him, no matter how angry he was. plus depicting satan as a cat?!?! how clich'e can you get? so much for the story. is it any wonder that don bluth, burt reynolds, melba moore, and vic tayback wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole? the animation was absolutely wretched. the colors were all washed out, and i can't count how many times i was able to see through objects that were supposed to be solid. it had to be the worst animation i've ever seen! i usually like animated movies, but not this bomb!
