at what point does a film become so bad it's good? compelling in it's awfulness, darkhunters stands out as a shining example of c**p cinematography and for that alone, probably deserves some kind of award.<br /><br />the plot revolves around the age old battle of heaven and hell for the unclaimed souls of the recently dead. in the case of darkhunters, the representatives of good and evil manifest themselves variously as a herd of cats, a hooded grim reaper figure with a face of flickering flames similar to a coal effect electric fire, a philip marlowe-a-like with a seriously bad manicure and a female psychologist who appears to be on day-release from kwik-save.<br /><br />the protagonists are competing for the soul of a newly dead teacher who spends most of the film running around a foggy field and bizarrely, a boarding kennels in an attempt to evade his pursuers.<br /><br />the plot is spread thinner than a dieter's sandwich with no character development or attempt to build suspense. the acting is laughable, comparable to a school play - although that would be an insult to many educational establishments. and the dialogue .......... oh, how my sides ached! with the unclaimed souls of the dead being described as "life's unwanted gherkins" by the flame-glow demon, you wonder whether hell really is a mcdonalds.<br /><br />but is is bizarrely compelling, you find yourself watching just to see how bad it can get - at just over 80 minutes, it's worth the time spent for the unintentional giggles.
