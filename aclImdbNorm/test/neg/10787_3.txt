i think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet-paper. no respect whatsoever to many important details which intrinsically make the movie. for example, the names of some serbian terrorists (that i remember) are caradan maldic, ivanic loyvek and leo hasse. what kind of names are that? certainly not serbian! by the way, caradan maldic!!! what a name, i laughed for days thinking about it. probably an implication on karadzic and mladic. secondly, there have never been any cases of terrorism done by serbians. a journalist like the main character ought to have known that. thirdly, the actors playing serbian terrorists are not even serbs nor do they speak serbo-croatian. all this aside, this movie is solidly acted but the story is paper-thin and full of holes. at times it makes no sense whatsoever!!!
