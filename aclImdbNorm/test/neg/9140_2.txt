i am a gigantic fan of both koyaanisqatsi and powaqqatsi, but this movie is just not good. the reviewer below is entirely correct that the stunning imagery of the detroit station is the first and last memorable scene in the film. i really, really wish i had left after that, instead of continuing to hold out hope throughout the film. maybe my expectations were too high, but i felt let down.<br /><br />the score is almost completely a rehash of the previous two - not necessarily a bad thing if you're a fan, but there's only one piece that stood out to me as being fresh. it was good enough, though, that i'll still probably check out the soundtrack.<br /><br />but just keep this in mind if you see this film: if you come to realize at any point that you're not enjoying it, go ahead and split - you won't miss a thing, because it won't get any better.<br /><br />i'll even give the executive summary here (warning! spoilers!): lots of shots of athletes that look almost good enough for a nike commercial, shots of smiling people, inexplicably dull frontal head shots of famous people's wax dummies (wtf were they thinking here?!?), some giggling babies (cuuuuute), some "bitchin'" photoshop effects, some imagery that's meant to suggest a comparison between the flows of water, information, money and people (i think)... and then a bunch of quick unrelated scenes of mass violence... and then a bunch of stock space footage.<br /><br />i could remake this movie in 10 seconds. here's my pitch:<br /><br />2 seconds of a happy daddy with a shaved head and lycra biking shorts playing with a toddler playing with a kitten playing with string; 5 seconds of that scene in "network" where the guy talks about messing with the "elemental forces of nature" and how "money flows in, money flows out;" 1 second of reginald denny getting brained with a brick, and then 3 seconds of alan bean bouncing around on the moon. <br /><br />there you go - that's 88 minutes and 50 seconds of your life i just saved. of course, i'd get a copy of after effects and apply a filter or two, so it wouldn't look as blatantly stock as it is. if steven soderbergh's reading this, hey, i won't even need much money for this project...<br /><br />if you insist upon watching a movie about "life as war," i suggest "bowling for columbine" instead. it may not have the pseudo-intellectual veneer so fashionable among the black turtleneck crowd, but at least it's funny.
