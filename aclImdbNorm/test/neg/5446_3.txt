this is just one of those movies that continually make you groan and that i wished was over. the problems are many and the good points are few. i feel the main problem with this movie is that it has what amounts to a cheesy plot and they try to make it out to be a epic movie, which a movie about super evil monkeys and smart ones that sign just is not epic, it is cheese. when you have cheese you make the movie more fun. granted, the final scene with the monkeys and that laser was very nice to watch and more of things of that nature was needed. instead the actors are doing such a serious job that you feel the movie just has a corny plot amid all the serious tension the movie is trying to set up. the plot revolves around a woman trying to find what happened to her missing ex-husband while also searching for some sort of legendary diamonds. she uses these two guys who trained an ape to do sign language and now wish to return her to the wild as cover to get into the country and begin the mediocre adventure of a lifetime. the only things that make this movie somewhat tolerable is ernie hudson's character and the laser attack at the end.
