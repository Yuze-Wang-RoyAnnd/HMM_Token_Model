it was funny because the whole thing was so unrealistic, i mean, come on, like a pop star would just show up at a public high school and fall in love with the girl who happens to be obsessed with him? come on, people!<br /><br />everyone but the lead girl were completely horrendous at acting. the dialog was cheesy, the premise was stupid, and the camera work was poorly done. i felt like i was watching a badly made home video. <br /><br />i feel as if i've wasted almost 2 hours of my life that i will never get back. <br /><br />i don't have anything else to say, except that i'd rather punch myself in the face multiple times, than watch this movie again.
