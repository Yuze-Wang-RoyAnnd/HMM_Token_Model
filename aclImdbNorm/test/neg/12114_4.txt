sure, this film was retarded. but you expected that the moment you looked at the cover-box. it's a b movie, and on the t&a factor this movie delivered. truthfully, it was funnier than expected. while it was by no means a work of comedic genius, like "the party animal" or "orgazmo", as far as b movies go it was worth the watch, if you're into that sort of thing anyway.<br /><br />christians and morally-oriented parental groups, this is soft-core adult entertainment. if you don't want your children watching sexual content and nudity, then you should keep your children away from this film.
