i rated this movie a 3 and that was generous. the scenery is ponderous and gaudy, the acting for the most part is terrible. i do think peter o'toole did a good job of acting (tiberius), but he must have been mortified when he saw the final cut of the movie. john gielgud, howsoever brief his appearance in the movie, still seemed to be playing a role from hamlet. the hard core pornography parts were neither erotic nor did they do much to further the story. okay malcolm mcdowell had a nice butt and the guy who played macro was handsome. the guy who played claudius, looked more like the traditional depictions of nero and was certainly at odds with robert graves' picture of claudius. the climactic (?) assassination of caligula, wife and child is inaccurate in that it shows him after death lying on stairs in an open-air area, when in fact he was assassinated in the underground passage on the palatine hill which ran along the front of the domus flaviana that still exists today. there are places in this movie where virtually anything drew my attention away from it--merciful distractions. if you want history, read suetonius or tacitus, if you want pornography and sadism, watch passolini's "salo", but by all means stay away from this movie.
