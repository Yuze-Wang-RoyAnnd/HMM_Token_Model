this is one of the worst films i have seen in a while.<br /><br />the problem is that it doesn't know whether it wants to be an intelligent political film, 'artistic' or an exercise is eroticism. as a result it fails on all accounts.<br /><br />the acting is atrocious, the narration off putting and the supposed symbolism pointless.<br /><br />klaus kinski is probably the best thing about this film but that isn't a good thing. sure he has an intense and 'unique' look but ultimately he can't actually act. just look at how he reacts when his mistress leaves....<br /><br />really don't watch this film, some say it needs repeat viewings i say one is too many.
