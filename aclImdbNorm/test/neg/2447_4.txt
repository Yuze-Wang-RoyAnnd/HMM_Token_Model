standard "disease outbreak in remote area; expert who happens to be vacationing in the area takes charge" movie. there are only a few deviations from the norm. one is that the kids involved are pretty reasonable from the outset. usually they are monsters who repeatedly gum up the works until they redeem themselves in the end. another is that the local medicine man/witch doctor who is normally an impediment early on is never completely discounted or redeemed in the end. perhaps since this seems to have been made for the faith oriented pax channel, they didn't want to seem too judgmental about the faithful. finally, there were no evil local politicians/leisure industry bigwigs trying to cover the whole thing up. the lack of these stereotypes was refreshing -- if we have the pax channel to thank for that i may have to sample a few more of their offerings. aside from that, however, this was pretty standard stuff. you've seen it all before.
