the plane is a 747 jumbo. the cockpit is located on the upper deck on a 747. in the movie the pilots do not climb the stairs in the 1st class cabin to reach the cockpit. they walk to the front of the 1st class cabin and through doors into the cockpit. what a gaff !!! the front of the first class cabin has a cloakroom for jackets and a tv screen. beyond that is the radar dome. before takeoff a 747 is shown to commence the taxi to the runway. on take-off the plane is shown to have only two engines. areal 747 has four engines. who was in charge of continuity on this movie ? during the early part of the flight the front of the plane suddenly includes toilets - another farcical gaff !!! after that the front of the plane becomes the rear and vice-versa. at this point i stopped watching. absolute rubbish!!!
