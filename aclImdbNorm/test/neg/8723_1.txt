drivel. utter junk. the writers must not have read the book, or seen david lynch's film. not worth wasting your time.<br /><br />longer does not make better. while more in-depth then lynch's film, it has gross in-accuracies, and down-play's key parts of the story.<br /><br />"a night at the roxbury" is more worth your time.
