you know the story of "sweeney todd" now, most likely thanks to tim burton's recent movie. you probably don't know it though, from this take on the old tale from andy milligan-that notorious sleaze merchant that gave al adamson and ted v. mikels a run for their money.<br /><br />it had to happen eventually. in my years of watching horror and exploitation from the 60's to the 80's, i'm finally reviewing an andy milligan movie. you see, from 1964 to 1990, andy gave us many an exploitation and horror movie-none of which was any good, and barely watchable. "the bloodthirsty butchers" is no exception.<br /><br />there is dialog and well, there is talk, and that's one of the things you will find here-lots and lots of talk. the movie reaches almost "manos the hands of fate" levels at times, as you wait tirelessly for something to happen. while i love cheap looking gore effects, the violence is too few and far between, and in spite of it's reputation, the "breast" scene isn't that shocking. <br /><br />i love cheap and sleazy exploitation as much as the next trash cinema devotee, but "bloodthirsty butchers" is the kind of bad that mst3k would tear apart mercilessly. sadly, milligan would die of aids in 1991, and if there is any movie of his i'd say i sort of like, it would be the delirious "the ghastly ones." this is no "ghastly ones" though-it's just bad.
