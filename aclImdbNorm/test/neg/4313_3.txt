i have read the other user comments and i am happy someone has compared it to the original by kamal called perumarzhakalam released in 2004.<br /><br />the original had a tight story and no loopholes as described above about the indian govt not having proper records, or even bad shoots and bloopers.<br /><br />the story is great and a touchy one and well described by others. but sadly nagesh taking credit for it as his own story is a sad thing and amounts to nothing other than plagiarism.<br /><br />i guess he has been affected by bollywood's so called "inspired" syndrome.<br /><br />he must at least give credit where it is due.<br /><br />i liked some of his older movies, but now i suspect if any of them were originals after all.<br /><br />here is a link in imdb for the original masterpiece. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425350/#comment i recommend everyone to see the original, even with subtitles if needed, to know what class direction and class acting is all about.
