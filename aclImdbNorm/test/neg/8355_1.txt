this film is just as bad as "the birdman of alcatraz". i do not refer to the acting but rather the premise of both films, which try to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic figures. moreover it disturbs me when well respected, revered actors like alan alda (and burt lancaster) play such roles, because their status tends to lend credibility to the director's intent to elevate the film's subject, a societal outcast.<br /><br />i was in junior high school during the last years of caryl chessman's life and his death penalty appeals and books were very much in the news. i remember the groundswell of opinion that the death penalty was wrong and chessman was the victim.<br /><br />get a grip people. read the history. chessman was a criminal and sexual predator. he drove around the la streets at night with a stolen police light in his vehicle. he stopped cars with attractive women inside under the ruse of making a traffic arrest; then abducted and raped the women. rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience and many victims say they would prefer death to its horror and humiliation.<br /><br />chessman got exactly what he deserved, it just took a decade too long. no sympathy for the devil here.
