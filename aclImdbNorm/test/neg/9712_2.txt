as was mentioned by others, could there be any other reason to see this film other than to see former "wayne's world" star mike myers play a serious role? the story line is interesting but lacks development and is sabotaged by loose ends and bad characters. if there was any good scenic shots of ireland then it would give it another reason to see it. but instead it focuses on a little normal village that is obviously surrounded by the 'green pastures' of the emerald-isle that are often shown in irish films. if there was any cultural 'spice' to admire the "irish personality" it would be worth seeing, however this could have almost been shot in england. too bad for myers, but this one fails to please or satisfy the heart of anybody who ever wanted to visit the land of guiness.
