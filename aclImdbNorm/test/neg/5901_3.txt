when it was released this film caused a sensation. i watched it and was thrilled. beautiful, usually young, naked women filmed in the classy style we knew so well from director hamiltons photography. his photographs never become porn and the same is true for this movie. today i saw it again and was bitterly disappointed. the soft core in extremely slow paced scenes, all filmed with some vaseline on the lenses, actually is all there is. there is no real story, the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies, but they are not real creatures with a soul. actually nothing happens. it is like hamilton is photographing using moving pictures rather than stills. and this gets so boring after a while. i even didn't watch the whole thing the second time, for i fell vast asleep. that is all that remains of this masterpiece: it is a very good sleeping pill. and you will never become addicted to it!<br /><br />back then 7 out of 10, now 3 out of 10
