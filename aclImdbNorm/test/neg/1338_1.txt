no! no - no - no! my entire being is revolting against this dreadful remake of a classic movie. i knew we were heading for trouble from the moment meg ryan appeared on screen with her ridiculous hair and clothing - literally looking like a scarecrow in that garden she was digging. meg ryan playing meg ryan - how tiresome is that?! and it got worse ... so much worse. the horribly clich'e lines, the stock characters, the increasing sense i was watching a spin-off of "the first wives club" and the ultimate hackneyed schtick in the delivery room. how many times have i seen this movie? only once, but it feel like a dozen times - nothing original or fresh about it. for shame!
