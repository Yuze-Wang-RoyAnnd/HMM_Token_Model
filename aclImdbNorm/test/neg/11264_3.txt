i have seen this movie last week during the berlin film festival and had medium-high expectations. - the director is bertrand tavernier and i was familiar with some of his previous work in french cinema. i actually enjoyed some of his earlier movies. -the cast: tommy lee jones, john goodman, peter sarsgard, mary steenburgen... i was looking forward to see all this talent on screen. -i wasn't familiar with the book it's based upon and i hadn't read anything about the movie beforehand but i was told that it was an investigation movie set in the deep south (we've seen a lot of those in the past, maybe this one's gonna be as good as the others...)<br /><br />2 hours later, the end titles appear: thank god it was over!!!! - the plot is beyond comprehension. if you've read the book, you have a significant advantage. there were too many minor characters and there were a lot of useless plot arcs. we didn't understand a thing! - the accents. my god! tommy lee jones' accent is decent but i still have nightmares from mary steenburgen's cajun-french singing... - poor casting in my opinion. i can't believe old man tommy lee jones can beat the crap out of a linebacker-built goon... and i'm not afraid of john goodman. - who were these people?!? we barely understand who all these characters are and what they do. there's a bait shop? tommy lee jones has a girl from guatemala? bl"org! - the comedic attempts were pathetic. the funniest thing about the movie was probably its "action" and "suspense" scenes. they were horrible. no thrills. bad acting (can tommy lee jones make different faces or is he like derek zoolander?)... - and then there's the sci-fi stuff. no spoilers but it gets ridiculously and annoyingly weird.<br /><br />i usually don't write any comments on imdb but i thought the movie was so bad and disappointing that i felt compelled to share my opinion. but that's just me...
