oh what the heck, i'll reveal the secret: this movie stinks!<br /><br />yeah there are some nifty dinosaur effects that, for their time, were probably really exciting to watch. now they don't cut it, but they're not terrible. they're just good enough to tolerate without being able to laugh at it. so they just sit there, and i sit watching this, not laughing, not excited, just, well, bored. it stinks!<br /><br />if i can exercise my jay sherman for a moment, the film really does. the box promises cowboys versus dinosaurs, and in very generic sense it delivers. guys dressed like cowboys fight a couple of big dinosaurs. but really these guys are a bunch of sissies, and the hero is a loser (more on this later) and the dinosaurs are hardly intimidating. the plot is a yawner, and there isn't much technically wrong with it that's there to laugh at. it's all just gray and bland.<br /><br />after some dreadful night cinematography (filmed in one and a half colors i called it), we get the plot which involves some people, doing stuff. that was what i caught. oh and they are at the turn of the century in mexico, so they at least dress like cowboys even if they don't act like it.<br /><br />so a bunch of these people, who i think were human, they go in the desert, and they stumble on these dinosaurs (after they find a miniature horse...i don't know, let's just move on). then the movie degrades into a really pathetic king kong ripoff in the final act. at that point i had lost the will to even keep my eyes at television level, and i drifted in and out of consciousness.<br /><br />the "hero" is played by the guy from beneath the planet of the apes who essentially played charlton heston's part when heston decided he didn't want to be in the sequel. he was picked cause, shock o' shocks, he looks exactly like heston. that's about all he has going for him. i was really upset when he was the hero of the film cause all he does is glower, snear, bag the chick in the film (who's named t.j...unfortunately she's not a prostitute or finally the origin of the name would have been revealed). meanwhile his friend kills all the dinosaurs, saves the day numerous times, and what does he get for it? not recognition, no nothing! and he dies, sacrificing himself for his friends! they don't even wait up for him while they escape!<br /><br />boring, long, slowly paced, with little to enjoy until the film decides to carbon copy king kong's script onto it's own, it's best to avoid this film unless you enjoy pain on the scale of dropping an anvil on your eyeball.
