if you pack all the clich'es about city firefighters into 105 minutes; you have ladder 49.<br /><br />it has a story but is highly clouded by all the clich'es. it turns it into movie that with every event; becomes so predictable it's not worth watching. there is no depth to the story and even the acting seems superficial.<br /><br />it looked like it wanted to be a tribute to firefighters but ended up being boring and pretentious. the parallel between jack morrison being fatally trapped beneath an inaccessible part of a building and firefighters being trapped beneath the rubble of the twin towers was all too obvious.<br /><br />it doesn't compare to movies like backdraft and certainly does not set an example for future movies about fire personnel.
