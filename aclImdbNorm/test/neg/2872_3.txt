this movie was really bad. it has that quality that a lot of indie movies have: moments of humor filled with long spaces that are completely boring. any die-hard bam magera fan will prolly like this movie, but then again thats probably the only person who would see it. someone gave me this movie to watch knowing i am a fan of jackass and was a fan of viva la bam, before the scripted nature of that show wore thin. to explain why this movie doesn't work i should just say the premise itself is played out<br /><br />a guy who is with a girl who is horrible to him. and pretty much the whole movie you've got this ryan dunn guy whining and bam magera skipping around like a merry mischief maker. dicamillo's performance is strange at best. it's a humorous little nonspecific canadian french accent that pretty much is the extent of his performance (basically funny for 5 minutes and then its like 'ok you're pretending to be foreign enough already")<br /><br />maybe it would work if they were going for parody but all they succeed in doing is making a movie with an iq of zero. i love toilet humor as much as the next guy, but this isn't even lowbrow its just stupid. its like the only humor to be gotten from this movie is completely inside and the audience, even those savvy to magera and company, are left out of the joke.<br /><br />next time magera is handed a sack full of money let's hope he doesn't blow it on some lousy pet project
