"a bored television director is introduced to the black arts and astral projection by his girlfriend. learning the ability to separate his spirit from his body, the man finds a renewed interest in his life and a sense of wellbeing. unfortunately, the man discovers while he is sleeping, his spirit leaves his body and his uncontrolled body roams the streets in a murderous rampage," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />the synopsis isn't entirely correct, as it turns out.<br /><br />anyway, the movie opens with a dizzying "out-of-body" example of handsome director winston rekert (as paul sharpe)'s newly discovered "astral body" experience; it also foreshadows an upcoming dogfight. young andrew bednarski (as matthew sharpe), being a kid, draws pictures of "the blue man", as his murder spree begins. handsome detective john novak (as stewart kaufman) discovers the victims are connected to mr. rekert. mr. novak's investigation leads to the supernatural; a prime example of which is karen black (as janus), with whom rekert fears he is falling in love.<br /><br />several in the cast perform well; but, "the blue man" winds up tying itself up in a knot. aka "eternal evil", its unsatisfying story tries to be far too clever for its own good.
