flesh feast starts at miami airport, ace reporter dan carter (harry kerwin, he is also credited as production designer) phones his mate ed casey (phil philbin) to let him know that he has just returned from south america where he has been investigating carl schuman (doug foster) & that he was onto a big story but while still talking on the phone he is stabbed in the back & killed. schuman meets dr. elaine frederick (veronica lake, she also executive produced) who has recently been released from a mental institution, together they discuss their grisly plans. the news of cater's death has reached casey & he decides to take the story up himself & do some investigating, well actually he gets his secretary viginia day (marth mischon) to do most of the investigating & just report back to him, lazy bugger. virginia informs casey that they have someone on the inside named kristine (heather hughes) since dr. frederick rents her spare rooms out to nurses, kristine reports back to casey about schuman & dr. frederick's grotesque youth restoration experiments involving human flesh & specially cultivated maggots...<br /><br />co written, co-produced & directed by brad f. grinter flesh feast is a pretty poor film on all accounts. first lets start with the script by grinter & thomas casey who was also responsible for the cinematography (you get the feeling that most of the cast & crew had more than one job), basically it's terrible. the character's are one dimensional idiots & have no personality, i didn't like anyone in this film. for what it's worth i quite like some of the ideas here, the flesh-eating maggots, the basement laboratory, stealing bodies from a hospital & that unforgettable 'twist' ending that's almost worth sitting through the rest of the film for on it's own. unfortunately the dialogue is so badly written, stiff & unnatural sounding it's untrue, i mean there is one scene in which a nurse says that they "won't let us out of the house" which is fine except for the fact that she is speaking outside in the garden to someone. no thought has been put into the story as no explanation is ever given for why flesh-eating maggots are able to restore youth, in fact at one point near the end when questioned about this very thing dr. frederick claims there is no time to explain at that point which to me sounds like the people who wrote this didn't have a clue either! even at an extremely short 68 minutes long flesh feast is very slow & dull, the poor editing doesn't help with scenes & shots lasting for far too long, for example there is a scene in which an ambulance pulls up outside a hospital, drives up to the doors, the guy gets out, he walks to the back doors & opens them etc. etc. did we really need to see every single detail? there is also another sequence in which dr. frederick enters room & puts some gloves on, then she takes them off walks into the opposite room & puts another pair on! i personally think that grinter probably didn't shoot enough material so he stretches every scene out as much as he can to make the run time up. i do like that bizarre ending though, i really do. technically flesh feast is complete crap, i'm not sure what the budget was on this but it must have been small, very small. just about the entire film takes place in one house, dr. frederick's laboratory consists of a table, some plastic beakers & test tubes, some ancient looking electronic medical equipment & a strange screen with funny colours on it (don't ask). the cinematography is poor, the music sucks & the entire film looks dubbed, badly dubbed too. the exploitation elements are also disappointing, there are a few maggot shots but they don't actually do anything other than wriggle a bit, there is a brief scene where a dead body has it's leg sawn off & a ok looking dismembered corpse & limbs hanging on hooks. the acting is awful from everyone concerned, & i mean really bad which makes the rubbishy dialogue even worse. do yourself a favour & avoid flesh feast, yes there are one or two unintentionally funny moments & that ending is, well unique to say the least but for the most part this is real amateur film-making that quickly becomes painful to watch. i doubt most people will make it through this is one sitting, i can tolerate just about anything but even i considered switching it off. definitely one to avoid, you'll be pleased you did & if you really have to see it don't say you weren't warned!
