i used to love the muppets. the muppet movie, the great muppet caper and the muppets take manhattan were good family movies, cleverly written and fun to watch. i never thought i would see the day when they would jump on the hollywood sleaze bandwagon, but here it is: scooter as a caged rave dancer, pepe making lewd and suggestive comments every five minutes -- this is not your father's muppets. it's not jim henson's muppets anymore, either.<br /><br />this "it's a wonderful life" themed movie has its moments, but not enough to save it. i cringed while watching this with my children. i still have hope for their next movie, but this one was certainly a disappointment.
