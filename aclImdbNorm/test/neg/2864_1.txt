about one step above an olsen's twins film, there's a nary a surprise in store here except for how repulsive the bloated, hunchbacked depardieu looks walking around the beach without a shirt on. this guy was supposed to be some sort of heartthrob? quasimodo hubba hubba? well, whatever.<br /><br />katherine heigl's a great actress, whose career over the last several years has displayed a lot of her potential as both a comedic and dramatic actress, but this movie definitely didn't do anything to offer her a break-out role. her vapid character lacks any trace of personality or self-esteem, spending her entire vacation crushing on a cute boy that she thinks is the greatest guy in then world (basically because he's a cute boy), yet she can't be honest with him for two seconds. ladies, let me tell you something; if a guy's really into you, he's not going to stomp off in a huff because you tried to pass your dad off as your boyfriend. he may be a little confused about why you'd do something so silly, contrived, and um...incestuous, but in the end it's just going to be something you'll laugh together about.<br /><br />the plot and dialogue hits every clche' right on cue. no originality and no wit...but it's rilly, rilly sweet and ben's rilly, rilly cute so viewers who think titanic is the greatest movie ever made will of course say this movie is great because they won't notice that it doesn't have a brain in its head. one star.
