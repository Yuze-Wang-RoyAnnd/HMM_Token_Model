i was really looking forward to this movie but sadly it didn't live up to expectation.<br /><br />a good movie has the audience identifying/empathising/sympathising with the main actor. unfortunately this was very hard to do with samantha morton.<br /><br />the storyline seemed very disjointed and didn't flow as it should/could have done.<br /><br />keifer sutherland appeared to be little more than window dressing and made me wonder why he agreed to play what appeared to be a bit part. beautiful scenery and the acting of tem morrison and cliff curtis was about the only plus.<br /><br />maybe by being a kiwi i set the bar higher for locally made films. maybe the change of director/ supposedly hard to work with main actor has biased my opinion.<br /><br />maybe i'm just trying to make excuses for a movie which could have been great.<br /><br />a lot of maybes which still does not explain why this movie just lacked anything special.<br /><br />it could have been great, it wasn't.
