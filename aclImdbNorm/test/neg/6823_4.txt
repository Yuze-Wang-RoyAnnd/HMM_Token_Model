this is a pretty run of the mill family move that i am sure most children will enjoy but with really no that much to please any adults viewing the movie. the premise of the film is that belushi's cop character takes his retirement but gets drawn into a case which results in him becoming a private investigator. the movie's plot is so obvious most of the kids will surely pick the ending before it happens. but additionally to that there seem to be story arcs and sub plots that are forgotten about as the movie progresses. this coupled with a sub plot where the titular k-9 gets pimped out by belushi. one to be avoided i am afraid.
