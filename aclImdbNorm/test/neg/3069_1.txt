i'm big into acting, writing, and directing, but not famous yet. my friends and i frequently rent bad movies, just for fun and a good laugh, but when we went to the local family video and found a movie called biker zombies from detroit, we knew it was gonna be the worst movie of all time and it was! biker zombies from detroit has no script! they can say they do have one, but they're liars! there was a 4 minute scene of just two guys riffing about women and sexuality, and you could tell it was improvised. and if they're going to improv, it should be at least decent, but it wasn't, and you could tell by the two actors screwing up lines and saying stuff that didn't even make sense.<br /><br />to give you an idea of how terrible and retarded this movie is, here's the beginning: a girl flicks a guy off, he punches her in the face and beats her up, then rapes her. then we see zombies who attack and they both turn into zombies.<br /><br />this is the beginning of the movie! not to mention the lead zombie voice over that carries through the whole movie, trying to be sinister and thought provoking, but sounding like marylin manson having a conniption fit.<br /><br />worst movie ever. bottom line, folks. but watch it if you like movies with no script, no plot, bad acting, bad editing, bad music, and over 100 f words used in the movie.<br /><br />if this can hit video stores, my future films are gonna win oscars.
