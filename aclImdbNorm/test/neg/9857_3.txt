kasparov vs. deep blue is no doubt a fascinating story, but i don't think you'd know it by watching this movie. i think it focuses too much on the conspiracy theory that ibm cheated...and what does this theory hinge upon? the idea that at one point the computer made a move that "looked human". i am not a chess grandmaster or a computer scientist. and while i don't doubt that the move looked human, to me it doesn't seem beyond the realm of possibility that the most powerful chess-playing computer ever created could make a surprising move...or that such a machine could beat even a genius like kasparov. the movie gets way too much mileage out of this theory, and not enough out of the personalities of the people involved...that could have made it a much more interesting story. the direction also relies way too much on the conceits of a pointlessly whispered narration, and the imagery of an 18th century chess-playing machine that looks like one of those animatronic gypsy fortunetellers you see at the carnival. also the story was slowed down by many empty shots of kasparov revisiting "the scene of the crime". i don't doubt that kasparov and the chess community found ibm's behavior vexing, but i don't think it's any different than you would find from any other big corporation. at the end of the movie, you are left with the feeling that kasparov is a huge crybaby and the deep blue programmers are either victims or cheats. i think if the filmmaker wanted the viewer to believe the conspiracy theory (which he almost certainly did), he should have presented a lot more evidence. in fact, more evidence would have been a good idea in the first place. the whole thing left me with a sour taste in my mouth.
