***big spoilers!*** "flesh feast" of 1970 is a more than unworthy conclusion to the great veronica lake's career. this has the wide reputation of being an awful stinker, and rightly so, i must say. as a huge fan of low-budget horror/exploitation, especially from the 70s, i nonetheless chose to watch this, mainly due to the cool camp-looking picture on this site, but after watching it i had to recognize that the picture actually has nothing to do with the film. the picture here on this site is the cover of a dvd collection entitled 'flesh feast' containing four films, including sergio martino's "mountain of the cannibal god" and dal tenney's "i eat your skin". what the collection does not include, however, is this boring turkey. "flesh feast" is not only camp and ridiculous, but mostly quite tedious, which is even more pathetic regarding that the film is only 70 minutes long. also, don't get fooled by the title, the film is not gory at all. yet it is watchable, if only for its trashiness and, especially, the extremely stupid, but therefore somewhat entertaining ending. the film follows a ridiculous plot about dr. elaine frederick (veronica lake), an ingenious female scientist who can somehow rebuild youth with the help of flesh-eating maggots (don't ask how). a bunch of criminals (or terrorists, or whatever), who are paid by a radical political group assign the doctor to restore the youth of a 'mysterious' commander. after an endless hour of nonsensical drivel, it turns out that the mysterious commander is actually hitler himself. it was quite obvious before, but i still had to burst out laughing because the film's finale was so unbelievably silly and unintentionally hilarious... this is a film that is very inadequate as the last film of a great actress and former beauty queen like veronika lake. except for lake, the performances are ridiculously bad, even for a zero-budget production like this. bad performances, however, are something i can easily forgive in films like this one. what i can not forgive, though, is extreme boredom. the final five minutes make this watchable for hardcore fans of camp stuff, but i would still recommend to skip it.
