'the 4th floor' is a decidedly mediocre film starring juliette lewis as a young interior designer with a heck of a problem neighbor. jane (lewis) has recently inherited a terrific 5th floor apartment from her grandmother, and per agreement with the landlord, gets a ridiculously low renting rate. her boyfriend (william hurt as a creepy weather man) wants her to move in with him, but she wants her own space. so she moves in, and weird stuff starts happening, and because this is a b-grade horror flick, there's a dumb, not-to-be-found-in-reality reason why. as the none-too-intriguing jane keeps trying to tell others- her boyfriend, the police, coworkers- what's going on, everybody thinks she's losing it. so, of course, she has to face the problem- the lunatic living right below her- alone. neither scary nor interesting, the movie's single saving grace is lewis. she's a very fine actress but poorly used here, which is not to say she isn't the best thing about this flick- because she is. she has feral charisma and holds the screen better than a dozen of the silicone bimbos that routinely populate this type of movie. this type of movie, though, is not worthy of her- which is ironic, given that she's probably the only reason anyone would see it.
