oh, how i laughed during those first couple of scenes. this silly little film about an 11 year-old who carries a gun, steals cars, robs stores, burglars houses, extorts money from other kids, burns houses, shoots rats, buys drugs, distributes drugs to his mother and his friends, and then kills a guy. what a great comedy! but it wasn't intended to be a comedy. it was intended as a social drama. how can this be? the events in this film are absurd and ridiculous. the characters are all stereotypes right out of a 4 year-old's comic-strip-induced immature imagination. the dialog is laughable; people talk like morons. it's a very dumb film.<br /><br />the first scenes are indeed very funny, for all the wrong reasons. but the unintentional hilarity of the idiotic premise runs out after a short while, and after that the laughs come only rarely; by that time the viewer can't believe what he is seeing and is alternately amazed and bored by what follows (if he has at least half a brain cell).<br /><br />a short film, but feels like an eternity. the film actually is a seriously-intended attempt to show the world of a young degenerate, while imitating movies vastly superior to it, like "fun". there is just such an air of phoniness about everything; the kids, the adults, everyone lacks credibility both in their actions and dialog. the kid in the lead mugs his way through the film as though he had seen all the jimmy cagney movies at least a hundred times. and, typically enough, the kid isn't portrayed as a reservoir of evil, but, instead, as a misunderstood little artistic talent. but of course. every young hooligan is misunderstood - society made him bad. poor child.<br /><br />the film is embarrassing; a collection of stale, occasionally hilarious clich'es put together to make a movie that lacks intelligence and meaning. the intellectual level of the film is zero.
