i am not so old that i can't remember laughing at bobcat goldthwait a couple times. but some where in all his years of drug abuse he lost his sense of humor as well as his brain cells.<br /><br />from the moment this film opens you can have no sympathy nor empathy for the female lead. neither will you find anything remotely funny after hearing the opening line. goldthwait obviously hates himself so much that he needs to degrade in order to feel better- even if it is his own imaginary characters he degrades. <br /><br />if you ever saw shakes the clown you know how unfunny bobcat was 15 years ago...this movie is worse. it was not even funny by accident it is sad, pathetic and a total waste of time. may goldthwaits' hands be rendered paralyzed so he can not write another script. strike his tongue so he can not dictate another unfunny scene. he is sad and pathetic and needs to make room for a new talent dying to get into hollywood
