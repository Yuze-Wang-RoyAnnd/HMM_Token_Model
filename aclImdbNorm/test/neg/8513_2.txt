in my opinion, this movie is not good. i hardly find a good thing to say about it, but still i would like to explain, before i conclude it is just another bad movie.<br /><br />i decided to watch it because costas mandylor is starring in it, and that was the main reason i watched it till the end. i like action movies, and i understand that such movies are built on the action rather than the story. i know they don't go into details when it comes to the credibility of the story and the events, but even that does not explain why some scenes, just because they lack the sense of reality, look ridiculous.<br /><br />at the beginning, the movie looks quite promising: a tough, good looking specialist and his not so tough but smart and funny partner must do a job, which turns out a bit different than they expected. the story takes place on a cruise ship. a disaster happens, the ship is turned over, and only a few are left alive. during their struggle to survive they have to escape a shark, a professional killer and the rising water.<br /><br />furthermore, the movie is quite violent. the main weapon (beside the disaster which already took out most of the passengers) is the gun, which is successfully used in many cases. i personally missed a good man to man (or woman to woman if you prefer) fight. family fun? i don't think so.<br /><br />all in all, i think this movie was shot in a hurry, without a real vision what it is trying to say. made of the usual action movie tricks, with a bit of something called love, and without a real meaning, it just results in a bad movie.
