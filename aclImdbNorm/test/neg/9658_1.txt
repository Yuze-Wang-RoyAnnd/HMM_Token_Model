this movie was absolutely terrible. the only explanation i can think of for the good reviews it received from some here is that they were written by people in the cast. it was actually painful to watch this movie. even my grandchildren (ages 6-13) could not bear to watch it. as far as i know, this movie never made it to theaters and for good reason. it's as if some people were sitting around having a beer and said, "hey! let's make a movie. who wants to be in it?" it's that bad. besides luke perry, who is only in a small part of the movie, i did not recognize a single other actor. that's not necessarily a bad thing but it is in this case. i liked sandlot (i) and i generally like stupid and silly movies but this movie doesn't have a single redeeming quality. the people who wrote it don't have the slightest clue as to how children think, talk, or act and the movie is a disjointed mess of terribly corny lines and stupid jokes. i rarely write negative reviews but this is the worst movie i have seen since man's best friend and it's definitely one of the ten worst movies i have ever seen in my life. if you rent it, remember that i warned you. the fact that some people actually rated this movie as being good is a sad commentary on their taste and intelligence. i'm not exaggerating.
