this movie's only redeeming factor was the fact that it was on tv for free, and that it probably helped the romanian economy. other than that, hallmark needs to re-evaluate this division of their empire, and maybe keep their movies more oriented towards bizarre love affairs between cancer-stricken hemophiliacs in mississippi. to go into details about how mindless this movie is would give credit to it for being memorable. it wasn't. i remember the act of watching it, there being vampires (some of them teenage) and some very bad dubbing. whoever worked on the dubbing track of this movie needs to be relocated to another sector of society...maybe food service, to the deaf. if you have the opportunity, watch this movie, just because it makes so many other really bad movies seem oscar-worthy in retrospect. then again, if you actually ended up at this movie's profile, i imagine that it may be too late...
