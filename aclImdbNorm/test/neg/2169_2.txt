while the writing was terrible, the acting was atrocious, the only thing that saved this "turd" was the breast count, but that wasn't enough to make me watch this again. all said and done i'm actually dumber from watching this movie. this was a new low for troma. lloyd kaufman starting the movie wearing a garbage bag and making fart noises should have made me realize what i was getting into. this was by far one of the worst ever put out by the troma team. the best place to show this movie would be to invalids, sense they can't get up to change the channel. to conclude this is not a swift recommendation to watch this movie just for the breasts.
