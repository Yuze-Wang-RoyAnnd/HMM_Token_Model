okay, so i'm singaporean and i would like to say that it's time to stop stereotyping singaporeans and making such films. some of the actors/actresses actually have talent, but sadly it wasn't shown much in this film. i was fidgeting in my seat when i watched this, being quite young at that time, my parents dragged me along to see it. honestly i could say that i was going to fall asleep. and there was this arrogant westernized boy whom just got on my nerves. overall a boring film, and a general waste of the actors' talent. i have seen better singaporean movies than this. chicken rice war was good. however, i cannot believe that this one would be considered a better singaporean film. sorry, i wouldn't recommend it.
