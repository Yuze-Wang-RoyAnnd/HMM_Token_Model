this movie reminds me old b movies, but not in a good way.<br /><br />when i saw the first scene i thought it was going to be a spoof of one of those early sf films. the terrible acting, the plastic props and the noticeable visual effects gave me that impression.<br /><br />but no, the movie is really that bad. the story is a complete nonsense, the effects are below the level of a tv production; even the editing is a mess.<br /><br />the only thing that kept me in the theater was that i wanted to know the end of the story, although i was pretty sure it was going to be silly (and it was).<br /><br />there are better ways to spend your time and money.
