wow. they told me it was bad, but i had no idea.<br /><br />we've started a tradition. we found one copy of this movie, and we just pass it from person to person. whoever has the movie watches it, and then passes it to someone else deemed worthy of seeing this unique, creative, horrible movie. hopefully it'll travel 'round the world a few times.<br /><br />it's painful. really painful. it's even beyond so bad it's funny. well, okay, sometimes it's so bad it's funny. but most of the time it just gives you that feeling that there's something sucking at your brain from the inside.<br /><br />wow. watch it, then pass it.
