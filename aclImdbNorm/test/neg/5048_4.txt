going into teaching mrs tingle, all i wanted was a fun, enjoyable teen comedy that would entertain me for it's running time. despite a rather good first half hour, the film quickly subsides into a dull, clich'ed mess that's about as entertaining as pulling out your eyelashes with pliers. rusty pliers, at that. 'scream' writer kevin williamson wrote and directed this movie, and proved that scream may well have been a fluke. most of the elements of this movie have been seen a million times already in other films; and while it was ok for him to steal elements from other movies in scream, due to the fact that it's meant as a slasher tribute; here, it just looks like he's completely ran out of ideas. the plot follows the cleverest girl in school, played by katie holmes. after being caught cheating along with two of her friends; the three decide to take the teacher that caught them hostage in her own home. however, this isn't just any teacher; it's mrs tingle, the meanest bitch in school. she isn't taking being tied to the bed lying down either, as she begins to play mind games to turn her captors against each other.<br /><br />the plot is very similar to the 1997 flick 'suicide kings', and a whole host of earlier films. it's actually not a bad idea for a movie, and if williamson could have populated the film with interesting characters; it could have worked really well. the character of mrs tingle is the most interesting in the movie, but she's massively one dimensional, and like all the other characters in the film; is merely a caricature. the acting is largely diabolical, with the exception of helen mirren in the title role. she's suitably evil in the role, and while she doesn't have a lot to get her teeth into; she clearly enjoys herself playing the central figure. the teenage cast isn't worth mentioning, with only katie holmes standing out; and that's only really because of her star profile, not her acting talents. williamson has draped nearly every scene in dull soft rock music, which would be really annoying if the film wasn't absolutely terrible anyway. honestly, this movie does have a few moments that are rather good; but basically, if you want to see a good example of the teen comedy - this isn't the movie that you want to see.
