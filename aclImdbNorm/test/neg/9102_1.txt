my friends and i rented this movie mistaking it for another one about skateboarding. watchin steve guttenberg as an action hero is hilarious. the movie is so incredibly predictable and over the top that it ended up being a laugh fest. even though i gave it a 1/10 this movie should be seen especially if u manage to catch it on tv anywhere.
