i normally am a glutton for poor movies, but this thing stunk.<br /><br />do not watch this movie.<br /><br />terrible effects and very little humour, what the hell was the point of making this movie? no gore to speak of and no acting to speak of.<br /><br />i could only manage 45 minutes of this rat dropping of a movie, and that is rare for me.<br /><br />something positive to say about this drivel? cover art was ok, i am pretty sure the movie has a ending too, even tho i did not make it to it.<br /><br />the rats were unorganized and blew their lines constantly,they lacked intensity and seemed just to be going through the paces for their paycheque. the actors were worse.
