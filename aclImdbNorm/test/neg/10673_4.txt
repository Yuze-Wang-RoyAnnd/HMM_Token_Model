frank tashlin's 'censored' is a so-so private snafu short which aims to teach the importance of the censor in stopping military secrets from leaking out. snafu attempts to get word out to his girlfriend that he's to be stationed in the south pacific but the censor foils each attempt he makes to send the letter. these early scenes are the best, with the unseen censor plucking the letter out of the sky with long mechanical arms, nets and even a specially employed eagle! the second half of the cartoon, in which snafu manages to send the letter with the aid of technical fairy, first class (who is actually teaching him a lesson), is less funny and climaxes with a disappointing only-a-dream finale. the main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of snafu's extremely scantily clad girlfriend who is even seen bare-breasted, albeit with strategically placed limbs at all times! aimed at the military, the snafu shorts were often characterised by a heightened bawdiness but these scenes, crowbarred in as they may be, are by far the most erotic i've come across in any of these shorts thus far. despite all this, i prefer the snafu shorts that go for the jugular a little more, usually resulting in the death of the main character. for great examples of this, seek out tashlin's 'the goldbrick' or chuck jones's 'spies'. 'censored' is fairly weak by comparison.
