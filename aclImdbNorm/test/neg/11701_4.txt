this film gives new meaning to the term "uneven", giving us a few intriguing characterizations offset by an awkwardly realized plot that relies on a few well-placed stingers to deliver the majority of the thrills.<br /><br />the plot concerns a group of men who harbor a secret that has caused a curse to be visited on them in the form of a ghostly female apparation that causes death. she also may be seducing their sons.<br /><br />it is quite a spectacle to have all the notable veteran actors together in one film, but unfortunately they're not very convincing, particularly the scene where melvyn douglas goes off the deep end begging the others to listen to him. it's no shock then that the actors who play these same characters in their youth are terrible, especially the giggling ricky. they deliver the worst "gee-aren't-we-all-drunk" scene i've ever watched.<br /><br />the movie has a few saving graces, namely dick smith's great ghost makeups (however misplaced they are in this film), and alice krige's fascinating performance as alma/eva. i've never read the novel that this film was taken from, but i intend to after reading some of the other reviews on this page. you don't have to have read the book, however, to realize that this is only a shadow of the original tale. there is a good story here, but it seems lost somewhere, amid exposition that shows the men having nightmares over and over again and making unsubtle references to the secret they all share. <br /><br />as it stands, it appears as if there was about half an hour of footage removed from this print, particularly near the climax. after all...how is it that fred astaire manages to mount an excavation of the pond so quickly? what did gregory bate and the kid have to do with eva? and while we're at it...what the hell was she, anyway? why did letting her out of the car cause the apparition to disappear? if it was an apparition, how could it have sex with two men and have them not know?<br /><br />these and other questions will never be answered, at least not by this film. unless some restored footage is discovered somewhere, it will probably forever remain a curiosity with some oozing makeup, bizarre sex scenes and nudity, and a few attractive performances.
