the acting was horrible. the special effects, while exceptional, dominated the movie. the writing was pathetic, and the dialogue was unbelievable. and the silly little love story between liv tyler and ben affleck was out of place.<br /><br />but the worst offense of "armageddon" was the total lack of scientific reality. "the asteroid is the size of texas," says billy bob thornton. er, that's 800 miles wide! no one in nasa even sees the asteroid until a midday meteor shower wrecks havoc in new york? suuuuure. nasa hires a drilling team to join the astronauts and trains them in a week? yeah, right. someone brings a sidearm on the space shuttle with them? yeah, that's realistic. and bruce willis blows up the asteroid with three seconds to spare. how disney-esque!<br /><br />how bad was this movie? i rooted for the asteroid!
