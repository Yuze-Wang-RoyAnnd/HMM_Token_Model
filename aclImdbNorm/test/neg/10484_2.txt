when a rocket from a government experiment on the effects of cosmic rays on animals crashes in a small texas town, people start to die. the county sheriff tries to investigate but is hampered in his efforts by other government officials. it turns out that there is a mutant space gorilla on the loose killing teenagers in the woods.<br /><br />i like low budget science fiction and horror movies. i like monster movies. so i thought that there would be a good chance that i would like this movie. sadly, i didn't.<br /><br />i don't mind the bad acting, the corny dialog, the atrocious musical score or the giant plot holes that this movie has. there are a lot of movies that have the same problems that i have seen and enjoyed in a so bad it's good kind of way.<br /><br />but where others of that type and night fright differ is that night fright just has terrible pacing. and it drags on because of that. there are scenes that just go on and on without anything happening-the searching the woods for clues is just people walking in the forest for a long time; there are several seemingly endless dancing teens at a party in the woods...but nothing interesting is going on. if these scenes were shorter, the movie might not have been as boring (though i don't think simply cutting those scenes would save this one).<br /><br />i have now given this movie three viewings to make sure that i gave it a chance before slamming it in this review. sadly, it has gotten worse with each watch. there won't be a fourth.
