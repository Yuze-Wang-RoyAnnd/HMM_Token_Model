computing . can there be anything more boring ? sitting in front of a computer all day typing away at some keys all day every day , tap tap tapping . that's much of the problem with this movie , the heroine sits in front of a computer vdu tapping the keys and no matter how many looks of agitation she gives , or how much suspenseful notes the composer strikes or how many extreme close ups the director uses there's not much excitement down to the fact that there's few things less exciting than watching somebody on a computer <br /><br />there's a few other problems too much of them factual errors regarding how computers work . is it possible to hack into a computer that is both turned off and not connected to the internet ? i guess that when the net was made 10 years ago very few people would understand how computers worked so the screenwriters would have been able to bs at length but since we now live in a global village where nearly every household in the western world has their own computer the audience are certainly very clued up on the factual errors of this movie . and of course there's too many instances where someone acts stupid or out of character at crucial times in order to progress the plot which makes the net a very mediocre movie
