shakalaka boom boom is a rip off from the movie amadeus. i personally rate amadeus as one of my favorites not only because it is about music, which is my favorite subject, but also because it tells us the real story of a musical genius who is not only remembered for the voluminous works of beautiful music he produced during his life-time, but for his own self-destructive nature and his tragic death at a young age of 35, being virtually uncelebrated during his life time because of the politics played by some people, particularly saliere, the italian composer, who was jealous of him.<br /><br />personally, i was shocked to see shakalaka.., as the director has invariably cut-pasted most of the scenes from the movie amadeus. i see the worst kind of plagiarism in this movie and am skeptic about the kind of movies bollywood keeps on churning day by day. the movie is a disaster, the two musicians in the movie don't give you any feeling of being realistic, the film is tasteless, meaningless and total failure on every count. the only person who makes an impact is bobby deol, who at least knows how to act. otherwise, the whole cast looks like a bunch of amateurs.<br /><br />the irony is that while watching the movie, the first screen in the movie says that all characters in this movie are fictitious and that any resemblance with anyone is purely coincidental which is a blatant lie, because all resemblances are very much clear and they are very much intended. i wish i could take darshan and co. to court not only for copyright infringement, but also for mutilating a beautiful work of art.
