1st watched 6/21/2001 - 2 out of 10(dir-emmanuel itier): pretty much worthless supposed thriller that spends more time drawing us into sexual encounters with and without the star 'amber smith.' it tries to wrap a story around the sex scenes but as usual with these types of movies it is not done very well. i was so bored with this movie that i actually fast-forwarded thru the ending to get it over with. the video version i watched was called 'tell me no lies.'
