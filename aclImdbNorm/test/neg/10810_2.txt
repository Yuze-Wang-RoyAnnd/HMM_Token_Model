ok, i saw this film through mystery science theater 3000, but i did see the movie, so i figured i would leave a comment on it. i just love once again how joe gets stuck with the crummy roles while his brother and nephew's are just getting the oscar winning roles left and right. soultaker is technically what you would call the movie that was meant to be good. it seemed like the director and actors just took this movie extremely seriously and had very cheesy effects, a story that didn't make much sense, and not to mention pretty crummy acting abilities. this is one of my favorite mst3k episodes, simple because a lot of what they mention is what we are thinking throughout the film and i'll explain why in a moment.<br /><br />natalie and zach are a couple who broke up and are now trying to work things over. but since zach is in upper lower class and natalie is in middle class, it just ain't gonna work. but on the way home, they and zach's friends get into a car accident and now the angel of death/soultaker is after them to meet his quota of soultaking. but also it seems like he's had some kind of other life relationship with natalie and just can't seem to move on. so now natalie and zach must race against the ever appearing five million times a minute clock to save their souls and lives.<br /><br />well, i guess zeppelin was wrong when he sang that there was a stairway to heaven, i wonder if black sabbith was wrong too, lol. basically there are a lot of plot holes in this movies, like no one can see the characters and they can't be killed, yet somehow they can still press buttons and open doors? the angel of death had a very strange face and was a bit distracting from the story itself. soultaker was just a lousy film that was rushed and makes you just feel so bad for joe, the under-appreciated sheen/estovez brother.<br /><br />2/10
