the acting is awkward and creepy, and not in a good way...at all. the writing, the dialogue, and the chemistry between the actors is horrible. nothing makes sense and every close-up of an actor's expression or reaction lasts 3 or 4 seconds too long, making it seem like a mexican soap opera (telenovela). everything about the writing is unrealistic, and all of the actors involved make it that much worse with their campy interpretations of the script. am i the only one who sees this??? to use the word cheesy to describe this canadian disaster would be the understatement of the century. did the director even watch the final cut before it was put on the air???
