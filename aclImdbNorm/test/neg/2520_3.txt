i first heard of this film when patton oswalt talked about it on his "werewolves and lollipops" cd. he said it was a lost classic that is completely ridiculous. being a lover of terrible cinema, i knew i was in for a treat.<br /><br />this film is, hands down, one of the weirdest i've ever seen. certainly one of the weirdest shlock films. basically, a demon took human form years ago for a woman, the woman died or something, the demon cried blood, the blood fell on the bed, the bed is now possessed and it now eats. along with fruit, flowers and chicken, it also has a taste for people. the people can range between horny teens, mayors, gangsters, servants or professional orgy throwers. there's also a sick guy who the bed ate but put his soul behind a picture in the room.<br /><br />most movies let you figure out the plot through exciting action. death bed takes another path: it basically tells you through narration exactly what's happening while slow, dull murder scenes take place. also, i must say everyone who's eaten by the bed are surprisingly quiet. i would think if a bed is eating you through the ways of a 5th grade science fair experiment, it would sting a little. i guess nerve endings weren't invented until 1981 or so.<br /><br />the story is wacky, the direction is slow and pretty awful, the sets are sparse, the acting it fairly painful and the brother is one of the unintentionally ugliest actors i've ever seen. probably would make a great party film if alcohol and smart-asses are involved. certainly one you shouldn't miss.
