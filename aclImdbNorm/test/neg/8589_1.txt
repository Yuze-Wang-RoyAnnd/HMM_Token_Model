i have never seen a more unrealistic movie than this foul piece of dung. the acting was over the top. the direction was tacky and amateurish. the script was just a joke. the story looked penned by a person that has never been around a high school football game, much less a professional game. and why, why did oliver stone feel the need to place himself in this movie as an actor? he was terrible, playing the most unrealistic announcer ever. he could not even get hired to do professional wrestling contests. then you have jamie foxx, who throws like a girl. but, he is a tad more athletic than the aged dennis quaid. seriously, stone wanted to direct this film at 16 year old males with add. that is why we hear the loud music, the quick cuts and numerous edits. it just became a bad mtv video. shame on al pacino for doing this crap. cameron diaz? heck, that no-talent takes any role that comes down the pike. when lawrence taylor is the best "actor" you got going, well, your movie sucks! and this one does.
