it's a shame barry humphries infamous sir les patterson character had it's film debut in this under cooked spy/comedy.<br /><br />this film reminded me of the beatty/hoffman stinker, ishtar (1987). humphries should have learned from the mistakes that film made - if your going to change gears on a concept don't use spies! like ishtar, the first 20 minutes or so offer a promise of something different. it would have been great to see the anachronistic and boorish patterson sleazing around in the world of australian politics. one of characters even point out that patterson is of date with the current times - you'd think humphires could of had a field day making commentary on the hawke government (i can just picture a scene with patterson and hawkie in a drinking contest). but instead of a film that might of been clever and even a biting look into that world, we get patterson running around the world as james bond trying to save the world from bio-chemical weapons that runs out of steam before the half way mark.<br /><br />disappointing.
