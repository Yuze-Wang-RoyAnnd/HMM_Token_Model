ok, if i was in the rental store and someone asked me if the movie was worth the three bucks for the rental, i'd have to say no. the plot was implausible. i've come to the conclusion that keanu reeves can not act. he can, at times, be painful to watch (though my wife thinks he's cute). dan aykroyd (who is usually great) was even a little disappointing as the crooked cop. on the plus side, the plot (because it is far-fetched) is unpredictable. cameron diaz was good.
