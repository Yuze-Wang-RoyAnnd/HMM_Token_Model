so me and my friend are carousing our local movie rental store and are looking for something to pick up to go along with eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, so why not pick up the third installment in the scarecrow series!?! keep in mind that this is not just scarecrow three; this is, scarecrow: gone wild. now both of us had seen to the first two scarecrows so we felt obligated to finish the job. let's start with the cover of the dvd first. first we notice a picture of ken shamrock ("the world's most dangerous man") on the cover. apparently he was used to market the movie as the "lead actor". by the way, he has the least screen time of any member of the credited class. next we notice a picture of a very attractive and very scantily clad woman in the middle ground of the cover. i can assure you that she is not in the movie....at all. at the time of rental we assumed that this was to reiterate the fact that the scarecrow was "going wild". in the background we noticed a large carnival on an island out in the ocean. i can also assure you that the carnival is also not in the movie...at all. looking back me and my friend should have known something was up. i mean really, who the heck puts a carnival on an island. now on to the actual movie. we start when a young man is inexplicably fused to a scarecrow in the middle of a corn field. don't ask me how they were fused but think of when brandon lee waking up from the dead in the crow. it's just that stupid. but in the scarecrow's defense, he has "gone wild". anyhoo, the scarecrow, who now lives vicariously through the young man, takes a trip to his local beach to brutalize those who had done him wrong. because yes, in the world of the scarecrow, beaches are conveniently located in the same general vicinity as cornfields. to make a long story short the scarecrow kills all who stand in his path without any warning except for the scarecrow's trademark whistle that signals a slashing. this is however rather impossible to believe because the scarecrow's costume's mouth is clearly sewn shut. several tracking shots that would make kubrick roll over in his grave later, and we have one of the worst third installments in a series ever. well except for maybe the third matrix. as joel siegel would say, "this scarecrow is wildly bad."
