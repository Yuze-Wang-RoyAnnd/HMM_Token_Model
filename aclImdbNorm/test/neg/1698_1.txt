the most irritating thing about "dies d'agost" (august days) is not simply that nothing happens in this film but that director marc recha has the nerve to pretend that this film is some sort of homage to leftist catalan journalist ramon barnils. unless mentioning barnils' name a few times constitutes an "homage," this pretense is an utter fraud. you will learn virtually nothing about barnils in this film nor about the spanish civil war (1936-1939) nor about the special role of catalunya in that war. you also will not learn about the collective punishment inflicted on the heroic catalan people for years afterward by the victorious and vindictive franco.<br /><br />the footage of the catalan countryside is very beautiful, of course, but "dies d'agost" does not have an extensive and varied enough collection of such scenes to qualify as a travelogue. the large number of stills shown -- not very illuminating images of the forest floor, for example -- is the clearest indication of the paucity of ideas here. the aimless drift of brothers marc and david during their camping trip does not produce compelling cinema. on the contrary, one's strongest impression is of a film made by and for spaced-out, middle-aged hippies. don't waste your time. read a good book about the spanish civil war instead. (i recommend felix morrow's scathingly anti-stalinist "revolution and counter-revolution in spain," which contains a gripping account of the 1937 barcelona uprising.)<br /><br />barry freed
