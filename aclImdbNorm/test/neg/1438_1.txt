wow...this movie really really sucks...'nuff said.<br /><br />the story: a psychopathic internet predator stalks and lures young men and women into torturous traps...it goes like this, kidnaps people, they find him, he becomes a changed man and is released on the world yet again, reverts back to his old ways and starts the torture again....the story is stupid, it's implausible. the characters are stupid, they're implausible...or at the very least way over the top. it's got some very violent imagery, and if you have a week stomach you might just want to stay away...but than again, even if you don't have a week stomach, you might want to stay away...it's that stupid.<br /><br />the cast: dee snider, kevin gage...if you're a die hard fan of twisted sister and dee snider, you might find this one interesting, since he's the writer and star of this film. his acting is laughably bad, and you can tell that he's the one that wrote the god-awful script. kevin gage...well they say he's been in numerous other movies that i've seen, but i don't remember him from any of them...and you won't remember him from this...these two sadly, make the film...they don't make it good mind you...they just make it...<br /><br />one to five scale: 1 it's bad...it's very very very bad...in fact it's so bad, that this movie should come with a clip loading pistol to play russian rullet with...
