it is hard to imagine anyone making a tom cruise film look good; hard indeed, but this one makes him look good. very good. actually, it makes him look like sir john gielgud celebrating very good acting day with a bravura performance.<br /><br />the acting from the entire ensemble struggled to rise above the risible and failed. the fault was, in part let us be fair, that the plot bore as much resemblance to the hg wells original as did the butchered carcasses of the human victims in the film to their living predecessors: both were bloodied and violated remnants of more attractive predecessor. but to describe a plot such as this to be a bit holy is to say of the colander "my, this kitchen utensil has a remarkable lot of holes", unless, that is, holes are your bag; in which case this film will commend itself to you.<br /><br />the fault in the other part was that these were demotivated, jobbing, dvd actors who knew full well, one assumes, that this was their exhibition that would wind up on the $5 dvd shelf. and overpriced at that.<br /><br />so should you watch it? why yes, of course, you should. you are a miserable sinner and deserve punishment.
