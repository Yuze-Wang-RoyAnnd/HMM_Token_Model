tom cutler (jackson) is a retired policeman who now works as a crime scene cleaner-upper. in his latest job, he cleans a new crime scene and destroys evidence and isn't aware the crime hasn't been officially reported. uh oh, this can't be good. <br /><br />you hear about cleaners all the time, but usually when a mob or gangland hit is involved when bodies etc need to be removed and the area cleaned up. this one is different in that tom cutler works with the police to clean up after the police have done their investigation of a crime scene. hey, someone has to do it. you know the police won't. the movie makes that quite clear and it is up to the family to get the area cleaned up. <br /><br />this is almost a good thriller, but a side plot involving tom's daughter (palmer) makes this story somewhat awkward. i guess they had to fill in some time. oh, they brought this side plot around to connect with the another side plot, but it was still a reach and awkward. see?<br /><br />this was almost a good thriller because there was a noticeable lack of tension, suspense and the pace was somewhat draggy. the music didn't help either as i noticed the music was more appropriate for watching people take a long journey. you know, journey music. get it? ha!<br /><br />the acting by all was excellent in this almost a good thriller. <br /><br />violence: yes, sex: no, nudity: no, language: no
