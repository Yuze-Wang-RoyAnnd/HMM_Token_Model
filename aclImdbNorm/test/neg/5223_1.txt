i recently had the idea to make a short film featuring a man who is hit by a car and wakes up thinking that he himself is chuck norris. this meant that i would have to do extensive chuck research, and find out as much as i could about the man. i later find out that he is not in fact a man, but an angel sent from heaven. with a face like that, who could ever doubt it? i have watched more chuck norris movies in the last four months than any one person should. i am proud to say that bells of innocence ranks pretty close to the top of the all time worst list. i spent most of the film wondering if i could return my copy to the local wal-mart without the receipt, which i had been biting down on to keep myself from swallowing my own tongue. the biggest reason why i chose to purchase this film was that it not only had chuck in it, but his son mike. i was anxious to see if mike was a chip off the old can't-act-his-way-out-of-a-wet-paper-bag block. i came to the conclusion a long while ago; the chuck norris is one of the worst actors in cinematic history for one simple reason. the only character he ever plays is himself, chuck norris. no matter what movie, no matter what situation, he is always chuck norris. the one thing that he holds over his son is that he is consistent. mike doesn't seem to understand how human emotions work. in the scene where he is talking to the little girl about his dead daughter, he seems to be extremely happy! maybe this is because he actually pushed his daughter out into traffic, as depicted in one of the oddest flashbacks of all time. his actions confused me throughout the film, making it very hard for me to focus on what little plot there was. the other two lead actors were just as painful to watch as the son of norris. the guy, who constantly wants to eat or tell a stupid peacock joke, was simply one of the most annoying characters that has ever graced the direct-to-video screen. the only thing i remember him being in other than this movie, was an episode of walker texas ranger, in which he plays an equally annoying character. maybe chuck owes this guy something. the other guy, which is the only name i can think of because he was so forgettable, was your average christian fanatic. i don't have anything against christians, in fact i am one, but this guy was just too much for me. to round out the story, you have a multitude of townspeople who love to call people "friend", and a couple of villains who don't seem to be able to decide which one of them is in charge. not to mention the creepy kids who remind me of the dollar store version of every other group of creepy kids in movies. all in all, the movie is possibly one of the biggest failures of all time, on more levels than chuck norris can kick people's asses. despite being one of the worst actors of all time, i still can't get enough of chuck. maybe he really was sent from heaven...
