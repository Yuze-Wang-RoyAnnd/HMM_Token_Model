''queen of the damned '' is one of the worst adaptations of a book to a movie that i already saw. the only thing that i like in this movie is the soundtrack, anything else besides that.( since i am a fan of korn, marilyn manson, chester bennington of linkin park and wayne static of static-x)<br /><br />there are so many mistakes and so many bad choices that i don't even know how to start. so many stories were cut, like the twin's legend (one of my favorite)armand and daniel's relationship and even louis is not present, to mention a few.(the plot was dead) first, they should have made a movie of ''the vampire lestat'', because it is the second book after ''the interview with the vampire'',and not ''queen of damned''. they tried to squeeze in a single movie so many informations, that you finish not getting almost anything unless you read the vampire chronicles.<br /><br />so many meaningful characters doesn't seem to have a real importance in this movie. it is pandora's case, for example.<br /><br />the actors that they choose to play all the characters doesn't match with many of anne rice's descriptions, specially marius, that is suppose to be a beautiful,tall,imposing blond guy with blue eyes, like lestat. (stuart towsend is also far from being like lestat) i didn't understand why they changed lestat's maker to be marius instead of magnus as well.<br /><br />''interview with the vampire'' was an awesome movie, i loved the actors and tom cruise as lestat was perfect and far superior then stuart townsend.(i am sad that tom cruise declined the chance of playing lestat again) only antonio bandeiras as armand didn't match with armand's looks, but anyway, far superior from this crap movie called '' the queen of damned''.<br /><br />anne rice was so picky about interview that i didn't get how she just sold the rights for this terrible production.
