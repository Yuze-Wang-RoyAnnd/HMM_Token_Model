i just saw this on a local independent station in the new york city area. the cast showed promise but when i saw the director, george cosmotos, i became suspicious. and sure enough, it was every bit as bad, every bit as pointless and stupid as every george cosmotos movie i ever saw. he's like a stupid man's michael bey--with all the awfulness that accolade promises.<br /><br />there's no point to the conspiracy, no burning issues that urge the conspirators on. we are left to ourselves to connect the dots from one bit of graffiti on various walls in the film to the next. thus, the current budget crisis, the war in iraq, islamic extremism, the fate of social security, 47 million americans without health care, stagnating wages, and the death of the middle class are all subsumed by the sheer terror of graffiti.<br /><br />a truly, stunningly idiotic film.
