wings hauser and son, cole hauser team up to make a film about neo-nazi thugs targeting a gay man, and terrorising a city. wings plays the hero, and his real-life son is the villain. fairly low-budget film that has not many redeeming features, and for some reason, no one has seen it! perhaps because it is quite a laughable and ridiculous film, and the studio realised this! maybe wings hauser himself prevented the distribution of 'skins', after seeing it himself! maybe people just didn't want to comment on such a bad film! oh well! i generally like wings and cole as actors, but this was a film that they both should have skipped. wings directed, wrote and was the lead actor in 'skins'! an extremely bad and stupid film! 1/2 out of *****!
