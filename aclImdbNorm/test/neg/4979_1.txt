only three words are really required for this review: piece of crap.<br /><br />if you enjoyed watching the cartoon as a child, you will find this movie to be a complete waste of your time and money. the best thing about your two hours in the auditorium will be your feet sticking to the floor.<br /><br />yes, they do use all of the names and catch phrases. the even name the dog "shoeshine" (in reference to the dog being "shoeshine boy" in the cartoon). they name the love interest polly, but she isn't miss sweet polly purebred.<br /><br />my wife and son drug me to see this. they should have drugged me to see it.<br /><br />the original underdog was voiced by wally cox, the ultimate nerd. this one is voiced by someone with a "smart alleck teenager that knows more than all the adults" attitude.<br /><br />as a stand alone movie, it is awful. as an homage to underdog, it is even worse. it is not an homage. it is not a retelling of the story. it is not an updating of the story. it is purely an attempt to cash in on a known title and create merchandising. the next time i go to the store, i fear that i will see underdog toys, pajamas, towels, sheets, clothing, etc. mcdonalds and burger king probably fought over the kid's meal rights for this.<br /><br />the worst part of this movie, however, is the soundtrack. they do the underdog theme song to rap (read that with a silent "c" at the beginning)! great, now that we are going to destroy something, let's go all the way.<br /><br />i knew that it would probably be bad before i went. my fears were confirmed when i arrived at my local 12 plex and found that they opened it for the first day and first showing in their smallest auditorium (and one of only four without stadium seating). even the theatre people knew it was going to be garbage! save your money on the tickets and invest it better by going out and buying the original series on dvd. it will be more entertaining and have better production values.
