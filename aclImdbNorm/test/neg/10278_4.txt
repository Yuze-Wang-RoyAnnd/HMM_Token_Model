i watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and must say: i was not impressed, not at all. i do side with the other posters when it comes to the fine performances, but some good performances do not make a good movie.<br /><br />on the discussion board, i found a review by an anonymous poster that captured some of the main points. it says: "'deed poll' is a movie that raises many questions but hardly answers even a few; a movie that is disturbing and above every attempt at categorizing; an experiment and a very conventional sexual drama despite some shocking scenes. the brilliant acting of barbara kowa and andr'e schneider, the partly very impressive editing and the good camera work (steffen ritter) make up for gross plot holes and some technical slips (especially in sound). however, the boredom the audiences have to deal with for 40 minutes remains." unfortunately, this is true. i wasn't intrigued by the story at all. the protagonists are cold, ambition-less people. they do a lot of drugs and have a lot of (incestuous) sex. so what? for many times, the direction seemed to be virtually non-existent, not to mention the technical aspect: the poor sound quality was enormously disturbing.<br /><br />what's the point of the movie? what's the message behind it all? the anonymous reviewer said: "somehow biermann failed to make a clear point and so the movie remains hanging in mid-air without a message. thus the boredom i blame on the movie. the movie is reserved and emotionless, cold, almost neutral and it doesn't take long to see the flaws: for long stretches the characters of sean and ivy are not credible (they clearly have difficulties with the english pronunciation), the character of the mute brother is not developed very well. some moments are very promising though - in the scene where the call boy is skinned (the one and only true love scene) an intensity is reached that one would love to see the whole movie long. as a spectator one has to regret the chances given away." again, i must agree. i did like the final scene, especially because of the beautifully captured faces of gianni meurer and andr'e schneider, but it was nothing compared to the boredom i had to suffer for the first thirty minutes. (the sex scenes, though, were aesthetically staged and perfectly edited.)<br /><br />all in all, "deed poll" was not my cup of tea - a good, controversial idea wasted -, but it was a interesting to see how a movie can be made with practically no money. maybe if they had a bigger budget and a more experienced director, this would have become a better movie.
