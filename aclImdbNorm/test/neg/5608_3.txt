simply put this movies is without any substance whatsoever. just take my word for it and save yourself the time it is a complete dud!! i would say the characters are one dimensional but that would imply there was some sort of character development. i thought eric roberts was going to jump out any second it was so close to b-movie status. <br /><br />the girl from that 70's is beautiful...but unless you are a stalker type fan of hers this movie has nothing for anyone. <br /><br />avoid..avoid...avoid<br /><br />this movie was straight to dvd for a reason...that being...it is a train wreck!!!
