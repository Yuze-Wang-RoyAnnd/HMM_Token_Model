when voting i was going to give a 2 but when seeing that 1 meant awful it hit the nail on the head.the portrayal of native americans as blood thirsty savages is deeply disturbing to me.this is the third film i've seen of d.w. griffiths where races of men are stereotyped in ugly ways.the man isn't able to tell his side of the story so i'm going to try and keep away from attacking mr. griffith personally.in my opinion the three films probably influenced the thinking of millions of people and their children's children.films like this probably made for many of the resentments that are still with us..some may say the camera work was great,the action a first for it's time.the positives are far outweighed by the negatives,it's like someone taking $10 from you and giving a dime back to make up for it.
