i rented this movie today... worst movie ever. it was a total waste of time and a horrible story. the acting was horrible, especially by the actress of "sai". she was so bad it was ridiculous. i can't tell if it was her bad acting or because the character was just that stupid in the first place. i can't even get my mind wrapped around just how awful and pointless this whole movie was. i'm surprised someone even thought it was a good idea to film this movie and bother to release it.<br /><br />if you're looking for a good vampire/horror flick.. this is not the movie for you. move right along! it's a waste of time and money. heck, i wouldn't even download this movie if someone paid me.<br /><br />this movie is so bad it doesn't even deserve a "1". i wish i could give it a "0"!
