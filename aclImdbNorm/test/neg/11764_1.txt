if you're looking for an accurate portrayal of che guevara, the cuban revolutionary who helped aid fidel castro in his bid for power, you'd better read up on cuban history or even type in his name on a search engine (you are on the internet, after all).<br /><br />but whatever you do, do not watch "che!". <br /><br />unless, of course, you just want a good laugh.<br /><br />all the reviewers of the time (and moviegoers) gave "che!" their vote for worst film of the decade. and no wonder; have you seen this travesty? its facts are tenuous at best, sharif is even unconvincing as a corpse and as for palance's fidel catsro imitation.... <br /><br />like i said, if you want a good laugh.<br /><br />it's like watching a co-production between the learning channel and mad magazine.<br /><br />one star. <br /><br />i wonder if palance can do w. c. fields, too?
