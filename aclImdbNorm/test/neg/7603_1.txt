unfortunately this is not one of those movies which at least make you laugh at their unbelievable stupidity. it has no entertainment value at all. it just plain sucks. i don't know where to start to explain how much this movie annoyed me. i think what really takes the cake is the unbearable soundtrack. it sounds as if someone took a simple beat and then, for the rest of it, let a 5 year old child run amok with a synthesizer and taped it. it's really that awful and as if that's not enough, there's not one scene in the movie without "music" (=noise). by the end of the movie, you're either deaf or already cut off your ears earlier. which would at least keep you from falling asleep, since there is nothing happening in the movie to keep your attention. just a lot of bad acting, a few cheap and unconvincing kills, no story at all (it just jumps from one scene to another and you as the viewer can try to make any sense of it) and in the last 30 minutes or so you can witness some of the worst "special effects" ever. it's extremely boring. do not watch this movie! you could do something much more entertaining like staring at a wall or reading the phone-book. did i mention how much the soundtrack sucked?
