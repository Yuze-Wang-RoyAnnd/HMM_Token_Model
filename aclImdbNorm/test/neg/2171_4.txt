elderbush gilch was a big disappointment for me. i'd heared how great it was, how important it was. it just didn't strike me. it had a dim-witted story line, plus some moronic and sadistic native american characters that are thurroughly offensive by today's standards. while most of d.w. griffith's films have depth and intelegence, this one feels more like a formula-baised programme picture.<br /><br />i loved seeing lillian gish and mae marsh in pre-birth of a nation roles, plus some of the staging of the battle scenes were pretty good. acording to future griffith cameraman karl brown, audiences were standing on their seats and cheering once the cavalry comes riding in at the end. i felt nothing. and beleave me, i lve watching griffith's early work at biograph. this film just isn't what it used to be.<br /><br />the best thing about this film it that, for all of it's flaws, it has many of griffith's touches to it. he handles his principal actors pretty well, plus the scene where the indians are encircling the cabin it reminiscent to the climax of birth of a nation, a far superior film that would send shock waves across america a little over a year later.
