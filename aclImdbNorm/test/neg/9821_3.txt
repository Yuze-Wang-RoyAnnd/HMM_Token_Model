the book gets 10 out of 10 stars...<br /><br />probably contains spoilers of both the book and the movie!!!<br /><br />if you've never read geoffrey household's rogue male, the source material for man hunt, you'll likely enjoy fritz lang's treatment of the story. on the other hand, if you're in my camp and have practically memorized the book, the movie will be a crashing disappointment. i'll assume you've already read a synopsis of the story, and proceed to my complaints. household's little novel is one of the all-time great suspense classics, taut and spare, with only a bare handful of characters to propel the action. fritz lang and his screen writer dudley nichols feel the need to throw in the protagonist's brother and a sympathetic floozy, the latter of which reduces the depth of the story by injecting an extrinsic motivation into the screenplay where the novel needed none. in fact, the true climax of the book was not the nameless narrator's escape from his underground lair, but rather his self-acceptance of his true motive for going on his hunt in the first place. and that's another thing: if david fincher and quentin tarantino can get us all the way through fight club and kill bill 1 without revealing the names of their respective protagonists, why can't lang? "thorndyke?" what hat did they pull that out of? which brings me to my bitterest complaint: household's hunter is so quintessentially british,he would bleed a union jack if you cut him. but walter pigeon, who plays him, is canadian! he can barely sustain the accent, which is only slightly deeper and more convincing that kevin costner's in robin hood. he looked about right in the role, and was a fine actor for the 1940s,but as rogue male's reluctant hero? let's look to the sceptered isle itself for a more convincing version. remake soon with subtlety and with, please! i'll direct it for free
