horrible writing, directing and acting! the writer/director has portrayed southerners, especially southern law enforcement as ignorant, backwoods, homophobic and racist (a very popular, yet ignorant, stereotype, that the film industry loves to perpetuate). the acting (or overacting) and the writing came across as amateurish and low budget. the plot line is the same old stale hollywood story of the mean 'ol racist and homophobic rednecks who are ultimately defeated by the enlightened people from "newwww yoke ceety".<br /><br />i was raised in the small louisiana town where this movie was filmed and looked forward to seeing the film but was immediately disappointed during the first few minutes of the movie. the start of the film depicts a gay bar located in the "swamps" of louisiana. how ridiculous a concept! there are a lot of gays and gay bars in south louisiana but no gay bars in the "swamps" or small towns of louisiana. we then are introduced to the sheriff who uses the phrases "homuh-sex'l" in the worst southern drawl and overdone performance ever. then there is the scene where the local police are watching porno on duty in the police station. i could go on and on about the horrible cheesy acting or the stale stereotypes or ridiculous scenes.<br /><br />this director and his crew were welcomed into this small friendly town and shown true southern hospitality. the townspeople of lake arthur, and the state of louisiana were only to be insulted and degraded in the final editing. the good people of lake arthur were excited and enamored with "hollywood" being in town not knowing that in the end, they would be portrayed as ignorant, racist and homophobic country bumpkins in a low budget amateur movie that went straight to dvd. my advice: skip this one or watch it on late night cinemax if it ever makes their rotation.
