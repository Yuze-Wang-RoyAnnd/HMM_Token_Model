ahem.. i think i'll be the only one who's saying this but yes, i was a lil bored during the film. not to say that this is a bad movie, in fact it's a very good attempt at portraying the innermost emotions - dilemma, sorrow, love.., esp it's the director's debut (read from somewhere, is it true?). i felt that something's not quite right, maybe it's just me, i'm not drawn to the characters enough to immerse me in their world. this is a simple story, about ordinary people, ordinary lives. through simple and short dialogs, the director tries to relate a simple guy's life, and how copes with the news of his illness by laughing it away every time. oh ya his laughter was kinda cute at first but gradually it gets to me, such a deep hearty roar for a gentle man! i must say, i didn't feel the impact that most readers felt, in fact i was more drawn to the trivial scenarios like spitting of watermelon seeds with his sis that clearly shows that they're comfortable with each other, the granny who came back for another shot - this is kinda melancholic, the thoughtful gesture of writing down the procedures for his dad - hmm but this is predictable.. don't misunderstood that i'm an action-lover, independent films are my cup of tea! perhaps i just have a really high expectation after watching many deep films that have stronger imagery. some asian films worth the watch: <br /><br />tony takitani (depicts loneliness) wayward cloud (only 1 dialog) my sassy girl (i like it!) 4.30 (loneliness as well) 15 (gangsters lives in local setting) before sunrise and before sunset (i just have to mention these even though they are not asian films. fans will understand!)
