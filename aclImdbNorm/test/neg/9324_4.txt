i found dominion to be a lousy attempt to continue the success of the story. the original movie was a story about evil, and how it can infiltrate our lives.<br /><br />schrader's version is lacking in evil. viewers do not get an overwhelming sense of dread, fear, or even foreboding. harlin's version offers evident evil, shows violations of the church's sanctity, and builds a convincing story that is plausible, given father merrin's background. schrader's story leaves one wondering exactly what happened. dominion does not evoke the emotions of the viewers to empathize with father merrin, and leaves the viewer wondering exactly why he was troubled in the first place.<br /><br />anyone interested in seeing a sequel which lives up to the original should see exorcist: the beginning.
