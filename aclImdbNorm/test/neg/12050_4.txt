i was thrilled by the fresh (pun intended) synopsis of this film and looking forward to watch it. the first few shots introduce some of the characters as well as the main location where the stories take place; the gardening allotments. the movie looks fantastic. colorful yet simple. magical yet genuine. unfortunately, it only takes a few minutes to figure out where the movie will go. we quickly figure out this will be a manipulative, sappy tale illustrating a bunch of jaded people set in their ways confronted by "nice victimized" refugees and that it will have a happy ending where the jaded people realize the error of their ways and accept these people. <br /><br />the characters, particularly the prejudiced ones, are very "comic-booky" in nature. the story focuses mainly on two refugee families. one of them is headed by a single mom played atrociously by diveen henry. i am saddened to say that any emotion that might have been felt toward her struggles were defused by what was memorably bad acting.<br /><br />the other story is much more interesting and focuses on a father and his two children. all are scarred by their journey to this country by way of containers, where the wife and mother died but it is the husband who suffers the most. benedict wong gives a mind-blowing performance here. at first, his emotions are very subdued but as the story develops, he subtly makes us aware of the inner-struggles of his character. <br /><br />unfortunately, the rest of the movie is just extremely boring. there were so many possibilities with this movie. there are several characters to keep track of, many of which might have potential but none of it is realized. even worse, despite this movie being very much not hollywoodian, some of the main plot threads are solved cheaply in a hollywood b-grade way. example:<br /><br />character a likes character b character b rejects his advances no problem! let's have character c declare her love for character a so we can all have a happy ending. yawn. <br /><br />i liked very much the plot thread of the asian family. that was well done. unfortunately, the whole allotment business, the communal aspect of it, the dynamic involving a large cast are all under exploited.<br /><br />what you're left with is a movie that has very little worth.
