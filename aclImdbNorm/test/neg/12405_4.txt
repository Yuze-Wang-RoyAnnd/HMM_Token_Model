your ability to enjoy the ashes of time may depend on our expectations before stepping into the theater. even its most strident supporters seem to agree that audiences can be split right up the middle in their appreciation of this unique film.<br /><br />unlike most hk actioners, the battle scenes are curiously kept at a distance. when they do happen, they're rendered in a jerky style in which it's difficult to make out exactly what's occurring on screen. the dramatic scenes can be extravagantly beautiful, with the of maggie cheung, brigitte lin, and a roll-call of hk's top acting talent chewing up the scenery. as with some of wong kar-wai's early work, the dialog could be more precise. <br /><br />in short, the ashes of time requires a forgiving attitude. released around the same time as wong kar-wai's spectacularly successful chungking express, it's clear that the director isn't as confident working with the elements of the martial arts film. anyone looking for tense action is likely to be disappointed. but those intrigued by the director's aesthetic will likely find this a unique experience at the very least.
