hungary can't make any good movies. fact. this is a great example of that.<br /><br />first of all the term "plot" does not exist in this movie. it's seriously weak. even tho a lot of people would argue with me on that. sure, it's about a taboo, but that's about it. there are endless possibilities, which could have been really great, if used, but they nearly skipped everything. i think the whole movie is just an excuse to show pictures, which are the only decent things in this whole pile of awfulness.<br /><br />the acting is just plain shitty. there aren't many lines, so you would think that the actors have great facial expressions or mimicking abilities, but no. in fact, 86% of the time, they suck. and that's when they don't say anything. if they say even a single word, you'll start tilting your head, saying: "that's damn unrealistic". but than again, this is partly the fault of the writing. there's also no emotion in most of the dialogs.<br /><br />the editing is sometimes ok, but most of the time illogical and just worsens the whole picture. it could have given an emotional push, yet it seems the editing in here is all about putting cuts after each other.<br /><br />someone please explain it to me, why critics say this movie is a masterpiece. calling this an "art" isn't gonna make it better. sorry mundruczo, but you failed. live with it. even tho you probably won't care about my or any other guys opinion scarifying your "child".
