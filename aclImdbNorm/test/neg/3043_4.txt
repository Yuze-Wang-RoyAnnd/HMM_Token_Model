this movie had potential to be a good little high school thriller. instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting. the problem was there were too many unnecessary things. a fight with the boyfriend, random friends coming over to be killed. it was obvious they were just killing time. the main character was bland and uninteresting. camilla bell had no emotion during this movie. she was just there. another problem was the fact that the killer was not a threat. the children survive, so it's obvious they are going to let jill survive. the only reason this got a four was because the last ten minutes (when the killer finally comes out) is actually exciting.<br /><br />4/10
