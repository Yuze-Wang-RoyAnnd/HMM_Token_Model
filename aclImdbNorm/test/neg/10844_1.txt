this is a strong recommendation to anyone who reads this review who has never seen the film total reality, don't waste your time and money renting this poor excuse for a film. this is, without peer, the single worst movie that i have ever seen in my life. i had nightmares of this movie ever since i saw it. the acting was terrible, and any amateur film maker could make a more decent film. the film blatently rips off far superior sci-fi films, such as timecop or total recall (where the title seems to have been derived from). i'm sorry, but i just think that there is more entertainment value in watching the side of a cardboard box for two hours. if you already have seen this movie, i feel sorry for you for going through what i did.
