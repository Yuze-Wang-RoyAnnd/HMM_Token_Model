early 1950s sci-fi directed by lesley selander. special effects of course are very primitive, but pretty good in comparison to what else was out there then. drive-in movie double feature fare; still interesting enough to watch. two leading men, arthur franz the brilliant young scientist dr. jim barker and straight talking and earthy newspaper reporter steve abbot(cameron mitchell)are joined on a manned flight to mars by carol stafford(virgina huston)another scientist and two other space experts(richard gaines and john litel). upon landing on the red planet, the space travelers encounter inhabitants that appear friendly and mentally advanced. in actuality, the martians are led by ikron(morris ankrum), who has the idea of conquering earth to vitalize their civilization. there is a beautiful martian(maruerite chapman)that dr. barker intends to take back on the return trip. she is the movie's redeemable element.
