i remember that hey hey fuss & i saw the jackson jive, it was a pretty straight forward comedy skit but i saw this & it is free & is out in the clear? have i missed something? if the black community should be complaining about any racist comments in a tv show it should be this & if you've read my earlier comments i am not the easy-to-offend guy. the basic plot is that an african/american moves in next to this white guy & they make these racist comments like the value of a house will drop just because of black neighbours & the white guy makes references like (if your easily offended by racial slurs do not read on) nig-nog jungle boy sambo. (i apologise but that really happens in this show i really am a guy who is fine with the black community) people might say hey lighten up but even when you take the racial slurrs away it is un-funny no new jokes badly acted & i can swear in one episode i saw someone's eyes focus on something unconnected with the situation. all in all horrible comedy.
