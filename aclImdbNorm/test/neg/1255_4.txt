wow, i just witnessed one of the greatest poker tragedies and i'm not talking about the premature death of the great stu ungar. this film i'm sorry to say was terrible. absolutely terrible. a true tragedy in filmaking history. well maybe i'm being a little harsh but unless you have some interest in the life of stu ungar then don't even consider coming near this one. and those that do have an interest in his life will find that most parts were trivialised and made out to be great novelty scenes. i watched it because of stu ungar but nearly wanted to end myself like he did while watching this movie 4 stars for effort but unpleasantly painful
