unfortunately, i went to this movie for entertainment purposes based on the limited information i had seen on fandango. since i am a sci-fi buff the notion of a movie about ufos interested me.<br /><br />instead, this movie quickly revealed itself as an evangelical christian propaganda flick. appropriate for an audience of like-minded individuals but very un-christian like to exploit the movie mall scene and preach to an unsuspecting audience, especially considering the costs of tickets and concessions. shame on you! at least the da vinci code did not hold back its wild-eyed craziness.<br /><br />so, this b-grade movie (and i am being kind) production will be appreciated in those churches with similar beliefs, probably shown to wednesday and sunday evening youth groups. but if you are a mainline christian or non-christian you will not be comfortable.
