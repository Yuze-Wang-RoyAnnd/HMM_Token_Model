looking at the ratings you would assume this is a classic, but yet again its just another example of poor independent film makers trying to drum up interest in their movie. they aren't even being smart about it 10/10 in the votes? i guess that to buck the curve and offset all the 1/10's it will get. is this better than any decent zombie movie? no.<br /><br />acting, corny and rubbish.<br /><br />sound effects, cheap and nasty, if it wasn't for where the actors looked you wouldn't know where it was coming from.<br /><br />cinematography. these people act like they have borrowed their dads camera right after watching the matrix. less is more, but more from this team is absolutely pap.<br /><br />zombies are rubbish as well. i don't doubt most of these people will never be heard from again, and it will be for good reason. i hope zombies eat their eyes as this was 90 minutes of pap that i wont get back.<br /><br />and falsifying ratings just makes it a million times worse.<br /><br />one reviewer said it was one of the best horror movies he has seen in the last 30 years? i can only assume that his recent cornea transplant was a success then.<br /><br />watch the trailer as thats a warning as to how bad this film is.
