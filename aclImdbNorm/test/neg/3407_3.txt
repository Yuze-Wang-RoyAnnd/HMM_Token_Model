i love watching a good gory giallo. unfortunately, solange is definitely not one of them. it's long. very long. the story is tacky and makes very little sense even if it's very obvious. the script spends so much time on the killings and the girls but it spends almost no time at all on the killer. this leaves a big hole in the story: we might get to see a bunch of young women showering together but we get zero characterization of why the killer decided to murder those girls. yes, what happened to solange is terrible but we still pretty much left in the dark over when, why did the [boring] killer decided that it was worth going through the effort of offing those oh so naughty girls. it's all so contrived that i couldn't get into it one bit.<br /><br />as for the look of the film, again, boring. nothing memorable about it. the actors? boring. the script? laughably boring. the whole "torrid" love affair between the teacher, the blond and the student was really embarrassing. what planet are they living on? the music? boring. skip it.
