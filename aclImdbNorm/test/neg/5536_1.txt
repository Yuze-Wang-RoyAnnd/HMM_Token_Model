so this ugly guy with long, nasty hair and his girlfriend end up in this house and they argue and argue about his old girlfriend. there was suppose to be something scary in it but i didn't see anything scary at all. there is some mention of a demon from the sea but that doesn't go anywhere at all. i wish it did because then it would've taken the tension away from the jealous love triangle. the title of the movie makes it look like it would be a scary and exciting movie but it is so far from it that i couldn't believe it. i waited and waited for it to end and was so happy when it did. it did not live up to the title like it should have so boo hoo hoo. the cover had a cool picture but i shouldn't judge a cheesy movie by its cover.
