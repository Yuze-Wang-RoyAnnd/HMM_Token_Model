anybody who thinks this film is great, desperately needs their head seen to. it strikes me that this film was made as a joke. it has no good points whatsoever. the props cost about $10 and the entire set looks like it could fall down at any time. why do films like this get made in the first place? this also had two of the most annoying characters i have ever come across in the young boy on the spaceship and the redneck from the twentieth century. this film is almost as bad as "cool as ice" starring the incredibly talented vanilla "misunderstood" ice.
