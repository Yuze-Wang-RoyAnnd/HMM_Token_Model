cruddy, innocent..no smoking, drinking or bikers, but jeremy slate (good actor) and jocelyn lane (good actress) make this moronically feasible for a bad biker flick, post-biker (exploit) time. they knew it, we knew it...adam roarke and slate are wasted..but they lived on.<br /><br />a 3 out of 10. best performance = jocelyn lane. lane is the only really to catch the final exploit biker film after run, angel, run (which also has good actors - like don stroud, etc.). it was over. they knew it. they were trying to make a living. but, jocelyn lane (from two elvis bad flicks, tickle me and something bad one) in yellow and leather is the modern hot chick with j. slate fighting for honor. it's worth seeing, but it sucks. but check it out. well worth non-biker, non-smoker, non-boozing, "biker" types with hot chicks.
