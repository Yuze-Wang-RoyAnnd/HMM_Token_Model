this movie has no plot. it was supposed to be that a guy moves in with his grandma, and everyone thinks hes a loser and he has to redeem himself. but what happens after everyone finds out who he's living with? they have a big pot party at grandma's house. the climax of the movie didn't even relate to the rest of it. that whole plot was introduced within minutes of the movie's end. i can see how it could have related to the supposed story - that grandma's vg skills redeem him - but that just wasn't there. <br /><br />however, the movie was funny as hell and clearly relied heavily on the jokes. <br /><br />"her pussy smells like the great depression" "he just sucked his first titty...yeah for 13 hours" "it's for you...i think it's the devil"
