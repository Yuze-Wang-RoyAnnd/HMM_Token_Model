without a doubt, one of the most racially prejudiced films i've ever seen, with the prejudice being levelled against hayden panettiere as she has to move into a tough inner city school. she is constantly called "white girl" and other slurs based on her colour. firstly would this be allowed the other way around if a black girl was the butt of all the abuse? and secondly the stereotyping of the ethnic kids from the inner city school is also a disgrace. the writers apparent desire to show they were "hip" also extended to missing the point that the inner city school win the cheerleading competition, not through talent but by intimidating their white opponents!! these overtones to the film took it away from it's expected direction of a harmless lighthearted comedy suitable for a family audience into a vehicle that does none of the participants any credit. hayden panettiere has star quality but i would be surprised if any of the rest of the class ever get much further. all in all a charmless film that was a waste of time.
