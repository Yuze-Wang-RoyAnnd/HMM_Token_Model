it's tempting to view this film as a daring avant-garde experiment. i like to think that the director was trying to see if it was possible to take all the conventions of comedy film and produce something that was completely, utterly, entirely unfunny.<br /><br />the answer, to judge by "from venus", is a resounding 'yes'. this may not be the worst film i've ever seen, but my brain seems to have repressed all memory of the others. this horrible flick hovers just on the borderline: bad enough that the thought still causes pain, but not quite so bad that my internal censors have obliterated it from my consciousness.<br /><br />it's difficult for me to imagine what the director and the cast thought they were doing when they made this, or why they went ahead and released it once they'd made it. i doubt anyone involved with it earned very much, but surely between them they could have got together enough money to buy up all the prints and have them burned.<br /><br />this is a movie that has nothing whatsoever to recommend it. it's not even enjoyably bad. it's just a non-movie in which nothing interesting happens. i gave serious thought to taking it back and demanding my money back, which is not something i've ever done before.<br /><br />don't even think about renting (much less buying!) this horrible non-movie!
