i really like salman kahn so i was really disappointed when i seen this movie. it didn't have much of a plot and what they did have was not that appealing. salman however did look good in the movie looked young and refreshed but was worth the price of this dvd. the music was not bad it was quite nice. usually indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was a very short movie for an indian film. the american actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series heroes, ali larter. her acting had a lot to be desired. however she did look good in the indian dresses that she wore. all the movie had not a lot to be desired and i hope salman does a lot better on his next movie. thank you.
