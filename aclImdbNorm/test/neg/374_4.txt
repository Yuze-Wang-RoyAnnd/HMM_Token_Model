although the story is good and portrayals what i expected of sam elliot my dvd copy contained almost unbearable synchronization problems. the dialogue was almost 3 seconds behind the lip movement throughout the whole film.<br /><br />i would therefore be very careful in purchasing any dvd of the film without checking for the problem.<br /><br />i would also follow the recommended censors classifications particularly in relation to language and drug usage.<br /><br />this film could become a silent classic cop movie and with the above cautionary notes i can recommend it to prospective viewers
