the book is great. it's one of my favorite books ever. the film, on the other hand, is amazingly insipid and bad! when i heard damon would play ripley, i knew this production was doomed. but i didn't expect it to be this bad. the actors go around and act very showy. except for law (and even he is guilty of some showy acting), all the actors here are near amateurish. speaking italian and moving one's arms or hair about shouldn't be considered as acting. damon is miscast. he's way too stiff for a character that's supposed to be a chameleon. paltrow is forgettable and hoffman plays yet another effeminate slimy character. talk about typecasting.<br /><br />what's really unforgivable about the script (written by the overrated director) is that it completely forgoes every subtle details from the book and comes up with many of its own, and none of them work! the addition of the jazz music stuff is totally wrong! i guess minghella's idea of italy in the late 50s, early 60s is clouded with images of chet baker roaming the italian countryside and spreading amore. yep, minghella is a true visionary. the film is so bleeding obvious. that silly scene when ripley drives through the narrow street full of mirrors. very laughable. yes, we get the point!!! every point or detail comes across a mile away, so much so that the film might give the audience the false impression that they have psychic powers. we know, for example, that the blanchett character, introduced at the beginning of the movie, will return later on only complicate things. and the soundtrack, at times, is totally inappropriate. whimsical when it shouldn't be. the film goes on for too long and in all sorts of pointless directions. there are too many boring characters populating the landscape (many that weren't in the book). this film is bad! really bad!<br /><br />apparently, minghella's son told his father that the ripley novel was his favorite. mr. minghella then proceeded to direct it as a favor of sorts to his son. well, the director did achieve what he set out to do: talented mr. ripley, with its hitchcock aspirations, is a film strictly made for 12 year olds!
