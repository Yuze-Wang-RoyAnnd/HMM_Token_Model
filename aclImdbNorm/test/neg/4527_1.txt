this movie is in the same league as ishtar. lots of wasted talent. who let this bomb escape? when sigfried says an example has to be made, in reference to a nuclear bomb, i said "please let it be this theatre!" don't waste your time. not even worth a free rental! and where did they get these shills to fill the comments section on imdb? i can't believe that anyone who has ever seen the original series enjoyed this stinker. steve carell is not a physical comedian. if they removed the "comedy" and made it a straight action movie, it could pass. what the heck was the purpose of the dance scene? also, the fat jokes and references were tasteless. this movie never missed a chance to go for the lowest common denominator and scenes just ended, it seemed, as if no one thought them through. just awful! save your time, if not money and give this movie a pass!
