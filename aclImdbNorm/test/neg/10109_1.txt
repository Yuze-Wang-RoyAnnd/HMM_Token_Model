well, i'll begin with this: i love horror-movies, not even the worst plot or the most insanely terrible acting will ruin the experience as long as there is a certain amount of gore and suspense present. second; this is the worst movie of all times. it even beats mean guns, and the attack of the killer tomatoes. and for that i pay it homage.<br /><br />however, the involuntary humor was only funny until half the movie had passed, after which point everything was so so sad. to my great surprise, the reviews where somewhat divided; and you guys who rated this piece of c-movie-crap from 7 and up; i know you're joking! good one!! hahaha! because if there is any reason in the world, and we have just an tiny bit of the same notion of what quality is; you can't be for real.<br /><br />everything worth to be mentioned about the contents has already been summed pretty good up, so i'll leave it. <br /><br />minor spoiler alert<br /><br />but the scene where the cloaked rubber mask guy drags the woman back and forth through the dog-kennel for ten minutes, with o so terrible music score and the mind blowing dialog between the two, really does it for me.
