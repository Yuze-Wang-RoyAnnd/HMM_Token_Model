it doesn't surprise me that the makers of this hopeless movie couldn't find a uk distributor, and then had to release it as a free dvd with a sunday newspaper. the distributors could clearly see what the film-makers and the sunday newspaper couldn't, that this was one movie that just wasn't going to recoup its costs.<br /><br />since it's a thriller about riddles, it would have helped if they'd picked a lead actor who could enunciate properly, rather than the mumbling vinnie jones who appears to pronounce "riddle" as "riell". and it would have helped if the dialogue hadn't been swamped by noisy locations or scenes flooded with distracting and inappropriate music. the plot is ludicrous: the lost charles dickens story supposedly helps our hero solve a series of modern murders, but so would a copy of herge's adventures of tintin, since the link between dickens and jones is more non-existent than tenuous. and we have the ridiculous premise that a would-be investigative journalist who lays his hands on a previously undiscovered dickens manuscript, would take several days to read it, just so that flashbacks to dickens can continue to be played throughout the movie, as if they had some connection to it. which they don't. i mean, if you found a new dickens manuscript, wouldn't you just go somewhere quiet and read it ? the film ends with one of those surprise revelations that have become mandatory since the sixth sense, but in this case it doesn't so much surprise you as insult your intelligence. if the film is suddenly going to turn supernatural at the twelfth hour, then revealing that vinnie jones is a robot might have been more acceptable. it might not have seemed so turgid if the film had been stylish, but it isn't. and in several places it appears decidedly amateur: there's a scene where a table is laid with a 60's jump-cut technique, but they haven't made sure that the person actually laying the table is completely out of frame between the cuts. consequently, you can see things changing at the edge of frame, when you're really supposed to be watching things changing at the centre of frame. a good rule in movie-making is: if you don't understand how to do a technique then try something else.<br /><br />the real riddle is why anyone thought it would be a good idea to make this movie in the first place.
