my first post at the imdb has to (unfortunately) be to warn others not to waste their time with the cavern! there is no story, no character development, no scares, and no good lighting. it doesn't make any sense. if you enjoy bad acting, people running through small portions of caves, bouncing cameras posed at bad angles, and people screaming while the screen is in complete darkness, you'll love this movie. i could shut the lights off in my house and scream too, and i wouldn't have to pay for the rental. the only thing that scared me was that someone actually made a movie this awful.<br /><br />... one of the worst movies i've ever rented.
