maybe i was to young when i saw it. perhaps i have not grown up with grease and elvis movies.<br /><br />i failed to get it. i get "black" comedy (black adder etc.). i get irony and spoofs. i don't get this one though.<br /><br />i made it a quest to find out the name of this movie (enlisting the help of people on usenet and the most excellent imdb message boards) so it could be my first 1-pointer. awful!
