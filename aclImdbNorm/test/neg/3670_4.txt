the casting (and direction) in undercurrent is more insipid than inspired in this noir clunker that fails from the outset to get off the ground. robert taylor's wooden style poses a roadblock almost immediately for the highly affected kate hepburn and it's bad chemistry from the outset.<br /><br />naive and innocent ann hamilton (hepburn) falls for handsome airplane manufacturer alan garroway (taylor) and rushes to the altar with him. she soon finds out there is a lot she does not know about him. as alan becomes more remote she delves further into the murky past and ann soon finds herself living a nightmare instead of the american dream.<br /><br />undercurrent resembles a few hitchcock plots but vincent minnelli rapidly establishes he is no master of suspense. hepburn is no shrinking violet and she is a hard sell for a character more suited to the reticent styles of teresa wright or joan fontaine. minnelli never really succeeds in getting kate to defer in desperate fashion to taylor's limited abilities as an actor. her attempts come across as silent gish while taylor's wide descent into madness takes on restrained bela lugosi. robert mitchum completes the miscasting as the sensitive brother. talk about piling on.<br /><br />cinematographer karl freund provides some highly stylized noir interiors but minnelli and cast utilize the atmospherics meekly and the tension remains tepid. with minnelli far from his forte (musicals) and hepburn's victim role fitting her like a bad suit undercurrent drowns all involved.
