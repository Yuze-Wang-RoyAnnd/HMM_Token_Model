my first impresson of the saikano: live action movie trailer (viewable on youtube), was "wow, this could be perhaps one of the few better live-action anime adaptations."<br /><br />this time i was just wrong! simply put, the live-action saikano movie was a puzzle missing a number of pieces; put together just enough to get the vague image of it all.<br /><br />*story* <br /><br />the movies story vaguely follows the anime and manga, but the movies story is just the frame of a car, rather than a complete automobile. it seems that many parts of the story originally in the anime were left out, altered, or completely changed. in fact the ending is completely different from the manga or anime endings. <br /><br />characters especially; many left out or had a different feel. the connection between fuyumi and shuji is reduced to that of shuji knowing her because she's the video store lady. chise's character felt too strong already and only uttered the infamous i'm sorry a few times in the movie. same can be said with shuji. we lost the shy uptight yet tall male lead, the song he hums, and his frequent action of calling chise silly. other characters like tetsu and akemi had a different, toned down feel to them. perhaps the dropping and toning down of other characters was to focus a lot more on chise and shuji, which it did. way too much. expecting a lot of sweet action scenes like those in the trailer? well don't! those in the trailer plus a few minutes, is the only amount of action you will get. so much of the movie is talking that while i was browsing thru the movie before watching it all, i thought i had gotten a regular asian romance drama. <br /><br />pacing was way too fast. in the film, we see the famous scene of chise armed with small wings and a chain gun arm, in just a little less than nine minutes of beginning it. there is very little time to get to know the characters and connect with them. what they should have done was split it into two movies, or even a trilogy. if it had been not as many things would have to be changed or dropped.<br /><br />but again the movie behaves like a frame. the anime was more of a complete automobile because even if all those little details and such are minor they can really add up.<br /><br />*production*<br /><br />-visuals- visuals were disappointing. so much of the special effects turned out looking quite cheesy especially the cgi. sadly, they were like those found on sci-fi channel movies. they are bearable and this movie isn't for the effects.<br /><br />-music- music was average. much of it was orchestral background music except there were really no themes. the film has dropped the addicting song that shuji in the anime was always humming. a noticeable piece of music though is the ending song, heard in the trailer. not a bad and somewhat beautiful song. its a shame that it was not integrated into the movie as itself or an orchestrated version of the song.<br /><br />-casting- saikano's casting was also so-so. the main star was chises actor aki maeda, who is most famous for her role in the battle royale films. the actor that played shuji was pretty good but they took away the glasses from the original character. oh yeah and tetsuo looks like lupin the 3rd.<br /><br />unlike what i've heard from a few others, the acting in the live-action saikano was not that bad. i rather feel at fault is the way the story was laid out and cramming the series into just a two-hour film.<br /><br />*what can be learned from the live action saikano:*<br /><br />-cgi- i really wish the cgi in saikano hadn't been that bad. but even with just that, we could have gotten a few more fight scenes! probably the most anticipated live-action anime adaptation neon genesis evangelion most likely wont suffer since they currently have weta studios assigned to do the effects.<br /><br />-modernism- fuyumi owned a video shop. chise used a audio cassette player to listen to music and gave shuji a mix tape for his birthday. why? this movie is made in 2006! not only that in the movies reality they can create such a thing as chise so it cannot take place in the 90s! the future is an age of cds, dvds, and mp3 players. hopefully in evangelion, shinji will have a sony walkman mp3 player. not one that plays cassette tapes.<br /><br />-story & pacing- as mentioned earlier, the saikano movie moved too fast and forced the story to drop out many details. it was a smart move upon adv films and whoever else, to make evangelion into a solid trilogy thus allowing more time to retell the story as true to the original as possible.<br /><br />-characters- leave most of the character designs alone and let those classic quotes be said! what if the live action evangelion didn't have asuka's "what are you, stupid?!" or shinji's "i mustn't run away!" sometimes as small as they seem, those frequent quotes add and are who the characters are.<br /><br />*conclusion:*<br /><br />all in all, the live action saikano movie had potential. it really did. those you who aren't fans and see this movie: you will be reluctant to start the anime or manga (so don't watch the movie first!) people who saw and liked the anime/manga, don't get your hopes up on this one. studies show you most likely will be disappointed. it was still fun to see the anime come to life in the live action adaptation but it could have been so much more.<br /><br />reluctantly, i give the live-action saishu heiki kanojo (saikano) a 2 out of 5. <br /><br />as chise says, "i'm sorry" <br /><br />~nekotakuto
