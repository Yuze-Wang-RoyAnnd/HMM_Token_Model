don't pay any attention to the rave reviews of this film here. it is the worst van damme film and one of the worst of any sort i have ever seen. it would appeal to somebody with no depth whatever who requires nothing more than gunfire and explosions to be entertained.<br /><br />seeing that this is directed by peter hyams it has made me realise that peter has no talent as a director, but is very good at filming explosions and the like. however, movies need other elements as well; for example, a story. this one didn't have one. this might explain the awfulness of some of mr. hyams' more recent films, hardly any better than this one, really.<br /><br />one can't help wondering how some people ever were put behind a camera.
