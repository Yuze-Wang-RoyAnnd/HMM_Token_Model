i remember the trailer for this infamously weak spin-off of conan. i saw the movie years later and laughed my head off. unintentionally! poor briggite nielson. her career never had a chance thanks to cobra and red sonja. the plot of the movie is this: sonja(brigitte nielson) hails from a tribe of female warriors who were killed off by an evil queen gedren(sandahl bergman). queen gedren steals the orb the female warriors were protecting and uses it to destroy each town she passes by. sonja goes on a hunt for queen gedren and later finds out that gedren killed her parents. on her quest she reluctantly joins kalidor(arnold schwarzenegger), an arrogant prince named tarn(ernie reyes jr.) and his bumbling idiotic servant, falkon(paul l. smith). together they go on a hunt for queen gedren and the orb. the acting is sub par and the action scenes are soso. i mean briggite neilson looks so emotionally distant. for someone who lost her whole family as well as her female comrades, sonja doesn't look fazed at all. arnold is playing his usual stoic role and ernie reyes jr.... what an annoying snot-nosed brat he was in this movie! the moronic manservant falkon had more personality than these guys. the action scenes are the only redeeming moments of the movie even though sometimes they fall flat. the scene where they fight the mechanical sea creature made me laugh till my ribs ached. the dialog is a hoot also. its as if the screenwriter thought that nobody was going to take the movie seriously so he gave everybody stupid lines to work with. i can only recommend this movie to you if you like your epic movies extra campy. anyone else don't bother.
