first of all, i have to say that i am not generally a big fan of werewolf movies in general. it's not that i don't like them, just that i don't like them a lot. there are some that i have enjoyed...werewolf of london (1935, stuart walker), an american werewolf in london (1981, john landis)...and some that i have thought were okay but nothing special...the wolf man (1941, george waggner), the howling (1981, joe dante), dog soldiers (2002, neil marshall) are some examples...but overall, the werewolf sub-genre is not my favorite. but i had this one on one of those 50 movie sets so i thought i'd give it a watch and see how it was.<br /><br />spoilers follow...<br /><br />the mad monster is a werewolf tale, but the werewolf is primarily used as a vehicle for revenge by a mad scientist, dr. lorenzo cameron (george zucco). dr. cameron has discovered a way to transform human beings into beasts, specifically wolves, but was ridiculed and ostracized by the greater scientific community. forced out of a prestigious position, he goes mad and plots revenge on those who mocked him in an old country mansion, where he lives with his daughter lenora (the lovely anne nagel) and his assistant petro (glenn strange) of limited mental abilities. using his serum, dr. cameron transforms petro into a werewolf and sends him off to kill his old rivals. eventually, though, the werewolf petro gets out of control and both the mad doctor and his creation are killed.<br /><br />the movie also plays out somewhat as a murder/crime drama, with lenora's journalist suitor (johnny downs) investigating the doctor's strange behavior and the rash of murders. the story seems to borrow many elements from other big pictures that came before it. there are reminders of frankenstein (1931, james whale) in the creation of a monster which runs amok, and the creature killing an innocent child. visions of dr. jekyll and mr. hyde (1931, rouben mamoulian or the 1941, victor fleming version) and the wolf man (1941, george waggner) also come to mind. and that is one of the problems with this movie in my view-it comes across as a mediocre melding of some great films. it doesn't add much to the genre.<br /><br />true, there are some redeeming qualities. george zucco's performance was convincing, and the scene showing dr. lorenzo talking to his visions/hallucinations of his tormentors works well for me in showing his insanity. there is some reasonable character build up, at least in the case of his character. but glenn strange's character is not at all convincing, and seems to have this comedic quality-whether intentional or not, i'm not sure-that just doesn't fit into the movie as a whole.<br /><br />i seemed to like it more than most imdb users based on my rating of 4/10, but it was still a below average film. perhaps worth a view if you are a fan of early werewolf movies or a big fan of the 1930's and 1940's horror films, but unlikely to appeal to you if you are not.
