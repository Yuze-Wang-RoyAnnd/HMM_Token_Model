this movie really left me thinking ... but not about the plot, the direction, the characters, an underlying message, or a clever script. far from it. i was left wondering what in sam hill went wrong behind the scenes. clearly, something was badly amiss from the beginning.<br /><br />i'm amazed at the positive comments for the movie and for jodie foster's performance. from the get-go it was clear that foster had phoned this one in. one earlier comment even made a favorable mention of her facial expressions. i must have been watching a different movie since ms foster (usually a personal favorite) seemed to be totally disinterested.<br /><br />in one of his first scenes with foster, fred ward looks as though he, also, is distracted by her lack of energy and he struggles to deliver his own lines with any enthusiasm. by the time he's called upon to take part in a supposedly desperate search for runaway foster, ward also seems to have become embarrassingly half-hearted about the project.<br /><br />in my opinion, dennis hopper has always been a uni-dimensional performer, so i wasn't expecting much from him ... and he delivered.<br /><br />yes, this one left me thinking long after it ended. the fact that joe pesci and charlie sheen refused to have their names attached to the project suggests that this was a real stinker for everyone involved. but to then learn that the director preferred to hide behind a pseudonym speaks volumes.<br /><br />but why listen to me? i always think foster looks ridiculous in a dress, yet she's sensational in lacy underwear.
