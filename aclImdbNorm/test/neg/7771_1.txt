in 1970, feminists invaded the 'miss world' beauty contest in london and brought the occasion to a halt by pelting the stage with flour and eggs. why? because, rightly or wrongly, they felt the event to be demeaning and degrading to women. i offer no criticism of their actions. its a free world we live in. what i want to know is: why don't their modern-day equivalents invade the studios where shows such as this are made and do likewise? <br /><br />'sex & the city' is all about four self-absorbed women from new york: carrie is a slave to fashion who turns into a pussycat when a man so much as claps eyes on her, charlotte yearns to find the perfect man ( they don't exist, love ) so she can use sex to ensnare the poor devil, lawyer miranda scares men away by wittering nonsense like 'out of touch with my emotions', and lastly we have samantha, the living embodiment of the old martini ad 'anytime, anyplace, anywhere'. feminists hold up these characters - particularly samantha - as a shining example of modern-day womanhood. well, if shouting rude words in busy restaurants is progress, i think the feminists should take a long hard look at themselves and what they're supposed to represent.<br /><br />had 'sex & the city' been the creation of a man, it would have been pulled from the airwaves for being sexist. instead, like 'charlie's angels' before it, it has conned supposedly intelligent women into thinking it has acted as a positive force for good. there's something very clinical and cold-blooded about the show. 'the benny hill show' was sexist too, but at least it was funny.
