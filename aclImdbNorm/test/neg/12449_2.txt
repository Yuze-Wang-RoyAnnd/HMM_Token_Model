return to sender, a.k.a. convicted, is almost imperfect. the one good thing about this particular film was that i was never bored. that being said, the reviews that hail this movie as a low-budget success may not have watched the same movie that i saw.<br /><br />rather than write a review and tell you what happens and what works and doesn't work, i will simply comment that nothing works. there are plot holes in this movie that you can drive a semi through. the acting in the film is not very good, although that may be a result of a script so poorly worded that it could have been ghost written by george lucas. there was no need for exceptional sets or costumes for this particular movie and everything seemed appropriate. did i mention that there were some plot holes? by the end of the movie, you are wondering how a blind guy can be such a good shot with a shotgun, why kelly preston trusts aidan quinn, why she would fall asleep the night before her client is supposed to be killed, how aidan quinn can drive 400 miles in such a short time with a car that keeps breaking down during the rest of the movie, why aidan quinn didn't by a fifth instead of a bunch of nips, etc.<br /><br />with all that being said, this is certainly a b-movie, and a terrible one at that. the unfortunate thing is that it just isn't bad enough to be good. if you value your time, please let this serve as a public service message to stay away from this one.
