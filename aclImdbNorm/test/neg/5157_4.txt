the nest is really just another 'nature run amock' horror flick that fails because of the low budget. the acting is ok, and the setting is great, but somehow the whole film just seemed a bit dull to me. the gore effects are not the best i've seen but are fun in a cheesy sort of way. the roaches themselves are just regular cockroaches that bite people. the nest reminded me of a much better film called slugs. if you liked the nest then slugs is a must-see as it's ten times better. also worth noting is that lisa langlois who plays elizabeth was in another 'nature run amock' type film called deadly eyes (aka the rats), which is about killer rats as you may have guessed. <br /><br />if you enjoy these types of horror films then you may want to give this a watch, but you'd be far better off seeing slugs which is far more interesting and gory.
