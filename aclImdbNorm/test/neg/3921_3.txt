obviously influenced by the success of pal's "destination moon" and lippert's "rocketship x-m" this one just doesn't make the cut. limited special effects, a thin story line result in a production that even the half-decent cast can't save. just no believability here. no one seems surprised to encounter martians, much like earthlings, etc. etc. pass on it!
