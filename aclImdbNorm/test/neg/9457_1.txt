nothing but the director's juvenile fantasy come to life. this 'movie' is nothing more than an excuse for the director/actor to play kissy face with an attractive young woman who would otherwise never give him the time of day.<br /><br />the plot is simple, the direction is nonexistent and the movie drags while the actor/director/writer/narrator narrates. don't be fooled by the 'x' rating, there is no nudity and minimal gore.
