even my five year old was bored.<br /><br />very predictable, and overacted. this movie couldn't make up it's mind as to whether it was slapstick, or wry commentary on the state of "pee -wee" sports.<br /><br />characters were underdeveloped, could have done more with the connection between father and son both coming from an orphanage.<br /><br />did not like the reference regarding the goalie slipping the laxative to his teammate...very mean spirited for a kid's movie.<br /><br />typical "mafia" behavior was boring and stereotypical.<br /><br />the dog, however, was so darn cute!!!!
