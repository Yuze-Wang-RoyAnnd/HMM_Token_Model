chuck norris stars as danny, a cop who took down a hulking serial killer however when said killer escapes, danny knows he is the only one able to stop the terror. however danny harbors a secret, he knows that it was sheer luck that got the terror arrested and even more luck that danny survived, now a final battle is waged but is danny ready? right there in my description tells what the problem of this movie is. norris is playing a wimpy hero who still suffers from psychological trauma. in the hands of a better actor, this concept would be interesting and could make for a great thriller. in the hands of a norris thriller it just makes it ridiculous and hopelessly unheroic. also on board is american ninja's steve james and superfly's ron o'neal but any attempt at character development is defeated by the atrocious script. also there is hardly any action and i always preferred a norris movie with more fighting and less talking. given the rating on this website, i must not be alone.<br /><br />* out of 4-(bad)
