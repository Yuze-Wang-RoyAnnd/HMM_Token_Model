this must be the worst thriller i have seen in a long long time. the directing, the acting and the adaptation of the story leave what could probably have been a good plot into a meaningless waste of time. within a few minutes of watching the film it was easy to figure out the whole plot and then there are more obvious clues very early on leaving no mystery. i guessed this within the first few minutes and i kept hoping i was wrong and much to my dismay i was not.<br /><br />the film starts off with two fbi agents who drive to a remote town to investigate a murderous spree which has left three witnesses, a young girl, a drug addict and a cop. they are interviewed under surveillance cameras separately and each tells their account of the day. each has something to hide about themselves and the day unfolds as they tell their accounts. this part is probably the saving grace and if developed could have made this film better.<br /><br />spoiler: the whole story ends in the fbi agents being the actual killers and the young girl is the only one who has figured this out and so left unhurt by them.<br /><br />why do they go through the whole charade of interviewing three witnesses and bonding with the young girl if their idea had been to kill them in the first place? how did they get away with pretending to be fbi agents (when you discover that real fbi agents had been killed and their badges were found on them)? how did they know how to set up and use the surveillance cameras?<br /><br />bill pullman and julia ormond are so unconvincing from the beginning to the end. maybe the idea is to develop their characters for the revelation at the end. come on, they both look ridiculous, stupid and not sinister in the least. the character of the young girl is also wasted potential. there is no meaning to her actions and no meaning to whom she prefers to bond with in her ordeal. she does not appear distressed, but rather detached which again is not explained. <br /><br />awful film on the whole.
