while the prominent and over use of the play-like format is in total operation throughout the film, it is not however this that lets this picture down. rather it is the unconvincing female performances and rather tedious script that the film so obviously relied on a little too much. with an idea that had potential, the simple plot is diminished still by graham's failure to truly express the devastation her character so adamantly claims to experience. the use of improvised scenes by all the actors would not be such a bad idea if only the two leading ladies could take advantage of this privilege. as downey jr proves as usual what a gifted actor he is, he shadows the two actresses in their scenes together which is constantly noticeable. the pointless yet intense sex scene seems merely to exist in order to prevent the film from being too verbally expressive giving the actors a much deserved break from talking. with an unsatisfying conclusion, two girls and a guy has very little to recommend it other than downey jr's formidable if not out of place performance.
