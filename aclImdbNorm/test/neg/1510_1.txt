got this off of usenet, so i wasn't prepared for the heavy (and i do mean exceptionally heavy) religious theme. not that i'm one of satan's disciples or anything, but it was very heavy handed.<br /><br />on top of that, the acting stunk. it might be because they had to get good little boys to play bad little boys, but it didn't work.<br /><br />there was some pretty cool filmmaking involved, so any fan of directorial style might want to check it out, but be ready with the fast forward buttons.<br /><br />there was some sloppiness to the editing. in particular, a black mustang (probably a representation of satan?) squares off against a white 240z. wheels spin, camera changes, and whattya know, that white 240z is transmogrified into a white civic.<br /><br />i gave up early on, so i can't vouch for the moral impact of it. but i would like to point out that this sort of film is totally preaching to the choir. if the director/writer/producer was trying to bring religion to the unwashed streetracing masses, they went about it all wrong. i think i'd rather watch an adult diaper commercial than listen to a steely-gazed bible thumper rant about jesus' dying for us. yawn.<br /><br />
