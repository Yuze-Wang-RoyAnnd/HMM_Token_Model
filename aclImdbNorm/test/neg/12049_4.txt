empty shortening of john irving's novel strives for profundity courageously but ends up being absurd. it's a quirky, goofy and bittersweet string of sketches, attempting to explain a man's growth from birth to adulthood and how he deals with the vices of lust and fanaticism that surround him. garp is born to a formidable unmarried mother, jenny fields, played by glenn close.(the various stages of garp's childhood are played by three young actors before robin williams takes over as garp reaches adulthood.) the story follows him through childhood at a boys' prep school, where jenny is the school nurse, through his high school passions-wrestling,writing,and sex-to marriage with his high school sweetheart, children, marital problems and a writing career. jenny meanwhile has become a famous feminist , espousing an unorthodox cause. the plot details an abundance of comic and tragicomic episodes and outlandish adventures. williams gives a cherub-faced performance. this script was not fitting for his wildness and anarchy and thus his talent was wasted. he's like an injured bird sputtering out of control. john lithgow's role as a father like transsexual, imparting wisdom, also doesn't make sense. this movie was able to attract some reasonable attention in 1982, due to the popularity of robin williams and his new entry into movies. williams had recently shed his mork and mindy pursuits and focused more on stand-up comedy and movies. audiences were confused by this film, especially by its arbitrary and inexplicable ending.
