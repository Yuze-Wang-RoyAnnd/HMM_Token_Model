i did not think haggard was the funniest movie of all time i like cky and viva la bam a lot more. i think a lot of it was just really stupid and had no plot for being a movie. i highly recommend not paying a lot of money for this movie but anyone who likes viva la bam, cky, or jack ass should see it. i loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts that should have been cut out. i think that jonny knoxville should have played in the movie because he is a much better actor then most of the people from haggard and probably could have made this movie allot more funnier. i think ryan dunn was probably the best actor and it should have had bam skating more.
