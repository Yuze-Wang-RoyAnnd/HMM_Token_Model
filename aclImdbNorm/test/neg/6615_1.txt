its obvious espn drools whenever knight is in the news, but did they have to make a freakin' movie about him? this was the worst attempt at a serious dramatic movie i have ever seen. it had it all: terrible acting, terrible dialogue, ridiculous casting, cheap sets, etc etc. it looked like it was shot on a $10 budget. cummon, whats up with the game scenes? were they in a middle school gym? and the lighting, well, let me just say it was ridiculous. and brian denehy as bob knight? give me a break. denehey looked like...denehy in a red sweater, nothing more. espn lost a lot of credibility with this flop attempt. they poured millions of $$$ in advertising, then the premier was a huge dissapointment. bob knight is not a subject that can be covered in a 2-hour movie. espn blew it. even knight himself thought it was more stupid than anything else.
