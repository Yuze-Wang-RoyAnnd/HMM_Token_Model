okay... for the most part, and all its cheesiness, this movie was actually pretty good for an mst3k flick... but then they decided to ruin what little goodness it had about fifteen minutes before the ending. *spoiler alert* the film is very basic... a rich mama's boy named danny meets a bum named bix, and the two of them travel to a small town, where bix meets a pretty girl named carrie (who is so very.) now, this film's basic premise seemed promising enough. all they needed to do was follow the simple chemistry of any romance movie... carrie loves bix... bix loves carrie... a creepy guy in town lusts for carrie... now, i know what you're thinking... bix fights the creep and ultimately decides to settle down with carrie, and danny returns home, and they all live happily ever after... right? wrong!! because carrie gets murdered by the town creep, because bix is too gay to commit. (there are so many homosexual undertones between danny and bix.) and then, the whole town decides to lynch bix, even though the town creep would've easily been the prime suspect. then, the town creep confesses to killing carrie without much hesitation... (must've felt bad, the poor dope.) then, danny brings bix home with him... that's the film's "happily ever after." sad, huh? all i can say is, thank god for joel and the bots. because they turned this horse hockey into one of my favorite mst3k episodes.
