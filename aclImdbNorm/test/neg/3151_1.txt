barney and friends is probably the worst kids show that i have ever seen. it teaches kids nothing, the songs are corny, it is not educational and the characters are just plain agitating. i am not one to disagree with those who hate the show. honestly, i have seen more negative than positive reviews for this show. 75% of the reviews are negative and there are some really mature people. this show contains no educational value or age-appropriate educational material whatsoever. more reasons why i dislike this show is because of the crappy plots, cheesy dialogue, horrid special effects and the abysmal story lines. besides, it says that you should eat junk food if you are sad and that strangers are your friends. saying that is a "model of what preschool television should be",as expressed by yale researchers dorothy and jerome singer, is a load of crap. they don't know what they're talking about. i would never recommend barney to anyone. te reason why some kids keep crying for or get addicted to junk is because of this show poisoning the minds of children everywhere. for people(parents/children) who seek real preschool mater, switch over to nick jr. and watch "super why!" instead. it's far more better than this turd and five tv once had the nerve to put it on "milkshake" but thankfully took it off. i highly advise everyone to keep far away from this show as possible. parents, i highly advise you to keep your kids as far away from this show as possible. they'll thank you later.<br /><br />bottom line: don't bother wasting your valuable time with this stupid show. it's utter garbage. -10000000000000/10. grade: z. avoid like the plague!<br /><br />thanks for reading.
