****some spoilers****<br /><br />there's nothing in this movie that you haven't already seen browsing the net. nothing is shocking about this film. in the film a man sodomizes a goat, there's a bulldozer decapitation, and a lesbian's face gets burnt off. all of these scenes of "extreme violence" are so fake, it makes one wonder why anyone would even want to resurface this piece of trash. i simply cannot believe i spent hard earned money on what certainly has to be the worst film ever made. don't let reviews fool you, this film would be a shame for anyone to own...except maybe prisons who want to torture inmates. for a real exploitation classic, look to bloodsucking freaks or even the more recent doom generation. island of death sinks to the bottom of the movie toilet and needs to be flushed out of existence.
