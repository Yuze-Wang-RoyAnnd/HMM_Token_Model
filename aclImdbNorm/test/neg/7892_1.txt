alright lets break it down. why is this one of the worst films ever? because there are so many answers to that question i'm having a headache. come on...cracker world? mr. honkee? the part with the arab guy? its just awful, i didn't really care about the whole white racism crap, but when they did that thing with the arab guy, i wanted to get the names of all the writers. its really not worth watching 3 seconds of this movie. it isn't even funny-bad which was my first interpretation. i hope the person who directed this movie doesn't commit suicide, but it seems likely, i don't see any other options.don't ever watch this movie, if you watch it, u cant say u died with no regrets.
