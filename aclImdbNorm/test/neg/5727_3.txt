i figure the company that made this movie wanted people to think of the conan movies, but unfortunately for the ones who made this one it does just that. you will be thinking, man the conan movies were pretty cool...this one is totally boring and sucks. the story, who cares? it isn't going to help you like this movie more or less as it just seems like a really cheap film. arnold, doesn't look like he belongs in this one, why he agreed to play the role is beyond me. well probably for the money. i just love the monster in the water that turns out to be a machine. lame! this movie is just plain and simply terrible.
