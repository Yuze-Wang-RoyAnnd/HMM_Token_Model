this movie was supposedly based on a non-fiction book. i'm not sure what book the script writer(s) read to write their adaptation but it has absolutely nothing to do with the true life adventures of frances mayes in italy. instead, it is an uninteresting tale that takes liberties at every juncture to bash men. note the following examples:<br /><br />********************************************************************<br /><br />spoiler details<br /><br />********************************************************************<br /><br />bash number one : lane's husband cheats on her and her marriage ends in a divorce.<br /><br />bash number two : lane ventures into a local italian town and is promptly solicited by every male on the street.<br /><br />bash number three : lane is saved from the horny town folk men by a charming gentlemen. she falls for him after consummating an afternoon of love making. she later finds out that he's already attached and cheating with her.<br /><br />bash number four : you have to broaden your horizon for this one because the reference is definitely is in the movie. her lesbian couple friends decide to have a baby by invetro (sp?) fertilization. i am told that in most lesbian relationships, you have one person assuming the female role and another assuming the male role. in the movie, after the female has been made pregnant, the "male" lesbian decides to run out on the relationship because she can not handle it.<br /><br />in conclusion, this movie has nothing to do with the book that it was supposedly based on.
