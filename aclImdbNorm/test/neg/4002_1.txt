piece of junk, would've given it a 0 if i could have. animation is good, but not quite good enough. storyline is absolutely the most ridiculous i've ever come across, and that's saying a lot! this 'movie' tried so hard to be interesting, but failed miserably. it's almost as if the writer started one story, then got another idea, and attempted to mesh the two together. don't waste your time on this; believe me, you'll be as ticked off with yourself as i was. the only actor of any note in this was james woods, and his part was peripheral at best. i'm all for doing stuff that is edgy, that pushes the envelopes, but this simply didn't cut it.
