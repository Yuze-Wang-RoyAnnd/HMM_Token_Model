congo is probably the worst big-budget movie of the 1990s. it is so bad that it is watchable over and over again. a bunch of folks with different agendas probe deep into darkest africa, where they encounter a temple of riches just like in king solomon's mines -- but with cannibalistic gorillas guarding those riches. on their side, the humans have a "talking" gorilla named amy who helps save the day at one point or another. so much for the plot. the dialogue throughout is witless, the acting almost uniformly atrocious, certainly campy (tim curry and ernie hudson are both on hand to assure the ham factor), and the special effects abysmal. wait until you see the cannibalistic gorillas. and the lava! oh yes, did i mention there's a volcanic eruption to top off the big finale? laura linney of all people is along for this bumpiest of rides. what could she have been thinking? this is right around the same time she appeared with richard gere and ed norton in primal fear, a movie that helped guarantee her stardom.
