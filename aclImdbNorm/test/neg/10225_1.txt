take a clich'e story and insert steve guttenberg.need i say anymore?this truly is as bad as you would expect. sheriff tom palmer(guttenberg)and anna montgormery attempt to transform a group of useless,inept kids into a winning soccer team.lacking originality and direction from the offset it's quite a struggle to maintain any form of interest in this film. despite my reservations about guttenbergs acting ability i can safely say that the acting of the rival teams coach is actually worse than guttenbergs.previously unimaginable i thought. this type of story of underdogs battling all the way to the top has been done before and better every time than this so called 'film'
