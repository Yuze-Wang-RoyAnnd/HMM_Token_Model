what can you expect from a direct to dvd film? you know what you are getting yourself into when you rent this. the quality of the cinematography reminds me of reality tv shows. <br /><br />why are they shots always up so close to the actors!? and why are they always centered? there isn't anything to look at. (and the actors are that great looking, so that blows.)<br /><br />the writing and dialogue is just plain awful. that intro scene, with the british guy is hilarious. just try and listen this words, they hardly make any sense, just goes around in circles. the lines in the rest of the movie sounds like they were pull out of romance and sci-fi novels, as if the writers had no idea what they were doing. the characters definitely sound like they have no idea what they're saying. <br /><br />this is a terrible movie. i feel bad for the actors tied to this project. embarrassing!
