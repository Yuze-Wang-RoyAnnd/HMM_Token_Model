crap! i accidentally watched this film-thinking that it was the swimming upstream that was released in 2003. i seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it. shame on whoever gave this junk an award. i thoroughly loathed this film-in fact i didn't see it through to the end. after an hour i could no longer stand it. i am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy script-which tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such ba-ad acting. painful. i rate it 1 star out of 10. an amateur could make a much, much greater movie.
