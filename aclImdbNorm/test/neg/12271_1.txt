for those of you who don't remember movies -- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080120/ -- this came out in '79 ( i guess enough time has gone by so naturally nunzio figured he could just redo this and say he wrote it - yea, right! ).<br /><br />the acting in this is way overboard - the "tough guys" walk around with their shoulders hunched forward to give the impression they are bigger than they really are, also the "hero' seems to have a passion for snorting, and rolling his eyes in a bug-eyed kind of way to express angst/anger to the celluloid eye.<br /><br />there is a sort of racial message here, from the sicilian perspective (mind you this is about 3rd generation down the line... the original "wogs" arrived in oz after the war and during my childhood - yep i'm an aussie. so the "wogg-iness" has been diluted a lot - they even sound like true-blue aussies - not a flicker of the "dago accent" anywhere ( there, there's another slang for ya, nun! )<br /><br />maori's with sunnies (sunglasses) at 4am - must be cool to be sun-blinded in the middle of the night and it looks like redfern... this is at this movie's tedious end. nunzio tried to copy the flavor of the warriors but, left too many holes in the story. how about coincidences ?<br /><br />the warriors had a gang of baseball guys wielding bats, with white face makeup chase the heroes to a train station and fight them - nunzios gang get chased on a railway station by a gang of stick wielding guys wearing whitish face masks. the warriors were mistakenly accused of shooting/murdering another gang-member -- nunzios gang are mistakenly accused of raping the sister of the big maori gang boss. the warriors are lured into a room by a gang of girls who attack them - nunzios crowd want to crash at a friends house, which is populated by, yep, a gang of girls -- there are almost too many copies from the warriors to keep on about here.<br /><br />i am saddened that people don't want to see other moves from oz because of this tripe - how about mad max - commander and master of the world? not all movies are made by actors who are so bad, they have to fund their own movies. <br /><br />as far as the other actors in this show are concerned, they seem to have taken their cue from "the nun" as they all are as bad as each other - don't bother with this movie! i can't get my money back - so save yours!
