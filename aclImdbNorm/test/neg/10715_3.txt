fun with dick and jane failed to entertain on so many levels. there were loose ends with the writing, for example, it seems as though one of the major conflicts was the indictment of jim carrey's character dick harper, but the writers never follow up that particular conflict. basically the story is weak and mostly unfunny, but carrey saves a few scenes with his physical humor, but honestly, jim carrey wasn't very funny in this movie, and tea leone might as well have been there just for her appearance because she wasn't funny either. this is just another example of hollywood banking off franchise actors with a lousy unoriginal story.
