set in the mid 1800's when the british is clearing new zealand outback wilderness to establish colonies. the daughter of a british army surgeon, sarah(samantha morton), falls in love with the son of one of the maori leaders. the maori is an indigenous tribe and a dangerous people for the europeans to deal with. by the time sarah's child, which she calls "boy", is born, his father is dead. by the age of six, "boy" is kidnapped by his father's family and sarah will begin her search for him with a man(kiefer sutherland),who is deeply in love with her.<br /><br />two-time oscar nominee morton is definitely the star of this movie. sutherland is a total waste. also starring are: cliff curtis, stephen rea, temuera morrison and david rawiri pene. this movie is rated r for some sexual content and violent battle scenes. i find the title river queen very misleading and the dvd cover with sutherland only and making you believe he is the leading star should be a crime.
