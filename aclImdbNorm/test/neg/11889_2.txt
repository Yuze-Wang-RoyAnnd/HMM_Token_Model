that this film has such a low imdb rating is not surprising. in our post-enron era, do we really need any more reminders of america's obsession with the greed creed? the topic has become so politically charged that a lot of viewers not only are not going to be entertained by movies of this sort, but will respond with barely concealed rage. it was all i could do to sit quietly through this cinematic memo of corporate corruption without extracting the dvd and smashing it into a thousand pieces.<br /><br />what's really irksome with these kinds of films, including "purpose", is their pretense that behind the glitter, there's some meaningful message that makes the film worthwhile. in "purpose", i found no such meaningful message. what i did find was a story that idolized the materialistic trappings of capitalistic power and wealth. the two main characters, nauseating in their glibness, do very little actual work. instead, they party, they play golf, they strut their coolness, they sound "hip" with dialogue straight out of mtv-culture-speak: "rock my world", and "now get back to partying; that's an order". john is smug, self-important, shallow, and smirks a lot. robert, who wears funky little glasses, is even worse.<br /><br />the film includes two youthful garage geeks, who look and sound like they're right out of the film "antitrust" (2001). stereotypes are played for all they're worth, and in this film also include chic-looking computer equipment, and barbie doll chicks on hand for those occasions when our can-do future billionaires need some relaxation after all that heavy-duty partying. and with the time-bound images and dialogue that such a story necessitates, can you imagine how dated this film will be in fifteen years?<br /><br />about the best i can do for this waste of cinematic celluloid is to say that it does have some nice aerial views of san francisco. the film would have been a lot more enjoyable, a lot more entertaining, if they had ditched those odious characters and that repulsive story, and simply flown us viewers around in that little plane for the film's duration.
