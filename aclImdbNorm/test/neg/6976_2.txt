i agree with one commentator who says that it's really impossible to review glen or glenda? objectively. if one does so, the film on its merits would have to be rated as fairly terrible given the hilarious, convoluted dialog, the generally mediocre to poor acting by the cast as well as the zero production values. yet, such an assessment does not capture the absolutely riveting experience of watching this film as it unfolds. it isn't the fact that the subject of the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the 1950s. it's not even the plea for tolerance of people who embrace alternate life choices that fascinates except as an historic relic.<br /><br />no, what makes glen or glenda? still a fascinating film after 50 years is that ed wood laid his psyche bare in a way that so-called auteur directors like hitchcock or godard, despite their vastly superior talents, never did. in glen or glenda, wood isn't afraid to reveal his own deeply conflicted feelings about being a transvestite despite the plea for tolerance for it through out the film. indeed, the conclusion of the film suggest that ed wood's glen character will be able to "kill" his glenda female counterpart by transferring the feelings of love and affection glen has for his feminine counterpart to his future wife, barbara. the psychiatrist even reassures glen and barbara that as glen makes that psychic transference, glenda will disappear. so, while wood could plead for tolerance of transvestites in general, he wasn't so sure of desiring it for himself.<br /><br />moreover, wood wasn't afraid of throwing everything else that crossed his mind on the screen. he did it with whatever stock footage he could get his hands on. if it didn't cohere, so what? what the viewer saw in glen or glenda especially was ed wood's imaginative world in all of its fundamental strangeness.<br /><br />the only comment i wish to add to my comment above is that my two-star rating is based solely on the objective evaluation criteria cited in the first paragraph. the oddly memeric effect the film has despite its technically atrocious qualities i don't think can be rated.
