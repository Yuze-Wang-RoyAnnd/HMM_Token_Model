this is one of those wonderful martial-arts movies that begin with two posses of tough gang members facing off in a park; and when the deal goes wrong and the battle starts, it turns out they all know karate and kung fu! the ever-wooden cynthia rothrock plays (as usual) a cynical, deadpan, good cop, this time in los angeles. she and her police partners are trying to break up a counterfeiting ring, and when that plot line is exhausted, the story just switches over to something else, and cynthia becomes the personal bodyguard of a wealthy, great-looking tycoon. within the film's obviously rock-bottom budget, there's some helicopter action, some speedboat action, some car chases, a brawl where cynthia beats up everyone in a country-western bar, some swimming-pool scenes with bimbos in thong bikinis, and a surprisingly good horseback chase. about a dozen and a half cops get gunned down. a lot of plot twists happen that just don't make any sense; don't worry about them. (and counterfeiting currency is a federal crime, so where the hell is the fbi? i guess they were too busy.) the fight choreography was done by cynthia rothrock's frequent co-star richard taylor, whose classy and witty presence in front of the camera would frankly have made this a better movie. he also tended to make cynthia a better actress when they appeared together, and frankly she could use it; she seems tired and bored, and does her best acting in guardian angel when she is playing opposite a pet dog to whom she delivers bitter drunken monologues. the dog almost out-acts her! she also wears some of the most god-awful clothing any leading lady has ever worn in any movie: loose, baggy-leg jeans with pale acid-washed areas over each buttock were the most shocking. the other actors are all over the map. you can picture many of the minor characters being cast this way: "hey, me and some other guys i know are going to be in a movie. you wanna be in it too? no, dude, i'm serious!" then there are the slumming professionals: the most fun is lydie denier, the stunning french model and veteran of "red shoe diaries," "baywatch," "melrose place," and of playing many, many other variations on the sexy french bombshell; here she plays a psychopathic killer as if she were in baisez-moi or an "alias" episode and not some direct-to-cable trash like this. there's also the tall, dark and handsome daniel mcvicar, now a regular on "the bold and the beautiful," john o'leary, who has played a dignified old man in dozens of movies and sitcom episodes and does it again here, and aharon ipale, the veteran arab character actor perhaps best known as "pharaoh seti" from the mummy and the mummy returns. for these professionals, guardian angel must be the most laughable entry on their resumes. i gave this movie a better rating than it probably deserves because my daughters, who are enthusiastic martial-arts students, both like to see a woman kicking ass and having the big action scenes for a change. they're still a bit too young to care what a low-quality picture this really was, and just enjoyed cheering cynthia on as she did her swivel-legged, high-kicking, stick-fighting thing. if you like this kind of flick, you could probably enjoy it on that level.
