no that its sick. it's not sick. it made me want to puke because i spent 2 dollars on it. its boring, retarded, and annoying. i didn't see the mst3k version, which sucks because i bet the mst3k version was funny. it's sad that people waste money on these kinds of movies. i'm surprised its not on the "100 worst movies of all time list".<br /><br />tromadude's rating- 0 outta ***** stars
