so i caught this one afternoon as "what lies above" and actually watched it because the beginning was somewhat promising. the heroine, diana pennington, is a mountain climbing expert...but that doesn't help her when her fianc'e brian gets hurt on a climb. when she goes off to get help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again.<br /><br />two years later, diana is still a climber...but she won't go near snowman's pass. that is, until curt seaver appears and tells her that he can find the body of her lost fianc'e with a new satellite program. she agrees and they take off up the mountain with curt's two assistants: his "bodyguard" hugo and the computer whiz tyler. from the start, you know that there's some ulterior motive going on, but unfortunately the twists aren't good and lead to a laughably bad chase sequence that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />the major disappointments are the red herrings, most of which have supernatural undertones that never come to fruition. the object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how snowman's pass came to be, and the most memorable one of them all: diana's dream sequence halfway through the movie. but what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball. the majority of the movie revolves around the search for brian, that's why i can't for the life of me begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was is never solved through the course of the movie. this was the major plot. this was how the movie started! how do you not wrap that up?<br /><br />i wouldn't tell too many people to bother with this one...
