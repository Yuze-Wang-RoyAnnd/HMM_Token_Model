it has been a long time since i have been to a movie as lame and boring as this one. it is one thing to have a slow pace where characters are being developed in a progressive way, or some aspect of the movie clearly is enhanced by such pacing (such as 'lost in translation"). however, there is a difference between slow progression and outright stalling, as happened in this one. i guess from the look on helen mirren's face she must have been distraught by the disappearance of her husband!! surprise, surprise!! what a marvelously creative moment the meeting of the mistress and wife was.(sarcasm) and what a great way that the whole story fell apart at the end. truly a masterpiece.
