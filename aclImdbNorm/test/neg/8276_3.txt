the title for this review about sums up how i feel about this movie. i can't imagine what audience there would be for this thing, if not for the die-hard fan of 1980s slasher films who simply has to see -everything- from that era. otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.<br /><br />the story is similar to most films of its type: something awful happens to one of the characters in the opening scene, which inspires a bloodthirsty killer to go on a murderous rampage. been there, done that. truth be told, none of these '80s slashers were known for their originality, so i can't see the point in harping on the film simply for this.<br /><br />but where the film fails is in its suspense and murder sequences. i've seen some pretty scary slasher movies from the 1980s that had far lower budgets than this. this one just fails to create any real suspense. the director throws in some nice camera angles and some semi-professional directorial touches here and there, but they mean nothing if you're not frightened. the gore is pretty tame as well, so anyone who watches these things with the intention of seeing some cool 1980s makeup effects will be sadly disappointed.<br /><br />the movie manages to clunk along rather dully. honestly, the key ingredient to almost any slasher is the tight pacing--you have to keep things moving along swiftly and keep the murder set pieces staged at regular intervals, because, let's face it, we don't watch these things for the great characterization and stellar plots. but the pacing, whether due to the script or the editor, is all off. the murders are spaced out at odd intervals, leaving us with some long-winded scenes (no doubt meant to build "character") that serve only to bore you and leave you praying for the next kill (which, as i've said, usually isn't executed all that well anyway).<br /><br />as for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening. he (or she?) wears a jogging suit, a fencing mask, and his (or her?) primary weapon is a sword. i bet the writer just wet himself over thinking he came up with an original, "cool" murder weapon, but the idea just comes off as impractical and silly. there's also not much emphasis placed on the "whodunnit' nature of the film, as if they either forgot or don't care to place any red herrings in the mix to throw us off.<br /><br />i have the sense that the people behind this were trying to make something decent and respectable, and at times, it shows their intentions were probably a bit more genuine in regards to making a quality film as opposed to countless other knockoff slashers from the era. but alas, the attempt fails for the most part. there is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film). there is attempt at characterization, but none of it ends up meaning anything in the end, so...what a waste. here, all it manages to do is bog down the plot and make the murder sequences feel like they can't come soon enough.<br /><br />in the end, if you're really into these old '80s slashers, by all means, check it out, if only to say you've seen it. there's a completest in all of us. but don't expect to be blown away or anything. what we have here is a very mildly entertaining slasher movie that leaves no real impression at all.
