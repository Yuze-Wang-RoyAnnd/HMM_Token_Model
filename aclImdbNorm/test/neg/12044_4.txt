it's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera-work and busy (but scratchy) background score that accompanies this 1933 release. although sound came into general use in 1928, there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman, unhappily married, who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods.<br /><br />the most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town, proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife's lover. in a frenzy of jealousy, he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment, losing his nerve. it's probably the most tension-filled scene in the otherwise decidedly slow-moving and obviously contrived story.<br /><br />hedy lamarr is given the sort of close-up treatment lavished on marlene dietrich by her discoverer, but her beauty had not yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when she was transported to hollywood. her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love (aribert mog), the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim.<br /><br />the swimming scene is very brief, discreetly photographed, and not worth all the heat it apparently generated. the love-making scene, later on, is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film--artfully so. more is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism--and this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece.<br /><br />not so. it's disappointing, primitively crude in its sound portions (including the laborious symphonic music in the background) and certainly miss lamarr is fortunate that louis b. mayer saw the film and on the basis of it, gave her a career in hollywood. he must have seen something in her work that i didn't.<br /><br />it's apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work. the jarring "workers" scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where none is needed. it fails to end the film on the proper note.
