watching this film today i got the feeling this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes or so from the beginning of the story. john wayne rides up on this trading post/saloon out in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner about some robberies. all he sees is the signs of a massacre, some dead bodies, signs of a fight and no one alive in sight. that's because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room, the kind you find in old english murder mysteries.<br /><br />the reason you find those hidden rooms in those kind of stories is that they were formerly priestholes. catholic families clinging to the old faith in 16th century england built these things to hide those on the run from royal authorities because of their faith. not something you see in westerns, but a good gimmick.<br /><br />unfortunately because of bad editing or writing or both we never know exactly what brought wayne to this place exactly. but this was a b western and not even a good one at that.<br /><br />gabby hayes is in this and he's clean shaven and playing a mute part of the time. an unusual circumstance for the garrulous gabby.<br /><br />if you want to bother and find out what happens and see a whiskerless gabby hayes then see this film.
