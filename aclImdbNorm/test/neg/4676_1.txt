the cast played shakespeare.<br /><br />shakespeare lost.<br /><br />i appreciate that this is trying to bring shakespeare to the masses, but why ruin something so good.<br /><br />is it because 'the scottish play' is my favorite shakespeare? i do not know. what i do know is that a certain rev bowdler (hence bowdlerization) tried to do something similar in the victorian era.<br /><br />in other words, you cannot improve perfection.<br /><br />i have no more to write but as i have to write at least ten lines of text (and english composition was never my forte i will just have to keep going and say that this movie, as the saying goes, just does not cut it.
