this is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action film. billy dee plays a young man fed up with racism who decides to take things into his own hands. it's fairly gritty and realistic without exploiting the characters but still it's not that interesting either and billy dee's character, though maltreated by white authority figures, doesn't really come off as sympathetic. it's also hurt by it's extremely low budget. still, it's interesting to look at as it's a good depicttion of 1970s social issues.
