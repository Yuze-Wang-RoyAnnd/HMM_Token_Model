wow. the storyline to this was just incredibly stupid. i realize that this movie was supposed to be of a comedic genre. but still, even nonsense is supposed to make at least some vague sort of sense.<br /><br />water has become incredibly rare substance?<br /><br />well, that's strange, considering that hydrogenated oxygen (or oxidized hydrogen) is one of the most plentiful substances there is in the universe. and pretty easy to make. glomp together hydrogen and oxygen atoms, and voil`a, water.<br /><br />instead of water, the rarity of dilithium crystals or some such thingamajig should have been used as a plot device as something the pirates would go after. water as a plot device was just dumb, dumb, dumb.<br /><br />the "comedy" seemed labored and contrived and forced. the comedy in the tv series "red dwarf" was labored and contrived and forced, but, it was actually amusing. here instead, i felt like saying, "ha ha, that was just so funny, i forgot to laugh..."<br /><br />sigh... all that money put into sets, costumes, actors... what a waste...<br /><br />rather than just whimper and whine and complain at it's lameness, my recommendations to make it better: 1) use a believable plot device. 2) get rid of the "comedy". none of the actors were really any good at it. the movie would work better as a "serious" action adventure.<br /><br />the obvious intention of the writers was to do a spoofy comedy, but they didn't quite pull it off. it's not likely i'll ever watch this again. it's too much a total hack job.
