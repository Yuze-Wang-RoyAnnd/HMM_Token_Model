i am currently 22 years old, and remember seeing this movie in the theatres when it first came out. you heard me right, i was 5 years old, and yet i can still distinctly remember what i saw that afternoon so many years ago. was it a mystical trip through the fantastic world of mark twain's creativity?... no, on the other hand, it was a quite creepy film about mark twain's dark, depressed, and in fact suicidal side. one scene that still bothers me was a particularly strange scene in which mark twain is playing the organ at his own funeral.<br /><br />would an adult enjoy this film? well, this movie quite possibly features some interesting viewpoints that a person with a working knowledge of mark twain's writing might enjoy; but trust me on this, "adventures" is not the film you want to use to introduce your young children to mark twain.
