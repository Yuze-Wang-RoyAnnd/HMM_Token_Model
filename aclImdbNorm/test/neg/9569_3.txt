well, i saw this movie during the last san sebastian film festival. the reaction to it was...let's say as funny as the movie unintetionally is. it happened that they showed a copy with terribly wrong spanish subtitles. they seemed to be a translation from chinese to english and then to spanish. it was all confusing, the genders were switched (girls appeared as boys and boys as girls), and my friends and i remember great lines... but because they were so absurd. all in all not a good movie, but if they ever show it on tv, and you have nothing to do, and if you want to laugh (again, not so much with the movie) then go ahead, "visible secret" is your film.
