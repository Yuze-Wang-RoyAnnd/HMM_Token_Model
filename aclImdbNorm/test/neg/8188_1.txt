joe rogan's whole act is profanity laced with bile. he is a pot smoker who entered fear factor, thinking it was a joke. he said he would egg people on because he did not know how stupid people were going to be. the producers of the show he explained were going on the premise of playing pranks on unsuspecting contestants to see how far they will go. the level of evil involved is a little twisted. mr. rogan's special is just filled with the rants of someone who is too good for regular human beings. i found him to be offensive and his stuff can be heard by more talented comedians such as eddie murphy or chris rock. rogan even does a five minute set on the n word. overall, ignore this special.
