this movie, like so many others (remember the titans, miracle), follows the basic sports-movie formula: there's a guy, he's a jerk. jerk does bad. jerk must play by someone else's rules. someone else's rules change jerk, jerk becomes good. insert tragedy (death, drugs, riots, etc.). tragedy effects jerk, makes him totally change. jerk must now play championship game. lots of close-ups on the sweating players and the balls. jerk wins. quote from coach or news or something that explains title. credits. weren't you touched? these movies can now be used to sort out the morons of society. anyone who pays to see this in theatres must be slapped.
