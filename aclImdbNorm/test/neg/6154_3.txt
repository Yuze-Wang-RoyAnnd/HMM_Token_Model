yeeee-haa! <br /><br />i have seen it argued that most american movies are cowboy movies in disguise; that hollywood is so in love with it's only truly original creation that it keeps reinventing the cowboy myth. i'm not sure i totally buy that argument but slipstream is evidence in support of the theory; it's a cowboy movie with aeroplanes. <br /><br />actually it goes one better than that. it's a spagetti western with aeroplanes! substitute the planes with horses, make the android a priest and this movie would be indistinguishable from any one of a dozen italian spanish semi-arty "shoot-'em-ups with pretensions" of the seventies.<br /><br />the film isn't as bad as i had been lead to believe by some of the reviews i had read here but it certainly wasn't good.
