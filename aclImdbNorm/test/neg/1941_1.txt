anyone remember the first cky, cky2k etc..? back when it was about making crazy cool stuff, rather than watching bam margera act like a douchebag, spoiled 5 year old, super/rock-star wannabe.<br /><br />the show used to be awesome, however, bam's fame and wealth has led him to believe, that we now enjoy him acting childish and idiotic, more than actual cool stuff, that used to be in ex. cky2k.<br /><br />the acts are so repetitive, there's like nothing new, except annoying stupidity and rehearsed comments... the only things we see is bam margera, so busy showing us how much he doesn't care, how much money he got or whatsoever.<br /><br />i really got nothing much left to say except, give us back cky2k, cause bam suck..<br /><br />i enjoy watching steve-o, knoxville etc. a thousand times more.
