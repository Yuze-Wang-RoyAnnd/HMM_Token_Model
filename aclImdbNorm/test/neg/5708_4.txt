a woman who deals in art starts to have a passionate love affair with a man named john. they make love everywhere they go and they play sexual games. the problem i had was that was all they did. there was no plot at all to this movie or i just didn't see it. the hot erotic passion was the best thing about this movie but i wanted something else to happen. perhaps he could have been a serial killer or she could have had a secret. i just needed something and all that there was was a bunch of love making scenes. not that's it was bad or anything, i just wanted more things to happen in the movie. perhaps a coworker was sleeping with him too. anything! i was greatly upset that this was all that there was. mickey rourke was so hot back then. i wonder what happened.
