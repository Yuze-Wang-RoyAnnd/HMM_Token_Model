mr. moto's gamble has a fairly straight forward plot - when a boxer is murdered in the ring with a mysterious poison, it's up to the even more mysterious mr. moto to solve the case.<br /><br />i'm shocked at the number of positive reviews for mr. moto's gamble on imdb. because to me...well, i found it extremely disappointing. i enjoy mr. moto and i enjoy charlie chan, but i can't say i cared for this mish-mash of the two. for those unfamiliar with the story behind mr. moto's gamble, it was originally intended to be a charlie chan film. but when warner oland backed-out, some of the scenes and action were rewritten for peter lorre and mr. moto. as i indicated, the end result left me underwhelmed. mr. moto is not chan. he's more mysterious, he's more athletic, and he's more exotic. so trying to put moto in a chan film is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole - it doesn't work. and listening to lorre/moto try to deliver one of chan's trademark euphemisms just ends up sounding silly. add to that the fact that almost 10 minutes of the already brief 72 minute runtime is made up of boxing scenes (something that i never seem to enjoy) and you end up with a movie that i couldn't help but dislike. if i have to say something positive i would point to the performance of keye luke. but even he's not near enough to save mr. moto's gamble in my eyes.<br /><br />sorry, but a 4/10 is about the best i can give this one.
