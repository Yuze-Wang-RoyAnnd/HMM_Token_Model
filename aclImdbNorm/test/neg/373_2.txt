i just finished watching dog watch. i thought parts of the movie were hokey with more than a few implausibilities. the acting wasn't too bad and the plot wasn't bad. but, as the saying goes, the devil was in the details.<br /><br />some examples:<br /><br />1) the bleed-through on charlie falon's (sam elliott) bandage was shown to be coming from the back of his hand while it was his knuckles that were bleeding.<br /><br />2) would a detective dispose of his murder victim from a very well-lighted area? this seemed very silly to me.<br /><br />i am not unusually picky about a movie but, in my humble opinion, this one is definitely not recommended by me.
