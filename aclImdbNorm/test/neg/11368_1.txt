this was the worst tv movie i had ever seen. the visuals were so dang choppy it made me dizzy. i hated the constant zoom in and zoom out, and the frequent black and white to color switch. i also thought that the story didn't make any sense what so ever, and it was another clich'ed action movie, with a hero a bad guy, and a few hostages. i could make a better movie than that with my own camera, why? i can hold it steady, something the director couldn't do. over all truly the worst i have ever seen, you thought disney was bad? i didn't even bother to watch the whole thing because i'm sure i could guess the outcome, and the visual were the worst i have ever seen.
