this fourth installment of the series is the last to get a theatrical release,though it feels like a direct to video movie.it's ok,i guess,but nothing special.the acting is the worst of seen in the series up to this point.and like the third movie,there isn't much in the way of imagination.also,the sentence "directed by alan smithee" is never a good thing.smithee is the pseudonym directors use when they want nothing to do with the movie.anyway,its an acceptable movie in the hellraiser series,but not much more than that.it's a slight drop in quality from number three,and a huge drop from the first two.for me,hellraiser iv:bloodline is a 4.5/10
