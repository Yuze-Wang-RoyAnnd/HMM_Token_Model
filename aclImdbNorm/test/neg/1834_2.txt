there is an endless supply of trashy horror movies. it seems that people never get tired of trying to scare and thrill. alas, very seldom these attempts succeed. this, unfortunate movie has almost no redeeming value. the story is highly predictable, most of the actors very uninspired, or just plainly miscast, special effects of very low quality. it took a lot of effort not to switch off the dvd and go to bed. with such a limited number of foreign movies issued in the usa, why in the world would anybody want to import this drivel. to top it all, apparently there is an "anatomy 2 ", for those who have nothing better to do. i'd rather watch the paint dry.
