after wasting 2 hours of my life watching this movie on late night television, i went back and reread some of the imdb material, to remind myself of why i watched it in the first place. in hindsight, the only thing that i can think of is that the genre generally appeals to me. but this movie was a total waste of effort. it fails on every level, and to see that it's described on imdb as a comedy really leaves me at a loss. i don't recall more than a couple of chuckles. there are more laughs in any episode of law and order than in the last man. seriously.<br /><br />too much of the characters' interaction just didn't seem to me to have any foundation, and was therefore very unlikely/unbelievable.<br /><br />if it hadn't been for the almost-gratuitous bikini shots, well, what can i say? avoid this movie like the plague. or tape it and just fast forward to the bikini shots. do not spend even $1 to rent it though.
