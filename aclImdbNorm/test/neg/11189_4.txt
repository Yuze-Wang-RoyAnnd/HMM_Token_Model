i'm a big fan of surrealist art, but this film by bunuel (with some ideas from dali) left me cold. bunuel had a life-long grudge against the catholic church and delighted in trying to offend catholics in fairly silly ways. this is one of the silliest; almost like what you'd expect from a smart-aleck 18-year-old in film class. the last few minutes of the movie, which have nothing to do with anything else, are a final nose-thumbing at religion.<br /><br />if you read the "scholars" regarding this slow-paced, occasionally amusing film, it's all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression. if that is indeed the point, then bunuel expresses it in the most roundabout fashion possible. the central male character is a nasty brute who loves kicking dogs and knocking blind men down in the street, and who mentally turns billboard ads into strange sexual fantasies. is this behavior the church's fault (for interrupting his lovemaking), or is he just a jerk? i vote for the latter. i think bunuel must have had a lot of personal hangups and chose the catholics as the ones to blame.<br /><br />there are a few moments where you might cry, "aha! surrealism!": a cow in a bed, a giraffe falling out a window (a poor model), a man shredding a feather pillow, a woman flushing a toilet while we watch pictures of seething lava (or a mud pit...hard to tell in b/w). the rest is forgettable self-indulgence. unfortunately, bunuel was still chasing the same bogey-men through the rest of his career (viridiana, discreet charm...). if you're interested in seeing surrealism on the screen, check out jean cocteau's early work.
