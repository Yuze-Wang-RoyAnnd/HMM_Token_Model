i rented this pile of sewer waste hoping for a few good laughs. with a title like `zombie bikers from detroit' and with dead alive productions stamped on the front cover, you would think that this could be a funny/gruesome film, but no. this is the worst movie i have ever seen (and yes, i have seen all of the police academy movies). the story (this is a joke within itself) and the dialogue are atrocious. the make up of the so-called zombies looks like they used one of those two dollar `make yourself look like a zombie' kits that you buy at k-mart.<br /><br />i would rather watch beverly hills 90210 while listening to the backstreet boys and be whipped by a 400lb novelty birthday card model than to sit through another single minute of this pathetic excuse for a dvd. honestly, i could make a better movie with $3, some popsicle sticks and a slinky. i feel as if 90 minutes of my life were stripped away from me and taken to the land of suckdom. i know that tagging on the dead alive production doesn't guarantee a great flick, but you do expect to get your moneys worth.<br /><br />the only thing that made me happy (save, returning the horrid mass of elephant feces) was that it wasn't titled `biker zombies from pittsburgh'. i feel for detroit folks that wasted their hard-earned money on this one. unless you have been lobotomized
