this is a film with a lot of potential, well done and acted, with a rather week and inconsistent script. a young woman with two children moves to her mother's cramped apartment, because the husbands flat on top of the workshop where he cuts up stolen cars is aggravating their son's asthma.husband ends up in jail when an ex pat's stolen car is traced to his shop, ex pat ends up being kind,generous and naive shmoe(and rather cardboard and we learn next to nothing of him ), but ends up with the girl, who "trades up" despite being sexually satisfied only by her husband. i expect this film to be successful in czech, where it will be welcome due to its obvious premise - "them ex-pats may have money, they may even get our women, but they're old, soft and our women want to be satisfied,we may be poor, but ... . now if only could evzen keep marcela satisfied so she would not need to play with herself, or if he already had an existing family in italy ... but that would complicate things.
