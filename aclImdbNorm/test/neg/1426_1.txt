just seen which way to the front? on tcm (uk) it is a truly awful film. if i'd paid at the pictures i'd have walked out.<br /><br />a terrible mess of a film. byers (lewis) and his mates prance around in cast off uniforms from an italian sci-fi movie of 1960's. were the cnd/peace symbol badges on the uniforms meant to be ironic? the sets were pure 1970, i'm sure a hollywood tv back-lot could have provided a more realistic set.<br /><br />the film is riddled with racism. the film takes the mickey out of veterans. <br /><br />not funny how lewis every got to make another film is beyond me.
