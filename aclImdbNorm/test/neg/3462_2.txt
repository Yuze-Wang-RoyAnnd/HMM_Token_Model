ok where do i start? i saw a screening a couple weeks ago and i was shocked how bad this movie is. sure if you just love beverly hillbillies and green acres (bad acting) and you think they are the best tv shows on air then you will definitely love this movie. me, personally, i really like george's work and he is very talented, but comedy is not his forte. some people are natural in comedy and i am sure he is great & funny to work with personally but comedy he can not pull it off on the big screen. it was a cute movie but would i pay $12.00 to see it? h&ll no !!!! now that i have seen it i would not recommend it to anyone to spend their money. george, buddy, i love you but please don't do any more comedies? this script is lacking a lot, great concept but just didn't do it.
