this film was so bad it became enjoyable. if you want to see a soap opera cast decide to do an action film, this is for you! overacting, irrelevant incidents, implausible dialogue - it has it all. the main character has a split personality and can not make up his mind whether he is thief, a loving father or a hero who will risk his life for others. he is plausible in none of these roles. this sets the standard for many of the other characters. the boss of the company whose building is set ablaze displays the same unpredictability, and so does his wife. and the punch line - who has taken the "chip" - beggars belief. i found myself laughing heartily and for that reason, i recommend you watch it.
