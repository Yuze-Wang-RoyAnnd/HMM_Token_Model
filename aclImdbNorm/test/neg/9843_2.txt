if this movie had been directed by a man, he would have been jailed. while adrian lyne was shackled with a lawyer in the editing room to oversee the gutting of a classic piece of literature to appease the censors, and to avoid running afoul of the child pornography protection act of 1996, a woman dumps ripe on us and everyone applauds. did i miss a meeting? in addition to the blatant pedophilia, this movie is utterly preposterous. has this woman never set foot on an active military base? has she never met a soldier? whose army is this? the uniforms must have come from uniforms-r-us. just throw on some patches, who cares? just make sure each and every one of them has a big red one. there is a slight inside joke here that no doubt went over the auteur's head, but might possibly have been slipped in by whoever furnished the military vehicles. certainly there were no military advisors. the u.s. army does not operate slums. temporary base camps in jungle war zones are cleaner than this. the u.s. army does not put 14-year-old girls to work on military bases, nor allow them to use the firing ranges or training courses. there is much drama to be mined in the sexual coming-of-age of teenage girls. this movie has absolutely nothing to do with that whatsoever.
