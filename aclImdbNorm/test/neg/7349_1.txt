i have watched this show for a while, only because of my cousins, and i hate it! first, the girls dress in the same style clothes, and they have the same first letter in their names. (come on, i could to better than that!) then the villains (spare me), first we have a monkey with part of his (little) brain showing, then we have a (gay) version of the devil, a pink hillbilly, a gang green gang (whit is ironic, that's their name) a spoiled princess (once again, ironic, that's 'her' name) among others. i have also found that there is no male hero in the show. (not that i'm sexist or anything...) i'd rather watch sailor moon, it's much better than this. if someone else wants to watch the show in the room that you're in, find a way to break the television. believe me, it'll save you a half hour of torture.<br /><br />rating: i'm giving this just what it deserves, a 1 out of 10. whatever you do, do not watch this!
