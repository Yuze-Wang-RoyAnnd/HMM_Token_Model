what really stood out to me about this movie was how little the plot made sense. so many characters were randomly introduced, it was like how i imagine tommy wiseau's "the room" would be re-envisioned for the disney channel set. we had the wise elderly couple who kept on hanging out where "jane" worked, telling the same story about how "soda" brought them together, or jane's mom/stepmom/random crying woman who would all show up at random times.<br /><br />aaron carter's acting is definitely the highlight of this film: i actually looked forward to every scene he appeared in. the editing is painfully bad, with scene cuts that make no sense. the "jane" character is really irritating, mooning about and moping about "j.d. mcqueen." the scenes with the "music awards" are more depressing than anything else. and the ending of this movie is surreal.
