plot:<br /><br />- a chair from ebay<br /><br />- random people<br /><br />- random people talk (" dude, it's right. " "i'm feeling it." "lets get married now!")<br /><br />- if you are a "hippie" then you will love this movie. (you must be high or drunk, otherwise you will question your life watching this junk.)<br /><br />this movie was clearly not thought out from the beginning to the end, and the other comments are probably the crew padding the reviews. if this wasn't aimed at my demographic, i don't know what it is aimed for. i found the plot everyday boring. it's something that i would do, and trust me it's not worth filming. going on a roadtrip and filming half of the silence does not make a movie!
