anyone who has seen the piece of steaming smelly poo called congo understands my title. and i feel for you. this movie wasn't just bad. it was painful. the book was stupid, the script was even dumber and the cast was terrible. dylan walsh? rumor has it julia roberts dumped your ass cause this movie blew so bad. huge diamonds? killer gorillas? talking gorillas? hmmm. sounds like a hit! oh! tim curry's accent is so bad in this movie i would prefer being deaf! i recommend this movie to bulimics looking to purge after a heavy meal or kavorkian patients who just need that one more reason to die. if this is faithful to the book, i would say lets have us a good old fashion footloose book burning and destroy every copy. if future generations look back and find this garbage, how would we explain ourselves? listen to the others who hated this movie! don't watch it! run away! do not watch this movie! if you think it is full of action or suspense or cool effects, you are wrong! if you think it blows more cock than nicole ritchie, you'd be right. so if you still are going to watch crapo..,.i mean congo, i say do it after you just took 50 tylenol pm.
