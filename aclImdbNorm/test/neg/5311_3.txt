the first 10 minutes of the movie makes fun of sequels and pg-13 movies. these are the 2 reasons the movie is so bad. they constantly reference a movie called "get leo" which is the movie-in-a-movie version of get shorty. every time they do this, you will be really angry. travolta isn't very cool, neither is keitel. however, the rock and vince vaughn are hilarious. they aren't the kind of funny you would expect to see in an elmore leonard movie though. if you haven't seen get shorty, you will probably like be cool. if you liked get shorty, you will leave the theater wanting to kill the director and screenwriter. wait for the dvd.
