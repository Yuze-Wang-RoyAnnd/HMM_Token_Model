directed and written by the famous/infamous edward d. wood jr, using a pseudonym(daniel davis)playing the lead role of glen/glenda. this is an almost radical documentary about transvestism; wood himself being a transvestite with a fetish for angora sweaters. it seems miles of stock footage and an incoherent bela lugosi is used to stretch this odd and awkward film to 67 minutes. police inspector(lyle talbot)seeks enlightenment from a psychiatrist, dr. alton(timothy farrell), to better understand the emotional and disposition of transvestites.<br /><br />also in the cast: delores fuller, "tommy" hanes, captain dezita and wood's sister evelyn. of note: farrell also acts as narrator. and fuller later helped write songs included in the elvis presley movies blue hawaii, kissin' cousins & kid galahad.
