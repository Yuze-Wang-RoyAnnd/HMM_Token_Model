this is basically just a dumb chase story, nearly identical to zillions of other chase stories in terms of acting, suspense, plot, dialogue, characterization (or lack thereof), and pacing.<br /><br />the one area in which 'the net' diverges from traditional chase movies is in its subject material: computers. unfortunately, the scriptwriters clearly didn't understand the differences between a pocket calculator and a cray!<br /><br />computer-newbies shouldn't watch this movie, because it will make them paranoid about computers. no matter what hollywood tries to tell us, it's just not that easy to erase someone's identity by hacking. there's still too much paper documentation in the world, and there was even more of it in 1995.<br /><br />computer-pros shouldn't watch this movie, either. i mean, a magical virus that can melt your entire pc when you press "escape"? please. and the whole virus, including the cool multimedia effects of your screen dissolving (what's that all about?) can fit on a single 1.44mb diskette? yeah ... whatever.
