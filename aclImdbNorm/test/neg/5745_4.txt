slayer is a mindless vampire movie with a few twists on an ancient plot. special ops team is sent into south america to hunt down blood sucking natives. their leader is a real old man who has aged well. there's an environmental twist as the vampires are attacking villages because their rain forest and old diet of wild animals is disappearing because of the greedy corporations and farmers. lost of fighting and so much blood they just never bothered to wash off the cast for the whole film. it looks like they slept in the bloody clothes and caked on blood. while each member of the cast brought their own talents, it really didn't all click as a film. the effects were ok, except for the vampires dangling from the buildings on wires. if you're looking for lots of blood and violence, this is for you.
