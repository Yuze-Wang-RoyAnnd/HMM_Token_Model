produced at a point in his career, where he had the juice to do whatever he wanted, eddie murphy took on the task of producing, directing, co-writing and starring in harlem nights, an expensive-looking but ultimately empty gangster saga about a group of black nightclub owners/gangsters running a ritzy club during the 1930's, headed by a wisecracking hot shot (eddie murphy)and his adopted father (richard pryor) and their attempts to avoid being overrun by white gangsters who think they are taking over turf that, it seems, they think is rightfully theirs, simply by virtue of their color. this was an idea that probably looked great on paper but it definitely lost something in the translation. this was a vanity piece for eddie and i think he spreads himself a little too thin here trying to be the whole show here. admittedly, it was a pleasure seeing murphy and pryor together on screen, but the rest of the large supporting cast, including arsenio hall, redd foxx, della reese, michael lerner, danny aiello, jasmine guy, thomas mikal ford, stan shaw, and eddie's brother, are really given precious little to do (though i will admit murphy's fight scene with della reese is hysterically funny and probably, the movie's best scene). murphy clearly poured a lot of money into this film and a good deal of it shows on screen. the art and set direction are impressive and the breathtaking costumes should have won an oscar, but this one was a big miss for eddie as he definitely tried to wear too many hats.
