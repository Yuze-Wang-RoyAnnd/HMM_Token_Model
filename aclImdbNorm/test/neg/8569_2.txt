i didn't buy this, i didn't rent this, it was on ppv and someone burned a copy of it and loaned it to me, so at least i wasted no money on it. for someone that did darkness, the nameless, devil's backbone, this is a pretty lame film. seems to have something to do with a bunch of girls that were at a convent back in the day and now they're all grown up and they're being pursued and killed one by one by a nun that comes out of the kitchen sink, the toilet, and even manages to negotiate the revolving doors in a hotel. and what makes this nun so mean and nasty (and wet?) i dunno, this was so boring that at some point about halfway through i just stopped it, put it away, and watched something else. wasn't even interested in finding out, really. oh sure, there's some lovely young ladies to look at but hey, are two of them lesbians? i guess, there's a picture on the bedside table of one young lady's bedroom and what self-respecting horror movie wouldn't be complete these days without a lesbian couple? yeah whatever. 2 out of 10, if you want to see a worthwhile nun horror movie try "desecration", "dead waters", or "the convent" (and that's the one with adrienne barbeau, by the way, not the one with john malkovich).
