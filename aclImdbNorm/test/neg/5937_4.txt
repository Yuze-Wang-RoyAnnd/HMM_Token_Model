after two terrorist attacks in europe, one in london and the other in amsterdam, the prime suspect is the leader al-saleem (alon aboutboul). the cia agent roger ferris (leonardo dicaprio) that operates in the middle east is assigned by his superior at langley ed hoffman (russell crowe) to keep a "safe house" in amman under surveillance, and he associates to the chief of security in jordan, hani salaam (mark strong). roger does not disclose the whole operation to hani, and it fails due to the intervention of ed. meanwhile roger has feelings for the local nurse aisha (golshifteh farahani) and he gets close to her family. when roger plots another scheme to catch al-saleem using the innocent architect omar sadiki (ali suliman) as decoy to lure al-saleem, he jeopardizes not only the safety of sadiki, but also aisha that is kidnapped. after the execution of sadiki, roger tries to negotiate the release of aisha with the terrorists and proposes to deliver himself to save the nurse.<br /><br />"body of lies" is a disappointing pyrotechnical tour through europe and middle east despite the names of ridley scott, leonardo dicaprio and russell crowe. the imdb user rating indicates that there are many viewers that like this type of fast paced movie of espionage using high technology, satellites and all sort of lack of respect to the sovereignty of other nations in the name of oil that gives no time for thinking, but that is not my case. it is boring and ridiculous to see the fat russell crowe with a cell phone like a family man while his partner is risking his life in a dangerous operation. the rich character performed by leonardo dicaprio is poorly developed and in my opinion this great actor is miscast as an operative agent in middle east due to his biotype. but the movie never explains his connections with the middle east. the rescue of roger ferris alive is also very stupid and corny. my vote is four.<br /><br />title (brazil): "rede de mentiras" ("network of lies")
