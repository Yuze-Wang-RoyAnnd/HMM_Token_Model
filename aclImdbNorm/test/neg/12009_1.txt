whenever someone tries to tell me that they think a movie is the worst ever (and it's usually some movie that's "cool" to hate, like "manos, the hands of fate" or "the avengers") i ask them, "is that movie a comedy about an orphan who is constantly trying to murder adults? does anyone utter the line 'i'd rather eat a turd' in that movie?"<br /><br />this movie is way too infantile and moronic for adults, and way too violent and irresponsible for children. is there that much money in the beavis and butt-head demographic to make a series of movies like this? there is a problem child 3, but i haven't seen it. i'd rather eat a turd.
