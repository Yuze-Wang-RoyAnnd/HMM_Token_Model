that's what i kept asking myself while watching this film. i mean the amount of nudity and sex was one thing but another part of the movie which gave its genre to the adult industry was its lack of storyline. really i just wanted to get up and leave during the whole movie, but i persisted. i persisted in the hope that maybe the storyline would get better, that there might be a good twist at the end. however i couldn't have been more wrong. in the end i persisted because i figured i could write a bad review for it if anything after watching it. <br /><br />i mean don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with beautiful, sexy and vibrant women, but when the director only shows that along with a shitty story thinking it's what the viewer wants to see, it insults us all. to think we are all so shallow to only want to see burlesque from rep ratable, big movie industry players is preposterous. my advice: hire a different movie.
