heard some good remarks about this film as being very gory and frightning, but it's neither. obviously the screenwriter wanted to do a scary horror film but at the same time inject some teenage comedy for the young target audience. scares and comedy seldomly result in good films, the same goes for monster man.<br /><br />not really funny, nor scary or overly enjoyable on any other level.<br /><br />aproaching 39 years of age i've seen my share of horror movies. i have seen good ones and terrible ones, but the crop of films released these days are so frighteningly mediocre it bores me to watch 'em. the acceptance these days for bad films like this is what really annoys me. let's face it, they produced a lot of crap in the 70's, 80's and 90's but they were regarded as such then as well. today they're regarded as "good entertainment". - bollocks!
