before launching into whether this film is worth your time or not, i should inform you i've never seen another adaptation of carmen, so if you're looking for a review on how it ranks amongst others, this might not be of much use to you.<br /><br />the only time i've come across carmen was on the car stereo when driving through spain on a family holiday when i was a teenager. i didn't pay much attention to it because i didn't like opera at the time and i didn't know any better. the story has been around for 150 years or so. do i feel i've missed out after seeing this movie? yes, mainly due to the plot, but also because if all the actresses who played carmen looked like paz vega, i would have all the adaptations happily sitting in my dvd collection.<br /><br />directed by vicente aranda (who also co-rewrote the story with joaquim jord`a), the story is told through the eyes of the original author prosper m'erim'ee, a french writer making his way through 19th century spain. he comes across jos'e (leonardo sbaraglia), a delinquent soldier and one of many men who fall in love with carmen (paz vega), a sultry, sexy, bedazzling gypsy woman, who has the mouth of the devil, the temper of a 'toro' and who recklessly leads men to their doom. the moment she meets jos'e, she is attracted by his stand-offish behaviour. but she hooks him, reels him in and lets him go, many-a-time. until one day, jos'e is wanted for murder. carmen persuades him to join her band of gypsy smugglers. they seem to be settling, she's fallen in love with him, but she meets the charming escamillo, the bullfighter. can jos'e hold his jealousy in check, or does it destroy him? <br /><br />it's a beautiful,seductive story, something that resembles, almost, a shakespearian or ovid plot, with the portrayals of immense passion and emotion that can make or break us and transform us to do things out of character. it's poetic, fiery, and above all, slutty. i was left hanging on, i didn't know which way it was going to turn. i always hoped that jos'e might change carmen's dirty little ways. i won't tell you if he succeeded or not.<br /><br />the above synopsis is what i took away from the film, but i was not impressed by the film itself. it was only after i watched it that i dug a little deeper into the story and i realised how much of a missed opportunity aranda had made of retelling m'erim'ee's classic. it was a shallow, slutty period-drama blunder, that saw paz vega spend a lot of the time partially or completely naked (not that i'm complaining about this in particular!).<br /><br />first of all, the acting was poor. i was not impressed by sbaraglia as jos'e. i'm still unsure whether he was a weak actor or jos'e was supposed to be a weak character, i've not read the book. he's supposed to be a man who with burning desire for carmen, but he spends much of the time looking confused, jealous and a bit dim. paz vega was slightly better as carmen. i was convinced by her hardened, wicked character, although i have seen more convincing performances by her in other films, such as zapping and lucia y el sexo. she seems too pretty to play a gypsy woman (not that i've come across many andalusian gypsy women), so in a way, the role didn't really fit her. the other actors in the film weren't great either. they seemed to do everything half-heartedly. the story is passionate, emotive
