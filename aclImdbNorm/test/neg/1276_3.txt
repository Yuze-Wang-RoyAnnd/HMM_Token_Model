if you're a kid liking fairy tale "real life" adventures, see it. if you're a youth liking kids movies, why not see it? :) if you're a parent going to see a movie with your kids, you're way better of opting for the squirrel!<br /><br />the start of this film was a bit funny, and set some good premises for the happenings to take place. but after the kind of funny introduction of characters, settings and potential conflicts, the story turned out kinda dull. when more or less the same things happen for the third and fourth time, the word "predictable" repeatedly comes to mind just like parts of a dented lp or those commercials you really hate. and the culmination of the plot... *oh sigh*... poor, poor, poor!
