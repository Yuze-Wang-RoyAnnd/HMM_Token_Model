not as bad as some people say...this is a unofficial bond movie and a remake of "thunderball", written by kevin mcclory (co- producer in "thunderball"). well, the cast is very very interesting, maria brandauer is a great bond- villain, kim basinger and barbara carrera are just like the "original" bond- girls, plus rowan atkinson and a truly great edward fox, who looks really refreshing in the "m" role. in fact, the whole movie is refreshing and gives some new impulses. sean connery does it once more confident and charming, except that he looks a little bit too old. but alright, he is the original bond and it was great to see him once more in this role. the locations are also typical- bahamas, france, etc. the only thing that really fails is the music score, the song "never say never again" is o.k., but the theme song is just missing. all in one, a nice try to make a difference from the comic and silly roger moore movies like "moonraker". only if there was another story, "thunderball" was a excellent movie and really did not needed a remake
