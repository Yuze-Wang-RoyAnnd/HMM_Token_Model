new year 2006, and i'm watching glimmer man again. say what you like, i find steven seagal's movies amusing. like many comments, good fight sequences - i particularly liked his answering of the phone at the restaurant saying how long it would be closed for restoration. bit like schwarzenegger's humour in the earlier action films - although that tended to be self-deprecating.<br /><br />but the one i like here is brian cox. one of the most versatile actors around. pity about his hand and foot, but so much for withstanding extended interrogation - must have flunked that class at the "farm".<br /><br />as the films went on i wonder just how the ever thickening girth of seagal affected his movement?. never mind, it's entertainment!.
