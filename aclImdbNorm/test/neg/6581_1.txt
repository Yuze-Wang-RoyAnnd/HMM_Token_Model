i am not kidding: there's a scene in this movie where a hobo hits his head on a tunnel keystone and explodes (with no fireball, though) into a million pieces! it made some kid in front of me scream in terror! ...in a g-rated film!<br /><br />this film might serve to convince children that santa clause is evil! his helpers are ugly, misanthropic, over-the-top and mean! when santa (here an anagram of satan!) appears, all 200,000 elves begin singing "santa clause is coming to town" as though it were a druid war chant. then, in the reflection of this movie's "rosebud" object (a jingle bell that whispers hints of why you can't hear it ringing: "doubt....doubt...)), old saint nick appears, looking like a stoic donald sutherland, his face glowing like moses' from "k10c". when we hear him speak, his thundering voice sounds less like a jolly old elf, and more like james earl jones' voice slowed-down about 20%. frightening!<br /><br />the syrupy music is out-of-place, boring and repetitive. it doesn't follow any emotional threads (as in "titanic's" very effective score). it just seems thrown in at certain points in order to generate feelings of warmth and magic. it fails to stir, partly because it doesn't match the imagery of the film. there are some musical train wrecks (no pun intended) where, out of nowhere, the eerie, symphonic score slams abruptly into happy, child-voiced polka about the title locomotive. it just makes the whole movie sound like it was rushed into production! <br /><br />finally, i agree with some other reviewers about how, well... "dead" everyone looks. it does seem a little macabre at times. the motion-capture technique is good for allowing the kings island-like roller-coaster train sequences to look convincing from a distance, but up close, "real" actors should have been used. overall, nice eye-candy for killing time in front of the tv, but not much else here.
