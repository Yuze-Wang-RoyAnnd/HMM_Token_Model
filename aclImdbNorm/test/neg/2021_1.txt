i'm at a loss for words. this movie is beyond description. i don't believe there is a language on earth that has a word that can describe how horrible this movie is. if you do attempt to watch it, be sure to stick around for the "suprise ending". i only made it about three quarters of the way through this piece of crap before i couldn't take it anymore. fortunately(or unfortunately) a couple of my buddies stayed till the end. when they woke up from their coma and after a couple of weeks of therapy they were able to fill me in on what i had missed. this movie has no story, no plot, horrible writing, and even worse acting. if you enjoy watching train wrecks or auto accidents then this film is for you. i think my iq dropped about 30 points from watching this (insert expletive here).
