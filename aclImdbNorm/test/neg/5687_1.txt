i knew it would be a bad movie when i rented it but i hoped for a good bad movie. oh well, had fun making fun of the endless sand trudging, eating camel dung (well, actually eggplant) and weird grimacing acting from i think it was about five actors. the dvd needs a director's commentary so that i can find out what he was thinking...or if he was at all. i can't believe they actually went to england, austrialia and wherever to film this...could have been done anywhere. would have been better if they had managed to get her naked. the best line of the movie? "he waiting for his upgrades." "yup, still waiting". now that was funny! if anyone had more than 3 pages of dialog (beyond the narrator....shut up already) then i'll watch it again.
