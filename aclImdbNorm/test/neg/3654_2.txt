this movie has the feel of a college project over it, who wants to do a blair witch project meets saw theme. but it isn't successful. the cinematography is poor, and the acting even more so. the characters, in my opinion doesn't come off as being credible at all. the editing of the film isn't really working as intended either. there are a lot of poor effects, which i believe are put in there to try and add a horrid effect. but to me it just gives me a feeling of indifference.<br /><br />i would stay away from this movie, unless you are a dedicated movie freak, who likes to watch "different" and indie "horror" movies. however, i believe this movie is not worth watching, for the average person. you will get no pleasure out of the poor effects, and the handycam feel, which this movie bestows on it's viewers.
