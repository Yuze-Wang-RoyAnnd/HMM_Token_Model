if i had to pick the most depressing movie, try to be suspenseful i've seen it'd be this one. i know about how good the original is supposed to be, it had better be better then this one. the movie's so dark and depressing but it isn't interesting to watch either-i've seen depressing "thriler" type movies that were saved because of the suspense to counteratc and balence the dark quality. vanishing didn't have that, this was so disturbing to watch to begin with and there was nothing positive to make this a classic type movie. i think another imdb poster got it right in saying this genre has just seen thrillers done in a far superior way. i completely agree-i would recommend skipping this one-maybe i'll watch the original some day but i doubt it. i give this a 2 out of 10.
