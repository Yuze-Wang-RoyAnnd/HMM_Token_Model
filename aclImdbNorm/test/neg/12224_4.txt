rko was trying to boost its starlet joan fontaine when they cast her as a flying nurse who is strong-willed enough to make a doctor (john beal) come to terms with running away from responsibilities in this little programmer. tcm aired it as a stepping-stone in the career of joan fontaine.<br /><br />fontaine is earnest and does an acceptable job, nothing more, and john beal is okay as her love interest. but it's obvious that philip huston (who has the appearance and cocky manners of a young james garner) is the actor who should have shared top billing with fontaine. whatever happened to this handsome actor? why didn't rko promote him, along with fontaine? he showed skill as a light comedian.<br /><br />these are the kind of thoughts that went through my head as i watched this rather tepid drama which never quite lives up to the stark promise of its title. the story itself is rather tiresome, only occasionally coming to life because of fontaine's spirited heroine.<br /><br />she photographs prettily as the nurse and wears her serious expressions skillfully, suggesting that there was more to be tapped at a future date. beal never did go on to a distinguished career and his performance here shows why. strictly lackluster.<br /><br />but whatever happened to philip huston? evidence here is that he should have had a worthwhile film career.<br /><br />trivia note: watch for dwight frye (of "dracula") as the out of control patient aboard the airplane.
