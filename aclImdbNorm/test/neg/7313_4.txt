the credits at the end read "all directed by shigeru izumiya". that's a fitting way to phrase it because it seems like filmed material from several projects were thrown together somehow, barely even attempting to make it all form one consistent work. it more felt like one of those music clip things that are marketed as feature films to cash in on those video commercials, just that here we have the marketable music and the live performances missing, except for one scene, which may as well be marketed as a weird music video clip in japan. whatever.<br /><br />it makes zero sense. visually it isn't too special either, although it has its moments (for example the female creature with the "death powder" who is strapped onto a bed base and some morphing sh!t throughout) and it certainly has an industrial-y feeling to it. usually i'd call the effects dilettantish but what this film offers in this regard is baffling more than anything else. you remember those cheap video effects from 70's and 80's music videos that make them look so dated, like a picture within a picture flying through the screen? there is quite a lot of these kind of effects in this, and without any apparent reason. the most half-assed seeming effort comes in the form of a picture collage. the pictures sort of look like album covers. whatever.<br /><br />i don't know what's up with the subtitles of the version i saw. the chinese ones (or whatever those hieroglyphics are) sometimes seem to show up when nothing is even said and the english ones often show up without the chinese ones. the english subs talk much about life without death (is it possible?), and a mind without a body, which provides what comes closest to a comprehensible conflict between characters in this film. one guy (a scientist dude) says that life without flesh is death while another guy (a metamorphosing dude) who claims his mind is beyond his body now that he got the "death powder" blown into his face and that he now knows the secrets of the flesh and whatnot; metamorphosing dude is visibly p!ssed off about the scientist dude's claim. whatever.<br /><br />erm, the end - all written by perception de ambiguity
