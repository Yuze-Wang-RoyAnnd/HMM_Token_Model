i first rented this movie on the infamous day of september 11, 2001. since then i've seen it a number of times. my only complaint is that it's too short. "strangeland" would've be a complete piece of horror art at two hours. as it stands, the running time is only an hour and a half.<br /><br />ex-twisted sister member dee snider wrote, produced and stars in this 1998 shockfest set in a small colorado town. he plays carleton hendricks, a crazed sadist who has psychotic ideologies on human evolution and a love for near-death experiences. hendricks is no pushover, he's a pumped up six-foot "modern primitive". someone who has tattooed and pierced their body to the very extreme. when he makes his first full appearance in the film, it is a truly terrifying sight.<br /><br />hendricks' main hobby in life is to share his "spiritual awakenings" with his kidnapped victims. he visits internet chatrooms under the name "capt. howdy" and then invites people over to his house. they believe they're going to a party. instead, they find themselves in a house of pain and suffering. hendricks sows their eyes and mouths shut and tortures them by sticking blades and hooks in numerous parts of their body. if it sounds sick, it's because it is.<br /><br />one of hendrick's victims is genevieve, the teenaged daughter of detective michael gage. gage not only manages to save her, but arrests hendricks as well. four years later, hendricks is released from a mental institution completely rehabilitated to the disapproval of the community. a group of rednecks led by freddy krueger himself, actor robert englund, decide to kill him. they fail and hendricks reverts back to his old self.<br /><br />the rest of the film i'll leave to you, only to say the conclusion is satisfying and will leave you in shivers. with the exception of snider, the acting isn't too good, but it's serviceable. the direction is okay, too. there are some humorous parts in "strangeland" and they are very funny. i also loved the soundtrack, it's awesome and worth buying if you love rock. overall, this is a movie worth watching. if you love low-budget horror films with a sense of humor, check it out. you'll probably like it.
