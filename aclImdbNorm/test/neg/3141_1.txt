looking for something shocking? okay fine... the imagery is that. that's about it. this film attempts to make deep connections with the audience through various symbolism and just ends up being annoying. i am not quite sure if the director's purpose was to truly portray some sort of deep message to his audience, or if he just sought to shock the hell out of them with gore, sex and violence. i am thinking that it was probably the first...but in the failed attempt..it simply ended up to be a piece of artsy garbage with lots of blood, some obnoxious characters, and an over reliance on religious symbolism. if you're looking for some independent film to critique for its attempted use of metaphor...have at it. if you are looking for a gore flick that will make you queasy and uncomfortable... here you go... if you are looking for a film that will irritate you to no end because you realize that in the end, the message was stupid...the movie was stupid... and you will never get those minutes of your life back..this is surely the film for you!
