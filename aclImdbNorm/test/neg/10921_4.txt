although charlie chaplin made some great short comedies in the late 1910's, others don't quite make it. examples like his new job and shanghaied come to mind, and i would also the floorwalker in this category.<br /><br />charlie gets mistaken for a manager of a department store (and vice versa). this manager tries to steal money from the cash register and make a run for it, and charlie is just an honest costumer but getting blamed for some missing objects, stolen by other costumers.<br /><br />there aren't many laughs in it, except for the last couple of minutes or so with some great scenes on the escalator. for the rest, quite disappointing.<br /><br />4/10.
