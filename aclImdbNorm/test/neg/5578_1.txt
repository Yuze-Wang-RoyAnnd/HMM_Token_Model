predator island starts as six friends, eric (tom dahl), chris (dan gordon) along with heather (iris mcquillan-grace), kim (iana baker) & denise (melissa roby) get invited to spend sometime on kevin's (michael wrann) father's boat partying in the open sea. what could go wrong with such a super sounding idea? well for starters a big green meteorite could crash into the sea near your boat & an alien life-force could emerge from it & try to kill all of you, then again that's just a ridiculously stupid idea, isn't it?<br /><br />co-edited, written & directed by steven castle i thought predator island was crap & it's a simple & straight forward as that really. the script is of the worst kind, you know the sort of abomination that's full of highly annoying teenage character's who do & say the most stupid things, it's full of clich'es & is utterly predictable, it makes next-to-no sense, things just suddenly happen without any build up or explanation, it's boring even at only 70 odd minutes & it has virtually no entertainment value whatsoever, not even unintentional laugh value. the film doesn't really have much of what i would call a plot, there's no explanation given as to why or how this alien creature can take over people's minds or why it can be selective in the sense that one moment the person will be 'normal' the next, when the story calls for it & with no apparent cause, they suddenly get green glowing eyes & a sudden urge to turn cannibal. there's not enough horror in it, the so-called action scenes are pitiful & i really don't want to waste another second thinking about predator island let alone wasting my precious energy typing these words...<br /><br />director castle doesn't do anything to make this thing watchable & the 'special effects' are absolutely terrible, this alien creature dude wouldn't even get into a 50's sci-fi film. the filmmakers even play some blooper footage over the end credits but this has to be the least funny collection of mistakes ever, i mean they can't even get it wrong right if you know what i mean! forget about any decent gore as there isn't any, there's a bit of cannibalism & some intestines placed on the unfortunate actors stomach so another unfortunate actor can pick them up & pretend to eat them.<br /><br />with a supposed budget of about $150,000 i have to concede that the filmmakers were working on a seriously low budget, that's still no excuse for making such a poor film. the whole thing looks very cheap & the acting is pretty bad.<br /><br />predator island is crap, i'm sorry but that's the way it is & i just fail to see what anyone would get out of it. in my humble opinion this probably one to avoid.
