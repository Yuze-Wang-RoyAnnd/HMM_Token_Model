i was excited at the concept of my favorite comic book hero being on television... and sorely disappointed at the end result.<br /><br />the only "amazing" thing was the wall crawling (despite the visibility of the cable). i didn't think nick hammond was peter parker... and he was visibly of a different build than the guy who did the stunts in the spider suit. you could tell they were two different actors.<br /><br />granted, i can also spot in the modern spider-man movies when i am looking at tobey macguire and when i am looking at cgi. but that is from a trained eye and experience working with cgi. still, the 70's version could have been better despite lack of special fx.<br /><br />the webs were hokey and looked like ropes that seemed to wrap around things rather than stick to them. and what was up with giving him a spider mobile to ride around in. hello? he's the web slinger people.<br /><br />sorry... didn't mean to get so worked up, but our beloved wall crawler deserved better.
