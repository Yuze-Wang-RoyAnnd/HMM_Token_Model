i could not stand the woman who played the mother. i wanted her to shut up. she had a bizarre manner of speaking and the lines she was given to read didn't make it any better. i had no idea why the men of the town were so taken with her to cause all these problems except that in a town populated by men she seemed to be the only woman over ten and under sixty. even after a terrible tragedy her voice was devoid of human emotion, she seemed to have no ability to grasp the events of her life. she delivered her lines with the same emotion whether she was saying "i love you", "i hate you", "the bank is foreclosing", "my dress is on fire". was this actually filmed in ireland? the sun blazed throughout the movie and the characters seemed surprised by a rain shower during the harvest. i lived in ireland during the summer of 2002, the wettest summer in a century. most everything was still harvested. if the farmers in ireland could only harvest during long dry stretches then the country would have starved hundreds of years ago. it seems as if there wasn't a lot of money to make the movie. the black and white flashbacks looked as if they were filmed with the security cameras one can get at sam's club.
