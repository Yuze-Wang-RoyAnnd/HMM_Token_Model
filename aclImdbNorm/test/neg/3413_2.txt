i've just seen this film in a lovely air-conditioned cinema here in bangkok. and since the temperature outside is hovering somewhere around 37c with very high humidity, my 100bt was not wasted.<br /><br />failing that, i haven't seen such a piece of extremely well-made junk in a long time. this is the kind of film that provides a test of taste, as it were. anyone who claims to like or love it goes immediately onto the same list of tasteless phonies who still go around talking about the superiority of british television. at least the gormless old broad in the wheelchair was good for a few guffaws.<br /><br />pseudo-profundity and fat lips, while characteristic of much french cinema, really do not a good movie make. i'd rather watch independence day 10 times in a row than sit through this stinker one more time.
