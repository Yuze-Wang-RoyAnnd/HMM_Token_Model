"my blue heaven" is boring. the plot is insipid; the characterizations and dialogue stink; the musical numbers, while occasionally staged in interesting ways, are not only too often absurd, but also lyrically trite, painfully bright, and emotionally hollow to the core. the leads, betty grable and dan dailey, are attractive professionals; however, in spite of their every talented effort to uplift the drear and uncompelling material, they fail. david wayne and jane wyatt, for all their demonstrated talent in other projects, are more or less cyphers here.<br /><br />there's really only one reason to watch "my blue heaven". one reason...one star: mitzi gaynor, in her film debut. her total screen time is probably less than ten minutes, but so what? her pert and promising screen personality, her feline beauty, and her exceptional charisma shine through gloriously and make these minutes the most watchable, memorable, and exciting moments in the entire film. if you would value an opportunity to see a tremendous young talent on the rise, then check out miss mitzi gaynor in "my blue heaven."<br /><br />incidentally, i scorn (and would urge you to avoid) drew casper's manic, obsessive-compulsive dvd commentary for this film. wordy, digressive, unduly fastidious, frequently ill-timed with what is playing on the screen, and galloping throughout with an excess of nervous energy, his comments are absolutely indigestible.
