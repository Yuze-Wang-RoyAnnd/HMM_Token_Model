why? why? why on earth no one tells the truth about this horrible, horrible movie? i still wake up in the morning and ask god why he didn't stopped me from seeing this revolting "comedy". i cant believe i paid to see this offense to my cinematographic taste. i'm starting to think that the 5 stars it has is because of martha higareda 's nudity and all the men who cant buy a porn film and avoid seeing this ... i will call it "thing" cause call it film is an insult to the mexican film industry. the characters are a huge clich'e, the acting causes involuntary laugh and the script is... well, i cant believe a human being wrote this. and just when you thought you've been tortured enough...the last half hour is so painful that i wished to ripped my eyes out. the only good thing i can say about this abomination is that it only last 90 minutes (that would feel like centuries, but still). really, avoid the pain!!!
