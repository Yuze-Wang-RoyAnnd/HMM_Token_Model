let's cut through everything in the first paragraph. "the messengers," the newest film by the pang brothers (danny and oxide), as a horror movie, is profoundly bad. and just as a movie in general, is a big disappointment. it's nothing but a rewarmed "sixth sense," and as long as that picture is still available, there is no reason on earth to pay money to see this turkey.<br /><br />lately, horror/slasher films such as the "final destination" series, "wrong turn," "boogie man," "the ring 2" and "the grudge," are becoming increasingly more reliant on big shocks with no payoff (for instance, something jumps out at the person on screen, elicits a gasp from the audience, but turns out to be a cat or a crow or something.) little goes into making it a genuine frightening experience like "the sixth sense," or "signs," or some of the classic horror movies of the 1940s, '50s and '60s.<br /><br />"the messengers" relies upon the same old, tired clich'es as these newer, far inferior films, and is therefor old, tired and - to my surprise - ended up as one of the most boring movies i have seen in awhile.<br /><br />the plot has another stupid family, led by dad roy (dylan mcdermott, "the practice"), mom denise (penelope ann miller, "awakenings," "kindergarten cop," tv series "desperate housewives"), big sis jess (kristen stewart, "zathura: a space adventure") and toddler ben (evan turner), who move to north dakota from chicago.<br /><br />the reason for the move is never really outlined here, but it has something to do with the dad's inability to find work and jess' drunken driving escapades. we know there will be trouble immediately because they move into a big gothic house in the middle of nowhere; a domicile that looks like the munster's summer home. oh, and the first five minutes of the movie show something really horrible happened there.<br /><br />jess hates the place (hey, who could blame her), but optimistic pop hopes to make a go out of raising sunflowers (despite the unusually large amount of crows fluttering about). but when he meets burwell (john corbet, "raising helen" and looking like kevin costner in the film version of "my name is earl"), an itinerant drifter and expert on raising sunflowers, things start to pick up.<br /><br />but then weird things begin to happen; jess is terrorized by a violent unseen force in the house (of course, no one else but the two-year-old ben can see it, so she's labeled a flake) and the crows keep hanging around. ben also is able to detect the unearthly creatures, but since he's two, he cannot articulate it. scene after scene of people telling the little boy to tell them what he sees finally had me wanting to yell to the screen, "he can't tell you! he's two - freaking' - years old!" yes, have the only protagonist who can solve all of these things be a mute toddler is real smart. <br /><br />anyway, we're left to ponder the sanity of jess; when and if ben will ever properly describe the paranormal visions he sees; if dad will make the sunflower thing work; if the high plains drifter is a good guy or bad; what the point of the george plimpton-looking realtor is; how a pitchfork plunged in the back can only be a flesh wound; what mom's role in the family is; and where are all the crows coming from.<br /><br />all of this while waiting and wondering for something - anything - to happen. the conclusion is really lame, as well, and once again begs the question of how a spirit which has no physical body can cause harm to a living person. very dull, pointless and most terrible of all, not frightening in the least.<br /><br />oh, and there are a lot of crows in this movie.
