as cute and adorable as they are, the story of three singing chipmunks just doesn't seem to have enough meat to it to sustain it for an hour and a half. i thought that the first half hour or so of this movie was well worth watching. it was fun, it had a few laughs in it, it was full of energy. then it somehow just lost that. i wouldn't even say it faded away, because it seemed quite abrupt to me. the fun was gone; the laughter disappeared. my daughter noticed it, too. she's 4 - she laughed uproariously several times in that first part of the movie, then her laughter stopped. perhaps it took on too serious a tone - the evil movie producer working the chipmunks to death. something happened, anyway, and it wasn't for the better.<br /><br />of course, the movie is trying to tell the story of how the chipmunks (alvin, simon and theodore) began. everyone knows the christmas song. here we discover how they met dave and got their start. the movie is updated to the present time, although their real origin is noted by dave's street address of 1958, which was the year when the animated singing rodents were first created. jason lee did a pretty good job as dave and the chipmunk voices were also pretty good. david cross as the evil ian irritated me to be blunt, and i couldn't figure out the point of the character of claire, played by cameron richardson. she added little to the movie. it's a movie you can watch with the kids - it's probably a movie you'd only want to watch with the kids, in fact. it gets a 4/10 from me.
