oldboy is set in korea & starts as a drunken dae-su oh (min-sik choi) is bailed out of the police station by his friend only to be abducted, dae-su wakes up & finds himself in a small room which he will be imprisoned in for the next fifteen years. dae-su is fed & looked after by his unknown captors but is never allowed out of the room, dae-su begins to train himself to avenge himself after he gets out which he intends to do by scrapping away the cement from the brickwork with a chopstick. however before dae-su finishes he is gassed & rendered unconscious, when he wakes up dae-su finds himself free on the roof of a tall building dressed & all moneyed up. dae-su instantly sets about trying to find out who imprisoned him, after meeting the pretty mido (hye-jeong kang) the two fall in love & together with her help dae-su finally finds what he is looking for but the truth comes at a price...<br /><br />this south korean production was co-written & directed by chan-wook park & has gotten any number of glowing reviews (the sort that distributors can pick quotes out & plaster them on the video box) & even won the grand prize of the jury at cannes while it was also nominated for the golden palm so surely oldboy is a true classic? well not for me it isn't since as i can't understand why it's so liked & i would go as far as to say i pretty much hated it apart from one or two isolated moments. for a start i couldn't get into the story at all, i just didn't like it as i thought it was slow & boring & while many out there would have you believe oldboy has the bestest most shocking twist ever i thought it was rather plain & not very well executed either. the ending in which dae-su goes to the new zealand alps to be hypnotised feels tagged on as well almost as if the makers wanted some sort of happy ending. at almost two hours i almost fell asleep i was so bored, the violence is tame & it's the thought of what's happening that i would imagine most people have a problem with rather than what is actually shown. in fact oldboy has a very low body count of about seven & one mild sex scene, it's really not that graphic or memorable. i didn't warm to any of the character's & while i accept oldboy has an alright concept & premise it fails to deliver & it's one film that i will never understand why so many people seem to like.<br /><br />based on a japanese manga of the same name oldboy the film looks alright, there's one or two nice visual moments here although while everyone raves about the hallway fight that takes place in one continuous shot i was pretty unimpressed & thought the fight choreography was quite dull. the actual on-screen gore violence amounts to very little, dae-su eats a live octopus which is apparently quite normal in korea anyway, there are some fight scenes, a severed hand, someones teeth are pulled out & there's a bit of blood at the end.<br /><br />the budget was supposedly around the $4,000,000 mark which is actually a fair bit, filmed in south korea & new zealand. the acting looks alright but it's hard to tell when actors are speaking a different language.<br /><br />oldboy is a film that i found an absolute chore to sit through, i don't mind subtitled films or foreign films or paying attention to the plot as i followed the thing perfectly but i just didn't like any of it & it's as simple & straightforward as that. apparently the second in director choi-wook park's revenge trilogy which also includes sympathy for mr. vengeance (2002) & lady vengeance (2005).
