kinda boring, kinda gross, kinda unsettling, this wasn't horrible, but not too good. there's a good creepy bit when the statue comes to life, though, props to this scene. not much happens, and the movie just feels sort of scummy. i was happy when it ended, and don't believe anything about this being a true story....very surprised this is averaging around 6.
