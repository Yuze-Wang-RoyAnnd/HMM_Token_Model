i usually really like lawrence and being in australia i haven't seen much of his stand up, so when i saw this at my video shop i thought, yeah i'll have a look. i wish i hadn't seen it now. obviously lawrence had a profound experience that opened up his mind, and i guess he wants to share this with others but this was neither the time nor the place.<br /><br />this whole experience seemed like a motivational speech in hell, it really did. i believe the catch phrase of the night was "ride it until the wheels fall off" which he intermingled with just plain lewd jokes revolving around sex and sexual organs.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, i don't mind crude humor, but lawrence lacks the gift of classing it up in the fashion of eddie murphy, richard prior or robin williams. lawrence was just plain lewd, the only time i laughed was when he relived his experience with the law and his recovery in the hospital. if there were minus points, i would give them....
