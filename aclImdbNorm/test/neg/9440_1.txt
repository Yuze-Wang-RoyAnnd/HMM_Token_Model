...i can't believe there are actually people here who recommend this movie... this is such a slow pos going absolutely nowhere. oh yeah ok it goes somewhere, but you see that coming from miles away. acting: really really bad, maybe the bartender was kind of ok. editing: bad! i suppose the editor was told "we need at least 90 minutes", cause half of all the scenes could have gone in the bin. music: don't get me started on that, the lousiest score i've ever heard. who is that singing in the last scene for crying out loud?? directing: oh my, imnsho david lynch sucks, but someone trying to copy him sucks even harder. skip this one.
