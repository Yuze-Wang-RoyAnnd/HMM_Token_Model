american graffiti is one of the best movies ever made. i've seen it at least 30 times and am emotionally affected by it each time i see it. (i graduated from high school in 1962.) <br /><br />however, more american graffiti is one of the worst movies ever made.<br /><br />it is hard to believe than anyone associated with the great original movie was involved with this terrible sequel. the part of the movie set in vietnam was extremely inaccurate. (i served 18 months in vietnam with the 101st airborne division.) <br /><br />the whole movie had nothing worthwhile in any part of it.<br /><br />if anyone ever wants to make a case against making sequels to great movies, more american graffiti would be the prime example of what can go wrong.
