i was really looking forward to watching this film. it had all the ingredients of a great tongue in cheeker, but it just didn't come together at all. kevin spacey's accent was tolerable except that sometimes he forgot to use it and i would rather not have had to listen to linda fiorentino's pale attempt. she and helen baxendale were totally lacking in charm and personality, thankfully their screen kids had loads, so you could find at least some members of his 2 families endearing. you could have strained spaghetti with the plot and i'm sure that the script was written by some adolescent schoolboy in a high school english competition. that said, when i wasn't cringing, i was smirking so it wasn't a totally wasted 90 minutes. i did find the superimposing of kevin's face on the painting very clever and quite funny. maybe i'm being a bit harsh but i was expecting a bit of quality viewing and it just never came.
