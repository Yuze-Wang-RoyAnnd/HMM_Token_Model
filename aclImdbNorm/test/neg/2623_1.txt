thank god i was not operating any heavy machinery, it could have been an even worst disaster. shots were slow & very repetitive. different scenes, same shots, medium shot, medium shot, medium shot, snooze. story line was rather empty. william hurt was the worst. where did he get that stupid accent from? random shots of scenery just to include them really didn't add much. there were more shots of arbour traveling in her car than anything else. the direction really didn't take us into any of the scenes & it also didn't make me feel for any of the characters. i would have rated it a zero if imdb had the option. great sedative if you can't sleep. there went 2 hours of my life i will never get back.
