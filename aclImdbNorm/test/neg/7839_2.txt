this is not a good film.<br /><br />i can usually sit through a van damme movie if i have to, as they are usually a bit of a laugh and don't require much thought. this one has no redeeming features. <br /><br />it has a distinct lack of plot, humour, acting, direction etc etc. a real stinker on all levels. <br /><br />i have never walked out of a cinema during a movie, although i came damme close here. <br /><br />avoid at all costs.
