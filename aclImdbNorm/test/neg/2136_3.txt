warning: may contain spoilers<br /><br /> the ripples in the wake of the first "jaws" movie were still prominent in the 1980s as well as beyond. movie monsters went from being radioactive monstrosities to unknown and voracious beasts lurking in the unexplored corners of human experience (ie: the ocean, deep space, genetics). although "jaws" was a milestone in this particular realm of film horror, few films have been able to match the visceral impact of the original. "shark rosso nell'oceano" (aka devil fish or red ocean), is a dutiful follower of the original "jaws" formula. after several hapless boats and seagoers are brutally murdered by some ocean creature, there is an initial drive to discover the beast, then a failure to study it without horrible results, and a final push to destroy it. although the filmmakers attempted to inject some fresh life into the equation by adding elements of technology and corporate conspiracy, the result is nothing short of disastrous. this movie sinks under its own weight of ghastly editing, brittle acting, and cheap scares.<br /><br /> the most sickly compelling feature of "devil fish" is its cookie-cutter editing. from the onset of the film when 3 different scenes are mashed together, the viewer gets a sense that the film lacks any technical credibility. it appears as if the editors cut the scenes around a set musical score instead of cutting the film and then making necessary changes to the music. furthermore, every cut is an intercut and it would appear as if the editors had never heard of the terms "fade", "wipe", or "dissolve". the impact of scenes can never settle in because they are immediately cut short after a final line and a new scene begins. silly camera tricks abound such as when two of the principle characters share a private moment on the beach and a sort of time-lapse image of their act is composited over their bodies.<br /><br /> the music is equally bland. the creature theme is a hopeless duplicate of the "jaws" theme with slight variation. although i like to keep my reviews devoid of mst3k influence, mike most aptly described the somber score as "soft core porn music". failing to produce tension in a film that relies so heavily on it is a death blow to "devil fish". the acting is stale, the relationships baffling, and the whole conspiracy is laughable. the question remains that if genetics had advanced to such a level to create a huge chimera of a sea monster to protect oceanic interests, why couldn't a more practical use be administered to better mankind? one of the few positive aspects of this film is the idea of the monster, even though its film presence is less than stellar.<br /><br /> overall, this movie is bad enough to dip below mediocre. if "jaws" had never been made, then the film could be described as average because its subject matter would be new and exciting even if it was executed ineffectively. sadly, as a carbon copy of spielberg's original thriller it sits most comfortably on a garbage heap of cheese.
