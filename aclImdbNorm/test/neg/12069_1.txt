camp blood <br /><br />aspect ratio: 1.33:1 (nu-view 3-d)<br /><br />sound format: mono<br /><br />whilst hiking in woodland near the deserted camp blackwood - site of an unsolved murder ten years earlier - four young city-dwellers are targeted by a masked psychopath who kills their guide (courtney harris) and stalks them through the woods with murderous intent...<br /><br />low-rent time-waster, filmed on camcorder utilizing the nu-view field sequential 3-d format. there's a plot, at least, but the script adheres closely to an established blueprint (with obvious nods to the likes of "friday the 13th", "the burning" and "the texas chain saw massacre") without adding anything even remotely new or interesting to the formula. director brad sykes - also responsible for similar 3-d efforts like the zombie chronicles (2001) and bloody tease (2002) - cites the early works of george a. romero and sam raimi as key influences on his career, but while those filmmakers challenged the mainstream with their no-budget efforts, sykes uses video technology merely to imitate his cinematic heroes, resulting in a home movie with delusions of grandeur. aside from the 3-d format, there is nothing here to warrant anyone's attention. followed by camp blood 2 (2000).
