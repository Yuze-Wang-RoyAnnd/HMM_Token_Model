this is one cheap looking movie! a stripper keeps getting attacked and raped by zombies and no one believes her. she goes to the police who also rape her. she finally finds a kid who was also attacked by the zombies and they trace the zombies back to 'the zombie master'. the fact that stephanie beaton stars as the stripper is the only reason to watch this film.
