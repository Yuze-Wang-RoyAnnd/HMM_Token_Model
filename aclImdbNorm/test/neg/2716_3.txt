tacky, but mildly entertaining early 90's soft core comedy features xena (sarah bellemo), luna (tamara landry), and sola (nicole posey), as three outer-space teenagers. xena's parents have gone on vacation for a couple of days. following some persistent persuasion from her friends, xena agrees to take her father's spaceship for a ride. the end result? they wind up running out of gas in space, and crash-land on planet beta 45, aka earth. meanwhile, teenagers dave (michael todd davis) and jerry (ken steadman) have come to california to stay the summer with dave's uncle bud (joe estevez ) a beach bum who lives right on the beach. the three of them wind up meeting our three space girls who have walked away from the crash without a scratch. uncle bud is about to be thrown out from his soon-to-be-condemned beach pad thanks to sally (linnea quigley), who lives right up the hill and used to be in a relationship with bud. she's also a bikini magnate, and is trying to win a bikini design contest to the tune of, $30,000....exactly what bud would need to fix up his property, so the girls decide to try to win the prize for him. and that's about it, folks. knowing that their paper thin plot was barely enough to sustain a feature length movie, the filmmakers subject us to scene after scene of endless beach parties featuring tons of extras gyrating their half naked bodies in the scorching sun. oh, and lets not forget the sex. there's quite a deal of it. before i go any further, i need to put this movie in context. it was released in 1993, long before the advent of such soft core labels such as surrender cinema and seduction cinema. compared to these newer, edgier, more explicit movies, the soft core movies of the 90's sure seem somewhat mild. when beach babes from beyond first came out in 1993 from the full moon offshoot torchlight entertainment, it was heralded as the debut release of a label that specialized in "mature audiences" type films. needless to say, the times have changed. this particular film genre has gone from a few steamy, but brief sex scenes and fleeting glimpses of female full frontal nudity to extended sex scenes that occasionally threaten to venture into the realm of hardcore. looking at beach babes from beyond again after viewing it upon its 93' release, it's safe to say that if this same film were to be made today, there would be a hell of a lot more emphasis on the sex scenes and less time spent on plot and dialog. as for the sex scenes themselves, they tend to run hot-and-cold. our three space girls waste no time in getting comfortable with the boys that evening. so each couple gets a soft core scene, complete with annoying slow motion camera work and too dark lighting. they're really not that horrible, and are surprisingly graphic in a few spots, especially the scene between xena and jerry that takes place in the back of a trailer. but the one sex scene that really leaves a lasting impression, and causes you to be surprised in its overall intensity, occurs quite early on in the film. sally is attending a topless photo shot with three of her models posing by a pool. all of the actresses in this scene are beautiful gorgeous, but nikki fritz stands out from all the two due to her enormous presence. remember that this point in her career she had yet to achieve the type of enormous popularity that soon would follow. her posing nude by a pool leads to an unforgettable fantasy sequence where she shows her soapy body in a tub and then again when walking away from her bath. walking toward the bed towards a nearly nude pumped up guy in the waiting, we get a full length complete nude scene with her almost heart shaped rear end and perfectly shaped back. it's good that nikki's back is so muscular as it is about to get a pretty good workout. nikki spends the next few minutes completely nude with a hunky guy in a variety of positions in a scene that is filmed completely differently than the three other lovemaking scenes. no dark lighting or annoying slow motion here...just two actors in one enormous bed sans sheets and covers who seem at time to be barely acting at all. nikki's ecstatic body language just goes to prove that few other actresses seem to enjoy filming sex scenes as much as she does. it's really the only time where beach babes from beyond truly delivers the goods. but even without this spectacular scene, i am mildly recommending this film just for the fact alone that it's fairly watchable and never dull no thanks to an incredibly energetic and attractive cast, many of whom would show up in various direct to video features in the remainder of the decade.
