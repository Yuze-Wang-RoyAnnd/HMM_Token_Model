a brazilian cable television is presenting "yadon ilaheyya" this month in its "cult" channel. i saw the trailer and listened to the advertisement, and decided to see this movie. indeed it is an absurd boring pretentious dumb pointless disconnected crap about the conflict in the middle east, and together with "soultangler", they certainly are the worst movies i have tried to see. i really wasted forty-three minutes of my life watching the first half of this crap, highly indicated for torturing enemies. how can this movie be awarded and nominated to prizes inclusive in cannes? my vote is one (awful).<br /><br />title (brazil): "intervenc~ao divina" ("divine intervention")
