my ratings: acting - 3/10 suspense - 2/10 character attachment - 1/10 plot - 2/10 character development - 2/10 overall - 2/10<br /><br />this show sucks very much officially. for me, csi miami is the best, csi ny 2nd and csi 100th. i don't know, in the other csis you get into the episode you're watching. but in this one, you just can't get into the episode, no matter how much you try, so in my opinion, this show is not worth watching. i know people have different opinions, and i respect that, but for me, this csi ain't good enough. so if you like suspense, real acting/performance, good plot, direction, character development/attachment and you an overall good show, i suggest you to watch csi miami.
