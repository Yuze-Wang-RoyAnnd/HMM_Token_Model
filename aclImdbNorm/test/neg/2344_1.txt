i watched this film on telly the other night and little did i know what a cringe-fest it would be...i knew it would be stupid but not this bad! this film exemplifies everything that is awful in australian comedy. apart from the most tedious, uninspired scenarios and characters i have ever come across (aside from those dubious french produced american tax break comedies!), most of the situations were boring, unbelievable, stereotypical and so not funny just...terrible! <br /><br />one such scenario that really annoyed me was the nerds on the bus scene. from a screen writing perspective the writers used the most uninteresting - not to mention unbelievable - scenario to get these three stranded without their luggage...they are on the holiday of their lives and they're going to risk it all (including a $300 deposit, luggage and room) to exert their rights to dance on a bus? i mean, they're about half an hour away from their destination! at least they could have had the bus driver kick them off but, no they leave willingly cos 'they can't take it anymore!'and wreck their holiday...anyway, i can't believe the writers didn't workshop this appalling scenario out. i think a ten year old could come up with 5 set-ups more clever, funny and believable.<br /><br />i can go on with many others - the really unimaginative stereotypical psychopath, the whole relationship with the angry jilted girlfriend and tag along virgin, the 'wow man! out there goth girl' inhaling stuff on the train - everything was just woeful! i cannot think of one redeeming feature of the this film except that maybe the third wheel nerd was kind of cute. spoilt his career by appearing in this trash though!
