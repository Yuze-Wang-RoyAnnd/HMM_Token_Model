totally brain-dead actioner made in the philippines. this belongs to the mode of filipino movies which tried to pass themselves as american films on the international market. after a rather dull beginning, the movie takes off and never disappoints again. it is actually a rip-off of the worst movies chuck norris ever made : an american prisoner in vietnam is brainwashed by the soviets who implant a microchip in his brain so he is programmed to kill the pope, then the president of the usa. one of his old buddies (played by b-movie stalwart max thayer) is sent to stop him. utterly ridiculous action scenes, putrid acting (nick nicholson's performance as the evil soviet commander is a must-see!)and implausible plot make up for one of the cheesiest action pictures ever bestowed in the general public.
