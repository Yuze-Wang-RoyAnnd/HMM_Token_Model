"the patriot" staring steven segal is a late 90's thriller/action movie that is not really a thriller and not really an action movie; rather it is steven segal playing steven segal by another name, but this time he is a native american country doctor who kicks butt every now an again. baring the obvious plot line holes, the movie itself is absolutely amazing in terms of the blatant disregard for character devolvement. <br /><br />from a marketing standpoint, i was left asking myself, "who in the world were they aiming at?" the bio-thriller plot-line is way off the mark for the middle america crowd and segal as silk cowboy would never sell to anyone even if you deep fried him and put him between a kripsy-cream donut. the whole movie is just way out there, even for segal fans, because it simply does not deliver on any level.
