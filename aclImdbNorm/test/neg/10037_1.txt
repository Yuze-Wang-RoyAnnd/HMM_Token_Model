in addition to the fact that this is just an abysmally made film (imagine giving a camcorder to the average high school drama club) the people who think that there is anything "real" about this legend need to grow up. this is the 21st century. guess what: ghosts don't exist. most people learn that from their mother when they're about 5 years old. you guys seriously need to grow up.<br /><br />the fact that a fraud was perpetrated nearly 2 centuries ago does not make it any less a fraud. the fact that a large number of inbred hillbillies from tennessee believe it doesn't do it either. go to college. or at least finish high school.
