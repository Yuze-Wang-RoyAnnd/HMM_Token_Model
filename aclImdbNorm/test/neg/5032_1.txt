i saw this film yesterday on tv. i had just finished reading the book in which the movie was supposedly based. in the opening credits it said "this is a free adaptation of eca de queir'os' novel". i should have turned off my tv at that moment.<br /><br />vera sacramento's idea of "free adaptation" is turning a story about church's influence over people and the hypocrisy of people claiming morality at the end of the 19th century into a story about sex. in fact, the only thing she adopted from the novel was the sex part, which was only mildly referred in eca de queir'os' novel. and, of course, the name of some characters.<br /><br />as of the characters, in the novel, am'elia and jo~ao eduardo were victims of church's influence. am'elia was seduced by father amaro and all the time she was controlled by him. jo~ao eduardo, her fianc'e, was excommungated by the priests, because he dared to criticize them. in this movie, am'elia seduces every one she meets and father amaro is just another victim. jo~ao eduardo is a dealer of drugs and illegal weapons.<br /><br />vera sacramento has turned a novel which criticized moral costumes of an epoch and turned it into just another movie with lots of (bad) sex. even worse, her story was completely empty of ideas. two wasted hours! eca de queir'os surely did not deserve this.
