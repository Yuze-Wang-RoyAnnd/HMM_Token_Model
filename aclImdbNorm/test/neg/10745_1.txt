dear mr dante, <br /><br />dude, seriously... the title of the show is "masters of horror". and be that as it may, it is supposed to be an opportunity to show of your horror chops, to show the world why you deserve to be called a "master" of the genre. appearantly you misunderstood the exercise. appearantly you thought it was your opportunity (or worse, your duty) to educate the american public on your political beliefs. and your attempt comes off as disgusting, overbearing, and above all preachy.<br /><br />the only reason anyone marked your short as a high score is because their political views match yours and they are the type of people that don't mind having that sort of politics shoved down their throat.<br /><br />i, on the other hand, don't give a damn what you believe, they believe, or i believe... i just want such obvious (not subtle) and unfunny (not satire) messages out of my horror. and while there were certainly other "masters of horror" that were big time disappointments or where i was just generally confused why that director (william malone?) would be considered a genre "master"... yours fails far beyond the rest for just missing the entire point of the series.<br /><br />so next time... can you please just keep your preachy politics to yourself?
