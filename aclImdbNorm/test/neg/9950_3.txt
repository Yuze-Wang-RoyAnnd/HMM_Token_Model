the mad monster starts in dr. lorenzo cameron's (george zucco) laboratory as he perfects his discovery of how to turn a human being into a vicious wolf like monster by injecting animal blood into a human subject who happens to be his dim-witted servant petro (glenn strange), apparently he plans to put the serum at the disposal of the war department who will use it to create an unstoppable army of these monsters, the ultimate soldier! however, first things first as dr. cameron has his sights set on some sweet revenge on the people who dismissed his experiments, forced him to resign & subjected him to public ridicule. dr. cameron puts his plan into action & uses his monstrous creation to murder professor blaine (robert strange), in an unfortunate turn of events dr. cameron is unable to control the beast & is spotted by a local farmer jed harper (eddie holden) who spreads the news like wildfire, in another unfortunate coincidence a reporter named tom gregory (johnny downs) gets wind of the story & starts to investigate, he starts to suspect dr. cameron & since gregory is going out with his daughter lenora (ann nagel) he has plenty of opportunity to sniff around...<br /><br />directed by sam newfield this is really low budget stuff from the 40's, even worse it's dull unoriginal low budget stuff. the script by fred myton drags the extremely thin premise out to almost 77 minutes which is far too long, there is no variety in the story & it's basically the same thing over & over. the character's are dull clich'es, the mad scientist who conducts pointless experiments that create a monster, the fragile pretty daughter, the reporter who plays the hero & by pure coincidence happens to both be investigating the mysterious deaths said mad scientist is responsible for & is romantically involved with his daughter, the dumb servant, stupid idiotic police & stereotypical shotgun wielding farmers who are always accused of being drunk. this was probably clich'ed even back in 1942! the film plods along at a fairly slow pace & director newfield never manages to maintain or generate much in the way of excitement or atmosphere which is a bad thing. technically the film isn't great, obviously the budget was minuscule & the mad monster itself looks lame resembling an old homeless wino who hasn't shaved for a few weeks & has had a pair of plastic joke shop fangs placed in his mouth. the black and white cinematography is basic & static like most films from this period while the good dr. cameron's laboratory consists of a couch & a table with a few sorry pieces of scientific equipment on top. the acting is stiff & wooden with petro looking like he's on dope throughout the entire film, zucco as the mad scientist doesn't convince & is forgettable. the mad monster is a pretty lame horror film, there is very little here to entertain although at least i made it through to the end in a single sitting which when i think about it is a bit of an achievement in itself!
