it was (foolishly) with some degree of relish that i sat down to watch what a friend had promised would be the worst/best movie experience of my life, the mighty 'roller blade 7'. 2 years on and i'm still in therapy. oh yes my dear friends it really is that bad. they obviously got about 40 minutes of footage in the can and then decided to use said footage endlessly and repeatedly to brain-numbing effect. my only fear of the kind of post-apocalyptic world featured in this turkey is that somehow, some way, a print of this abomination would survive. truly the living would envy the dead.
