i had watched this as a kid but, not being much of a jerry lewis fan, i had completely forgotten it (not that it's in any way memorable). the film revolves around impersonation (which seems to be in the curriculum of every comic star!) - in this case a german officer - and, while not as bad as leonard maltin claims (awarding it a bomb rating), it's not exactly classic stuff either - certainly leagues behind chaplin's the great dictator (1940), even if comparably narcissistic! ironically, the scenes prior to the appearance of the would-be wacky general offer more felicities than the rather forced humor at nazi expense! <br /><br />the film was really lewis' last gasp during his heyday; in fact, this proved to be his last vehicle to be released for 10 years (it's painfully apparent here that his particular brand of foolishness wouldn't pass muster in the age of mel brooks and woody allen)!
