boy oh boy, does this movie stink. this movie is one of the worst pieces of trash i have ever seen in my whole entire life. please, even if your life depends on it, do not, and i repeat: do not under any circumstances, view this horrid piece of garbage. only watch this thing when it comes on as a mst 3000 episode. that was the only way i could sit through the whole thing. if i had to watch it without that show, i would've stopped watching it before it was over. it does have one use: a cure for insomniacs!!!!!
