the plot was not good.<br /><br />the special effects weren't.<br /><br />the acting was... not very good at all.<br /><br />like others, i felt there were numerous holes in the plot that you could fly, well, a space shuttle through.<br /><br />i thought the ending was rather unbelievable.<br /><br />by the way guys, about the "blow torch in space".<br /><br />blow torches have their own supply of oxygen (hence the name "oxy-acetylene torch"). two hoses run from the torch: one to an acetylene bottle and one to an oxygen bottle.<br /><br />so a "blow torch" would work just fine in space.
