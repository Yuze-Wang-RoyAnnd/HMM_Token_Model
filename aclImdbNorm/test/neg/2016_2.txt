a space ship cruising through the galaxy encounters a mysterious cargo ship apparently adrift in space. the crew investigates, hoping to lay claim to its cargo and acquire the ship. however, once aboard the ominous vessel, their own ship mysteriously disengages, leaving them to fend for themselves and battle none other then count dracula or orloff as this creature calls himself.<br /><br />not a bad start. i mean it follows any number of typical sci-fi/horror plots. the genres have been around enough that even the most original story will inevitably invoke comparison to some other film. but, when you start with a fairly typical horror convention, the legend of dracula and vampires in general, and combine it with a fairly typical sci-fi convention, a crew happening upon something and becoming marooned to battle whatever they're forced to confront, the filmmakers better have some clever up their sleeve to imprint their own mark on the familiar genre staples.<br /><br />director darrell roodt, who also wrote dracula 3000 with ivan milborrow, is primarily responsible for this utter failure. so, no, roodt and milborrow have nothing up their sleeves but their arms.<br /><br />this film begins ominously enough, with a very poorly delivered voice over by caspar van dien, essentially providing enough exposition to explain who the crew on his ship are. i should also point out that van dien's character is named van helsing. and, oh so very cleverly, this orloff character is from planet transylvania in the carpathian system. no kidding. i mean, come on guys, we get it. and, again, don't be goofy and use such names unless you got something special in store.<br /><br />so, after van helsing's introduction of the crew, we have, essentially, a film about this crew trapped in a space ship with a vampire lurking about.<br /><br />i'm a very forgiving viewer when it comes to low budget films. occasionally, they can be brilliant, see raimi's first two evil dead films. dracula 3000 had a decent budget, enough for some decent special effects and for the salaries of 3rd stringers like, van dien, erika eleniak, coolio, etc. however, unlike, the evil dead flicks, there is no talent behind the camera. in front of the camera, the talent is marginal, but i'm going to give the actors some benefit of the doubt. it really seems like they don't know what to do. the best actor of the bunch, alexandra kamp-groenveld, gets killed off quickly and the ever-enjoyable udo kier is reduced to being an exposition vehicle for the viewer as the deceased captain we hear and see via a video journal. grant swandby is also okay as the professor, but it's hard to take seriously a scientist in the year 3000 who wears glasses and rides a wheel chair. and, yes, it's a wheel chair as in there is nothing futuristic about it. as for the rest of the actors, well
