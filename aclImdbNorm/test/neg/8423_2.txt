so what is one to do if you are a porno star with fading looks? i know, become a pop star! this documentary - and i use the term loosely - follows the trials and tribulations of colton as he tries to transform himself from a gay porn star into a singer of electronic (read: dance) music. i only wish mr ford's voice was as muscular as his arms...sorry to say his vocals are painfully thin. there isn't much interesting going on here but mr ford and friends are eye candy.<br /><br />see him record a song that sounds exactly like every other mindless dance tune. see him travel to new york to make "connections." see him go back to l.a. with little success. see yourself look in the mirror and ask, " why am i wasting time watching this mess?"
