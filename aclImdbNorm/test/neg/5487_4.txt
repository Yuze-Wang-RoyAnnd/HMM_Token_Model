i liked all the lilo and stitch movies. the tv series weren't that great, but i put my opinions of the series aside when i watched this movie. and i must say... it was bad.<br /><br />one thing i found disappointing was the animation. yes, you heard it. the animation. i found its quality greatly degraded since the first movie. its quality was only as high as the tv series', something which i did not expect at all. if you're looking for eye candy, don't expect anything much here. also, the animation failed to portray any serious moods. even in the supposed sad scenes, i didn't feel anything for the character, another downgrade from the first movie.<br /><br />the next, was the absolutely horrible voice acting. i found it very, very unconvincing, and wondered why, disney, with all its riches and glory, couldn't afford voice actors with real talent. the voice actors' skill were just as annoying as the one in the series. i tolerated the one in the series because, hey, who wouldn't be tired out when made to voice act for so many episodes? heck, i don't even know how many episodes there are (theoretically, there are 624, but i just can't believe that). however, i thought that the voice acting would improve in the movie, and i was put down in the face by the truth, that what they could do in the series was already their best.<br /><br />next, was the horrible script. it was cheesy beyond redemption, and the writers just try too hard. they try to put some jokes in, but i just found them annoying. maybe it wasn't the voice acting, but the cheesy dialogues that ruined the sound section. (on the upside, the soundtrack wasn't too bad, and matched the mood quite well.) <br /><br />fourthly was the problem with the storyline. i predicted everything, and the storyline was what made the characters so unoriginal and unlikeable all of a sudden. you have the aliens get new positions and responsibilities inouter space. after the initial hype, they realize that they actually didn't like it and miss their old life. <br /><br />meanwhile, the evil villain gets broken out of jail after a very 'action packed' action scene and breaks in to jumbaa's lab to steal his experiment. the experiment was then cloned into 100 others and the hamster wants to conquer earth. when the main characters find out, they try to stop the evil hamster but gets confronted in some cheesy final showdown against the experiment and owns him in an extremely lame excuse for trying to make the series to look cool. the characters then give up their new privileges and return to earth to resume their life. seriously, how many other movies has used that ending already? the that storyline was extremely short and formulaic, so don't expect too much from it.<br /><br />so disney has failed in sound, graphics and storyline. the only charm of the series was the original characters, and how they managed to retain the 'feel' of the characters, but even that wasn't able to save the movie. i tried to like it, i really did, but i give it a rating of 4/10. another disney failure.
