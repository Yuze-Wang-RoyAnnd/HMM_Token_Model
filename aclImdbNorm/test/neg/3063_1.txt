some people may remember ms. russell from films such as "black widow", which had some appeal and critical acclaim. boy, she must have really needed a rent check when she signed on to do this dog.<br /><br />yes, there will be those who like the gratuitous violence and nudity. but one must sit back and wonder, in retrospect, what possessed anyone to spend money and time to make this in the first place. i just saw this movie on one of the "hbo's", and i can't believe they picked it up.<br /><br />in 1996 ms. russel didn't have the physical attractiveness she did earlier in her career. but, come on! having her play ma barker??? her "sons" all look like they could be her brothers. it's also creepy in that you think there are going to be incestuous relationships occurring (thank goodness there aren't, hope that doesn't count as a spoiler). with eric roberts and alyssa milano added into the cast, this one is b-movie 'straight to video' all the way.<br /><br />the scenes between purvis and ma barker, either in person or on the phone, are a primer in terrible, terrible acting. oh, wait, i forgot terrible, terrible writing as well. chalk this one up to experience. a bad experience.
