this movie is bad. just bad. in absolute terms, bad. <br /><br />the dialog jumps off the screen and slugs you in the face with its thoroughly artificial banter, and then defecates on your ability to detect even trace amounts of subtlety. <br /><br />racism is bad. racism in los angeles can be especially bad. i live in the city of angels, i can attest to that. what is so terrible about the bigotry in los angeles is its insidious nature. it creeps at you with a knowing glance, or a swallowed word. until just at the edge of a full on fist-fight, it almost never comes right out and says, "why did he have to be black!" <br /><br />i can see quite clearly that the car-jackers are black, the detective's partner is hispanic, the da is white. as long as there is film rolling through the projector, i can let the visuals, music and words take me to that conclusion without just telling me the conclusion. characters emote, and we read between the lines to make the connections and conclusions. <br /><br />that is a partnership and trust between filmmaker and audience. that trust is raped by this movie. <br /><br />a good film pulls you in directions as an audience, and it steers you with cues to drive to a point. this movie beats you down with its point and insults you and your intelligence along the way. my unanswered question is, why did we as a society say collectively, "thank you?"
