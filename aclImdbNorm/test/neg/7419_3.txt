one minute into the untold and it`s already ripped off techniques from the blair witch project and predator . does this mean we`ll be seeing lots of trees ? we sure will . will we be seeing an austrian bodybuilder blowing things up ? well this film has the budget of a tvm so the answer is a resounding no . does anyone like these soft porn shows like bedtime stories ? good because there`s a scene in this that resembles these type of shows . unfortunately the only thing you see is cellulite . do you like it when the screen fades to black during a tvm ? great because this happens between every scene in the untold . in fact it happens during every scene too . did you enjoy millionaire - a major fraud ? fantastic because one of the characters looks like a bearded major charles ingram the contestant who tried to swindle the show out of one million pounds . seriously one of the characters looks like major ingram . i kept expecting him to say " it`s bear. it could be a bear . but it might be a bigfoot < cough , cough > , yes it`s a bigfoot < cough > , it`s definately a bigfoot < cough > yes i`m going to shoot it . final answer chris " <br /><br />oh and have i mentioned that all the above are the good bits ?<br /><br />the untold isn`t the worst bigfoot movie i`ve ever seen , that accolade firmly goes to night of the demon which i saw over twenty years ago and i think i`ve only seen less than a dozen films that are worse in all of that time . but that said the untold is still a very poor film in just about every aspect , especially editing . as some other reviewers have pointed out it feels like whole chunks of the film are missing while there`s other bits where scenes are spliced together in the wrong order . this is a really bad film that deserves far less than its rating of 5.1. i give it 3 out of ten and i`m being very kind
