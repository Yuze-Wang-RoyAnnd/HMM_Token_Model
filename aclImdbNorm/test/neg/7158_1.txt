the theatrics and the drama included in the movie is fantastic, but the facts and the research is far from solid. when quoting dr. bovon, where the documentary tries to establish a connection to mary magdalene from mariamene, dr. bovon later clarifies it should be used for literary purposes (ie: fables of that time) not for a historical figure. in fact he states, he does not believe the mariamene ossuary in talpiot is mary magdalene. he further comments on his public letter, that he was not informed that his words would be used for this documentary but rather for information regarding acts of philip (a literary work in the 4th century).<br /><br />so what we have here is a director that took one clip for a 4th century acts of philip fantasy and used it specifically to support a 1st century ossuary inscription. a very sad stretch and dr. bovon calls the jesus/mary magdalene connection as "science fiction" -- as this documentary should be rightly labeled.
