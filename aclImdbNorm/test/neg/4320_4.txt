this movie is watchable, but nothing special. four girls on a road trip to vegas foolishly decide to pick up a hitchhiker (because he is cute). they all end up staying the night at a motel in the middle of nowhere, and the hitchhiker's psychotic issues with women become apparent.<br /><br />the characters are clich'es--there is a married, responsible woman; a slutty party girl; an unsure bride-to-be; and a man-hater who just got dumped. the hitchhiker is genuinely nice until he goes crazy.<br /><br />there's not nearly enough gore, and way too much rape. i enjoy slasher horror/thrillers a lot, and this one did nothing for me. the ending was just as lame as the rest of the movie.<br /><br />on the positive side, the actors did a great job with that they had to work with. the dialogue isn't awful, and overall i was impressed with the cast, having never seen or heard of any of them before. and the plot wasn't out of the realm of possibility (although i really doubt any woman in this day and age would pick up a hitchhiker--no matter how attractive he is), so i wasn't groaning that things didn't make sense.<br /><br />overall, "the hitchhiker" was well-acted and made sense, but wasn't very interesting. there are a lot of better movies in the same genre that i would recommend over this one ("rest stop," "the devil's rejects," "texas chainsaw massacre," even "the hitcher" remake). do yourself a favor and skip it unless you don't have any other options.
