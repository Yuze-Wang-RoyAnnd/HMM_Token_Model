the cavern: 2 out of 10: blair witch meets the cave and gives me a headache.<br /><br />i have something to ask all film schools, could you please teach future directors how to hold a camera steady. flailing the camera around like aunt betty with 12 drinks is headache inducing.<br /><br />also film is primarily a visual medium directors may want to point their camera's in the general direction of the action. film also requires light to work. perhaps a light source should be employed so one can see the action on the screen. i know it is a cave movie but there is absolutely nothing frightening about watching pitch blackness for minutes at a time.<br /><br />for that matter showing the film upside down doesn't indicate confusion on screen it indicates confusion in the editing booth.<br /><br />a last note to the director i'm sure there was a good reason to have a horribly fake cgi campfire. i honestly can't for the life of me think of one.<br /><br />now on to the screenwriter. try to make at least one character likable. i'd prefer two or more but one decent person i can root for or care about might help. also if you are going to have flashbacks make them relevant to the story.<br /><br />if you are going to have a surprise ending it is probably best if it doesn't contradict every single thing that comes before it. and try adding some fancy spelunking terms to a cave movie. you might have wanted to start with spelunking.<br /><br />the cavern is a pretty bad film, poorly shot with a confusing, improbable and anticlimactic ending.
