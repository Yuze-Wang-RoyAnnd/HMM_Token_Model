this movie narrate the story of john belushi,based of his biography `wired' , wrote by bob woodward.all of movie is narrate on flashback without a chronological order , where after the death of john belushi we see one angel accompany belushi during few points of his life.michael chicklis in the character of john belushi is enough credible , but entirely devoid of the devastate force of belushi ,and his play stay only a pale animation.the director,on more,not succeed to give continuate on the story , that for who not knows the book is very confused. but the worse is that they have featured bob woodward that spoke with belushi before he died. for this negative points the movie is only a would-be attempt to narrate the controversial story of john belushi. my rate is 4.
