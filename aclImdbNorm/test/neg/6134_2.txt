i spotted the dvd on a store near my home, and since i'm a "cheesy horror movie/alien flicks" addict, i wondered how good it was. it even had two award mentions on the cover (i don't remember what festival it won) so i figured "hey this might be good". so i bought it (for five euros) and i came here to imdb to check out some reviews. here, either people bashed the movie to say it was bad, or people said the movie was a wonderful feat in indie movies bla, bla. i then played the dvd, not thinking about any review i had read, with an open mind, and not expecting anything at all.<br /><br />man... i don't' like being this critical, but the movie was genuinely bad... ok, i'm just going to give out some pointers of what i thought:<br /><br />1-acting/dialog: the acting was so confusing... sometimes the actors did a decent job, but there were scenes were i could spot no effort at all from them! the dialog was even worst... i think it was probably the aspect i most disliked in the whole movie. the talking in between characters seemed... off. not just bad, but far away from the actual happenings in the movie. the monologues of the female character, although well delivered, became boring and annoying in a little while... but of course the most ridiculous aspect was the... "aliens" or the "infected"... i wont even comment on that one, just going to say that it was absolutely ridiculous and took the entire mood away from the picture; 2-visuals: the strongest aspect in the movie... if you forget the awful fx and light flashes they used to simulate explosions or what the hell they were supposed to be. the "camera in car" aspect was quite cool actually, but they didn't even used the environment to inspire fear or dread. they left that to cheap sound and video fx and the three "infected" characters. the movie becomes boring in so many scenes...; 3-sound: talk about editing... this movie has no problems in showing how weakly edited it was. from computer sounds imitating the forest animals to the "alien dialog"... ah...<br /><br />so what did i like in the movie... (spoilers) the only thing i really liked and it was actually quite scary was the succession of two scenes where the car is still and you spot something/someone walking in a distant. at first i really thought it was me seeing things, but when the character realizes that the "figures" coming towards her were her own reflection, i was surprised! pretty creepy idea done well! apart from that... i had an awful time.<br /><br />and i don't recommend this to anyone... not even "teen get together" because you can't even laugh at this...<br /><br />i give it a solid 2. only some technical achievements worked here... apart from that... yeah... nothing
