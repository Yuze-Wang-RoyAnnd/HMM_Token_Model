i must say, when i saw this film at a 6.5 on this site, i figured it was well worth a view. i was sorely disappointed. from nearly the opening scene, it is obvious the two supposed fbi agents are, in fact, the killers. could they have made it any more obvious? if that is the intended "twist" in this film, that's pretty sad. while pullman and ormond are excellent actors, even their talent is no match for a reprehensibly bad script. pullman adeptly acts the part of a sociopathic killer... and that's the problem. there is no switch from "i'm playing fbi guy!" to "i just killed 12 people and boy, are my arms tired." you can't blame the actors... the story fails in far more ways than one.<br /><br />from the onset of the film, however, i was certain i was wrong, that no director/writer would ever be so blatantly obvious about a plot "twist." ormond and pullman must just be acting strangely in order to divert the viewer's attention from the real killers, i thought... which gave the film's makers far too much credit. i should have followed my instincts and turned off the movie before it even made it past the 15-minute mark.<br /><br />to lynch's credit, she did manage to interject many things that make a good film: sex, violence, humor, and well-trained actors. too bad they were in the wrong configuration. hopefully pell james can recover from this role... i found her performance particularly impressive, as the stunning drug addict-turned would-be savior. she should have rewritten the role so the "crack whore" would win.<br /><br />those people who have compared this film to natural born killers, take note: tarantino made the characters of mickey and mallory reprehensible, yet sympathetic. the artistry of that film far overpowers the gore, and this is not seen once in surveillance. surveillance only wishes it were natural born killers... in fact, it has wet dreams about being even a fraction of what that film was. folks who haven't seen surveillance... stick to something with a little more intelligence. like camp rock.
