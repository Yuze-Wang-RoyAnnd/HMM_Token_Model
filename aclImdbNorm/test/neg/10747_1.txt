the last sentence of this review is a major spoiler.<br /><br />i have enjoyed joe dante's work since piranha. he's done a great deal of different genre parodies that were both funny and honest.<br /><br />but this is pure crap. this is the kind of satire - in line with thank you for smoking - that is so literal and direct that it leaves nothing a) to be laughed at and b) to leave the audience to think about.<br /><br />it's a shame, because the plot and the material is so rich, timely and ripe for intelligent commentary.<br /><br />by the way, there is absolutely no reason for the main character to shoot the ann coulter character at the end of the film. it's just flat out ridiculous.
