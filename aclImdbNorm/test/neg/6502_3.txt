let me say at the outset that i'm not a very artistic person and that i don't "get" new art. that being said, this film is absolutely crazy, and in my opinion not crazy in a good way. filmed entirely in black and white with a series of very loosely connected stories, avida is a film for those who can look at modern art and say "wow, i feel the energy and passion of this painting." the only reason i give this film a 3 out of 10 is because i actually did manage to laugh at some parts, though mainly laughing at the sheer insanity of the film. two of the characters throwing chairs on a lawn, as to do what these characters were doing, i have no idea. i wouldn't recommend this film to anybody.
