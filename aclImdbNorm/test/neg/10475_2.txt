this movie was not very well directed. they almost totally disregarded the book.i guess they were trying 2 save time. the only upside 2 me was that the actor who played finny was cute. some of the dialog between the main characters appeared a little gay which was not the case in the book. major parts of the book were once again chopped out.you lost the over all effect it was not as haunting as the book and left me lacking severely. also the strong language although it was brief was very unnecessary. also i was surprised ( not pleasantly) by a new character that was no where in the book.one of my favorite characters (leper) was poorly interpreted and portrayed. he seemed more sinister in the movie than the real leper was in the book. over all disappointing.
