this film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen. the writer obviously bought the playbook "how to write a space disaster movie" and followed it play by play. in particular, the stereo-typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space - putting on a brave show in the face of disaster - has been done time and time again.<br /><br />max q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw $50 million at the project. but, judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects, the producers could only muster $50 thousand. to learn that the film was nominated for a "special visual effects" emmy has me absolutely gob-smacked.<br /><br />i think a handful of high school students with a pass in media studies could have created more believable effects!<br /><br />and the plot holes are too numerous to mention. but i will pick one out as an example. now, i'm no nasa expert, but surely it's highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear-shaped with the program. surely there is someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than a twenty-nine year old who has not been in the control room before.<br /><br />the only saving grace for this film is the work of bill campbell. he manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script.<br /><br />i give this film 2 out of 10, with the above-average work of bill campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark.
