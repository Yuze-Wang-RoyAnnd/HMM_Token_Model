first of i should point out that i used to love winnie the pooh as a child and i really enjoyed the tigger movie even though i am in my 20's.<br /><br />but this movie was so bad i was ashamed to have been a fan in my youth.<br /><br />ok, ok i know this is a movie for kids and isn't aimed at people like me anyway but this is my thoughts on the movie for other people of my age.<br /><br />the main downfall in this film is the heffalump itself, it has to be the most annoying character i have seen in a child's movie (possibly even more annoying then the young child in monsters inc). it has the most annoying voice and prattles around singing stupid things and making even more stupid comments, i know pooh movies aren't exactly high brow but this was insulting to even a 2 year old's intelligence!<br /><br />secondly - where was the story? previous pooh outings had a least a point to the story- yes i can see this was about accepting people who are different to you into your hearts - but really it ended and i felt like i had watched a 5 minute cartoon on kids tv.<br /><br />i don't have children of my own but when i do i fully intend to show them quality children's movies like the tigger movie, toy story and finding nemo (even though they are too childish for me these days i can see how they would be of great appeal to young children). not so with this appalling attempt at a movie.<br /><br />oh and one more thing - not enough eeyore! he should have his own movie!
