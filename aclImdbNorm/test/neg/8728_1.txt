i agree in many parts with the fairly thorough review already posted on the subject of the miniseries, and agree that it does have its pros, not only its cons. for example, the original film manage to truncate much of the middle and final sections of the novel into a single montage, including the discovery of gurney halleck and the love affair of paul atreides and chani, which, on reading the novel, is a travesty, probably born of the studio cutting shenanigens of which the other reviewer writes. this was one of the great failings of the original film, and the miniseries, to its credit, does include many of the original plot lines that were cut out of the lynch film due to the expansive nature of the herbert novel.<br /><br />however, this in itself is a double edged sword. rather than complete a text-to-celluloid transfer of the novel, the creators of the miniseries were tempted to create their own plot lines, absent from the original novel. similarly, although this is surely a "fuller" account of the storyline of dune, it is also a break from the originals heart and soul & main vision - that of prophecy. where are the internal monologues that characterize herbert's writing and demonstrate what the many different characters are thinking, without the need to suddenly switch viewpoint, or expand in words or unnecessary and stilted spoken monologues? gone. so much of the original agony of paul's decision to choose the jihad or death, the choice to fulfill the prophecy or swing away from it, surely the most interesting aspect of the novel itself (and one which captivates people who are far from science fiction fans) is missing. <br /><br />without prophecy, what is the point of dune? it is simply a more educated and learned version of farscape or andromeda. how sad that this is all we are provided with. lynch's film was flawed, yes. but a flawed film could lead to a correction by another film-maker, taking on some of the best points of lynch's film-making and rejecting some of the more overblown aspects of the style whilst restoring the storyline. now this story shall probably never be translated to film again, and this i find heartrending.
