lou gossett, jr. is an excellent and captivating actor, but to have him take the role of a "president" and then have him act like he's james bond, running around carrying a gun and entering a warehouse to uncover a plot to kill christians, and then being able to escape the supposedly high security facility to live another day, does not do him justice - this movie has so many unresolved issues<br /><br />i will attempt to list just a few: <br /><br />1 - what was the purpose of "stockpiling" a vaccine if no one is vaccinated? - for example, the preacher could have been vaccinated if the "tribulation force" already had vaccine on hand - later, buck williams' wife goes to be with the sick preacher and she herself becomes sick; so, was the virus, therefore, contagious? - if it was contagious, then why did ray and his wife go into the church without proper protection? - why didn't they become sick too? - and when chloe drank the wine and was "cured", how did she suddenly know the wine was the "antidote"? - was it california wine, ordinary red table wine? - could red grape juice been adequate - and,if the preacher had received "communion" at least every time he preached, maybe he would have had anti-dote flowing through his body already? - buck and chloe got a "heavy" box of vaccine that was never used - what mysterious message should we see in that? <br /><br />2 - the presentation of "evil" forces who are working with the anti-christ nicolai to destroy the world, as being russian, chinese, etc., is really a relic of the 1950's and the early james bond era, and shows an ignorance of modern society and of humanity - are we to believe that russians and chinese are perpetually trying to destroy this planet? - and for what purpose, mere destruction? - this was such a narrow-minded view of this world and was so clich'e as to be laughable<br /><br />3 - the main purpose of this movie was the scene near the very end where kirk cameron and lou gossett, jr. are proselytizing the non-believers in the audience (by showing kirk proselytizing lou) - it was a movie with no meaningful storyline, too many disconnects with reality, and a completely inappropriate plot for a great actor<br /><br />i, therefore, rank this as a 1, since zero is not available
