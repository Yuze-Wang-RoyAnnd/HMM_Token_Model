the reason why this movie sucks, have these people even read a bible? everything in the movie was about moses, god was staying out of it. that didn't happen! god directed everything, he told them where to go and what to do. also the people wandered for 40 years after they arrived at canan and betrayed god again! they didn't wander for 40 years then suddenly find it, it was a punishment for their doubts. maybe if the people who made the film actually picked up a bible first they would say oh no we got it all wrong try again. everything in this movie was about moses. they made god look like a jerk who was messing with moses the whole time. no no no no no!!!!!! god was their the whole time and he wanted the people to see he was taking care of them. how dare they say otherwise not even close to the passage. and moses was kept out because he was angry at the people and blatantly disobeyed god! he sinned badly and was told he would not be allowed to enter for it. when did moses run off and yell at god for everything in the bible? never!!!!!! actually read your story before you make up whatever you think is a good idea. also this whole god stayed out of it for the most part and made them do it themselves is not true!!! god did everything for the people, he provided for them in every way and god told them where to go. he was there the whole time. the whole we have to do it ourselves is true in some ways, but back then thats not how it worked! yes today he doesn't work directly for everyone to see, but back then he actually killed people after the golden calf thing! god worked directly with the people. read the bible next time echo bridge or don't make another bible movie!
