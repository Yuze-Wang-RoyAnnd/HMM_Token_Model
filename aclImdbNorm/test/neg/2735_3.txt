this is a very very very bad movie !<br /><br />the plot is weak the acting is bad and the science is worse.<br /><br />the special effects are unconvincing. the dramatic scenes are a joke. every step of the way you can see coming a mile away. the end is disappointing and there is no suspense. the best aspect of the film is the soundtrack.<br /><br />the only reason not to give this a lower vote is because it is a tv movie and i believe the budget was low to start of with.<br /><br />i do believe that the young female fans of luke parry will still see this movie however he has done better work. again this is terrible. very very very terrible. if you have a choice, look at something else.
