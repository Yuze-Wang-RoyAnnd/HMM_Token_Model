you're dead is an indescribably awful attempt at a british gangster film. it has not got a single original idea in it, being an atrocious copy of various elements of lock stock & two smoking barrels, the usual suspects and pulp fiction. the acting and dialogue are absolutely excruciating, the plot is ludicrous and utterly predictable despite constant attempts at plot twists, and contains nothing but one dimensional stock characters and clich'es. it has some good actors in it, but they are off-form, and unable to do anything much with the dreadful material they are working with. it is absolute torture to sit through this drivel.
