so much for judge and jury, which lives up to its nonsense title. what good is there? the lighting is terribly foggy! another horror movie you ask? well, that's perfectly explainable. david keith actually does pretty good at disguising clowns, chefs, and other shenanigans while being the killer who escaped death row. but overall, despite some new twists, it's reasonably stupid. unapix has been putting out some ludicrous productions recently, and this one only means so much. we, the jury, find this film guilty for its indecent exposure to many of us sitting around believing it's a total waste of our time!
