that's all i can really say about this film. it's dbz...like tree of might and the world's strongest, it really...doesn't fit into the timeline for the show at all, though it is supposedly placed just before the beginning of the tv series. the action is pretty nice in general. the plot has a nice enough base, with a good background establishing why these guys hate each other and all. pretty good in general, there... the problem is...there's a lot of really weird stuff. i mean, really weird stuff. like the world's strongest, there's a really, really odd song in this one that could only have been created in a drug induced haze...disturbing is the fact that gohan, while singing, is pretty much drugged out himself. creepy. the villains are odd and rather comical...moreso than the usual dbz type--this seems more like it was made as a dragon ball movie rather than a dragon ball z movie. in general, its entertaining enough, but...just...strange.
