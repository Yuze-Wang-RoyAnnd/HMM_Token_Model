this is so blatantly a made-for-tv ripoff of black widow (1987) - even the insect titles are so similar.<br /><br />if you want a better "marrying for money" movie, check out black widow, starring debra winger & theresa russell.<br /><br />these movie is cheesiness at its best..! i just had to watch it entirely to see how it ended.
