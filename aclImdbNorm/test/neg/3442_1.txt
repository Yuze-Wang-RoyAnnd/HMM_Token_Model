tim taylor is an abusive acholoic drug addict. he's a coward and a child and has absolutely no redeeming qualities as an actor or a person. the only film with him in it that is enjoyable is "galaxy quest" and that just because his character - a boozed out washed up actor from a former hit tv show - was so close to real life for him. the rest of the cast is equally bad. i hate the mother and the actress that played her patricia richardson, she sucks! ever clich'e is there, the stupid woman who is fat and likes opera and only cares about her children, while in real life she's proclaims family values and gets divorced after having twins. and the child actors were about as interesting as a root canal.
