"escape from hell" is not made with enough artistry to disguise what it is: crass exploitation. the direction and writing are both sloppy: for example, the camera-work during the fight between cintia lodetti and ajita wilson is so bad that you can barely make out what's happening; also, if the alcoholic-but-kind-hearted doctor hadn't killed the warden, the guards would never have followed him and the girls after their escape - the "fake plague" plan had worked fine until then but he just had to ruin it. i would have given this film a 4 out of 10 (the sweaty lesbian scene is not bad and christina lai has an amazingly beautiful face and body), but a particularly disgusting scene of abuse forced me to cut 2 more points. of course some sickos will take that as a recommendation. after all, one thing even more disturbing than this film is that some people actually gave it positive reviews!
