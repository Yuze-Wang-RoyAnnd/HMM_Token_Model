this movie is about a young couple running away to start a new life in la, who end up being stalked by a psycho at a deserted rest stop. actually, it's really just about the girl (nicole), since her boyfriend literally disappears within a few minutes. the movie gets going extremely fast, and early on you wonder how it could possibly stretch its story out to feature length. it isn't long before you realize that the movie does this by simply wasting time with unnecessary scenes that go nowhere.<br /><br />the story is not only paper-thin, but unstructured, stupid, and incoherent. minutes after the disappearance of her boyfriend and car, nicole finds a mobile home at the rest stop. she sees the flashing of a camera, and knows that people are inside, but she easily gives up on trying to get their help when no one answers her door knocks. after she is informed by the killer that her boyfriend is in danger, she walks around the rest stop, doing all sorts of stupid and unnecessary things. this includes turning on a tv (and even looking amused when she thinks she's stumbled onto a porno movie, even in this dire situation), sitting around, wandering, and drinking from a bottle of liquor for hours on end. she does all this knowing that her boyfriend has been abducted, that the killer is still on the loose and stalking her, and without taking any actions to ensure her immediate safety (she doesn't bother to lock the doors or remain alert). oh yeah, she tries using a radio to call for help, but why even bother when there's a mobile home with people inside right there at the rest stop? it really seems like the script writer forgot about this important fact while writing this part of the story.<br /><br />there's no sense of entrapment or ever-present danger in this story. the heroine freely wanders in and around the various buildings at the rest stop, and the killer only drives in occasionally to scare her, before driving off again. there's nothing stopping nicole from simply taking off (even if the rest stop is a long way from anywhere else, that's better than sitting around), but she chooses to stay anyway. at one point in the movie, the main character even acknowledges that she can run off, but doesn't.<br /><br />the story doesn't go anywhere, and instead just jumps from pointless segment to pointless segment. nicole finally gets inside the mobile home, and it turns out that the inhabitants are a family of sheltered, presumably inbred or psychotic religious fanatics. they seem willfully ignorant or uncaring about the killer's actions (but there's no indication that they're connected to him in any way), and then kick nicole out after several minutes.<br /><br />in the next irrelevant segment, the main character wanders into the bathroom building. she discovers one of the killer's previous victims (a young woman named tracy), who is still alive and locked in a closet. for some strange reason, tracy starts vomiting ridiculous amounts of blood. nicole goes off to fetch a crowbar to pry open the closet door, and when she returns a minute later, both tracy and her pool of blood have disappeared without any explanation. what was the point? nicole finds a bulletin board showing many missing persons, and sees that tracy had disappeared in 1971. so, was tracy a ghost or something? the writer never bothers explaining.<br /><br />next, a cop shows up in the middle of the night to man the police office at the rest stop, which had been conveniently left unattended for the entire day so far. nicole tells him all about what's been going on, and when the killer drives up in his truck outside the office, the cop goes outside to confront him. what does the police officer do, knowing that something is seriously wrong? he goes up and calmly talks to the killer (who nicole had even pointed out to be the guy who was stalking her), and buys into the killer's lie that he was simply driving through and needed directions. seriously. the cop then talks to nicole outside, totally unaware as the pickup truck turns around and runs him over.<br /><br />the cop quickly starts telling nicole that he's a goner who's "lucky to be breathing" still, yet he strangely doesn't die for quite a while. the two of them do some more pointless talking, and the all-important fact that he has a gun is annoyingly not even mentioned for too long a time. when the two of them finally try to use the gun, nicole stupidly wastes most of her bullets blindly shooting at a door when the killer was possibly behind it. with two bullets left, the policeman tells nicole to use one to euthanize him. she fires one into his mouth, and he lays still for a few moments, with a chunk blown out of his head. then, he suddenly and inexplicably yells out "you missed!" and she has to shoot him again. completely cheap attempt at shock.<br /><br />nicole finally confronts the killer
