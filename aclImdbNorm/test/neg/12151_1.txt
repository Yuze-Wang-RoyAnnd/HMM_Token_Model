first of all i dunno if i was supposed to use my imagination in this film or the director was trying to save money or low on budget! here we go....<br /><br />basically there were so many years and gaps that i don't understand, its like the movie was jumping from 9 years to 20 years to 30 and so much gaps that makes you ask questions how the hell did this happen? and why? i think this is a big flow. forget the reviews who keeps whining about the history , this movie doesn't have only history facts issues, but also has so many flaws. so most of the people keep saying watch this in cinema you will lose all cinematography like rivers, deserts etc.. thats true they are beautiful thats why i waited for bluray release 1080p. ok! beautiful scenes but whats the point of that? i turned off the movie after 1 hour and half, i just lost interest. the movie kept on doing the exact same things jumping in years ( at least mr. director put for example, after 2 years after 10 years!) i mean i couldn't watch the movie i lost understanding of whats going on! anyways i wish i could include spoilers but when u decide to watch this movie, just ask yourself how did this happen? you will know what i mean! don't watch this movie its a waste of time.
