this is a very dull film with poorly developed characters, subplots that go nowhere, and barely tolerable acting. it comes across as a poorly conceived rip-off of "2001."<br /><br />the only thing making it worthwhile are the sets and costumes and visual effects. but even that wasn't enough to keep me from nodding off. i would like to get the soundtrack, especially the music during the space flight sequence, for nights when i have trouble falling asleep.
