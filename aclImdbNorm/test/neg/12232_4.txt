when i first saw the trailer for the comebacks, it looked absolutely horrible and i had no interest in seeing it, but when it came out on dvd today, i figured since there was nothing else that caught my interest, i would rent it and give it a shot. i watched it tonite and it really wasn't that bad. i think it was immature and stupid at times, but there were a few funny moments that made me laugh. i don't really watch many sports movies, so i wonder maybe if i saw more, maybe this movie would make more sense to me, but it's all good, i still didn't mind so much watching the comebacks. i admit, these "stupid spoof" movies are lame, but what's the harm in a stupid joke every once in a while? the comebacks isn't really that bad if you give it a fair chance.<br /><br />coach fields is failing in life, family and career both, but when he is offered a chance to bring his career back to life if he can bring a looser football team into the championship. but the team is really really terrible, like beyond terrible. but with a little work and team effort they try to give it their all, even though that might turn into something more sad.<br /><br />the comebacks over all isn't the worst film i've seen, i think it's good for a couple laughs and giggles. i know that this was stupid, but i couldn't help but laugh when the coach comes in the middle of a fight in the locker room and he's beating the nerd's head against the locker, just him and the nerd in general were so funny together. if you have an open mind and don't take this movie too seriously, i think you'll have a fun time watching it, if you watch it expecting it to be oscar worthy material, this is not the movie for you.<br /><br />4/10
