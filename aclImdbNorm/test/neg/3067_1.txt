ouch, no real need to say anything else. this movie actually had me contemplating suicide. as a huge fan of the wonderful genre that is zombie movies i found this to quite possibly be the worst attempt i have ever been privy too. the film never actually seemed to go anywhere! what was the point to it all, i am left feeling hopeless and lost. hell this was so bad i cant even justify bashing it anymore. i'm just gonna go hang myself in the closet. ok now i tried to submit my comment but the server will only accept comments that are ten lines or more. so here it goes... bad, horrible, no where near enough gore. no tits!!!!!!how can you have a zombie movie without tits. as a matter of fact the female lead had one hell of a rack and the only reason i watched the film to completion was in order to maybe by chance get a glimpse. nope! of course there was one line that does deserve mentioning, a line i am looking forward to using myself someday (when i just feel the need to get my face smacked) "this hog isn't going to smoke itself" this movie is bad, so bad.
