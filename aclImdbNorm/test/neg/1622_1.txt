there's simply no redeeming quality about this film. ok, some of the costumes are ok, but they're nothing you can't see in, say, the conan flicks. and what's up with ator's hair? i can't believe this is part of a series! i will say one thing about this film: it was deemed bad enough for a righteous lampooning by the early cast of mst3k and i suggest to anyone that's curious enough to see how bad this film is to watch that version of the film for moral support if nothing else.
