even though he only made his debut film in australia and left for great britain and then america to continue his career, australians will tell you that the greatest film star they ever produced was errol flynn. i'm not sure he ever even went back to australia after his breakout success in captain blood. still i attribute this film to the well known aussie irreverence for trashing the reputation of one of their own.<br /><br />part of the problem in telling errol flynn's life story was that he told enough tall tales in his life right up to the very end in his memoir, my wicked wicked ways. i could see that a lot of the film was based on that and upon reading between the lines of that book.<br /><br />his mother's infidelity to his father was not written, but could have been inferred in reading my wicked wicked ways. he didn't particularly like the woman, that is clear from a few sources. <br /><br />i wish the film had dealt more with his new guinea adventures, that to me was the most interesting part of my wicked wicked ways. as for his street fighting in the depression, i tend to disbelieve that. even if he had been successful at it, i guarantee that enough of that would have ruined his looks and he would never have had a career as a leading man.<br /><br />still the folks down under seem to think the atmosphere of sydney during the depression was captured well and guy pearce is a charismatic errol flynn. american audiences know him best as the uptight, but honest lieutenant exley in la confidential which came out the same year as flynn.<br /><br />but la confidential was a far better film.
