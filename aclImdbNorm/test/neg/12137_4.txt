boring as hell and kind of a chick flick.<br /><br />it's the story of a neurotic woman who struggles with the concept of marriage as a business arrangement, the romantic nature of a one night stand, and the uncertainty and pitfalls of true love.<br /><br />many of the story's motifs are reminiscent of other recent kst movies (e.g. the english patient), but have far less appeal.<br /><br />after the first half-hour i started checking my watch, wondering if i'd make it home in time to catch leno on tv.<br /><br />i passed up "gladiator" to see this!?!
