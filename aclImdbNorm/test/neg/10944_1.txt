most people get the luxury of typing in the title of a film, and finding out about the film before watching it but unfortunately i've just never been one of those kind of people. i wouldn't even read the synopsis for fear of spoilers but there are two sides to that because if you ignore such warnings and even give a film a chance after it has flopped in theatres, you're entering at your own risk and might just end up with a bad taste in your mouth which is exactly how i feel about this stupid movie.<br /><br />honestly, the only thing good about shakalaka-crap-crap are some of it songs (and seriously excluding the title track). even the ever promising kangana renaut's talent (metro, gangster, woh lamhe) is seriously wasted here as she plays ruhi, the woman who has captured the attention of both the leading male characters played by bobby deol (who plays a.j. a rootless music producer) and upen patel (who plays reggi, an upcoming artist who crosses a.j.'s path). celina jaitley provides the right amount of oomph required of a socialite who gets jilted by reggi (whom she helped get his foot in the record industry's door). this doesn't sound like a mix or movie that should include anupam kher right? well, you're wrong because he's in it as reggi's father (another wasted talent).<br /><br />the film might not have been so bad had their not over-killed the writing behind deol's character. the moral message was too preachy (revenge had a deadly dark side) and the ending was way too overblown that it will make you wonder why you sat down to such a foolish movie in the first place. truly, this is the epitome of crap.
