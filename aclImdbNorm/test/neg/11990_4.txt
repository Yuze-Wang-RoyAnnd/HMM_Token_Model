there is only one reason this movie is watchable. till schweiger. he is such a good actor the movie isn't completely terrible. uwe boll please take up another career. the special effects and action are acceptable. all other aspects were very disappointing. all i can say is that kevin smith (an evening with...) talked about tim burton not ever reading the batman comics and it showed. uwe boll must not have ever played the video games that he keeps making movies about. if you two ever want to know how it is done go see andrzej bartkowiak. doom was one of the best video games to film adaptations ever. some people may disagree, but if you watch the movie you can see that the guys at id had a lot to do with doom. it doesn't seem like anyone at ubisoft was even near this production.
