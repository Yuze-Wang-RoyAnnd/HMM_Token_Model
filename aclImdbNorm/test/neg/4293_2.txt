i saw this as a kid, before it had been yanked from the rotation, and even then it left a bad taste in my mouth. there were some competently worked out gags, but making slapstick villains out of american citizens who'd been interned in camps strictly due to their race was amazingly tasteless. <br /><br />moe himself might have wanted this one buried. he was a liberal guy. in his autobiography he told of visiting a town in the segregated south, where he saw a black man get off the sidewalk to avoid passing too close. moe stepped into the street to show it wasn't a problem, and the man then got back on the curb. then off again. finally, the man told moe nervously that if moe didn't stop trying to share the sidewalk with him, he might get them both lynched.<br /><br />another thing: there are exploding ostrich eggs but no oxen in the film, so the title should actually be (if anyone cares) "the yolk's on me."
