this film goes into my "worst films ever made" file. i have a copy of this film which i watch when i want a good laugh, and this isn't even a comedy. i am disappointed that such great actors agreed to be in such a piece of garbage. this film is inaccurate (in its portrayal of hockey), offensive (to canadians), and i wasn't even all that impressed with the acting. even the story was a bit weak. if you have never seen this film, you're lucky. if you have, i'm sorry.
