a wide variety of snakes stage an uprising on tourists "invading" their island due their captain's boat damage. the few remaining survivors who aren't caught vulnerable by the snakes will attempt an escape mission, their goal to flee to available boats which can get them safely off the island.<br /><br />presented straight-faced with injected doses of visual humor featuring lots of snake gags, wayne crawford's snake island features plenty of different breeds of the slithery predators, in striking position, ready to attack their prey. star william katt, as an author researching snakes for a forthcoming novel, has fun in his role along with writer / director / co-star wayne crawford(..as the tourist boat captain) as put-upon heroes who stare down a most serious crisis. kate connor is crawford's attractive love interest, a lawyer on vacation. the other cast members serve as either tourists or crew, mostly fodder for the snakes. <br /><br />as in many other movies of this type, director crawford features live snakes with computer generated ones, and the violence is really tame. crawford even incorporates the point-of-view technique with the camera as the eyes of the snake as it faces the potential victim(..with the actor looking directly into the camera). never to be taken seriously, the tongue-in-cheek approach was probably the best way to shoot snake island because the premise is just too ridiculous to accept on it's own.<br /><br />the effects and suspense scenes rarely work because crawford is often unable to successfully stage the sequences where humans face off with the snakes. the snake attacks themselves also never happen on screen(..one or two tops), or are so limply presented they leave little impression. that's a no-no for a genre such as this. fans of katt will probably want to check it out because he does provide some facial comedy that establishes the overall tone of certain scenes where he must defend himself against the snakes. the cgi scenes where we see a large number of snakes in a general area aren't very effective which remove the realism crawford might've attempted to establish. there are plenty of better horror films featuring snakes as the aggressors than snake island. surprising moments of nudity, relegated to a scene where the tourists and crew unwind after a long day with the bubbly, not knowing what danger lie ahead.
