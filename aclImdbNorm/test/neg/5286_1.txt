this movie is by far one of the worst b-movies i have ever seen. there are no plot twists at all. though the acting is decent, the storyline is terrible. there are also many mistakes in the movie, and it was bothersome to watch. for any of you who like horror movies, slasher movies, or even b-movies, i don't recommend this to anyone at all. most of the movie is focused on pointless killing, in ways that aren't even worth discussing. this movie could very well be compared to a crappy remake of jeepers creepers, which, too, wasn't that great of a movie. for anyone who wishes to spend a day at home, watching poorly made movies, this one takes the cake.
