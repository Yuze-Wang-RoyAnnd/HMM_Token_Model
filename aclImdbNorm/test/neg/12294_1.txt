to call this film a complete waste of celluloid would be an understatement.<br /><br />the acting was unconvincing to say the least, especially from actor craig fong, who couldn't have acted stiffer. as far as story goes...well...what story?! the "film" is nominally about harry lee, a malaysian of chinese descent who comes back to his home country after flunking out of every course he took and tries to start a band.<br /><br />the film has ever cliche you can think of -- sex, tension among band members and a little bit of racial tension thrown in.<br /><br />the problem is that even with a subject that's been covered adequately by even the most amateurish directors, this movie is all over the place and the whole thing just feels contrived with parts that would make even the most hardened reviewers' hairs stand on end.<br /><br />
