i love these awful 80's summer camp movies. the best part about "party camp" is the fact that it literally has no plot. it simply drops a weak batch of "characters" into a location and then things occasionally happen. the cliches here are limitless (spoilers): the nerds vs. the jocks, the secret camera in the girls locker room, the hikers happening upon a nudist colony, the contest at the conclusion, the secretly horny camp administrators, and the embarrassingly foolish sexual innuendo littered throughout. the only cliche missing is the presence of corey feldman. this movie will make you laugh, but never intentionally. i repeat, never. a final note, be prepared to bust a gut watching the nonsense that is the "dramatic" scene where jerry riviera and d.a. share a beer late at night, spilling their guts to each other. the dialogue literally makes no sense, and the acting belongs on a high-school stage. it's a classic.
