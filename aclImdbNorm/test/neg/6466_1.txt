ladies and gentlemen, may we present the worst of all disney remakes. although the name of this movie is "that darn cat", it should have been "that darn teen" or "fbi agent". the cat didn't get any real good scenes, ricci's character was more annoying than funny, doug e. doug didn't get any good lines, even dean jones's cameo role couldn't save this movie! the only really good characters were the town's only two auto mechanics, but their scenes were only brief. in all, i'd say that if you are considering watching this movie, go get something more intelligent like a barney video.
