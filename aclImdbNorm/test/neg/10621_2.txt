well the name in the summary should tell you everything. fred olen ray - the modern king of low budget flicks, be it for tv or direct to video (i doubt he produces for the silver screen anymore - with the death of drive-in b-movie double features and all).<br /><br />creator of such cult(?) classics, like hollywood chainsaw hookers and dinosaur island....<br /><br />well i kind of like this guys stuff. its mostly entertaining (in a distinctly cheesy, campy and especially cheap kind of way) and if he's one thing, he's a pro - something you can't say for all guys in the movie biz.<br /><br />but this one flick here is among the weaker ones in his oevre. insipid acting, an uninspired script and lame jokes conspire to make your brain go numb in a matter of minutes. if you are out for real f.o.r. goodness (or rather badness), look out for the above mentioned ones, and generally his stuff from the 70s and 80s (i think he lost a bit of his edge lately).
