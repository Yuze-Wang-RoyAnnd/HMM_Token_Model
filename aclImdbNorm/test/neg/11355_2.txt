i never really thought about watching this film. i kept seeing it perched on the horror movie shelf in my local video rental shop and never thought much about it. just your run of the mill, bland zombie flick with a bit of gore and a sex scene. nothing special, might as well watch python...oh no wait, that's a terrible film.<br /><br />i only decided to watch it when some of my friends saw it on tv and said it was an awful piece of trash. so, i decided to verify these tales, and only then did i realise how terrible the film hiding behind the bland and uninteresting dvd box cover was.<br /><br />not that the idea is bad in itself. a plane is a confined area, and would be a real death trap for the people on board should zombies make their appearance...a good premise for a zombie film. but this film took a good setting and crapped all over it with poor acting, unsteady camera work, annoying characters and a terrible score.<br /><br />the characters all have different levels of hatefulness. there are two young couples who are basically friends going on a vacation in france. one couple is composed of a jock and his annoying bitchy girlfriend who is having an affair with mr jock's best friend, who came along with his girlfriend who is a blonde psycho. there is also a policeman escorting a con-man (an effeminate and highly annoying con-man). the policeman is probably one of the least irritating characters of the lot. then there is a bunch of air hostesses who mostly end up as zombie chow...no i didn't watch the whole film, it was just too painful an experience to carry through, almost as bad as watching cannibal holocaust. oh and there's also a golfer on holiday with his wife, some strange air marshal who really does not appear to be important until he's summoned to help deal with the zombie escapees, a trio of scientists who all fall victim to the undead and a couple of pilots. the camera work is often shaky, and although many people don't seem to mind, it can really get on your nerves after a while, like having a small fly buzz constantly around your head. it's small but it's there and it's annoying.<br /><br />the adulterous couple are genuinely annoying. all they do is have sex in the plane's toilets while their spouses aren't looking...in fact all the young adults in this film are insanely annoying. they whine, bitch, argue and have some of the most inane and mind-buggeringly boring dialogue in the movie...yes, it makes you glad to see them die.<br /><br />the score is atrocious. it is so generic and uninspired it kills any kind of suspense a scene could have generated and replaces it with the feeling that someone is scraping a blackboard with their nails and laughing at you. in fact, it sounds like the score from...python! that film will never stop haunting me.<br /><br />there is also a character that the film makers seemed incredibly intent on having in as many shots as possible. a nun, sitting near the young adults and clutching her bible who is included in so many shots you start to wonder if she plays any major part in the film...but no she doesn't, so why have her in so many scenes? was it because the film's creator's original project was a nun porn flick? nobody will ever know.<br /><br />the zombies look pretty good. their makeup is good and they are probably far better actors than the living characters, they are far more convincing and likable! the guard responsible for keeping an eye on the scientist's illegal cargo was quite funny. a large crate appears to fall on him, and the camera briefly shows the audience that his leg has been pierced with some kind of sharp object...yet he doesn't scream, wince or moan in pain. he just grunts and squirms in an attempt to get the thing out of his leg...in fact he sounds more like an overweight man trying to scratch his back than a man in pain.<br /><br />ah well, all in all i give it 1 for the interesting setting and 1 for the zombies.<br /><br />watch this movie only if you like young adults bickering and throwing things at each other, and sadly, there really isn't anything funny about the whole thing so watching for a laugh would probably fail, unless you're high on some kind of psychoactive drug.
