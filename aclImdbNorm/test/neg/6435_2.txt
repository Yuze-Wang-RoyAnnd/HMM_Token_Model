licence fees to watch this trash, and pay for it with hard-earned cash? humourless, no hint of laughter, god knows how it won a bafta! <br /><br />we've now been subjected to "eastenders" for twenty years. when, oh when is the great british public going to see this awful soap for what it is? crass pap! this programme no more depicts reality in the east end of london than everyday life in beirut, and never has done.<br /><br />the eastenders i know (the real ones) are kind, courageous, hardworking and loyal. and one of their greatest attributes is humour. it was the eastenders who went through the worst of the london blitz and still stuck two fingers up to hitler. and what do we see on our screens for five days of the week (including an omnibus)? nothing but a bunch of moaning, wailing, "dead from the neck up" wimps, who seem to do little else than sit in a pub all day sniping at each other. what a great advert for britain that is!! do the writers actually believe this garbage they're pumping out? obviously the woolly-minded section of the public does, but then i've heard that apparently anyone can be brainwashed into believing anything.
