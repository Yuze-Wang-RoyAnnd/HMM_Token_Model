afraid of the dark left me with the impression that several different screenplays were written, all too short for a feature length film, then spliced together clumsily into this frankenstein's monster.<br /><br />at his best, the protagonist, lucas, is creepy. as hard as it is to draw a bead on the secondary characters, they're far more sympathetic.<br /><br />afraid of the dark could have achieved mediocrity had it taken just one approach and seen it through -- and had it made lucas simply psychotic and confused instead of ghoulish and off-putting. i wanted to see him packed off into an asylum so the rest of the characters could have a normal life.
