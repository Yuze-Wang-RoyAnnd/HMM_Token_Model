to start off, i didn't bother seeing the grudge. the previews for that movie didn't make me jump, didn't scare me, and didn't entertain me. but when a group of friends asked me to go see the grudge 2, i accepted the invite, a little curious as to how this movie would be. i mainly went because of my friends. not even 5 minutes into this movie, i realized i threw away $7.50. the acting from the get-go is horrible. the schoolgirls in the beginning look as if they have never acted in their entire lives. then, the movie plot takes over. let me tell you, i could not stop laughing this entire movie. it is just so stupid. i'm pretty sure they tried to not make it scary. they don't make anything jump out or anything. it shows the kids, then shows them "attacking". it builds up to it, it's not an "all-of-a-sudden" thing. and even in the middle of the movie, the core of the movie, the acting is still horrible. it leaves so much time in-between the dialog for someone to add in their own comments. this movie is honestly one of the funniest "horror" movies i have ever seen. poorly written, horrible acting, horrible script, horrible "unable to act" cast, and a horrible concept. the movie blacks out and changes situations more times than you can count. each part eventually plays out and then ties up at the end of the movie. i would never again pay to see this movie. i wouldn't even watch it on cable, for free. this movie is a joke. please do not waste your money on this movie!!
