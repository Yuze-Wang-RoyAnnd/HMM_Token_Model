this was intolerable. (spoiler #1) protagonists avoid the pointless disclosure of agonizing truths to their loved ones, lest they surrender said status and assume the roles of antagonists. (spoiler #2) the writers would have us believe that the exposure of multiple transgressions, by the transgressor, presents a threat to, and provokes a retaliatory response by, the primary victim of the transgressions. (spoiler #3) until the final 15 minutes, i was anticipating a score of 6 to 8 out of 10; instead, it was kind of like discovering that lieutenant columbo's dog is the real murderer. the story just wasn't credible, and i don't think the world's best director could have saved it without massive editing.
