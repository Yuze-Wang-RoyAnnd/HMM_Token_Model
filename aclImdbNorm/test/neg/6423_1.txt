newly released on dvd in the us; just stay far away from it.<br /><br />i usually give plenty of room for stupidity in horror films; i'll settle for nearly anything remotely suspenseful, supernatural, spooky, or even just a vaguely interesting concept. this one simply stank. i knew there was trouble when sara's "best friend" in college, who had considerable screen time, wasn't even listed in the credits on imdb! i wasn't surprised not recognizing any actors, but that character ("daysha" or "day-glo" or whatever her name was) apparently didn't even exist! <br /><br />i'm so embarrassed that i actually paid a rental fee for this garbage; deeply, deeply ashamed...
