the good things first: i agree with another viewer who said that gene raymond has a marvelous drunk scene. he does -- i was tickled to finally get a chance to laugh. and there were other moments i found amusing -- raymond's parents in the bathroom with the defective plumbing, and the scene in the restaurant with robert montgomery trying to make carole lombard jealous by mouthing sweet nothings to a stranger. <br /><br />but overall, i was dismayed. i love carol lombard and most of hitchcock. and i understand the restrictions laid on productions by the hays code. but this was embarrassing and awful to watch. of course i knew they'd end up together, this is a romantic comedy after all. but it made no sense, it happened too fast. plus i can't believe the professions of love when confronted with such hurtful behavior, both physical and confrontational.
