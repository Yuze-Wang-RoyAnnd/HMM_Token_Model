i've always said that there's nothing to beat the original form: the comics. i've been proved right again. this, like all of the other movie takes on the asterix series, failed to impress. the makers of this movie don't get it that what makes all the other such comic-turned-movies (x-men, superman et al.) ventures successful is that they all deviate from the original comic versions and adapt it to make it more watchable. agreed, this movie did deviate, in the sense that this movie was a cross of two asterix books, viz. asterix and the great crossing & asterix and the normans. also, uncharacteristic of the asterix series (save asterix and the secret weapon) , a love interest for one of the main characters was introduced. all this ended up doing was create a childishly immature storyline. the funny parts were very few and far between. all in all, a total waste of time and money watching this, let alone at theaters, even at home.
