if jacqueline mckenzie and john lynch weren't such talented actors this film would probably be even worse than it actually is.the story of two mentally disturbed people who fall in love and have a baby is an interesting one,and well worth exploring.however on the negative side,the plot becomes increasingly over the top as the story progresses,and the music choices more and more bizarre,so that by the end i found myself laughing when i know the director intended for me to be crying.
