i saw this at a drive-in when i was 9. all i remember are a few scenes (the ones where the main character elle is being chased by a guy in a mask) and being scared spitless. seeing it now, my opinions have changed. it's a pathetic "horror" film about an ophanage run by gloria grahame (sad) and dealing with a young, talentless girl elle who is sent there after her mother, the town tramp, was beaten to death with a hammer (graphically shown). the film has adolescents (actually actors in their 20s) being beaten, tortured, killed, starved, attacked with meat cleavers, raped etc etc. the brutal hammer murder is the opening scene and then it gets worse and worse. there is nothing to recommend about this crap. the plot is stupid, all the dialogue is bad and the acting...the less said the better. how did this sickie get by with a gp (now pg) rating? it would get an r now. worthless. one last thing...a truly repulsive twist ending suggests incest!
