in most parts a lethally dull venture, naach is about this dancer/choreographer (antara mali) who regards herself as some kind of auteur, beyond the petty commercial compromises that people around her, including her actor beau (abhishek bachchan) build their careers on. nice idea, only it turns out that she has the most howlariously bad concepts about costumes and dance movements, stuff rotten enough to make even the forces behind those ultra-cheap south indian potboilers squirm in severe embarrassment.<br /><br />the story follows a yawn-inducing predictable pattern...dancer and beau meet and have an affair (yes, sex included)...beau gets success, but she spurns his attempts to help her...beau throws attitude and they walk out on each other...dancer meets a most unlikely director who wants her 'to do what she wants'...incongruous effort bags even more incongruous popularity...beau's attempts to reach out are rebuffed until a climax where he bursts out about how he can't live without her...d-uh end.<br /><br />actually i didn't really expect this film to be much good. so why did i watch it? because i have an antara mali fetish. she's an actress with imo sufficient talent to reach grand heights provided she has the opportunity. alas, her role in the film looks far better on paper than in actual execution, ironic for a film that's supposed to be about an uncompromising character. to give her credit she puts in a game effort, shining well in the few scenes that actually ask of her as an actress. i just wish the movie had been more worthy of her. abhishek bachchan also throws in a few good punches, the last scene salvaged somewhat by a simmering turn which pleasantly reminds you of his father.<br /><br />only recommended if you can sit through humongous piles of dogcrap for the return of a few grains of good moments courtesy the lead actors.
