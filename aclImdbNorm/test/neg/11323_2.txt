trite and tiring, the one-liners almost made me cry. my 4 year old left the room and ended up doing a puzzle. i don't know what age group this was written for, but the writer himself/herself didn't even want credit. as for the song, it's mildly amusing. at least it was a decade ago. there are many christmas movies to watch. although i've seen some many more times than this, they are still enjoyable. whenever this comes on, i try to encourage my child to watch something else. one positive note, that allowed a vote of 2 instead of 1, is that it encourages good moral values. that would have been encouraging, if anyone were watching.
