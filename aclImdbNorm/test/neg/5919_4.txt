i'm a collector of films starring ms. weaver, so i bought this only because of her being in it. i find it really odd that her early career is filled with so many awful movies. she started with incredible promise in alien but then had a slew of bombs. these bombs include this movie, deal of the century, one woman or two, and half moon street. she also appeared in the year of living dangerously, which was not a bomb, but her performance was less than notable. in the time between alien and it's 1986 sequel, aliens, the only movie she did that was worth anything was ghostbusters. before the release of aliens, i'm sure everyone thought this woman was on her way out. luckily she wasn't.<br /><br />back to eyewitness though, the film is boring. it doesn't create any suspense. william hurt seems like a cardboard stand in, and the atmosphere is just to dry. sigourney is decent but nothing worth remembering.<br /><br />watch this movie if you must but don't go in with any expectations of a decent movie. watch better movies with these two stars like accidental tourist and working girl.
