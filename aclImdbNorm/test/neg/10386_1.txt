blackwater valley exorcism is set on a small town ranch where teenager isabelle (kristin erickson) is found wandering around covered in dog's blood. her parents ely (randy colton) & blanche (leslie fleming-mitchell) own the ranch & are deeply worried about their daughter, recently she has not been herself & is considered a danger to herself & other's. ranch hand & ex-priest miguel (del zamora) recognises isabelle's symptoms as a possible case of possession & when she starts to speak ancient latin in a strange voice he becomes convinced of it. blanche calls priest jacob (cameron daddo) who is her other daughter claire's (madison taylor) ex husband to see isabelle, he confirms miguel's suspicions & accepts the job of performing the exorcism that will hopefully banish the demon inside isabelle & an innocent girl free...<br /><br />directed by ethan wiley i was sat there in my house in front of my telly watching blackwater valley exorcism & i kept asking the same question over & over again, why do i do it. why do i keep sitting through all these awful low budget horror films that look like they were shot on a camcorder? right lets honest about this, blackwater valley exorcism is a complete total & utter unashamed rip-off of the exorcist (1973) & you literally tick off the major plot points that the two share. there's the possessed teenage girl who starts to get very horny & suggest inappropriate things, the demon that uses past misdemeanour's against other's, the worried parents, the way that the possessed girl is shunned by doctor's, the priest with a troubled past & the possessed girl is tied to her bed amongst other things. i suppose where blackwater valley exorcism is different (other than it's total crap) is that it tries to give all the character's some screen time & tries to get across how the situation is affecting them but it's so badly written & acted it just ends up being boring. the film starts with isabelle already possessed so we never knew what she was like as a normal person so we never really care about her or what is happening to her either, the rest of the character's are poorly written & fleshed out. at times i wondered whether blackwater valley exorcism was a spoof, there's a silly scene in which a vet tries to sedate the possessed isabelle with horse tranquilisers & after he states that she needs a 'little prick' he enters her room with a huge needle hidden behind his back! there are a few scenes in which people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect. the film has an uneven tone as a result as it goes between silly spoof & serious horror drama, or it did in my opinion at least.<br /><br />according to some text before the opening credits blackwater valley exorcism was based on 'actual events', yeah right actual events from 1973 that happened in a film called the exorcist... this piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a real priest. there isn't even any decent gore or exploitation to liven things up, there's a scene of a cut arm, there's a dead dog, someone is stabbed with a crucifix & that's about it. there's surprisingly no bad language in it either despite the demon trying to be offencive. i would imagine the only reason blackwater valley exorcism has an adult rating is because of one very brief scene in which a pair of breast's are seen. one pair of naked female breast's is not worth the time watching this or the money you might spend on it. there is zero scares, no atmosphere & a really amateurish feel to the whole film too.<br /><br />with a supposed budget of about $1,000,000 i must say that i am wondering where all the money went, the film looks ugly & cheap throughout. there are no special effects to speak of & the production values are rock bottom. the acting is very poor from all involved, genre favourite jeffrey combs gets near top billing during the opening credits but has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen time. even he must have feared how bad this was going to be has he hides behind a moustache & a terrible accent, he is better than this.<br /><br />blackwater valley exorcism is a complete rip-off of the exorcist without anything that made that film such a classic & the makers are thirty five years too late anyway. a total turkey from start to finish.
