i'm only going to write more because it's required. however, the summary i put at the top is way too wordy for what this film was. you pretty much know who's in on it from the beginning. in spite of its attempts at plot twists and turns -acting 'talent' trying hard to have looks of shock and dismay when a twist happens-, you never really need to wonder 'whodunit' in this 'mystery'.<br /><br />the more i write, the more i feel bad that i have to write so much in order to have a comment, but rules are rules. i really feel bad about saying this, but this is the lowest i've ever rated a movie... i think. it makes me wonder what i'm saving votes of 1 and 2 for. however, i thought this film deserved a 3, since i believe there was some talent in the film. johanna watts (or is it watson) did a pretty good job. she was crying and distraught in one part and i thought she conveyed that emotion well. the man who played the character that was 'the drummer' did well, too, for his short part.<br /><br />many of the actors did an 'ok' job. but the lead actor, david -forget his last name (terrible with names)- was pretty bad. i think he must have thought he was doing dramatic displays for 'the young and the restless' or 'days of our lives'. if you try, you can just picture him in a white lab coat, playing a doctor with multiple personalities on 'general hospital'. it doesn't help that the movie is even shot like a daytime soap. although, i'm pretty sure i could shoot this same movie with a camcorder; though without the obvious and soap'ish sound editing.<br /><br />first time i ever thought the money to rent this movie was wasted. though, i wouldn't watch it again, unless i was paid a large sum of money.
