the core issues at play (god & satan / good & evil) can be & should be tremendously compelling (as demonstrated through thousands of works of art/music/literature/film). end of days, unfortunately, is nothing but a 2dimensional cartoon. byrne's acting ability stands so obviously in sharp contrast to arnold's corresponding lack of ability and is further underlined by a plot filled with nothing but stereotypes.<br /><br />the single compelling scene occurs at the very beginning with the transformation of the gabriel byrne character and his subsequent interaction with his wife? girlfriend? it is both erotically charged & repellent -- modernizing the vampirish themes, the seductive power of evil.
