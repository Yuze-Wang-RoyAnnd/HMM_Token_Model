this has to be one of the all time greatest horror movies. charles band made the best movie of 96' in this little seen gem. highly realistic and , incredibly stylised- with a visual flair david fincher would envy, its not hard to see why band went on to make such classics as 'killjoy 2: deliverance from evil', 'the regina pierce affair', 'virgins of sherwood forest', and 'timegate: tales of the saddle tramps'.<br /><br />with a highly sophisticated story- a tiny body with a large head controls a family of weirdos who perform experiments on naked women, this movie may be a bit too much for younger viewers and is only for the most educated type of viewer, but for those who see it, band is able to convey subtle messages about the human condition through his masterpiece. the head is symbolic of the lost love and longing for one's inner self that we all must face at one point or another, and for this reason i was able to engage with this film on a deeply personal level. although many earlier critics have compared band's film to re-animator and other lesser works, this stands head and heels above the rest. it is gorier, but not pointlessly. the gore in this film is well crafted and used to enhance the storyline, rather than to just get a cheap shriek out of the audience. also, the special effects in this film are absolutely top notch, easily the best work done in a horror film since... well... ever! the work in this film makes savini's effects look like the work of a blind, limbless hobo.<br /><br />the only problem i have with this film is the copious amounts of full frontal nudity, which were ultimately unnecessary in achieving the composer's goal- to create a timeless epic that would forever go down in history as possibly the greatest film of all time. if it were not for this slight problem i would have given this film a perfect 10.
