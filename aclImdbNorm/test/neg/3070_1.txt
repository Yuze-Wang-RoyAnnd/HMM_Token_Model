any movie should have an idea; simple or more complex, it needs one... the problem with fragata,..it's once more, that when he decides to make a movie, he so anxious to do "whatsoever" that he forgets this main detail, and as result we have the characters doing whatever without any justification, behaving without justified reasons...they are simple puppets going along the movie on the flavour of the wind. it's boring and sad to see them appearing and vanishing like cards being discarded in a game. fragata always seem to have talent in advertising is own work...and that leads you to see what he did...but in the end there's always a big disappointment. it's not enough having a movie full of the "hot portuguese's pink magazine stars"...especially when half of them can't act...they only pretend to be funny. here my only good point goes to the actor helder mendes...one of the few non stars': he makes the effort to establish some credibility, and in such a messy movie without any direction (of any kind) i give him the credit for trying hard. but this movie its worth to check out as a manual of "how to not do a movie"...and if fragata's previous works where bad...this one it's a "masterpiece" in achieving the title of awful. in few words,..just check it out! it will make you good,...and if you homemade your family movies,...and always feel bad with your work...so just spend 30 minutes looking to this so "called" professional work...your home made stuff will look like powerful hollywood flicks compare to sorte nula.
