what if someone made a horror movie that was completely devoid of plot?<br /><br />well, i think it would probably end up a little bit like this one. i don't think i've ever seen a move was so steady it its slide from hackneyed (at the beginning) to complete crap (by the end). i only stuck with it, because i kept thinking it couldn't possibly get worse. well, up until the very end, "necrophagus"/"graveyard of horror" proved me wrong.<br /><br />who would have suspected that a movie with an undead lizard-man, evil grave-robbing cultists, and mad scientists tossed in for no discernible reason could suck this bad? one would think there'd at least be some humor value... but not here.
