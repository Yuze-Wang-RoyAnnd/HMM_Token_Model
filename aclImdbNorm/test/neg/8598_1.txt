the unfunniest so called comedy i've ever seen<br /><br />not a patch on the naturalism of the hilariously dare twin town<br /><br />vegas i ;like normally but this script is so dire so predictable so well english in the worst way (in recent years the english films have been awful all of them) ireland at least produced the commitments, scotland with braveheart and trainspotting 2 stand out great movies and wales had twin town, zulu, last days of dolwyn , torchwood, doctor who and under milk wood etc<br /><br />the comedy is paint by numbers, the actors are dead men walking because there is no characterisation and no originality and it's just so unfunny<br /><br />england is falling behind no matter how many grim up north movies they produce. it's the old class system that destroys english films. the oxbridge graduates spewing endlessly clich'ed scripts about working class people they've never lived with. it is pathetic. monty python wasn't funny, neither was anything from oxbridge.<br /><br />let guys like jonny vegas and peter kay, rob brydon, billy connolly or write their own dialogue and forget the archaic failed class system let the working class people and the real talent that comes through the system properly take over the writing and the british and english film industries will rise again what next prince edward to write a modern day oliver twist?
