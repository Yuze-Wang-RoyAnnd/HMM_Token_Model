on the face of it this film looked like it might be really good - it isn't.<br /><br />the cast is pretty good, but most of them seemed embarrassed by the whole thing. the real disaster in this film is not the flood, but the script. it attempts to include every clich'e in the book, all done incredibly poorly. the ending is very abrupt, but this is a blessing in disguise. congragulations if you make it that far.<br /><br />all three main male actors (carlyle, courtney and suchet) would surely agree that this is the low point in their careers. i hope they got paid a lot of cash, because none of their reputations come out in tact.<br /><br />the special effects are quite good, but the same thing was done to much better effect in the day after tomorrow.<br /><br />in short, a pointless exercise. don't waste your time.
