20th century fox's road house 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie. full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more. miscast is ida lupino in the leading role! lupino, a lady who was capable of exuding about as much sex appeal as a blood orange, is here under the illusion she is rita hayworth playing the part of a sexy bar-room torch singer. handsome cornel wilde as her lover is as wooden as usual and totally wasted is the talented celeste holm who's role is little more than a bit part. then we have richard widmark who has the most ludicrously written part in the picture! when we first see him he is a nice o.k. guy who runs a thriving road house. then suddenly - and for reasons that are not sufficiently made clear - he becomes insanely jealous of his manager (wilde) when the latter tells him that he is about to marry lupino. you see widmark wanted to marry her himself but - 1) he never proposed to her - 2) they never had a relationship (they don't even have anything that resembles a love scene together) and - 3)without telling anyone (including lupino) he has obtained a marriage license. wow! so how widmark was to achieve something like wedded bliss with lupino after such a "courtship" is anybody's quess. huh? well, when widmark goes to pieces over the whole affair so also does the movie i am sorry to say. from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical! his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing. he finally goes over the edge, becomes completely deranged and with a few tommy udo sniggers, he laughably goes gunning for poor cornel wilde before biting the dust himself.<br /><br />and if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors. there's not a single outdoor shot in the entire movie! added to this - 95% of the film takes place at night.<br /><br />besides an interactive press book and a photo gallery the extras also includes a featurette "widmark & lupino at fox". whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me! as far as i know they were never before together in a movie at fox or anywhere else! however this featurette is hosted by such heavy hitter know-alls as robert osborne, eddie muller, rudy belhmer and a few others who amazingly heap praise on this wearisome and cringe - inducing affair. all i can say then it must be me i guess. but "road house" up to now was a forgotten and buried noir and as far as i am concerned it should have remained so.<br /><br />fox would do better if they issued dvds of superior and thus far elusive widmark movies like "down to the sea in ships" (1949) and the colourful "red skies of montana" (1952).
