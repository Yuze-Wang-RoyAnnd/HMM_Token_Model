a terrible deception: controversial film, winner of the teddy in berlin 2003, mil nubes de paz turned out to be a fiasco. the actors are all reciting (well, they are not exactly actors); the film tried to be a high bet but ends up being a doubtful bet: it stays in the superficiality of two guys kissing and a guy whose lover is gone; it has no purpose: nothing to do with the homo-sexuality presented in other films (e.g. before night falls (2000) by julian schnabel). technically the only thing that works is the photography; otherwise, the camera is put in strange angles (to make it more `art-film') and the whole film runs in a black and white atmosphere. the film is so pretentious that bothers. i mean, it's good to be pretentious when you have talent to support it. or maybe it is that it's so art-cinema that it's incomprehensible. the story flows slowly, slowly, slowly. to me, more form than essence. superb edition? it was good. superb direction? don't think so: the film is weak. it was an interesting project. it's a shame. it's a flaw. one star out of four.
