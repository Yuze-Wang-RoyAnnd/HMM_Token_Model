there is a phrase by the experimental filmmaker nathaniel dorsky, who says some films are structured like a camera mounted on the head of a dog who goes down an alley, sniffing everything along the way.<br /><br />that's how this movie is. the structure is "kurosawa started out as a baby, then he became a kid, then a young man, then a movie director, then he started making 'masterpieces', then he grew old, the end." the word 'masterpiece' is used a lot in this film to describe kurosawa's output, without explaining *what* makes his films so good/great. just because the off-screen narrator reading a script says that a film is a masterpiece, are we supposed to kiss his rear-end and accept that a certain movie is one of the great works of art of the 20th century? and one more point. the voice of paul scofield is used as the voice of kurosawa, when excerpts from the director's memoirs are being read off screen. he brings pear-shaped shakespearean tones to the text...but why him?? if you were making a documentary about billie holiday, would you use dame judi densch as her voice????
