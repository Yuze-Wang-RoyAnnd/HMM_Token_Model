ok, to start with, this movie was not at all like the book. i read the book when i was 13 and since then it has always been my favorite. when i'm waiting for a different book to come out, this is the book i turn to to fill in the time. i have 3 copies for god's sake. anyways, i knew this was not going to be anything like the book but come on! they could have done a little better than this. i mean seriously if i wanted to watch american werewolf in paris or london than i would watch those movies. they took a perfectly good story and twisted it around into a copy of a story that has been told over and over again and quite frankly i'm tired of watching it. i mean hello the best part of the whole f*****g (sorry) story is she ends up with gabriel. he doesn't die. what was that about? and he's old in this movie. gabriel is supposed to be only 24 not 44 da** it. awww. and astrid who the he** came up with the idea of astrid being vivian's aunt no no no no. astrid and vivian hate each other. awwww. anyways yeah that was my little rant seriously pi**ed off. hope this helped.
