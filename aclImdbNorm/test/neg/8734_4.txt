although embryo could have been a potentially thought provoking examination of bioethics, it degenerates into a stereotypical frankenstein parable, putting across the by now monotonous lesson that there were some realms man was not meant to enter or study.<br /><br />scientist rock hudson is experimenting with ways to prevent miscarried babies from dying. after success with a dog, he immediately jumps to humans-violating medical ethics and any sense of plausibility-with the equally unrealistic assistance of a hospital administrator. his experiment works too well, with some decidedly unpleasant side effects.<br /><br />although barbara carrera is reasonably good in her role, and some of the animal training is spectacular, the film suffers from being too fantastical. even though a message at the prologue assures viewers that this represents contemporary technology, the scientific work depicted looks far fetched even for the twenty-first century, let alone the mid- 1970s. furthermore, the scene where carrera is able to find a cure for the side effects of bioengineering simply by typing a question into a computer is laughable.
