this is truly a re-make that should never have gotten out of the stable. it has two casts that are acting in entirely different strata. at the top of their game are joan plowright and maximillian schell. every nuance of the franks is in plain sight. at the rock bottom are melissa gilbert and doris roberts. i cannot imagine how schell and plowright manage to play so well when gilbert and roberts are working their anti-magic. gilbert ruins every scene she's in. it's like father knows best in the ghetto. she's ann frank light. her run at helen keller was thin but not awful. this is sacrilege. doris roberts makes mrs. van damm merely annoying. she is a completely inappropriate choice to play the sexually hungry woman whose flirtatious, dissatisfied presence caused so much trouble in het acherhuis. this needed to be played by a woman who could convince us that she at least remembered what it was like to voluptuous. her weight is not the problem. joan plowright could have played this part beautifully. roberts was on a career high when this was made, getting lots of press and many opportunities. her performance here displays her weaknesses as an actress shamefully.<br /><br />james coco and clive reville, have most of their scenes with gilbert and roberts , and , strong though they are, they are completely incapable of undoing the damage done by their partners. reville is a wily actor capable of the kind of iconic performance given by ed wynne in the original film. he gets no support from gilbert . she drain the color out of every scene. <br /><br />i've read with dismay the comments by those of you who grew up watching this version, filled with attachment to these performances. it's a lesson in how the version you see first attachs to you. it makes me reconsider my attachment to some inferior products i loved in my childhood. i encourage you to watch the original. it has very few weak spots and it's head and shoulders above this mess.
