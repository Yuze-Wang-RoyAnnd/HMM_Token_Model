*possible spoilers ahead*<br /><br />i'll only say what hasn't already been said here (and i'll continue this for the rest of my wwf/wwe comments).<br /><br />if you're going to have a women's title match, at least make it interesting, rather than just a squash to put over the current champion. i guess moolah couldn't handle an intense match but they wanted to have the legend in a wrestlemania.<br /><br />i thought the killer bees were wasted in wrestlemanias, especially here. i became a fan in 1989, about a year after the b. brian blair was gone and jim brunzell became a canvas back. so i didn't realize for a while that they were a top tag team, even top contenders.<br /><br />but i loved seeing bill fralic in the battle royal. he really came into his own here, creating a cocky heel character in a pre-match interview and even making an elimination in the battle royal. besides steve mcmichael and kevin greene, he is the only professional athlete from my generation with any respect for wrestling (anyone remember dennis rodman?). and what was with the hart foundation's ridiculous green tights?
