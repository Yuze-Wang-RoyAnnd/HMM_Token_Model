i don't usually watch hollywood dribble, but i was dragged along with some friends to see this one, which turned out to be amusing in places but totally devoid of any originality. don't worry, you won't have to think - tarantino-like storyline leaves enough over-obvious hints for us to correctly predict where this one's going about fifteen minutes before every "twist" - i sat there worrying that the film was building up fairly nicely for a hollywood flick but that it would have nowhere to go at the climax. and boy were my fears realised - ymca couldn't save this one, but liv tyler almost did. i suppose being male and in my twenties helped, but she delivered a really good performance - obviously she didn't have to do much except look absolutely stunningly over-the-top sexy, but what she did she did well! mccool's is certainly not going to go down as one of hollywood's great successes (or should i say "shouldn't" because the mainstream american film industry is not going anywhere at present, and hasn't for a decade at least, save the odd hit like american beauty, titanic and saving private ryan, and even those had major flaws), but if you're a teen male, do yourself a favour and see liv - she is one hot chick. rating: 5/10. see also: anything by quentin tarantino, any american teen film over the last decade, anything with sex as its main selling point.
