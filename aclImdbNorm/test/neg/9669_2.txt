a bad bad movie... terrible plot, hinges on bolo yeung's charater, but he speaks maybe 20 words in the entire movie and only has one fight scene - still in great shape considering he was also in the kung fu classic "enter the dragon" interesting to see william zabka ("johnny" from the karate kid) in another martial-arts role.
