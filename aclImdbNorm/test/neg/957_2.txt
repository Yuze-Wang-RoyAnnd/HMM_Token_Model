possible spoilers --<br /><br />i love dennis quaid and i like meg ryan. i was looking forward to seeing them together, being married and all, i wanted to see their on-screen chemistry. okay, that being said, i guess the fact that they are actors, their off-screen relationship didn't have to permeate their performances, especially with this script.<br /><br />how stupid can a professor be to glue himself to anyone. i don't remember the original, but i can only assume that o'brien probably was handcuffed to his leading lady, probably in a more inevitable way. if i were "bonded" to someone i'd be pretty angry. the crush i would have would definitely have dissipated quickly. meg showed not even a little annoyance only slight surprise. dennis would have to take me kicking and screaming. that whole section of the movie was so horrible -- especially meg having to go to the bathroom (#2) between dumpsters in the dark at night. ewww. no f****ing way! <br /><br />what's with dennis socking every single suspect in the movie. sock first ask questions later. not once, not twice but too many times -- i could have kept count if i were so inclined. <br /><br />the most interesting part of the movie was nick and his family drama. too bad that couldn't have become more of the plot. the assumed off-screen drama leading up to this tragedy. i think it could have been written in without distracting from dex' quest. <br /><br />my blame lies with the writer of this screenplay. unless the director and others doctored it up so much that it's unrecognizable.<br /><br />i won't even get into the real reason poor dex was murdered. how ludicrous is that. even when dex confronted the real killer and the reason was explained, (a true "film noir" moment) everyone on screen seemed bored. oh, _____ happened. oh. (yawn) "dex even says this is a silly reason for a triple murder. oh the tension, you could cut it with a spoon.<br /><br />if anyone but dennis had been in this movie, i'd have to give it 1/2 star (only because i really have seen worse), but in this case 1 1/2 stars.<br /><br />for dennis and meg stars, see anything else.
