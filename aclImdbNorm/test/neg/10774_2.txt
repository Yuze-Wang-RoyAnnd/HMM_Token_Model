i tried watching this movie, but i didn't make it past the first 15 minutes. it's a terrible disappointment, considering the cast, but i can't look past the fact that the dialogue is in english and some of the actors pretending to be indian are not even close (read: kristin kreuk). considering that india alone has 1/6th of the world's population and one of the biggest movie industries, i don't think it would have been hard for the film-makers to have found an excellent indian actress to play the part. and i don't say so because of some blind patriotism, but because it's absolutely and totally absurd for a non-indian to play the role of an indian/pakistani. now some people say that 'as long as she's convincing who cares?' but my point is exactly that she's not convincing and never can be - not due to her acting skills, but due to her ethnicity. for example, however good an actor tom hanks may be, he'll never be able to play an australian aborigine!<br /><br />but that is still minor to the biggest faux pas the film-makers made: having the dialogue in english. it totally destroys the mood, as well as any semblance of authenticity. had the same movie been made in native languages (hindi, urdu, punjabi) with english subtitles, this may have been an excellent movie. unfortunately, as things stand, i would not recommend anyone seeing it, apart from film students who want to study "what not to do" in movies.
