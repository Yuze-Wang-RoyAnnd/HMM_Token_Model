hi, today i looked this film because of the medium (5,6) imdb rating. i thought it would worth viewing. also the comments here were quiet good but after start watching this movie i quick realize that this movie isn't anyway near a 5,6 ! its just boring. you can describe the movie with some words also its just the standard horror movie story with all the standard horror movie scenes. i don't know why people still like those films or why they vote such films better then a 1-3 in imdb. just some examples <br /><br />bunch of people arriving from somewhere or going / driving to anywhere. they meet somehow on their journey strange people but hey maybe they are just nice so hang out with them. then a very important scene for every horror movie "oh my cell phone isn't working oh oh mine too .. is that strange but we don't need them so enjoy our ride ..." uhhhhhh our strange person is a strange psychopath better we all sit back and scream a while till he starts cutting parts from us or killing some of us. after a while the bunch of victims get a weapon or chance to escape ofcorse they never think about running away or even kill the psychopath if they got the chance they just talk about what to do until the psychopath got his weapon back with any of the handful of standard tricks they got in those films and all running back as usual ... screaming ... some more to kill ... oh and in the end it gets really exiting sometimes the bad guy wins sometimes some of the victim can escape wow great movies. ... ok if i never ever saw a movie of that kind i would say it is a movie which can be watched but if anyone ever saw any movie of its kind it should be just a boring waste of time because nearly everything in the movie you know before you even watched it because it every time runs like the standard horror movie shematic. .... mmm maybe there is a windows program out there? horrormoviemaker 2.0 ? you can just pull some adjustment buttons and get the new shuttle, saw45674, jeepers creepers kind of movie.
