"scarecrow gone wild: he's the death of the party!" need i say more? scarecrow gone wild got four out of ten stars from me for one simple reason: aside from the terrible acting, plot holes, cheap special effects, and anti-climactic whistling, it was cinematic gold! i think that this movie could have actually been really good, had the scarecrow turned out to be the baseball coach (as portrayed by the ever-so-brilliant ken shamrock). but then again, they would have had to cut those awesome "return of the jedi" electricity special effects.<br /><br />while watching this movie, my friends and i were convinced that it was in fact written by one of our friends, a stereotypical teen-aged boy. this movie has topless women, miserably fake gore, and dialog that could not have talked its way out of a paper bag, or in this case, a cornfield.<br /><br />if i could ask the filmmaker one thing, it would be this; "how much did you have to pay the teenager that wrote this for you?"
