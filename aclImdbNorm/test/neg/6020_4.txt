star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning <br /><br />danny (mel raido) is a lonely factory worker who tries to get by with his job and to be a good dad to his two daughters after a messy divorce from their mother (maxine peake.) but after an altercation with said daughters present at a working men's club, he uses a trip to their dance class to take a glance at louis (colin salmon) and his gang of hard men who train in the boxing gym/free weights section there and to train himself into a tougher, more assertive person. before long he's taken the philosophies of louis to heart and has joined him as a nightclub doorman as the 80s disco faze kicks in...but when associate sparky (scott williams) tries to do a sideline in drug dealing, everything turns pear shaped.<br /><br />as robert de niro once stated in the film a bronx tale 'there's no bigger tragedy than wasted talent.' the writer of clubbed had a good idea and a talent to make it into some sort of film...but without the ability, it seems, to put it all together into some sort of coherent film.<br /><br />as a brummie, some of the filming locations (especially a scene at the end outside the ring o' bells pub in moseley!) were quite easy and fun to spot...but the dour look of the cinematography is really a downer on things. some really poor acting, for instance lead actor raido with an indecipherable accent that's all over the place, and a hammy script with some misfiring dialogue are bigger problems for the film though. more established actors like peake and even telly favourite neil morressey are sidelined to very small supporting parts, while the disastrous raido and ronnie fox's lame villain take centre stage. williams does a poor man's sick boy from trainspotting impression, leaving salmon and shaun parkes seemingly the only performers left with any integrity from the whole thing, as the excessive, blood splattered violence (becoming a common trend for brit flicks!) takes over. truly a missed opportunity. **
