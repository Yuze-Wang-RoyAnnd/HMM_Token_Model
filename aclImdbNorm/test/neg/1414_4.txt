i liked the understated character that laura linney played in 'love actually', and she is very good in 'man of the year'.<br /><br />but wow. robin williams doesn't give that much of a performance, with a couple of minor exceptions this was weak. laura linney may not have been miscast, but either the editing raped her character, or this was just a sad performance by director barry levinson.<br /><br />and i think it was barry levinson that got old. so many weak performances, such uneven results have to be the fault of management.<br /><br />christopher walken and jeff goldblum are great in supporting roles. goldblum plays a sinister side with relish, and walken's combination of entertainer's manager and commentator for the film is wonderful.<br /><br />but the story is clich'e, the presentation looks like it could have (should have) been a very good picture, and too many actions are half-hearted. the pacing, story, and direction all come up weak, compared to, say 'head office' (spoof of 'secret of my success').
