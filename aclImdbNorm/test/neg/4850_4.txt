well...i like patricia kaas. she is a beautiful lady and an extremely gifted and versatile singer. her acting in this film is more than competent and from my point of view about the only redeeming feauture of this film. she very gently captures the essence of the lonely singer with a very serious helath problem. however what i tremendously dislike about the film is the shameless product placement for a well known french chain of hotels. the other thing is that the story seems to meander for way to long without really deciding what the film is about and what it wants to be. on a positive note you may argue that the film is not predictable but you could also say it's plainly boring because of the lack of cohesion. there are some nice shots in the film bujt you can't help thinking that all the parts just don't add up to anything at all. it really is a pity bevcause kaas really shines in this film.
