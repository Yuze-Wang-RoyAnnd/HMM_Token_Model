although this film has had a lot of praise, i personally found it boring. there are some nice brasilian sunsets and the characters are believable, but the story of how they interrelate, even if very unusual by our standards, is not interesting enough to sustain a movie this long. the central woman takes up with one man after another in a close knit way and putting the interests of her children first. as the tolerance of the various men is stretched, we see their characters develop. the story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent acting. it is a rare glimpse into the brasilian hinterland, far from the city, but hardly exciting enough to keep one's eyes open for.
