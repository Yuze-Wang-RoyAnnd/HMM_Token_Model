this was the worst movie my wife and i have ever seen. the only concessions is that we did not pay to see it at the movies as we rented this on dvd from the video store. simply - no plot worth mentioning (i only watched it 5 minutes ago and already i have forgotten), annoying characters played poorly by two-bit actors and if this was suppose a comedy i am still waiting to laugh. in fact the only laugh we got out of the movie was that we joked with each other that we agreed it was truly awful.<br /><br />put simply this movie was quite utterly pathetic and i warn others to not waste their time. a travesty of the national lampoon name , rating 0/10.
