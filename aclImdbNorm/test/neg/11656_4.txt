this was included on the disk "shorts: volume 2"--a rather dull collection of short films. shorts are among my favorite style of films but somehow the people assembling this second collection had a hard time finding quality content--and it wasn't nearly as good as the first volume or other shorts collections. <br /><br />this short film feels like it's woefully incomplete. there is a story, but so much in unanswered that the viewer, like me, feels a bit left out and unfulfilled.<br /><br />the film begins with a woman, her boyfriend and her westie (that's a dog, by the way) going to a lonely beach. the lady speaks with an accent that, at times, is a bit difficult to follow. given that i am hard of hearing, i sure would have loved if it had been closed captioned. anyway, the boyfriend goes for a swim while she naps. when she awakens, her dog is gone. she panics and makes the guy follow her all about looking for the dog. they spend most of the time arguing and being disagreeable. then, out of the blue, they stop to have sex. later, they find the dog--end of story.<br /><br />as far as the characters go, both seemed rather dysfunctional and unlikable. she was a fussy and demanding lady and he seemed to have contempt for her. when you wondered why they were together, their little sex break showed what bond kept them together.<br /><br />some might like the characterizations--i kept finding the people irritating and unreal--more like caricatures than people you might meet or know. also, the payoff for all this just isn't worth the wait (unless you want to see the guy naked).
