this is about some vampires (who can run around out in the sunlight), that are causing some problems down in south america. casper van dien is sent in with his team of commandos to investigate. the movie opens with van dien & co. walking through the jungle, and there's this huge black guy who just absolutely, positively cannot act. he speaks all his lines as if he's reading them off the cue-cards for the very first time. his voice is also so low that, well, it's positively hilarious. great way to get the movie started! anyhow, they run into some of our vampires, shoot them (this causes them to appear to die for about 20 seconds), and then of course they come back to life. van dien notices that one of them was impaled across a tree limb, and yells to his buddies to kill them with wood. the stunt work must be seen to be believed - the vampires are on wires that pull them up trees, which is supposed to make them look like they can climb really easily, but it just makes them look like they're bouncing around on bungee cords or something.<br /><br />yeah...anyhow, later on, the huge black dude is down in south america with some guys (van dien not included), and they're attacked by more vampires. it's really too bad these guys never heard of a crossbow, because it would seem to be the perfect weapon to kill the little bloodsuckers with, but instead they use big old wooden stakes that they try to impale the vampires with by hand. the big black dude ends up getting captured and he eventually becomes some big powerful vampire leader. van dien ends up battling him later on. it doesn't help that all through the movie, everyone forgets that if you shoot a vampire, they are knocked out for 20 seconds or so, which would enable a person to stick a stake in them fairly easily. they just try to stick stakes in them in the middle of hand-to-hand combat. yeah, not exactly brilliant tactics.<br /><br />there's a hot babe (remember veronica from the lost world tv show? yes, it's her!) who also happens to be walking around in the middle of vampire county on some sort of research mission, and she also just happens to be van dien's ex-wife. hey, what are the odds? it's a shame she's not in the movie a whole lot more than she is. will her and casper get back together in the end? will van dien defeat the huge black dude who can't act? will the circus performer vampires make you laugh through all the numerous action scenes? will we hear the three stooges music when somebody does something funny? has even lynda carter forgotten how to act in her small cameo (she's more convincing in her sleep number bed commercials)? these questions and more will will be answered if you make it all the way to the end of the movie.<br /><br />i don't know, it might score some points on the so bad it's good scale, but that's about it. eh, it's a bunch of goofs running around in the jungle, i guess it's kind of entertaining.
