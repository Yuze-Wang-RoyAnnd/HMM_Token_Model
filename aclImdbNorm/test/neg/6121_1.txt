this movie was a waste of time. it looks nice, pretty settings, nicely acted, appears earnest and seems to be leading somewhere so you stay tuned awaiting a meaningful payoff. it doesn't happen. <br /><br />it surprised me that so much effort could be put into a movie, it was clearly very professionally done, and have an outcome that seems nothing short of a b-movie.<br /><br />save your precious time and see a good french film like les visiteurs (funny), jean de florette or manon of the spring. i can't recall the language in europa europa, but that's another great film--heavy but very worth viewing.<br /><br />this film appears to promise a lot but delivers nothing.
