as i write this, no user reviews are in yet, but there are 17 votes with a 4.8 average, so apparently some people thought this movie had its moments. i didn't notice any, and even if i had i don't think i could have stopped rolling my eyes for long enough to appreciate them.<br /><br />a common debate among movie buffs is whether major mistakes in science, police tactics, and the like so common in b movies should detract significantly from one's enjoyment. i tend to fall into the "yes, that's a reasonable reaction" camp -- especially when the mistakes are central to the plot. with this movie, i look forward to reading how anyone can defend this mess. they completely botch pretty much every aspect of military tactics and strategy, police tactics, weapons, science, folklore, common sense, and human behavior (outside of b movies, that is.) in short, i can't think of any non-trivial thing they got right.<br /><br />any movie would have its work cut out for it when its central premise is a supernatural spirit, impervious to all small arms, able to disappear into another dimension at will, and yet apparently vulnerable to simply a bigger explosion. (they don't make ghosts like they used to.) combine this premise with every detail being wrong and you have a memorably bad movie.
