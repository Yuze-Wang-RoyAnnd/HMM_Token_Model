this is quite possibly the worst documentary i have ever seen. it looked so amateurish. chris hegedus was one of the directors of the war room which was a great movie (albeit a little one sided), but it looked beautiful. startup.com looked like it was shot in some guy's basement. the quality was so pitiful that i couldn't stand watching it. i saw about 30 minutes or so and i had to take it back to blockbuster and get something else. i can't understand how something so amateurish some from someone like chris hegedus. how the hell did this win any awards to begin with??? the war room definitely deserved an award, as did another great documentary called ameragosa (both won awards). this documentary looked like it was done by uncle joe who also does weddings on the weekends. shaky, dimly lit, unflattering lighting, bad sound, a 10 year old could make a better film than that guy did.
