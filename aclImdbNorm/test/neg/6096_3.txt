i can only assume the previous posts came from execs at the production company...<br /><br />attended the uk premiere last night. zane and brook attended (they probably knew i was gonna be there) and are undoubtedly stars, but what a turkey of a film. i felt sorry for them at times, when the audience erupted in laughter at what were serious 'thriller' scenes.<br /><br />but perhaps i was missing the point. perhaps an element of tongue-in-cheek was intended. if so, pure genius. if not, career genocide.<br /><br />on the plus side, zane always shines, and brook can actually act a little. as the other half said (as we ran out the cinema, avec broken ribs), they can be forgiven for this film as they both seem like nice people! the scriptwriter, however, should be marooned.
