i feel very generous giving this movie a 2 out of 10. okay, noted that the special effects are, 'okay' and renny harlin did make one my favorite genetically-altered-sharks-attack-a-research-station movie, that of which you may know as deep blue sea. also, the opening credits are done fairly well with a remix of whitezombie's "more human then human' and it does go fairly well with what is in the context of this 'movie'. but enough praise, lets get to the reason why this movie sucks so much.<br /><br />not since uwe boll's alone in the dark did i ever feel that the special effects in a movie were totally wasted. okay, our story starts with four guys who are descendants of four different families, each of which possess a never fully explained power from a never fully explained family background that did a never fully explained art of witch craft. oh and for some reason, these descendants are all 17, all go to the same school, are all on the swim team and all, for some reason or another, sit in bed with their shirts off, sweating and talking to each other on the phone. i have nothing against gays, gothic or thirteen year old's, but that is what this movie is aimed at...13 year old goth who question their sexuality. yeah there's girls in it who sit on their beds in their panties or whatever, but how come they don't take their shirts off? hey its only fair.<br /><br />anyways, the characters in this movie are told that when they turn 18, they will ascend and be granted new profound, almost god-like powers. but before i go any further, i forgot to mention that when they use their powers, they age slowly and they grow more addicted to it. that explains why they got people in their late 20's to play 17 year old's. oh and if something needs explaining, don't worry, someone will explain it all in one large piece of dialog. god this movie sucks...where was i? oh yeah, the ascension part.<br /><br />okay, apparently there was a super-secret-alpha-one family that the others forgot about or some s#*t like that, i don't know, i was dozing off at this point. but they were written out some how and the new kid at school who is befriending the group is 'secretly' one of these descendants from the fifth family. and i say 'secretly' because anyone who has seen any of the previews of this movie knows that this new guy is the bad guy. he has greater power then the others because he's older i think. anyways, bob loblaw (say it out loud) things happen and we get to the final fight in the movie.<br /><br />to be honest, i was all game for a witch battle. you know like saurmon vs. gandalf or anything along the lines with magic battle, because you know, this is about witches and stuff. now, when these two witches throw down, its more of like...how can i put it...a very, very crappy version of a dragonball z type battle. they throw stuff at each other, talk, throw stuff, talk, throw stuff, talk etc. when i say 'throw stuff' i only say that because i have no clue what the f#%k their throwing at each other. it looks like big gobs of slimy water. god this movie sucks, anyways, when our main witch 'ascends' he doesn't get very powerful at all. he just throws bigger gobs of slimy water. things happen and it ends in a way that you as the viewer know its gonna end. the good witch wins bad witch loses.<br /><br />you know how shitty a movie is when the bad guy says something so incredibly stupid as, 'i'm gonna make you my wiotch' thats where i wanted to punch myself in the face for sitting through this whole...thing.<br /><br />yes, i admit, the thought of witches doing battle, using powers in the modern day does sound kinda cool, but when the execution is this bad, i really wished they didn't make this movie. maybe if it was r-rated, had tit's and threw in more deaths with a dash of gore, it might have worked...might have worked.<br /><br />if your interested in watching this, don't buy it or even rent it. wait for it to come on tv or borrow it from your sucker of a friend who bought it. just don't waste your time with this hack of a movie. if you spend any money on it, there's a good chance your putting an effort towards a sequel to be made by uwe boll called, the covenant 2: alone in the dark with the house of the dead.
