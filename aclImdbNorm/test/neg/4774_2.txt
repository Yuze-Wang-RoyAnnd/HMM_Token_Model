it had potential...it really did. but there is so much about the movie that was ridiculous and laughable. i'm a horror movie weenie and i thought it was stupid; as did my 13-year old! i was expecting to be at least creeped-out. and, yes, the gross-factor of the vines squirming in the people was there; however, the lead-up to getting to the ruins is just dumb, dumb, dumb.<br /><br />i mean really who goes on a hike...in a jungle... with a total stranger... with a little water and a few snacks...in flip flops, no less?! puh-lease! better still who goes to a foreign country and leaves the tourist area without an interpreter or being able to speak a bit of the language? are these people complete morons?<br /><br />the german's brother isn't heard from and he doesn't call for assistance? who doesn't do that? he just finds some greeks and americans to go on a little search and find?
