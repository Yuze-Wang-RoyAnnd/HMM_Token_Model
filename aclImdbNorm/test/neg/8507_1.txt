debbie boone had a monster hit with her recording of the pop song "you light up my life;" the didi conn film of the same name, however, was a horrifically embarrassing flop. conn plays the stereotypically goofy-homely-vulnerable girl who is in love with michael zaslow, who plays the stereotypical yuppie-wannabe guy. they are engaged, but every one knows that zaslow isn't going to marry any one that isn't blonde and built, so only didi is surprised when he dumps her. needless to say, didi is quite embarrassed.<br /><br />fortunately, she has been doing a little songwriting in her spare time, and she's come up with a tune she thinks is pretty nifty. she calls it--can you guess?--"you light up my life." she hops in the car and drives off to the big city to sell her song and make a new life. now, i recall sitting in the theatre and watching her hop in the car to drive off to the big city, and thinking "well thank heavens, we've finally got all the exposition out of the way. now maybe something interesting will happen." and something interesting did happen. the credits rolled.<br /><br />yep, that was it. not only was the movie badly acted, badly written, and badly filmed, it also ended in the middle. this movie is a really, profoundly bad movie, and we're not talking cult-movie-bad here. we're talking unmitigated flop, a real yawner from start to finish. if you liked the debbie boone song by all means buy a copy of it. but don't waste your time or money on this flick. this is one movie you'll be glad you missed.<br /><br />gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer
