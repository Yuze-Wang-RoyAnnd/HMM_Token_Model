the story is: a turn-of-the-century troupe of actors, along with producers and theatre-owners, have very complicated relationships. a resident playwright has written a psychological drama. he wants to get a good production on stage, but can't unless he convinces a pariticular reviewer to revisit the production, and give a positive review. if his production does not go on, then the troupe will put on the doll house, recently written by ibsen. many different relationships among the principals are explored; none of them interesting. but the involvement of the characters with one another lead to giving the play by the resident playwrght a second shot.<br /><br />this movie is purely an excuse for the director and his friends to get together and put on a movie. the story lines are incoherent to anyone who isn't a buddy of one of the stars. the only reason i didn't leave the theatre after about a half hour is that a fat lady was resting a full meal atop her stomach at the end of my row.
