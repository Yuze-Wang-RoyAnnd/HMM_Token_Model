i really hoped for the best with this one, but it just didn't happen. financed at a very non-dutch manner and still looking great, with a style and pace that's very much like hollywood. what i don't understand is how-with all these great benefits- the director,writer,producer still managed to make this film a completely horrible picture to watch. filled with bad jokes, cheap nudity and actors that just can't really talk [act] in the english language. kudo's for pulling it off, but what was this guy thinking!
