try as i might, i just simply couldn't get into this one. perhaps it was the washed out tones; perhaps it was the drawn-out approach--i'm not really sure, but though this was by no means a "bad" movie, i didn't really find it to be very much of an "effective" movie (words that i understand are so much more arbitrary than their common uses).<br /><br />so, basically, the deal here is that a series of adolescent boys' deaths sets off an investigation and anxiety in a small provincial town, triggering a witch hunt. what do the boys' death have to do with the mysterious, sexy woman who has appeared in town? is the crazy hermit woman involved? is it voodoo? the story is a mixture of crime drama and horror as the various townspeople are all suspect and corpses keep appearing while bloody violence ensues.<br /><br />good enough, but to me, most of it fell a little flat. oh, it had it's moments... the one boy walking in on a beautiful naked seductress was pretty good, and the scene where the fathers beat the hermit was a bitter commentary (even if the effects themselves failed, considering her skin seemed to peel off as if they were whipping her with red-hot irons).<br /><br />my biggest issue was the ending. i've already put spoiler tags on this review, but be warned, here's the big spoiler: i don't believe it. i don't believe that a priest could convince himself to kill young boys for becoming sexually aware without some hint of that psychosis appearing earlier, with other boys, with a history, or some other personal affect. the movie didn't really earn its ending. end spoilers.<br /><br />nonetheless, fulci is a big name and i'm more than certain there's an audience out there for this. i definitely need to check out more that he's done, because this may have been a poor introduction. most italian giallo is hit-or-miss anyway, so i'm waiting to see what else this guy can do before writing him off.<br /><br />--polarisdib
