i just attended a preview screening of this film. a masterpiece of documentary film-making it was not. totally absorbed with its subject, the film becomes incapable of leveling any sort of critical commentary with regard to ms. faye. cloying and sappy, the only redeeming quality of the film was its use of puppets in an attempt (albeit a failed one) to structure some kind of narrative. but the creepiest experience occurred as the closing credits rolled. the audience rose and applauded. like moths to flame, americans in the 21st century are still drawn to freakshows. the narrative of the misunderstood monster is getting rather tired.
