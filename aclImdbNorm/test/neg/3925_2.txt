this movie is poorly written, hard-to-follow, and features bad performances and dialog from leads jason patric and jennifer jason leigh. the premise, believable but weak (undercover narcotics agent succumbs to the drug underworld) deserved better than this lili fini zanuck flop. the competent supporting cast (sam elliott, william sadler, others) was not enough to save this film.<br /><br />in addition, this movie also contains the absolute worst "love" scene in cinema.<br /><br />moreover, the soundtrack is vastly overrated; specifically the revolting, sappy-without-substance "tears in heaven" by the otherwise legendary eric clapton.<br /><br />"rush" is wholly unenjoyable from beginning to end.<br /><br />2 of 10
