an absolutely baffling western featuring flash-forward sequences set in an insane asylum, south of hell mountain was one of the first films produced by the schlockmeisters at cannon film. co-directed by william sachs, who would later deliver such fan favourites as the incredible melting man and galaxina, the film tells the very dull tale of a trio of gold robbers who stumble upon a cabin occupied by two women who are hiding some secrets that aren't worth discovering. the cast (most of whom never made another film) try gamely, but are hamstrung by the screenplay, which generally makes no sense. the asylum scenes are edited in to little effect and are punctuated by ridiculous sound effects and tape loops. ultimately, it's a lot of talk and little else.
