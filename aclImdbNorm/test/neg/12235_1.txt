this movie is a terrible attempt at a spoof. its attempts to parody various sports movies are half-baked and not at all funny.<br /><br />even things that should be funny - like the female kicker from india who's always wearing traditional dress over her uniform - aren't really funny. the fact that the football team studies and gets good grades which makes the coach mad didn't get any laughs either.<br /><br />the plot of having a traditional loser get one more chance by coaching a loser high school football team really had potential as a spoof. it's a classic and trite sports theme. but alas, the screenplay was too weak for any cast to pull it off. and this cast is no exception.<br /><br />there is gratuitous use of women in bikinis and underwear, so it's not all bad from that aspect.<br /><br />but animal house or talladega nights, this is not.
