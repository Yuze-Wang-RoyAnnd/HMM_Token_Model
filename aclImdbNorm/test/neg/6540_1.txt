"the puffy chair" was a supreme waste of 84 minutes of my life which cannot be retrieved and spent in a more worthwhile way (even "the blair witch project" was a better use of life's precious moments). it must be called "the puffy chair" because only 'puffy' chairs could accommodate the extremely 'puffed-up', self-important brothers who drooled it out for public consumption; and, obviously, they are so full of themselves that they have assumed the public would actually want to consume their drool. "the puffy chair" made "the wooly boys" seem like a cinematic masterpiece! "valley of the dolls," "beyond valley of the dolls," "pink flamingos," "texas chainsaw massacre," "night of the living dead," "urban cowboy," "the blob," -- all of these would be a better use of one's time, than viewing "the puffy chair." the characters portrayed are either too predictable or too lacking in normal, emotional reflexes to even come close to being likable or believable. also, at one point in the film, while the characters are supposed to be in the same small town, if one watches closely, one can see that one part of the town is apparently in the southern united states, and the other half is located in maine. that's some town, eh?
