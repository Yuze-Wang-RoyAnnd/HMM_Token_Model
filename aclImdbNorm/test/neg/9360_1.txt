i have no respect for imdb ratings anymore. i think a bunch of mormons flooded the website and voted for this. this is not an artistic movie, it is mormon propaganda. nothing wrong with that, but the plot outline and the way it is described is totally misleading. if you are a bible thumping christian or a mormon, watch this movie, you'll love it and think it is truly amazing. for anyone else, don't bother, the story is so contrived, random stuff happens that really doesn't follow in a coherent way. this guy tries to commit suicide cause he sleeps with his neighbor. are you kidding? what a pussy! anyways, this is an awful movie.
