from the acclaim it got i was expecting more from a korean horror if it's going to be viewed in the same caliber as a tale of two sisters, as some other reviews have stated. this movie isn't in the same caliber except in budget spent on special effects. think amytiville horror. with a tree and sparse dialogue.<br /><br />if you're going to have a movie with limited dialogue, the plot line and characters have to carry the film. this film could have been told quite well in a 30 minute short film concept, 2 hours with a lot of staring at trees and terror scenes that make you not only not scared, but detract in a "what the..." sort of way does not a good horror movie make.<br /><br />those people who are stating that this film gave them lasting impressions must literally have heart attacks when decent horror films lay it in.
