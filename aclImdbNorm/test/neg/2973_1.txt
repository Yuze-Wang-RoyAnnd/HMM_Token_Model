"how!?!" i hear you ask, i will proceed, as we have learnt from the review of donkey punch (2002) irene via sly nudges and dirty winks etc tried in vain to teach the slight peculiarities of checkers to all the angry sherpas. sherpa 5 who is known only for his violent tirades against democratic principals during the post revolutionary years of the now united states of america and it's consequential affect on the mind sets of it's population in the post modern empire that now exists, through the invasions of countries smaller than it, got carried away in a river of violence due to his lack of comprehension of checkers. according to an eye witness , he sprung around like a feckless banjo string at mardi gras wielding a stick with nail through it, after the struggle that ensued 5 llamas were each found to be missing their left testicles, 3 sherpas were discovered spooning beneath a gooseberry bush and sherpa 5 had the nail stuck in his big toe.<br /><br />a sherpas lifestyle is as modest as a nuns, with only rudimentary health care facilities at 15000 ft above sea level. consequentially when the first aid hut was opened only an iou for a tin of spam, and some crotchless knickers were found. sherpa 5 hopped around like a dark on a noose in agony, until irene burst forth like a cock from a hen house and suggested soaked his ailment in llama spit. sherpa 5 agreed to the procedure , to sedate him, a bottle of 100 yr old glenfiditch was produced, some say it was left by an angry scotsman, who is thought to be an ancestor of the angry sherpas. one under the influence, the toe was bathed until ridged, dressed with irenes slightly soiled diaphragm and some blue tack. some of you may feel that this procedure wouldn't do the sherpa any good and you would be fully vindicated for holding that view. only four days later gangrene set it and a week later the leg was removed through the use of even tighter elastic bands
