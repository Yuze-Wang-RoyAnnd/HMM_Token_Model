the star packer is one of about 152,000,000 westerns that john wayne acted in during the 1930s. well, the number is a bit exaggerated, but it seemed almost like this many. this is because these b-movies were quickly made with very low budgets in order to be the second, or lesser, feature in a theater. most bs were pretty cheap and tended to cut corners to keep down costs and the star packer is no exception. to save on costs, incidental music is not used, running times were kept to under an hour, the writing was often rather derivative and the actors are mostly lesser talents--and wayne himself was definitely far from being a household name at this time. some of these wayne features are pretty good, while others, like this one, are watchable but also rather silly and inconsequential. i enjoyed this film and most of the others, but it's probably because i cut bs a lot of slack.<br /><br />wayne stars as john travers--a us marshall investigating the actions of a local gang out to chase locals out and steal from the stage. this is odd, as the film was apparently set in the modern time or close to it, as they used telephones and modern machine guns--things you just wouldn't expect to find in the old west. such anachronisms are actually pretty common in b westerns--as gene autry films (for example) abound with them. wayne's sidekick is yak--played by stuntman and real life friend of wayne, yakima canutt.<br /><br />the bad guy is an unknown figure referred to as "the shadow" and he dispenses his instructions through a black screen that hides his face! this sounds exactly like a character from a movie serial--the sort of baddie that kids loved but grownups groaned at because they were so silly and at bit like blofeld or dr. evil! the problem is, if you listen to his voice and pay any attention at all, it becomes obvious early in the film that this "shadow" is george hayes. now speaking of hayes, this is the same guy who later in films was known as gabby hayes, but here and in several other of wayne's early films, he looks and acts nothing like gabby. in the star packer, he was well dressed, articulate and clean-shaven--imagine that! in real life, apparently this was more the real george hayes--though i doubt that he was evil! now as you can tell from the last paragraph that there really is no mystery in this film. you are left with acting (passable and nothing more) and stunts--which were actually pretty amazing. again and again, one amazing stunt after another occurred--such as men jumping from horse to horse and some great fight scenes--all done, by the way, by canutt and his friends. canutt was often john wayne's double in films--and this went on for decades. the problem with some of the stunts, however, is that it appears that the film makers actually killed a few horses to get those great "stumbling horses" bits seen later in the film. up until about 1940, film makers often strung thin metal wire and ran horses across it at full gallop! in the process, the horses' legs were usually broken and the horses were subsequently euthanized! one of the worst examples of this was the film jesse james--where several horses were brutally killed--leading to the american humane association insisting that a representative of the organization be on film shoots to certify that animals are not hurt in the production. so, since about 1940, films bear this little disclaimer. the star packer was made well before the disclaimer and i can't see how the horses did these "tricks" without being killed.<br /><br />overall, this is at best a time-passer due to a poor plot, occasionally poor acting and an unbelievable cruel attitude towards the horses. i am no bleeding heart, but just can't understand this disregard for a poor old animal.
