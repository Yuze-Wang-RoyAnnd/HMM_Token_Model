i generally love this type of movie. however, this time i found myself wanting to kick the screen. since i can't do that, i will just complain about it. this was absolutely idiotic. the things that happen with the dead kids are very cool, but the alive people are absolute idiots. i am a grown man, pretty big, and i can defend myself well. however, i would not do half the stuff the little girl does in this movie. also, the mother in this movie is reckless with her children, to the point of neglect. i wish i wasn't so angry about her and her actions because i would have otherwise enjoyed the flick. what a number she was, take my advise and fast forward through everything you see her do until the end. also, is anyone else getting sick of watching movies that are filmed so dark. anymore, one can hardly see what is being filmed. as an audience, we are impossibly involved with the actions on the screen. so then, why the hell can't we have night vision?
