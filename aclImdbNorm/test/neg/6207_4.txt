this is another bollywood remake of a hollywood movie. hitch...if i'm correct.<br /><br />the film has some great moments which will have you laughing out loud which frankly only come from govinda who has become a legend within indian cinema and will always bring his a game in terms of comedies. another bonus is rajpal yadav; who is hilarious as the gangster who mimics 'don', an indian icon of cinema. lara dutta is a plus...i know i sound shallow but its mainly because i have a soft spot for her, she tries to be funny but its seems to be forced. her acting is weak...but she still shines. salman khan is atrocious, he tries to bring the cool, charming depths but fails miserably, he over acts and keeps shouting for no apparent reason. <br /><br />'thats not acting mate, thats called being mentally challenged'<br /><br />katrina kaif is just bad...not very good at anything. no charisma, no talent..and i don't see why people consider her pretty... the plot was far fetched and i had a hard time believing that katrina's character was remotely attracted to govinda. the only good thing is the music...'you're my love' was the best in the soundtrack.
