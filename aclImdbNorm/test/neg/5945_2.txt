my father insisted i should watch this film with him and i regret that i wasted my time watching--i want that approximate hour and a half back! the "funny" little film concerns the elderly don ameche staying with his son, tom selleck. it turns out that ameche isn't just "forgetful" like he's been told, but has dementia (it seems a lot like alzheimers). and, because dad is so frequently "out to lunch" he gets into so much trouble again and again--almost like the adorable tyke from baby's day out. the problem, though, is that you know baby's day out is all fantasy and the baby is going to be fine. plus, you aren't laughing at the baby for having a deformity or illness. but, in this case, you are being encouraged to laugh at a man who is slowly losing his mind--and where's the humor in that?! if this film had been more successful, would the producers have then made films making fun or people with cerebral palsy or a flesh-eating virus?!?! there are a lot of people who should have felt ashamed at having made this film.
