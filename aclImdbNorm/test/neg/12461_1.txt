for the first time in reviewing films, i found myself immediately uninterested in this story. i don't know if it was the way that it was filmed or the story behind the characters, but it felt bland, overused, and completely unoriginal. within the first thirty minutes, i found myself rather apathetic with all the characters and the story. i felt as if i had seen this structure before, and tart was providing nothing new to surprise me. after thinking that it may just be my mood, i stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning, but the same feeling persisted. i just didn't care. that is not a good sign. the characters were bland. when i say bland, i literally mean that by watching them develop, you will never have any flavor hit your palate. the story seemed recycled, nearly to the point of plagiarism. now, i am not saying that christina wayne stole this story, but she added nothing fresh to the perspective. the casting was horrid, the underlying symbolism and themes were so far lost that no critic could find them (nor the characters), and the stories were vague and sloppy. you knew nothing about anyone or anything, and instead of pushing more emphasis on the characters, we instead found ourselves with drugs, minor sex, and money pushed into our faces. these are themes we have seen in every film since the dawn of film time, yet somehow could not be creatively captured by wayne.<br /><br />what immediately pulled me away from this story? it was mainly the characters. i have seen most of brad renfro's work, and honestly he needs to redefine himself. director larry clark has defined him, and oddly he cannot get out of that stereotypical character. within the first twenty minutes of renfro's screen time i was bored. i knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why. it was spectacular nor impressive, just repetitive. he needed to bring some excitement or suspense to his role, instead of just blandly playing this random socialite. without a strong character, the final climax of this film comes instead as a letdown. renfro did not showcase the best of his abilities in this film. while i am on the subject
