you know, as you get older, you somehow think the movies you did not like when you were younger, might have been because of your youth and inexperience. case in point, when i saw the godfather at age 14, i thought it was boring. 20 years later, its an incredible movie to me. in other words, i grew up and began to appreciate great movies.<br /><br />so i rented dirty dancing with my girlfriend last night on her request, as she loved it at age 14 and i hated it at the same age. but i hoped, because i was young and stupid at age 14, perhaps this would be a new experience for me. so i sat down with her to watch, hoping to be enlightened.<br /><br />well, the night after watching dirty dancing, i feel a violation. i feel like someone reached into my soul and robbed me of 2 hours of my life from watching this cheese fest.<br /><br />first, patrick swayze plays a 20 year old, but he looks like he is 35. and the premise of the movie is him seducing some underage teenager, wooing her with his dance moves. really creepy.<br /><br />anyway, the movie is the clich'e plot where the "wrong side of the tracks" guy and the "rich smart girl" accidentally fall in love with each other. of course, their romance is fueled by the fact the "rich girl" can't dance a lick, so the "poor hero" teaches her in a week to become an expert dancer for the big end of vacation show, or something like that.<br /><br />but you guessed it: the disapproving father soon enters and forbids the two to see each other, and the movie progresses to secret meetings of dance lessons and love making. this all culminates into the final scene where the entire resort rallies around the two young lovers while the once antagonistic father accepts the 35 year old dancer as his teen daughter's new man.<br /><br />even my girlfriend whimpered at the end of the movie as she admitted it was not anything like she remembered. i didn't press her, but i did smirk a little, and put the godfather part ii in the dvd player.
