"dogmatic," as another reviewer described this film, is a fitting word. the director's idea was to present bach without plot, acting, fun, theatrics, dialog, narrative, or drama. mission accomplished, monsieur straub. "pretentious?" yes. "cinematic?" no way. this is anti-cinema. no one moves. hardly anyone talks. the camera holds static shots for 10-12 minutes at a time: very very occasionally the camera will dolly in. you may catch a glimpse of gustav leonhardt's fingers moving over the keys. that's it.<br /><br />if you like the idea of staring at the back of a harpsichordist's (bewigged) head for 7 minutes at a stretch while listening to bach, this is the film for you. i'd rather listen to bach on my stereo with my eyes closed.
