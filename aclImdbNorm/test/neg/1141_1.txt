i'm a big fan of the "vacation" franchise, and i love randy quaid as cousin eddie, and at least a couple of the behind-the-scenes names were involved in this project (most notably matty simmons, who produced or executive-produced all 4 of the theatrical releases, as well as "animal house"). for those reasons i figured this made-for-tv spin off might be worth checking out, even without chevy chase.<br /><br />for the record, i did not expect it to be very good; i just thought it might be a slightly amusing diversion. therefore, my high level of disappointment goes to prove just how bad this utter turd of a movie really was. it was mind-numbingly, jaw-droppingly, heart-stoppingly, head-explodingly terrible. yet, somehow, i could not stop watching it. it's a sickness i have; i can't seem to walk out on a film or give up on a tv show before it ends. nothing has ever made me want two hours of my life back more than this movie.
