the expert, starring jeff speakman, is the definition of dull!!!<br /><br />dull, characters, dull situations, dull direction, dull actors, dull cinematography, dull music.<br /><br />i don't really understand this movie. is it supposed to be an action movie? it's almost as if speakman wanted to be in a serious movie but the level of acting and writing found in the expert is below your average tv drama. and there are some typical "speakman pummeling bad guys" scenes here and there but the main aspect of the movie relies on some sort of believable drama, which is totally wrong for speakman or is so badly directed that it just doesn't work with the action star. in the end, this confused movie looks and feels very nondescript and bland. the worst aspect of the expert is the music. the composer is a jerry goldsmith wannabe, with his pompous and melodramatic score, which simply doesn't belong in this kind of (dull) movie. it's as if the producers knew they had a very dull product on their hands and they asked the composer to make the film feel more compelling and dramatic with his score, which makes the entire movie look even more confused, goofier and dull.<br /><br />don't waste your time watching this, even if you're a jeff speakman fan.
