folks! is a "comedy" about a man whose parents beg him to kill them because they're going senile and want to be put out of their misery. several times he tries to kill them and then changes his mind, saving them from his death-traps at the last minute and losing one of his body parts each time in the process. the movie seems to hate its main character, which makes it all the more painful to watch. there's also the usual tacked-on love-interest and predictable ending.<br /><br />this movie was also the first time i'd seen tom selleck without a mustache, and i remember his shaved upper lip looking weird and making me feel slightly slick. but this might have been just because of the terrible premise and lame execution of the movie.
