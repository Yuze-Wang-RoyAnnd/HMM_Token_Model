i hoped for this show to be somewhat realistic. it stroke me as just another mainstream show after i watched it. i didn't feel the characters at all, is this americas glamorized idea of how terrorism operates? the main character doesn't act like a fundamentalist at all, and how he passes for a terrorist is beyond my comprehension. neither of the other terrorists managed to appear genuine. one of the members, a blonde all-american white boy, would never be accepted by muslim terrorists in real life. another member, a french ex-skinhead, doesn't quite fit in an islamic terror movement. on top of this the terrorists have sexual relations to white american housewives, which i find very strange. this is just another stupid misguiding american tv show. it is about just as realistic as prison break.
