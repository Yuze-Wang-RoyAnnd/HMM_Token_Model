firstly, i am a huge fan of crap films. b grade is always good for a laugh. unfortunately this film is just plain bad. i dressed up as a zombie for a party and my make up looked better than the ones in this film. especially the big guy at the beginning, it just looked like a kid had drawn on his face with crayons.<br /><br />the acting is so bad i need not comment on why. the effect are also extremely amateurish, with obvious blood tubes firing a straight jet of blood out the back of zombies heads when they get shot. <br /><br />it also seems many people commenting on this movie are trying to boost the rating. nobody without their finger in the pie would rate this film above a 5/10. frankly it is disgraceful that people who worked on this film are boosting their own ratings.<br /><br />i suggest everyone avoid this movie, it isn't worth wasting the 90 minutes of your life.<br /><br />absolutely awful.
