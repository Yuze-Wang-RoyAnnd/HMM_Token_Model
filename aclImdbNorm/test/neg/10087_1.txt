this is by far the most vapid, idiotic, insanely stupid show that has ever been on the air, and this is coming from someone who remembers "san pedro beach bums".<br /><br />my wife loves watching reality shows--and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a "walk". the end result was straight out of monty python's "ministry of silly walks" sketch. i couldn't laugh hard enough.<br /><br />and then there's the ubiquitous ms. banks (as in laughing all the way to the...). she has to be the most annoying self-important woman on tv since rosie o'donnell left "the view". as if modeling was doing great things for mankind. please. i've never found her attractive, and i don't find her intelligent now that she has the temerity to open her mouth.<br /><br />someone needs to tell these human clothes hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women.
