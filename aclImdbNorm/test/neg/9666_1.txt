i got this for my birthday in a box set under the name broke skull. well, after watching one on the dvd and being pleasantly surprised, i popped this sucker in. it was worse than i had expected, and i didn't expect much. this movie is basically a convoluted story about a guy who dies and comes back to life with the mob, and other bull crap. there was some interesting ideas in this that were never followed up on. now everybody has been saying there was a lot of gore, can somebody tell me were? i saw a bad effect of a head being crushed, brain tissue (or something...), and blood coming from the penis area two times. i have to say the the part were the guy gets his man hood bitten off made me squirm, that was the only good thing about this movie. and that gay sex scene was just thrown in there for no reason. the acting in this was atrocious, really, it blew. that asian chick was annoying, then the annoying mexican boyfriend who comes in to just be killed. i say if you get this in a box set, that is fine, but don't spend any money on it, at all.
