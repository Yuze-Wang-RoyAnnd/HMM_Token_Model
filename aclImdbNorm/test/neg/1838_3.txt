i was looking forward to this movie as everyone was talking about it as being a good horror movie, and finally an european one. so, maybe my expectations were to high.<br /><br />it begins with a good quiet horror/shock sequence but it lets you down right away in the following scenes, where the plot begin being introduced, as the acting and the motivation/life of the characters reveals itself no better than any 'made for tv' drama. it keeps that way right into the end.<br /><br />about the horror part of the movie, it is certainly a good idea and a different one, but all the scenes are of the 'seen it before' kind.<br /><br />overall, my idea of this movie was that it had a good concept, which was inserted into a mediocre story, bad acting and less than tolerable plot holes.<br /><br />
