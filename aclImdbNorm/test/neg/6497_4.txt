i saw this ego-centric "effort" at achieving a film of "epic" status in the company of several native russian family members. five people gave 5 different reactions, from mikhalkov worship to my cynicism.<br /><br />i saw a movie that looked like mikhalkov took a lot of "canal +" money, put some of it in his (and other's) pockets and turned the project over to a bunch of film students. i counted at least 4 different "styles" in the movie. there is no way that the same director is responsible for these different scenes. contrast these for yourself:<br /><br />.cadets polishing shoes with a dog.<br /><br />.train station scene (saying goodbye to andrei).<br /><br />.outdoor panorama shots.<br /><br />.ormond talking through the keyhole.<br /><br />.initial attempt on the grand duke and later chase scenes to get andrei back to sing in figaro.<br /><br />.fencing sequence<br /><br />julia ormond is faster than superman. learning about his transfer belatedly, she gets all the way across moscow in one minute to say goodbye to andrei.<br /><br />the russian natives felt that the impression given of russian life was "caricature" and not history. they called it "tourist postcard" russia.<br /><br />they were all proud that a russian director/producer/fixer has managed to break into the "big time" and be able to waste over 30 million dollars of other people's money while maybe putting a little into local pockets during filming.<br /><br />if you want to "think" you have seen russia go see this movie. drink some coffee before you go.
