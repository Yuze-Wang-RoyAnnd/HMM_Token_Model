typical steven seagal fare: that is, it's crap. the plot relies on a series of incredibly improbable coincidences; there's a hefty dose of conspiracy theory which would be much more palatable if we didn't know that seagal takes it all literally; and once again, bad-movie multi-millionaire seagal tells us all about the evils of the rich.<br /><br />seagal's survival relies, as usual, on the fact that bad guys never fire their guns from out of arm's reach, and always like to give a little "i'm gonna kill you" speech before blowing a man's head off.<br /><br />watch this one right after the even-worse *fire down below* and note how the carpet in keenen ivory wayans's apartment is more flammable than a big puddle of gasoline.<br /><br />oh, and watch in the final fight scene for the incredible disappearing forehead wound, which is probably the most entertaining thing in the film.
