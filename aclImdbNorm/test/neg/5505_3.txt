generally speaking, i'm a an admirer of jess franco's film-making but, for some of this movies, i really have difficulties understanding the motivation behind them or even their reason of existence. like this sick puppy, for example. "sadomania" has absolutely no cinematic value, it's poorly made without any sort of plot and featuring some of the most ill-natured sleaze footage ever captured on film. this is another filthy women-in-prison film where rape, lesbian-action and violent torture games are daily routine. the guards are crazier than the prisoners and the institution is protected by an impotent governor who only gets sexually aroused when he spots a girl having sex with a dog (!). the girls are all very beautiful and naked throughout the entire film, yet you can't really enjoy this sight with all the perversion going on. the dubious highlights include a barbaric hunting game (you can guess what he prey is), a duel-to-death between a guard and a prisoner and the image of a poor girl having a needle injected all the way through her nipple. auch! avoid this sick mess and you'll save yourself the trouble of taking two baths in order to wash the filth off.
