brilliant acting, excellent plot, wonderful special effects! this is what i would say about this movie if i had been watching it with a bag of diarreha on my head for the entire film. instead, i endured a 2 hour crap-o-rama. our "brilliant" story begins with some billionare who has nothing better to do than look in volcanoes in a vain attempt to find his lucky charms. instead, he finds a 5'4" man in a cheesy rubber dinosaur suit and some queer cave-folk.<br /><br />in his infinite wisdom, (along with his infinitely large nose)he decides to go inside this volcano with a team of "special" people. to travel to this underground land, they go by plane? no. boat? no. they use this giant soup can with a "solid metal" drill on the end that i swear i saw wobble. in summation, this movie was faker than....oh that's right! this was the fakest movie i've seen! for those of you who haven't seen it and are thinking of sitting down on a sunday afternoon with this wonderful movie; i warn you! if you watch this movie you should be prepared to cut of any shred of your manhood and give yourself a full frontal lobotomy.<br /><br />eccchhh!! the rating system only allows for a minimum of 1/10. i give this a -10/10!
