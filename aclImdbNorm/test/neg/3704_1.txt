this movie is the very worst that i have ever seen. you might think that you have seen some bad movies in your time, but if you haven't seen this one you don't know how terrible a movie can be. but wait, there's worse news! the studio will soon rerelease this masterpiece (i'm being ironic) for all to see! the only things worse than the plot of this movie are the effects, the acting, the direction, and the production. bill rebane, the poor man's ed wood (not that there is a rich man's ed wood) (i like ed wood's movies, though) manages to keep things moving at a snail's pace throughout this film. it opens with the capture of a baby bigfoot (a littlefoot? --sorry, couldn't help it) by a pair of unlikable hunters, who are killed by the parent. this causes the entire town where the hunters lived to go on a bigfoot hunting jihad. this is pretty much it for the plot. nothing even remotely interesting happens, and we the viewers are never able to care about any of the characters. if one is interested in the films of rebane i would recommend almost any other over this. however, as i said, it will soon be rereleased by troma in order to bore a new generation of filmgoers.
