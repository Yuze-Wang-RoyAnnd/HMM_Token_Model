much praise has been lavished upon farscape, but i don't think it's that good. it certainly has a distinctive look, but it lacks just about everything else: story, purpose, direction, excitement; you name it. i'm a big sci-fi fan, and i make it a point to watch all the sci-fi shows i can. i've almost finished the four seasons of farscape, and at this point i'm not very satisfied. the show does have a few good things - most notably claudia black (who's sadly missing from the first few episodes of season four) -, but they are very few and very far between. as a whole the show is marred by a lot of very silly stuff (such as fantasy elements rather than sf ditto), and many many episodes, esp. in season four, are unspeakably messy and very poorly structured. and one just feels that it isn't going anywhere. it's mostly just non-directional adventures with thin, long-running plot lines which develop painstakingly slowly. well, sometimes it's a little bit tighter, but it only lasts for a very few episodes at a time.<br /><br />effects-wise, there are a few impressive things here and there (esp. out in space, occasionally), but the show seems stuck in the same style of effects, which frankly gets old fast. outlandish and unconvincing puppet aliens mar the show a great deal, and i've come to prefer (by far) the episodes where regular human-looking characters are the focus.<br /><br />i think the peacekeepers are by far the most stylish and intriguing and interesting figures on the show; they succeed in being a convincingly alien culture, despite their all-human appearance. there are a few really cool episodes with them, esp. in the first season (iirc), where crichton masquerades as a peacekeeper captain, and invades and eventually destroys one of their secret bases. such episodes can reach a rating of 8 out of 10, but i cannot award the show as a whole more than a "4" rating.<br /><br />aside from the peacekeepers (which themselves are somewhat too single-mindedly totalitarian and militaristic to be really nuanced), the show simply doesn't offer anything important or significant that you need to know or want to see. otoh, it does contain a few good ideas and is not a total loss.<br /><br />this is just my opinion, of course, but as a seasoned sci-fi fan, i think it counts for something, and may be of help to others. there aren't a lot of good sci-fi shows out there; but star trek (any series) and especially the new battlestar galactica are definitely better than farscape. but if you're a huge fan of mediocre sci-fi shows, you may well like farscape, too.<br /><br />my rating: 4 out of 10.
