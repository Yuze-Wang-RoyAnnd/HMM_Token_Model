i thought the this film had an interesting name and just might have proved thought provoking, but was i wrong. this film was boring, especially in the beginning and the middle parts. i cannot comment on the ending because i just couldn't stand watching the whole film. the premise of signing a student researcher just because he walks into your lab makes no sense. this student had an interesting type of moving robot in his apartment and sadly enough this non living thing is more interesting than the characters in this film. so if you are having trouble with sleep then i recommend that you rent this film.
