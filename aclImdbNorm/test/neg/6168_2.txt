diane lane, mickey rourke, rosario dawson & thomas jane.....not a bad cast in my opinion however they were totally wasted in this movie.<br /><br />there was no real direction, there were no unusual turns, in fact the whole movie was very predictable from start to finish. mickey rourke had a really annoying sidekick who did nothing but irritate you from the start. rosario dawson was totally wasted and there was hardly any point in even having her character in the film.<br /><br />i really do believe this is one of those straight to dvd movies that everyone will forget about very quickly which is a shame as the movie could have been so much better.
