this documentary was boring, and quite stupid.<br /><br />i mean... the documentary maker obviously does not even know what how darwinian evolution works? it is a theory, and the name is just plain dumb. reading a college biology text-book could have told the documentary maker what darwinism really is. darwinism is a good theory, but evil if it is done as politics.<br /><br />also there was no real evidence in this documentary just interviewing some people... no expert testimonies, and shady leads...<br /><br />the documentary was also boring. i mean it could have been edited down to 35 minutes, and then it would have been lots better.<br /><br />there are a lot better documentaries than this... this was not worth watching... you can get better information from wikipedia =d don't waste your money and time!
