if corky st. claire in waiting for guffman had directed the citizens of blaine in a horror movie with comic undertones the result would have been very much like the milpitas monster.<br /><br />to be generous, this was the longest hour and twenty minute movie i've ever seen. to call the pace glacial is to be kind.<br /><br />almost nobody associated with this project ever made another movie with the exception of ben burtt, who did the really admirable (considering the budget) special effects. he went on to do sound for movies like munich and several other big budget projects. the narration is by veteran voice-over actor paul frees, who probably donated his efforts.<br /><br />when you're watching the opening titles and see the milpitas unified school district listed as one of the producers you know you're going on a long, strange trip.<br /><br />pollution at the down dump in milpitas, california, becomes so toxic that it creates a monster. remember that this is 1975 and ecology was a hot topic. just a few years previously moviegoers had been treated to godzilla vs. the smog monster.<br /><br />so far so good. the monster is a winged creature at least fifty feet tall and has the capacity to tear the town apart. instead it steals garbage cans.<br /><br />central to the premise is the idea that this monster can prowl a small city and leave eight foot long footprints behind but not be noticed by anyone. there's a nicely conceived scene where it walks through the middle of a carnival at night but somehow nobody notices.<br /><br />the only person who sees the monster until the final scenes is george, the town drunk. all through the movie i hoped, hoped, hoped that george would be torn to shreds on camera but this didn't happen. drat. in fact, nobody gets killed. george supposedly sacrifices himself to save priscilla (he's tied to a helicopter to lure the creature- george smells worse than garbage and the monster is attracted to the scent).<br /><br />the nominal leads are a group of high school students. there's pretty priscilla and her nondescript boyfriend and some "bad" boys who (surprise, surprise) whip themselves into shape to help defeat the monster in the final scenes.<br /><br />the monster is involved in four main set pieces. he attacks a browning-ferris garbage truck and leaves it beside an elevated highway, but nobody notices. he walks through the carnival, again unnoticed. he tears up a building (nice miniature work) and nobody sees him but george. then he attacks the high school during a dance and grabs priscilla and carries her off just like a certain very tall ape has done several times, most recently this past winter.<br /><br />there are plot ideas that come out of nowhere and are dropped. local citizens picket at city hall because they want their garbage cans back. an elaborate secret weapon for tracking monsters is flown in by private jet, examined, and forgotten.<br /><br />so why did i watch the whole thing? because these people were having so darned much fun. i had the idea that the firemen were firemen, the businessmen were being filmed in their own offices, priscilla may well live in that suburban tract house, and scenes of people in their yards may well have been in their own yards.<br /><br />they may not be great actors, but they are real people. nobody is stunningly good looking. in fact, i'd estimate that four out of five of the adults on screen wear glasses. since this is the mid seventies we see some really bad clothes and some of the men have awesomely bad facial hair. one dignitary being interviewed before a meeting at ciry hall has such a loud tie and sportcoat that you think he's on his way to play marcellus in the music man.<br /><br />and that got the movie two extra stars. zero for the story. two points for the sometimes decent special effects. and two points for the fact that people in the community actually got together and did this. they can actually say they've performed in a movie; despite lots of stage experience and working behind the scenes in live television i can't say that, and i'm happy for them.<br /><br />remember those great old movies with mickey rooney and judy garland? at some point somebody would say, "let's put on a show! aunt edna has all those old clothes in the attic, and we can use uncle ned's barn!" then they'd do 'neighborhood shows' with sets and costumes that would cost well into seven figures if duplicated today.<br /><br />that's the spirit that the good people of milpitas had for this project, and bless them for that.
