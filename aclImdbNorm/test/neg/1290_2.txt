while the dog was cute, the film was not. it wasn't the premise, or the theme that was a problem. the premise had great possibilities for humor and pathos both. the theme is a worthy one. helping other people is more important than amassing a fortune.<br /><br />sadly, the adorable dog, the unique premise, and the theme were undercut by poor acting, stilted dialogue, and amateurish filming.<br /><br />even my youngest child who will sit through almost anything gave up before we had gotten halfway through. how many times can that dog run up and down the same hallway? i can't spoil it for you, as i never saw the end. it just was not worth watching all the way to the end.
