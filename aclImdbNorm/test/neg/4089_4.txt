well, i watched this film expecting to be rolling in the aisles ... how wrong i was. the film was moderately amusing, at best, and irritating at worst (the slapstick comedy styling of building an ark with archaic tools, laugh ... no i didn't). i'm very disappointed given steve carrel was the lead. i've watch the office us religiously, cracks me up immensely, i thought 40 year old virgin was good ... but evan 'elp us- why on earth did he accept this script. and, as for morgan freeman- he's old enough to know better.<br /><br />so, the idea seemed reasonable, the actors i had every faith in- but the execution was nothing to write home about and the ending, well it seemed as if they had run out of money, or ideas. this for me was one of the most contrived endings i could have imagined. they took a biblical story and dumbed it down to a cautionary tale on localized environmental issues, not even global issues, but a local bill - yawn!<br /><br />in summary, reasonable start, got gradually worse and, for me, it was all washed out by the time the credit's rolled.
