`it's as if this town has the power to suck your brain right out of your head.' -patti<br /><br />patti (christina ricci) is a sarcastic teenaged girl, bored with her all-too-average little town. bored that is until a woman is kidnapped and she finds what she believes to be clues to the poor lady's whereabouts. now, with the help of her precious cat `d.c.' and an inept fbi agent (doug e. doug) she must find her.<br /><br />that darn cat is a bad movie. it is quite foolish and it has humor that often falls quite flat. there are, however, a few buds of talent in it. doug e. doug was good in cool runnings. his performance as `senga' was really funny. here he is wasted as the bumbling fbi agent. he does have a good scene when he imitates the cat, though. micheal mckean plays patti's father. his character must be the most understanding parent to ever live. this poor guy has his expensive cigar crushed, gets arrested for picking up his own cat, and gets bitched-at by his snippy wife and still doesn't get angry at his daughter for causing all of his troubles. i wish my old man was like that. the only real good performance is christina ricci's. she entertaining as the ever-annoyed patti, but her occasional very bad dialogue pulls her performance down. you might also recognize peter boyle (young frankenstein, everybody loves raymond), the old lady from wings and cliff from cheers, in this movie. this is a movie that all these actors would probably like to forget. even the cat isn't very good... i really can't recommend 1997's that darn cat. some young children (under 8) might enjoy it a bit, but every one else should look elsewhere. if you're looking for a good christina ricci movie, i suggest addams family values, the opposite of sex or sleepy hollow. if a fun family film is what you're after, try snow day, instead.<br /><br />
