this was a highly-hyped movie prior to its release, but turned out to be a dud. i never talked to one person who ever liked this movie. i agree: i didn't like it, either. perhaps one big reason it wasn't a box office success was that it had nothing but unappealing characters in the story.<br /><br />for awhile there - i don't know if this is still true - i hadn't any movie in which laura linney or dylan walsh played anything but annoying characters.<br /><br />that, and a stupid story, make this film a big disappointment, especially considering that big buildup. did the filmmakers, with dialog this dumb, really think this was going to be a hit?
