if you are a weirdo who thinks it's "romantic" and wonderful to have sex with a woman who is the genetic equivalent of your mother, get her pregnant, and then have sex with her again once she's had an abortion and not tell her that she is related to you, then you would like this movie.<br /><br />nevermind the fact that the guy is married and has a son at home - it makes it even more disgusting and deplorable that he has no conscience as to what he's doing. he can't do right by his job, his family, or maria. he's a loser. there is nothing romantic or positive about this movie - it is vile and incestuous.<br /><br />it moves slowly and it leads nowhere for over the first half of the movie. i couldn't even finish watching this pathetic excuse for a 'romance'. i'm glad we didn't waste our money in the movie theater on this one. 0/10
