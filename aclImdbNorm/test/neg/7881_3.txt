well, how to make a movie as provocative as possible? this cartoonishly straight shocker tries by having two low-life paris women (one prostitute, one recently raped ex-porn actress, no less) lash out and go on a national sex-and-killing spree- of men in particular. <br /><br />very short running time gives you a hint of the experimental nature of this violently hardcore "thelma & louise"- but it's done completely without irony or contemplation for any possible feminist message... and since we don't get very close to the protagonists, the violence actually feels muted and numbing- and maybe that's a good thing. <br /><br />as a liberal advocate of freedom of expression, i always welcome when the "serious" movie industry dares to contain full-on sex scenes. but the question is: does it work for the movie as a whole? is it any good? here, not very, although we're given a new meaning to the phrase "a shot in the ass"! <br /><br />3 out of 10 from ozjeppe
