oh my god! the beeb hit a new low with this gutless act of political correctness, a mixed race family living in birmingham with a disabled kid thrown in for good measure. whoever commissioned this tripe should be hunted down and thrown to the dogs. the usually funny jasper carrott is about as funny as piles in this show and don't get me started about the others. they have the timing and subtly of a nuclear bomb. i only hope comedy will get better but with the likes of little britain and catherine tate about i severely doubt this. i think you'd be better off getting the box set for a decent comedy from yesteryear such as fawlty towers or bottom if you want a laugh.<br /><br />ban this squeaky clean rubbish!
