maureen o'hara is always beautiful and appealing. here she plays an actress terminally ill. we don't know with what.it is a bit of a precursor to "love story" in that respect.<br /><br />william bendix is good, as is most of the supporting cast. john payne is meant to be grieving but he seems to sleepwalking. the girl who plays the child he and o'hara adopts does her best with a contrived plot device: of course! adopt an orphan. she will live on after the passing of your wife. it's a sweet movie but it doesn't feel sincere.i was hoping to be moved. i was, by o'hara's gentle performance. but i don't like to feel manipulated.
