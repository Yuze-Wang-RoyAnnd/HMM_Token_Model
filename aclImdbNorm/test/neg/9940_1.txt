heftig og begeistret (intense and enthusiastic) is a documentary-like story of a male choir up in berlevag in the very northern part of norway, where the weather is cold and hostile, the days are dark during the winter and the towns are faced with young people moving to the more populated parts in the south of norway, where the climate is warmer and there are more opportunities.<br /><br />the most beautiful part of this movie is the humans themselves. the people in the choir, who are aged from 30 to 95, all have unique, colorful lives and are very enjoyable beings. they are characterised by the harsh climate and the recession of the north and have adapted to the way of living required. throughout the movie, we learn a bit about many people in the choir and we follow them through songs, some events in a church and on the harbour, and in the end, a trip to murmansk.<br /><br />the outside environment filmed in the movie is very beautiful and characterised by the norwegian nature. the scenography is also natural and taken directly from the choir and from the peoples lives that we meet. thei r livingrooms, the bathroom, the kettle on the oven; there is nothing artificial about this movie, not the people, not the environment, not their music and not their feelings. everything is as real as can be.<br /><br />it all loses out though when it comes to giving a story. it is very beautiful and real, but why do we see it? is it because of the songs? is it because of the nature? or is it simply just to see a story about berlevag mens-choir, about their life and some of the trips they have. the message, if there is any, is that this small society copes with life through such social events like the choir. the choir have kept the people together for many many years.<br /><br />it is all nice, but being as popular as it has been, seen by almost 200.000 in norway, there is something wrong. there is no beginning or end to it. nobody gains or loses anything, nobody reveals any message or tries to convince the audience of that this is good or that life up there is great. why was this movie made?<br /><br />i am sorry. it is a nice movie about good people, but compared to the average european, scandinavian or norwegian movie - this does not deserve a 9 out of 10. it is closer to 4 out of 10, and that is what i will give it.<br /><br />if you see this movie in a theater, you should expect the average age on the audience to be around 55-60. it has reported to be consistently high in all theaters. maybe this is also the reason for it receiving such very high praise in the news and good grades also on the imdb: it is a movie about elders, for elders. it is a movie of "i regret nothing in my life", and a story saying that living in a small town like berlevag, might be a nice life too.
