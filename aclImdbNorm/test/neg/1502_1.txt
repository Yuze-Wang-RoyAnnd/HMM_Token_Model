no way ! i hated granny. first, she is way too tall -of course she is, it is tom, whoever's brother, who's playing her- and i hate that thing she does when she brushes her fake silver hair back, but : there are funny parts in this movie. for instance, the fact that every single actor looks v.g. (very german), and also that they think that, even when left alone, they should pretend that that guy (tom) is their actual "granny" or something. i specially liked -not- that moment where charlotte leaves and starts walking to the nearest gas station to ask for some help. she suddenly finds herself in the middle of some woods (where were these before? nobody dares explaining) and turns, turns, turns a-r-oun-d like a ballerina, looking at the stars...and...ignoring the fact that granny's behind her, ready to strike !!! but, anyway, the music wasn't so bad, the haircuts were okay and the ending terribly provocative... mmmmm... wish i had the german version.
