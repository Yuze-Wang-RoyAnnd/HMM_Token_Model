in the early 00's, production companies had a short-lived craze for supernatural genre movies in france after "the crimson rivers" and "brotherhood of the wolf" turned out to be hits, so several movies were green-lit or saved from their "direct-to-video" fate. however, france, as opposed to the us, uk or italy, has little tradition of fantasy b-movies and it turned out quickly that "samoura"is", "bloody mallory" or the "crimson rivers" sequel were ill-advised attempts at recreating a kind of magic that had never existed in french cinema in the first place. as they flopped, producers have gone back to their usual fare: derivative farces or the umpteenth self-referential tribute to french new wave by a former critic from "les cahiers du cin'ema".<br /><br />"broc'eliande" could only have been green-lit during this short window, as it serves no other discernible purpose. it's your by-the-book slasher movie mixed with vague mythological element and horror references and you'll find bimboesque female characters, a french university looking like a us campus and plot twists so lazy you don't even care because you had guessed it by yourself an hour before, even before the movie started.<br /><br />these elements make all the fun of a 70's or a 80's b-movie and you expect them in a 70's or 80's movie. however, we're not in the 80's anymore and nobody warned director doug headline, as this tribute to the slasher movie genre is nothing more than a derivative slasher movie. headline himself is no rookie and has been writing as a critic about this kind of pictures since the early 80's but as a first time director he shows a lack of skill and ambition that makes "broc'eliande" a bore.<br /><br />when you put together clich'es from a movie subcategory and hand them to a skilled and inventive director such as wes craven or quentin tarantino, you get a "scream" or a "death proof", movies that are imitations from old guilty pleasures but also magnify these clich'es and add a great deal to them. that's called "talent" and that's why you can't confuse these recent movies with their original inspirations shot decades ago.<br /><br />"broc'eliande" takes the lazy path and only reproduces the worst elements from past movies (unfortunately for the male viewer, the gratuitous nudity is mostly missing). there are very strong similarities (presumably unintentional) between the plot of "broc'eliande" and the reviled "halloween 3: season of the witch", as both deal with supernatural druidic evil rituals and some silly attempt at taking over the world on halloween night. as even the plot of "halloween 3" makes more sense than this one, it means that something seriously wrong went with "broc'eliande".
