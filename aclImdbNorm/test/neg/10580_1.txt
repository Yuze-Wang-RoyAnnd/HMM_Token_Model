i happened to rent this movie with my sister in hopes of watching a great entertaining movie, that was humorous, however my expectations were let down. this movie was beyond disgusting and revolting for a pg-13 movie, this should have been rated r for the many mature references that went on in this movie. i wouldn't recommend allowing a 13 year old teen see this.<br /><br />even if no one under the age of 17 is watching this movie, beware of a truly stupid movie, there's no humor in the movie, just a bunch of disgusting sexual references including a small touch of pedophilia, something that shouldn't even be joked about. <br /><br />i would like to know what happened to pg-13 movies, that were actually safe for actual a 13 year old? this is beyond a deplorable movie and should be re-rated.
