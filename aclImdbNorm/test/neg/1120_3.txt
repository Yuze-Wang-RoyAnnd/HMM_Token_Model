sorry randy. i love your comedy but in this case you really laid a 'golden turkey' egg.<br /><br />the plot was thinner than a single layer of my skin, the acting more wooden than a giant redwood and i think the direction was non existent.<br /><br />there certainly appeared to be pathetic attempts at take-offs of other films, jaws and european vacation to name but two.<br /><br />if memory serves me right eric idle played the same type of character in nat lamp european vacation, but much better.<br /><br />i am wondering if chevy chase and beverley d'angelo were approached to make this sequel. if so, they certainly knew what they were doing when they turned their parts down.<br /><br />in my opinion no one can better chevy and beverley in their roles as the griswolds and randy quaid complemented them admirably in the earlier movies.<br /><br />randy quaid should have quit national lampoon whilst he was ahead.
