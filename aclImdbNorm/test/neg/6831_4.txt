i'm normally a fan of bruce willis, and despite him playing the cold-hearted professional killer, i thought him the most appealing character here. that said, his character makes such a mess of his professional activity, it's incredible he hasn't been caught before. the plot is thin to the point of being nonsensical. the end was no less annoying and insulting for the fact that it could have been predicted from about 20 minutes into the movie.<br /><br />** spoilers follow ** in hollywood morality, the good guys always win, with a few casualties along the way, and the bad guys die, or are at least heading for justice by the end. the breathtaking insult of the film is the way that our ira terrorist, who has somehow become a cuddly, touchy-feely character, gets to walk off to a new life. as does his former terrorist playmate (who is now a loving wife and mother).<br /><br />who's the bigger villain? the former (and, so far as we can tell, unrepentant) terrorist, or the hired assassin? i don't see much to choose between them --- in real life, or in the film.<br /><br />this is the poorest film i've seen this year.
