man this thing bites! i am sorry i ever sat down and watched it! friedkin was insane for making a film attempting to win over the viewers sympathy for this lunatic if it were up to me i'd have made the audience hate that low life instead of getting all misty eyed over him! he killed people! quite grizzly i might add too! and friedkin wants you to feel sorry for him because he's "not right"! i say friedkin can forget it! i hate the guy this movie is partly based on and hope they did wise up and give his sorry butt the juice!!! in a nut shell, don't waste your time! it's sick and perverse!
