hey if people thought ed wood was a bad director then they totally have not seen this movie. i mean there were gaping plot holes and under utilized cast. shoddy special effects. i mean i cant believe that this movie came out from a hollywood studio. a high school drama club could probably come out with a better product. i mean they had erika eleniak who is gorgeous casper van dien and under rated actor. their agents should be shot to ask them to sign on to this dribble don't they read scripts. i still cant believe that tiny lister was a survivor in the movie i was banging my head the whole time at why him and not a descendant of van helsing be the last man standing. i am a fan of vampire movies and this is by far the worst they should stake it so that it never sees the light of day.
