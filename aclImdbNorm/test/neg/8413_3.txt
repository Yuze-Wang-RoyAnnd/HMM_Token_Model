for a movie that gained so much recognition and appraise this spinoff to "rosemarys baby" is one big mistake. it starts off that andrew/adrian whatever his name is because he's so confused that he doesn't know who he is anymore runs away from a cult with his mother and soon is kidnapped by a strange lady that ends up taking care of him as if she were his mother. the acting is terrible as andrew grows up in his twenties and looks terrible with his sunken in face, never ending grin and dukes of hazard clothes on looks more like a drunken has been than the son of satan. in fact thats all he does is drink and falls sloppily all over himself as he tries to come to grips with his past and the last memory of his mother driving away on a bus screaming to him. he finds a friend that seems to be an angel but he's quickly killed off and electricuted in a hillarious scene in which he looks more like a christmas tree. andrew gets cought and the cult with the members of the first part test him to see if he's really the son of satan. his dumb self fails the test and gets up off the alter glittering with myme makeup and jumps of the stage of a night club and dances like a clown on crack!!! this scene is memorable and well worth a watch. the ending is terrible and somewhat predictable considering how stupid he is in the whole movie. do not watch this piece of trash or you will loose respect for the first part.
