unbelievable. great cast, fair acting, interesting plot.<br /><br />but this movie has such graphic cruelties that are not tense or giving thrills, just pure disturbing unruhe.<br /><br />*spoiler*<br /><br />everyone could see coming the freak returns to his habits. and that robert englund was acting (was he?) like an idiot; forbidding your daughter to sleep with a football player, but him trying to kill an idiot and liking kiddypr0n is alright?! <br /><br />the policeman who's daughter was kidnapped - anyone felt he was a cop and not an actor? not me. this movie drags on and on with an ending that we see in other horror movies: if the returns were alright a part 2 could be made. bad, really bad stuff. might give creeps some inspiration...
