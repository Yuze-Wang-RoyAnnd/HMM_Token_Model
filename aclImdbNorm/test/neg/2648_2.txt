i went to see random hearts with 3 friends, and at first, i thought maybe it was just me who wasn't enjoying the movie. after all, i didn't like as good as it gets and that movie won all sorts of awards. well, it wasn't just me...none of my friends liked it either. it was unbelievable slow, much like getting teeth pulled. the only action that is in the movie is what is in previews. we didn't walk out of the theatre because we all assumed something more would happen. we weren't as smart as the 7 or 8 people who did walk out. i have never walked out on a movie in my life, but i definitely should have. this is all tough for me to write, considering i am relatively easy to please when it comes to movies. it takes a lot for me to think a movie is awesome, but not much for me to just like it. this movie didn't even come close in the like category. not only was the movie about 2 hours too long, but it was like two separate trite stories in one, but they weren't smoothly sewn together. plus, the "soundtrack" if you could even call it that was so annoying. like seinfeld has the same riff that is played over and over again (difference being that i like seinfeld)..this movie had this jazz riff that it kept playing, which sounded highly inappropriate at times, especially when people were dealing with the deaths of the plane crash. hard to explain what i mean, but trust me it was awful. i cannot say enough to make people not waste their money. after i left the theatre, i honestly wanted to write to the movie company and demand my $7 back..sheeesh, i could have gone bowling or something for that money.
