i think it is very interesting this movie is called a thriller. it is anything but thrilling.<br /><br />most of the time you hear piano sounds. then you hear piano sounds. then some people talk about facts which do not concern anybody.<br /><br />then again piano sounds.<br /><br />to be honest, this movie was the reason for me to register at imdb, because i think this movie is one of those which humankind has to be warned of.<br /><br />spoiler: by the way, the most action-like part happens when a can of hot chocolate is spilled.<br /><br />also very interesting: the "actors". yes, the quotes are intentional, as you can think, because they do not act. they play piano and do smalltalk, but it's not acting they do.<br /><br />i think before this movie i never left a cinema and felt angry. really, this film made me angry. angry for the time and money i spent on it.
