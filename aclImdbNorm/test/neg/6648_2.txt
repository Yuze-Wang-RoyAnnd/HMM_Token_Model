this is a movie that should have been a mini-series as it tries to get too much information in too small a space. the whole story is constantly being bombarded with sub-plots, character introduction and meaningless pieces information that go nowhere. there is a underlying plot where boy meets a girl, she has doubts but gets married anyhow and then her doubts surface and she goes to see if they are real. they turn out not to be but her husband won't believe that she was not unfaithful and her almost boyfriend doesn't want her as she was not unfaithful to her husband. with that said there are no less than 1000 sub-plots and character introductions that make this plot almost incomprehensible. in the first 15 minutes you are inundated with so many things and situations that you just stop caring. you don't care about any of the confused and screwed up cast that drifts in and out of the story like vultures feeding on a corpse. each one comes in and takes some interest away from the viewer. after a half-hour, and completely disinterested, i stayed and watched the remaining two and a half hours out of pure morbid curiosity. i couldn't imagine where it was going but like staring at a fire i just couldn't get up and turn it off. the production values are superb but the resulting movie is a waste of time; wash your socks instead.
