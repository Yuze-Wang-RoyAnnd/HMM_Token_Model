i rented this movie expecting it to suck, and it didn't let me down. i rented it with some friends as a joke. but, what we got was worse than anyone could ever imagine.<br /><br />it starts off sucking before you even take it out of the box. it looks like a blade rip-off and the guy on the cover is nowhere to be found in the movie. its called vampire assassin, but isn't an assassin someone who kills for hire? well this guy kills the of his own volition, so that doesn't make him an assassin.<br /><br />then, when you actually put the disk in it gets worst. first off the menu animation is lame. but, when you actually start the movie every thing from the set design to the lighting (or lack thereof) is terrible. you know a movie is bad when the credits even suck. the acting is laughable. the action is childish. the writing is elementary. and the directing is the worst>
