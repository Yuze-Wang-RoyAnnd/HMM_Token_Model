i've seen some bible-based trash. this one tops it all. to make matters worse, it lasts about three hours. a horrible waste of time, unless you want to match your kid's biblical knowledge against the innumerable aberrations. do yourself a favor - take a walk in the sahara instead. since i am required to give you a ten line statement of why not to watch this movie, let me just say there is absolutely no redeemable quality to it. god's conversations with noah are ridiculous. the whole thing has a stench of "let's make the biblical account look retarded." the basic logic goes, if they spent the money on a biblical film, why not make it worthwhile? since the basic logic is not met, something is amiss. the movie starts with a disclaimer about poetic licenses taken...that is the understatement of the century. poetic rape. but then, poetic would be an unmerited favor.
