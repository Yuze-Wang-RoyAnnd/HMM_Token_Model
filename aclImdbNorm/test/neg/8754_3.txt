hollywood had a long love affair with bogus arabian nights tales but few of these products have stood the test of time. the most memorable were the jon hall, maria montez films which have long since become camp. this one is filled with dubbed songs, anachronistic slang, and slapstick. it's a truly bounteous crop of mesopotamian corn, and pretty near intolerable today. it was nominated for its imaginative special effects which are almost unnoticeable in this day and age, consisting mainly of trick photography. the only outstanding, positive feature which survives is its beautiful color and clarity. sad to say, of the many films made in this genre, few of them come up to alexander korda's original "thief of baghdad". almost any other arabian nights film is superior to this one, though. it's a loser.
