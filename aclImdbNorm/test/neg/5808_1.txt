creating a comedy is like walking a pretty thin tight-rope. it either works, or it does not. grandma's boy is one of those movies that does not work. it may have a few very funny parts, but for the majority, it's just a terribly unfunny comedy from the usual supporting characters in adam sandler films (sans sandler himself, he's just a producer).<br /><br />alex (allen covert) is a game tester. he's 35, and is the best tester and game player at his otherwise kid-filled workplace. he ends up getting his apartment and his stuff taken from him for not paying the bills (as it turns out, his roommate had just been spending the rent money on philipino hookers and not paying the landlord). desperate, he moves in with his grandmother, lilly (doris roberts of everybody loves raymond) and her two roommates.<br /><br />that's the basic plot of the film, thrown in with subplots about a hot new girl named samantha (linda cardelli, unrecognizable from her days as velma in scooby doo) trying to get the testers to complete a new game as fast as they can, a robot-like game creating prodigy j.p. (joel moore) who works with alex and wears much of the same clothes as neo in the matrix, and of course, all sorts of sex and drug related jokes. that's it.<br /><br />the problem with the film, besides the fact that the real conflict in the film occurs and is resolved within the last fifteen minutes of the film, is that it just is not funny. it is totally mind-numbingly boring, and only sparingly funny. nothing really happens at all. no emotion, no real sense of direction, and a whole ton of intense swearing. you find yourself maybe laughing at a few funny quips that the actors say, but otherwise sit in complete boredom, wishing you had not even bothered with the film. how this film was greenlit and how fox thought it could make money will always remain a mystery to me.<br /><br />there's just no entertainment value to come from it. none of the actors are actually putting in good performances, they are just acting like idiots for the camera, and hoping for the best. stoner comedy has been done before multiple times, and on occasion, actually works (harold and kumar go to white castle and dazed and confused come to mind). here, it just makes for making the film even less funny than it is already. the random inclusion of a monkey and a pair of bare breasts really does not make the film any better either.<br /><br />other than a few funny one-liners, this movie should just be out-right missed altogether. it's not very funny, the entire plot is silly, it's boring, and it just makes for one horrendous film. avoid it like the plague.<br /><br />1.5/10.
