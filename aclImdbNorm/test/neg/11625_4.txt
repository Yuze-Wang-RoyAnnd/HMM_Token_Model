when i was a little girl, i absolutely adored the swan princess, it was reliving the same fairy tales of snow white, sleeping beauty, and cinderella, the princess and her prince who saves the day is always a timeless story that will never die, well, hopefully. but i figured that i would check out the sequels for the swan princess to see what they were like and unfortunately, this is the typical cartoon sequel that just disappoints more than entertains. the only character i found still very amusing was the queen, she was very funny in this movie and had the best part. but with the voice changes, they were noticeable and also bothered me quite a bit, i don't mean to be picky, just it was too weird for me. the story also was just more or less borrowed from the first swan princess, just the villain in this movie is following rothbart's footsteps.<br /><br />odette and derek are about to celebrate their one year anniversary, but derek has been too preoccupied with fighting for his kingdom to keep it safe. with his mother's birthday also coming up, he forgets about that since there is a new villain in town, clavious, who is hoping to go above and beyond where rothbart's powers went and kidnaps the queen on her birthday. but odette must change back into her swan self in order to help derek fight him and save his mother.<br /><br />the swan princess 2 is of course more than alright for the kids, that i never mind, it's good clean fun for them. the reason why these sequels are disappointing though is because it is usually just for the kids, that is the audience they aim for, but it's more enjoyable when the jokes and story can be enjoyed by everyone. now there are a few laughs and giggles here and there, but this wasn't as clever in my opinion to the first swan princess. i would recommend it for the little one's, but if you're looking for a fun cartoon movie, i'd recommend staying with the first swan princess.<br /><br />4/10
