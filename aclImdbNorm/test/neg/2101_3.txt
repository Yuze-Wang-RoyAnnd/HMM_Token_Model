upon renting this, i wasn't expecting to be blown away. in fact, i knew it was going to be horrible. it was just seeing how horrible it really was. that's what comes with low budget horror.<br /><br />"snakes on a train", not to be confused with the serpentine summer blockbuster "snakes on a plane" with samuel l. jackson, is about a woman who is put under a mayan curse that causes snakes to hatch inside her and devour her from within. her only hope of surviving lies in a shaman that lives across the border, so she and her companion stowaway onto a train bound for los angelas. throw in a few passengers and hilarity ensues.<br /><br />come to think of it, though, the story isn't half bad. isn't half good, either.<br /><br />the acting in this film rivals that of a sci-fi original, if not worse. trust me, it's horrible. the snakes were another problem. they were supposed to be rattlers, i guess, but most of what you get instead are mostly harmless garden snakes that don't attack anything and there's this rattling sound effect that gets really annoying.<br /><br />the gore effects on the other hand, while not on the tom savini level, were actually pretty good.<br /><br />and another thing, the ending alone makes up for the rest of the movie. i'm not going to talk about it here, so you'll have to rent this and see for yourself.
