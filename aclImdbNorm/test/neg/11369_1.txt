if you thought nbc's 10.5 was stupid, you'll be happy to hear that fx reached into the bowels of made-for-tv hell and squished it's fingers into this pseudo post-9/11 poop. not only was the plot stupid, it was a complete ripoff of 24 and a bad ripoff at that. the filming style was the now overused "docu-action" look, complete with cuts to grainy b&w "rawcore" footage. i'm not quite sure what that means, but it sure sounds like something the dp said to the director before filming. i don't know what they were going for here but it reminded me of the guy at the office who thinks powerpoint presentations with "fly-ins" and "animations" are "cool."<br /><br />the story is that 6 "terrorists" take over a nuclear power plant in southern ca. that's right, nuclear power plants, where hundreds of people work, where there's security precautions up the ying-yang. for the sake of reality, they put 2 off-duty chippies in the mix. because, they'd be able to stop 6 people, right? six. i mean, even bruce willis had to deal with more terrorists over at that stupid nakatomi building.<br /><br />leslie hope (tv's teri bauer) plays a chp officer who has problems talking on the phone after she's shot in her bullet-proof vest. her voice sounds like a sally struther's tv ad, whiny and monotonous. her character is only a plot device, and after she performs her one small duty, she is promptly disposed of. yes, teri bauer is died! <br /><br />bruce greenwood stars as fbi s.a.c. tom shea, who continually points out how he punches foreign diplomats in the face. his boss is out, so nobody over at the dept. of homeland security believes his prognosis of the situation. he's the sensible one out of a group of paranoid public officials afraid of taking blame for any type of catastrophe. he's calm, he's strong, he's boring.<br /><br />there is absolutely nothing redeeming or entertaining about meltdown - ok, well maybe teri bauer getting died was pretty unnecessary and funny - other than that, nothing redeeming.
