usually i'm the one criticizing the twenty-something neanderthals for not being able to appreciate a film unless it has plastic t*ts, gunfights and car chases. however, in this case the film might actually have been improved with a few of those additions. at least i wouldn't have gotten bored after an hour and changed channels.<br /><br />i don't mind surreal, and i certainly don't mind having to pay attention to find subtlety or hidden meaning, but there should be some point to the whole thing. i didn't get the feeling that even the writer or director really had a broad vision of anything but were, instead, just so self-absorbed in their own pretentious visions that they became deliberately scattered. or perhaps they just got confused themselves. either way, i don't care. it bored the crap out of me for just over an hour with no saving grace.<br /><br />although a whole pack of other viewers have filled up this site with excited ravings about the alleged symbolism and masterful cinematography, i must respectfully disagree. perhaps i didn't mince through enough film classes to appreciate some inspired techniques not visible to mere mortals ...<br /><br />or perhaps this movie was just crap. <br /><br />i give it a "1" and file it next to "ishtar."
