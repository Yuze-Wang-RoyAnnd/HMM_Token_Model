<br /><br />i used to like some of the hollywood action blockbusters of the 80s. they had icons such as arnie and sly but i think the action movie in the '90s has plummeted to new depths. the worst of these, i believe, was armageddon.<br /><br />the plot is shamelessly contrived and pulls off the worst cliches as it seeks to excite viewers. the melodrama is so cringingly saccharine and awful that you actually cannot wait for bruce willis to disappear from the screen. liv tyler, who had acted admirably in several fine independent features directed by such masters as bernardo bertolucci and robert altman, regrettably decided to jump onto the commercial bandwagon. this movie symbolises the new hollywood aesthetic of grand special effects and precious little good dialogue or authentic melodrama. that is the norm these days and i begin to wonder if there is a role in hollywood for screenwriters. it seems as though they just employ hacks and committees to write the facile scripts. the rest they leave to technology. there is not a single piece of grand, heartfelt human emotion in armageddon. it just feels empty and bland. i can think of only one good aspect of this movie and that involves liv tyler's dad who doesn't even make an appearance in the film. steven tyler's band aerosmith provide a theme song for the movie - a ballad that really soars and at least tugs at the heartstrings a little when the end credits come up.<br /><br />i weep for western civilization if people like this predictable, cumbersome movie. it stands for shallowness, lethargy, and a decline in the human intellect. i would even prefer to watch the eighth friday the 13th.
