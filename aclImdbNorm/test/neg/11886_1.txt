this film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own mountain-top commune as free men in 17th-century brazil. the story is interesting and edifying. however, this film -- as a film -- is terrible.<br /><br />the soundtrack is not period music or tribal music. it is afro-brazilian pop music from the early 1980s. battle scenes are fought to the sounds of cheesy pop rhythms best left to the disco or bad cops dramas. admittedly, the lyrics are folk-ish tales of the slaves' heroism. the special effects are absurd. rather than invoke the mysticism of african religion and atavistic beliefs, they merely make the film look cheap. they are completely unbelievable, and i don't mean merely in a sense of verisimilitude.<br /><br />life within the commune of palmares could not have been the way it is portrayed in the film. for this society, as shown in the film, is one-part kibbutz, one-part afro-pop festival. moreover, it is almost embarrassing to watch the director play upon the clich'es of blacks as talented singers and dancers who simply want to be happy. he portrays daily life as a series of dance parties in which the freed slaves paint themselves bright colors and whirl around to the strains of '80s pop music. on the other hand, they have an abundance of beautiful food, but the viewer hardly sees any work being done. the king inveighs against private property in a hackneyed and clich'ed way. when a man complains that people are taking the vegetables that he has grown over many months, the king says, "what comes from the earth belongs to everyone, as the earth belongs to no one. if they need food, they have a right to take yours."<br /><br />i am glad that i learned about this episode in history, but i am relieved that a film with such low production values and that trades upon such worn stereotypes would likely not be made today.
