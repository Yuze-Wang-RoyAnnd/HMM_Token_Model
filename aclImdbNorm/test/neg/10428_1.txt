journalist bob woodward's blistering, scattershot and sometimes suspect account of actor john belushi's rise and fall becomes a wholly misjudged movie, a nebulous "fantasy" directed by larry peerce as if he were doing something edgy and vital. michael chiklis (years before his breakthrough on "the shield") is put in the unenviable position of portraying belushi, taking a post-mortem trip through his life, recreating those "saturday night live" skits which are now part of tv history. it's like watching someone try to out-lucy lucille ball--it can't be done. the reason why there was such sorrow at belushi's death was because he was one of a kind. chiklis makes a commendable attempt at looking the part, and he's funny in an early scene trying to escape from the morgue. still, it's an uphill venture and no actor--no matter how talented--could have saved it. * from ****
