okay, here is a really short review: this movie blowed. i wish i could just have a review that stated this simple principle, but i must bore you with more bad review type words like 'horrible' 'clich'ed' and 'unwatchable.' it's the type of film you watch when you are drunk or are stuck on a desert island with nothing else to do. here's the premise: the vice president is captured by a terrorist group at a play-off hockey game and only van damm can stop the madness. truly, truly terrible, but then again, i didn't pay to see it the first time around and only my dad felt the absence of girth in his wallet after this movie. i hate the fact he is a republican and all, but then again, he did spare me the horror of paying for this piece of garbage. okay, that is now enough space to be recognized as a review, so i bid adieu.
