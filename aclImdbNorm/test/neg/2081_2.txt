paul mazursky misfires on this film. the writing, direction, casting, and acting (with the exception of victorio gassman) are all off the mark. i remember the reviews from 20+ years ago being mediocre, but i thought it still might be worthwhile to view. with notables such as susan sarandon, raul julia (who overacts in most of his scenes) and john cassavetes, i understandably expected much more. the music picked for the film is jarring, the cuts between new york and greece confusing, and the overall pace all leave much to be desired. why paul mazursky felt the need to update this story, or add his touch to it is puzzling - this retelling of prospero and his daughter takes very little of import from the play, and adds not much more. the play is not one of shakespeare's best anyway, and to gut it even further seems not to be a good decision. unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend in this film.
