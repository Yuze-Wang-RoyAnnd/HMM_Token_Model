despite this being one of john cusack and demi moore's early films, it is one even hardcore fans can miss, unless they absolutely have to complete the collection. i have rare moments, where i can handle better off dead, but this movie is ultimately worse. i am just not a savage steve holland fan, and he did both movies. so if you don't like the cheesy, random comedy and amateur animation, steer clear of this one. fyi even for the demi moore fans: she can't sing and the 80s synthesizers did not save her. there are too many predictable twists and too-easy jokes. i suppose if you want mindless entertainment or something you can leave on in the background and ignore while you do something productive, then go for it. otherwise, don't watch this movie. if john cusack (or demi moore) couldn't save it, you know it's got to be bad. they are the only reason i didn't give this movie a 1.
