the story, as i understand, is "based on real events." that can be either good or bad, depending on what sort of license is taken with those real events and how they are rendered.<br /><br />in this case, the results are enough to gag a maggot. i wasn't expecting much going in -- anticipating a story of rich high-school kids taking an ocean cruise under a stern skipper. that is, what i figured was a coming-of-age movie along the lines of something about boot camp or basic training, the kind in which the drill sergeant says, "my duty is to snap you out of your winsome civilian ways." well, it is that, in a way. the kids start out as kids and end up as an organic group. but this is far hokier than any boot-camp movie i've ever seen, outside of a deliberate comedy. who wrote this thing? the air is filled with slogans that belong, not in high school, but in the third grade. the dialog offends the ear.<br /><br />jeff bridges usually does a better-than-average job but in this case his performance is mediocre. he brings nothing extra to the part, although given his lines, it's hard to know how he could do much with them. the rest of the cast is undistinguished and a few of the kids are painfully inadequate. there's a lot of tearing up, and considerable crying. the best scene involves a dolphin.<br /><br />the immature clich'es continue to the very end. the coast guard is cast in the role of the hard-hearted court at the hearing that follows the disaster. the interrogator does nothing but hit bridges over the head with his misinterpretations and misconstruction of events. "you let the crew drink alcohol, didn't you?" (a couple of harmless drinks.) "and you didn't punish them, though you punished them for killing a fish." (the dolphin business.) the technical details surrounding the sinking are left murky. what is a "white squall" anyway? and if it's as dangerous as bridges claims, why weren't the whole crew alerted and wearing life vests? but why go on? if "the albatross" were a dreadnaught, it would still be torpedoed and sunk by the ludicrous comic-book script.
