i watched this movie for the first time a few weeks ago, and it was quite possibly one of the most boring, unfunny films i ever had the misfortune of seeing. first of all matthew modine is a terrible actor, and ruined most of the movie, on top of that, the plot is just way too silly. the only reason a checked into this film was because of alec baldwin, and his character was eliminated pretty quickly. unless you are a fan of michelle phiffer you should probably avoid this movie like the plague. many people can't praise this film enough, but i just cannot figure out what people find so terrific about it. if its supposed to be the black humor that makes this film so terrific, then i guess anything can pass for comedy these days.
