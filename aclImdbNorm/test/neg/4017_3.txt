pretty dreadful movie about several unbalanced young people in a car starts off reasonably well but becomes more bizarre and hard to swallow as it progresses. rachel leigh cook is the sole highlight in a tender and sexy performance, but i would recommend this film only to die-hard fans of the actress.
