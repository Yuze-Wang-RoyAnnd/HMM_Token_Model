usual awful movie... i'll not bother you about the synopsis, just put together the core, armageddon, an evil-planner military officer and one or two solve-all nukes and you'll have the movie, if i can call it that way. <br /><br />seriously, nukes in this kind of movies are more useful than swiss army knives: <br /><br />the big one is approaching? nuke some places and it's over... a tornado wants to destroy "insert important city name here"? nuke "insert another important city here"... a volcano is erupting? nuke it! a nuke is near to go off? nuke it! coffee is cold? nuke it! you didn't like transformers? nuke yourself, but i can't assure this will fix things...<br /><br />in the end, how many more movies like this can be made before they start copying one another? i doubt there are still many things to blow up with a nuke...
