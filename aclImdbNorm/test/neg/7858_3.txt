henry (don ameche) turns up at the entrance to hell and recounts his life story to his excellency (laird cregar). the story focuses on his relationships with females throughout his life, and in particular, his relationship with martha (gene tierney). at the end of the film, we cut back to henry and his excellency for a very predictable ending.<br /><br />unfortunately, there is nothing more to say about the film because nothing happens. its a sentimental story of one man's life and its very boring. i watched it with my girlfriend and my dad and we all thought it was rubbish, despite the lubitsch touch. i yawned more than 15 times. hugo (charles coburn) is good whenever he is on screen as the grandfather and there were a few funny moments of dialogue. the colour made it a good spectacle but it wasn't enough to save this plodder from going into the reject pile. in the same mould as "its a wonderful world" and "you can't take it with you", and so, not surprisingly, it was nominated for an oscar. a story about ordinary people, none of whom are interesting and with no storyline of any interest. boring, sentimental and the biggest damp squib of an ending that i can remember...
