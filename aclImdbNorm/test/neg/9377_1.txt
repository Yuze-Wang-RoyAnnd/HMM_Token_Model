this is the only movie that i can think of where after it ended, i was seething with anger at the waste of money and time on the part of myself and everyone involved in making it. no wonder alan moore refused to have anything to do with v for vendetta (a phenomenal film) after this debacle.<br /><br />it's not bad in an entertaining way, like showgirls. it's bad in a way that makes you want to claw your eyes out. plot holes the size of planets. the worst script in memory. horrible acting by decent actors. visuals that should be great, but somehow flop. <br /><br />it could have been so good...
