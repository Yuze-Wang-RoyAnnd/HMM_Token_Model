where do i start? first off, the story sucks. the acting sucks, the effects really suck, i guess i'll start with the story. the story for komodo vs. cobra: number one, it doesn't explain how or when the komodo and the cobra even got there. or for that matter, how it was created. the acting: terrible! it seems like the director just pulled a few people from the street (which is probably what he did). and last and definitely the least, the effects: they are so horrible that the komodo doesn't even look like a komodo, just a dinosaur, that looks incredibly unrealistic. the water doesn't even move when the cobra appears. all in all: terrible piece of crap, don't even think about renting it.
