such a highly-anticipated remake of a cherished musical classic and such a bitter pill it was to have to take. very, very hard to swallow...all of it. it didn't have an ounce of believability anywhere. and when you don't have a rose, you don't have a show.<br /><br />bette midler seemed born to play this part. yet, all she was able to produce was a cute, funny, glitzy, trademark bette midler...weighed down with all the familiar midlerisms. roz russell has nothing to worry about. she can rest in her grave knowing she is still the definitive mama rose (of film, anyway).<br /><br />i thought midler was really going to put it across this time...to throw herself into what is one of the greatest musical roles of all time...like she did in "the rose." but, no, she played it safe. she played herself. she made rose a total dinner-theatre cartoon. even her songs were uninspired. it was maddening to watch, knowing midler has the talent to rise above her money-making schtick. she showed promise only once in this "gypsy" and that was with "rose's turn." but, by then it was too little, too late.<br /><br />a sincere cynthia gibb as the titular heroine gave the film its only true spark and when the role of gypsy outshines that of rose, you know there's trouble in river city.<br /><br />a huge, huge letdown.
