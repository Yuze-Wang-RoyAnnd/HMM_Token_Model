the german regional-broadcast-station wdr has shown both "the general" and odc. on saturday i've seen "the general" and i thought, it wasn't very bad, but not very good too. but yesterday i've seen odc and i switched it off after about an hour. although kevin spacey was the main actor the movie was totally confusing and seems restless. "the general" told the story straight and ordered, but odc just wanted to be cool. there is a reference on the guy ritchie movies "lock, stock and two smoking barrels" and "snatch", but doesn't have the coolness of these movies.<br /><br />so, in the end i would rate it 3 of 10!
