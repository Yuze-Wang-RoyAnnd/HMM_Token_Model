this must rank as one of cinema's greatest debacles. i was wandering europe at the time and had the misfortune to stumble upon the crew making this movie in what was, even then, one of the world's idyllic, unspoiled settings. i was enlisted as an extra, and what followed was an exhibition of modern day debauchery. forget all the accusations you've ever heard of peter mayall's intrusions on this rare piece of french life- geoff reeve and his cohorts embarked on a level of revelry at the restaurant at les beaux that left the maitre'd slack-jawed in disbelief. they were, quite simply, awful, uncultured and undeserving of french hospitality.
