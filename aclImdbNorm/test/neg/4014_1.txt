i have only seen the minimum wage episode yet i have no intention of watching the others, how can that be? morgan starts theatrically complaining about his awful situation living on minimum wage right at the beginning of the episode and the complaining never stops. ever. luckily for the viewer, his skinny girlfriend is just as annoying as morgan (if not even more annoying).<br /><br />and then to top it all, they go to the movies and buy bottled water for 2,50 and after that go to a restaurant to eat out all the while they naturally *drumroll* complain about being poor.<br /><br />i don't care if the other episodes may or may not be better than this. no one should be forced to watch this crap.
