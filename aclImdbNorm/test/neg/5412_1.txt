thank god for dvr and the high speed of it's fast forward. even with that i couldn't sit through any more of that travesty. when they came across the old indian asking for beans i gave up and erased it. is this the best that scifi channel can come up with for saturday nights? how about some old classics instead? the idea of a coed special forces unit was bad enough. it seems like they wanted to save money by having everything filmed out in the woods. what more can i say? it was so awful that i don't think i can come up with enough lines to qualify for space to review it. but, it looks like one more line will do it. save your time, let alone your money on this dog of a film.
