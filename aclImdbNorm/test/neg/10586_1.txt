it's not unusual that hollywood likes to pump out crappy films. occasionally, a handful of good films come out of them while the majority just sucks major ass. it's also not surprising that those bad films are retreads of old tv series'. occasionally a surprise pops up with "the fugitive" (who saw that best picture oscar nom coming?), but for every "fugitive", there's a mchale's navy or some other wholly unoriginal film devoid of any plot or interest. the mod squad, in my opinion, goes into my top ten of truly lousy films, in which hollywood should get it's sorry ass beaten for producing what could've been a good movie. we're shifted right dab smack in the middle of a story that just doesn't seem to make sense, it wastes the talent, and the dialogue is just bad. we don't actually know who the hell these characters are, and we could give a flying f**k about what they are. instead, you're expected to automatically know who they are and what they're going to do. there's one particularly bad riff, about the "i'm too old for this s**t" line, that's just plain stupid. something my friend verbally noted when we were clamoring for the movie to just end. it's just an insult to hollywood cinema. grade: f-
