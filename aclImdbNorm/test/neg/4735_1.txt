if you are a fan of either of the two origin franchises (aliens & predator...duh...and even if you liked or disliked avp flick in 06) you will hate this movie. the innumerable plot holes, flakey and unbelievable human characters, terrible special effects and even worse directing and fight scenes make this one of worse films i've ever seen.<br /><br />***spolier*** one of the hundred huge plot holes included the pred/alien hybrid going from chest burster, to full-grown bad-ass in seconds (it takes off on an onboard predator-ship killing spree and wipes out a ship of preds before the ship even breaks earth orbit.) as if. in the first avp we saw a ship of sr. pred hunters drop off three juveniles hunters going on an "earning their stripes" hunting party, and then in the end saw them picking up the "honored body" of the juvenile that was left over at the end of the flick. are we expected to believe that the single chest burster hybrid killed all these sr. hunters before the ship even broke orbit? also, (and this was extremely cheap production value on the director/producer's parts) jars and jars and jars of face-huggers somehow magically appeared aboard the pred ship, even though the entire temple complex and queen alien were destroyed in the avp flick. these face-huggers end up playing an intregal part in movie...of course. and how about all these face huggers becoming full-grown aliens in a days time? what a joke. although there were many many more plot holes, i don't think imdb would appreciate me filling up their servers by writing them here.<br /><br />on the flakey and unbelievable characters, well, where should i go boys and girls? where to start...almost all of these goof balls are clich'e people from other films or tv shows. the town bad-boy who left to avoid jail time but shows up just on the day everything happens to save the day??? where did i see that? oh yeah, last season on jericho!!! then there's the 20-something town sheriff (a former trouble maker himself) who was best-friends at one-time with the bad-boy. where did we see that? oh yeah, jericho and walking tall! then there's the generic soldier (with no rank) coming home from some generic war-front that isn't met like a long-missed loved one and hero at the airport or bus station, but at her own front door by her daughter and husband. and who is this soldier? what did she do in the army/air force/marines/navy/coast guard? we don't know because the movie never tells us. but ... dunh, dunh, dunh...she was some kind of soldier/airman/marine/sailor/coasty that knows how to drive a stryker infantry vehicle and ...magically... a helicopter!!! this character is just a generic copy of every "coming home" service person...except that she brings home a set of night vision goggles to her daughter that cost several hundred dollars. these are things soldiers have to sign for and don't just "bring home." ugh!<br /><br />the special effects and fight scenes are what pi-sed me off the worst though. these are the things i enjoyed the most in the first movie...watching preds and aliens go at it! the way this was filmed though, the action sequences were so dark and filmed so close up that you couldn't tell what was going on. you couldn't see who was doing what and what was going on as they were fighting it out. all in all, these hundreds of items are going to kill this franchise and the fanchise. no one is going to care anymore about seeing their favorite sci-fi movie monsters, and can only guess that the series will go down from here as producers won't like dump millions of dollars more on a sequel.
