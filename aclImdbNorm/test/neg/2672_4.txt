i am not quite sure what to say/think about this movie. it is definitely not the worst in the series (there's still "halloween 3"). the style is just very different and it focuses on other elements than its predecessor did. it tries to explain why michael myers freaks out on halloween and starts butchering around. well, all that stuff about michael myers being cursed and the evil cult was a rather nice effort, but i didn't buy it. none of the other installments in the series tried to come up with any fancy explanations.<br /><br />the movie contains lots of gore. actually it's plain carnage. if you haven't seen the other halloween films you will probably like this one for its blood content. but for a real halloween freak this sequel might be just too different to be seen as a good one. suspense was turned into terror and carnage (exploding heads..., you get the point).<br /><br />the ending (theatrical cut) is simply awful. michael gets stabbed with a needle, then beaten up with a pipe, then stabbed again, this time with more needles, then beaten up a little more until there's slime running out of his head (where did this green stuff come from anyway?). basically it's nothing more than trash worth 5 million $.<br /><br />there was one good thing though: michael's mask!<br /><br />dedicated to donald pleasance, quite a disgrace. <br /><br />my rating: 4/10
