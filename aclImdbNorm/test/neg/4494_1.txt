this movie serves up every imaginable greek stereotype. in one particularly galling scene the tycoon says "i'm just an ignorant peasant." as the grandson of greek peasant immigrants who passed on a legacy of wisdom and love to their children and grandchildren, i found this movie contemptible and odious.
