essentially plotless action film has two good guys (fong and roundtree) pitted against two bad guys (mitchell and pierce). fong is perhaps the most uncharismatic action lead of the 80s, roundtree's small part is a far cry from his "shaft" days, and cameron mitchell adds another shameful role to his career, one to sit right next to his laughable turn in "the toolbox murders" (this man was a respected actor once, now he has come down to wearing flowers in his hair and complaining about people bleeding on his carpet). only stack pierce acts with some dignity. as for the violence, don't worry: most of it is too badly done to offend anyone.
