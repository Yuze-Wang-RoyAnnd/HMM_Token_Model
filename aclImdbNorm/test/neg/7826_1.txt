the story is disjointed and poorly written. we are given threads and a possible hook in act one, only to see it vanish. had the writer bothered reading his work carefully, it wold have been apparent that madsden's character's initial problem and meeting with the 'bad' girl suggests that there will be a troubled alliance between them as they try to solve his problem.<br /><br />the problem goes nowhere. the relationship goes nowhere. and there is no sexual tension in any of the relationships. no-one digs anyone and no-one is appealing. the writing and directing is laughable. you can feel someone struggling with the mess and shifting the story focus about trying to extract some excitement. there is none. the writer/director is simply a beginner whose muddled efforts somehow became a movie. from simple errors such as '...they took polaroids...' - in japan in 2007 ? to insulting errors such as nudity for eroticism, this movie is an insult. you cannot make them much worse.<br /><br />and by plastering 'madsden' on the talent list, the producers thought they'd have some success. he is hardly acting. asia certainly is... and the result is some heroin-chic panto.<br /><br />give it a big miss.
