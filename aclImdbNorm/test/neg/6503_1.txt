the abc gears up it's repertory company for another unrealistic representation of rural australia. yes folks, it's all there baca bourke (jeremy sims,an actor of little talent) fire hero , lill (libby tanner plays bronwyn craig in the bush), fifi (nadia townsend) town slut, preggers by baca's brother joe (i think). then there's uncle geoff the, big daddy of lost springs. uncle geoff's scenes are like tennessee williams on speed. only saving grace is russian actress natalia novikova as baca's loony missus. she is great. i can't understand why john waters took the gig as lilly's psychologist husband. must have needed the money i expect! still, he won't last long as lill and baca will be having it off toute suit. just watch this lemon to see how bad an aussie show can be. frankly, i'm ashamed.
