*the elite sniper team that has inserted 24h or so earlier have instead of digging in and making them selves invisible decided to take cover behind a big rock in one of the first scenes. *when the hero "runs" to rescue his wife he actually jogs. *when inside a building and aiming for a target only some 20-30 meter away the hero uses his scope. besides the fact that most non elite soldiers would make that shot from the hip and still hit there is also the fact that the scope probably wouldn't be able to focus that close. *there is a satellite that can actually look horizontally into buildings.<br /><br />the list is endless... and the film is the biggest heap of crap i have ever put in my dvd player.
