i remember watching this for the first time in the 80's as a teen. man, i've read the reviews on this trash and i find myself astonished by the voting. this movie does not deserve four stars!!! this movie is not better than topgun. topgun has its own problems; don't get me wrong. this movie should be banned just for its own stupidity. so many stereotypes, so many loop holes, so much poor dialog. i cannot think of one redeeming quality of this vomit. this is not action/adventure. this is a bad joke on film. kinda like watching plan 9 with stock f-16 footage. this movie not only defies logic and common sense within the context of a military setting, it sends a disturbing message. the military is not going to save your dad from the imminent evil of the middle east b*****ds. so go out there and hijack a multi-million dollar weapon and blast him out of the sinister clutches of the backwards, anti-american arabs. cuz you can't reason with those animals. this is a bruckheimer flick without a budget. bland direction, weak acting, lame music, idiotic plot, equals...iron eagle.
