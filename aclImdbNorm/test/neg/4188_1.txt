my spoiler is in my pants because thinking about this movie made me so angry i crapped myself.<br /><br />once you finish watching it, you stare at the tv set in confusion and horror. then, there's a soft tap on your shoulder and a voice hisses, "you will die in seven days." you turn around, and one of your best friends is standing there with a look of absolute hatred for the one that suggested this movie when you were in blockbuster.<br /><br />i won't lie: this is the worst movie on the face of the earth. i saw it with 5 of my friends all 18-year-old guys, and these were our reactions: -one person actually began crying and punching himself -one person screamed and passed out -one person stood up and staggered out the front door to reappear more than an hour later -one person simply blacked out (this one was me) -one person started babbling incoherently, as if he had both cerebral palsy and touretts' syndrome -one person went into a sort of catatonic trance and did not respond to our voices for more than twenty minutes<br /><br />the movie really is that bad. there's one part where the retarded cameraman actually trips (while holding the camera), but the producers decided to leave it in. seriously, you can hear him grunt and swear when he hits the ground. there's only one special effect, and it's special in the same way that a retarded kid trying to solve a rubix cube is special: the camera rotates so that the on-screen action (action, n. some dumbass lost in a corn field for 80 freaking minutes) does a barrel roll.<br /><br />under no circumstances should it be watched, and the movie itself even warns you of this fact. do you know what the tagline on the back is? "some warnings should not be ignored." i honestly think that the release of this movie to the public is a sick practical joke on the producers' part. that's not to say, however, that you should pass it by if you see it at the movie store - it would then sit on the shelf for some other poor sucker to see. rather, buy every copy of it you can get your hands on and mail them to people that you hate.
