i fail to understand why anyone would allow a sub-par director to put drivel like this onto celluloid. this movie has already been made at least two other times that were better than this ("here comes mr. jordan" - 1941, and "heaven can wait" - 1978). the only saving factor for figure skating fans might have been some nice ice skating done by a professional cast of skaters, but this just does not happen. the closest thing the audience sees to good skating is when tara lipinski's character takes a turn on the ice for a just a moment. others like nancy kerrigan and elvis stojko are hidden in the background and do not do any figure skating at all. there is not much real emotion shown, and there is not really any reason to tune in to this obviously made-for-tv movie. my advice: rent the original.
