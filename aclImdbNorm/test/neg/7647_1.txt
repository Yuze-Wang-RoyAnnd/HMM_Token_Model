honestly, one of the worst written, directed and acted movies i have ever seen. seemed like a made-for-tv movie. and a bad one at that. i cannot believe that people are still hiring danny huston after seeing him in this movie, or that they are still allowing john sayles to make films. my husband and i came across this movie on tv one night and got so bored with it, we ended up cleaning the house while it was on . . . and it still bored us! it made me think that critics have been so gullible with sayles' previous films, such as lone star, which was raved about at he time but didn't really add up to much in the end. spend your time on something better. anything.
