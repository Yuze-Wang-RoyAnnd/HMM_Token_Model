if you thought day after tomorrow was implausible, wait till you see this.<br /><br />okay so the premise of most disaster films is usually a 1 in billion event occurring, compounded by other circumstances. in this case, the even is the joining of two huge storm systems. fair enough so far. oh but hold up, no, the "event" is the sabotage and subsequent destruction of the power grid.<br /><br />next throw in loads of human interest elements - in this case a cheating husband, a psychotic gun-wielding boyfriend, a rebellious daughter, a hacker with a point to prove, a senator trying to push an agenda, a reporter trying to stand up against "the man", and a pregnant women stuck in an elevator.<br /><br />finally add a handful of taster events to add excitement.<br /><br />jeez if the director tried to fit in any more meaningless plot lines, there would have been no time less for the actual disaster, which, given the pitiful state of the computer graphics, was almost certainly the intention.<br /><br />jeez, if you can't even model a truck convincingly, you really should not be taking on twisters, exploding power stations, las vegas getting ripped apart, or destroyed oil stations.<br /><br />in case you didn't already gather how appalling this movie is, let me just add that all three bad guys get killed in separate, and wholly ungratifying, implausible manners, that stunk more of moralising that good film-making.<br /><br />i'm have no problem with first month film students writing jaded, hackneyed, clich'e-soaked scripts, but for god's sake, that doesn't mean anyone has to make them into movies!<br /><br />it manages to make the abysmally implausible 10.0 apocalypse look not quite so dreadful. avoid them both.
