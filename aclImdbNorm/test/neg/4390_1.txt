the box is why i originally picked up this movie and the back is why i rented it. but i soon learned that i had been duped. i had thought this movie would be something like a road trip/eurotrip/american pie deal. but i was wrong. this movie is one of the dumbest i've seen in a long time. the unrated version teases you in to watching but will completely disappoint you. the acting was terrible and sound effects just gaudy. it appeared very low budget with the entire setting taking place in the same building. go out and get eurotrip or road trip instead. i can't believe national lampoon put its name on this. don't buy it, don't rent it. don't waste 2 hours of your life on this.
