most of this film was okay, for a sequel of a sequel of a sequel...<br /><br />i was impressed by the amount of suspense there was; i had actually expecting that to be chucked out the window in favor of gore, gore, gore. it wasn't, but there's some pretty ridiculous deaths.<br /><br />the thing that i disliked, however, was all of the plot complications. those could have been okay, if the scriptwriters had taken the time to explain all of them through. but what was the purpose of the secret society in the mental institution, specifically? why were they protected from michael's damage until a certain point? what exactly were they going to do with the baby? how did jaime lloyd get pregnant, for that matter? why lock her up for 20 years for her to get pregnant, too? why did michael kill all his co-conspirators in the end? why were there fetuses in the lab? the actors seemed to have "figured it all out" once they saw the fetuses.. but it was never explained to the audience.<br /><br />if you're just going to watch this film to see people get snuffed, then this'll be okay for you.. however, if you can't stand a plot being thrown at you which remains unresolved by the time the credits roll, you should go watch something else.
