a complete and utter waster of my precious two hours. the entire movie could have been made in less than 60 seconds by simply showing people getting coked up, a car crashing, people getting more coked up, people having sex, people crying, and people getting more coked up. the tagline for this movie should have read "come see how f*cked up our characters are! they're stoned! they're coke addicts! they're a mess! who are these people? do you really care? does it matter? just give us your money please, because we sure don't care about anything else!" an absolutely terrible movie. it never went anywhere, you never got to know the characters (they never even said what these people did to earn such a big house and so much money and cars and coke), and it was just downright boring. you might like the movie a little more if you're a stoner yourself, but for the vast majority of us that aren't, this movie is a waste of film and of time.
