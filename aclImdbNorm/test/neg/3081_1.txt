from what i remember seeing of this film, it was not good. i always say that if a film is good and can keep you attention throughout the hardest of moments (example: a tylenol cold & sinus war) than it is a film that has done its job. the fact that i was asleep for most of this film only proves the fact that it could not keep my attention, and ergo, it did not complete its job. why did i fall victim to the tylenol cold & sinus, when i had a film in my arsenal? <br /><br />to begin, committed did not make any sense. the acting was poor and the overall story left more doors opened that just couldn't be closed. i am thinking of the moment when i swear i saw affleck and graham (brother and sister in this film) kissing. that didn't make any sense. then there was a scene with affleck and his roommates indicating that he was sleeping with one of them, almost breaking up a perfect lesbian couple. i suppose this was to show that most are not as committed to a relationship as graham is, but for me it just was nothing more than filler. i have this suspicious feeling that the director of this film was sleeping with affleck. his acting in this film was atrocious. i mean, i have never seen him do any "good" acting, but this was by far the worst. oh, i just had another moment during the battle come through my mind and i confirmed it with imdb.com ... what was john stewart doing in this film? that was yet again another moment when my eyes were opened just for a moment in one of those battles that seemed to last forever.<br /><br />and frankly, it's heather graham - we could care less about her after a while. she's just not interesting - she's just bland, boring and basically stops acting after a while. while they desperately start throwing wacky characters into the mix to revive the movie, it just doesn't work and instead of just calling it a day - they start throwing more characters into the mix so now it's just weird, tedious, boring and really, really long. luke wilson's slow drawl acting style slows an already crawling movie to dead halt - why exactly were these two married? committed is a truly terrible film--the kind of "hip comedy" that leaves you staggering out depressed and bored.<br /><br />grade: * out of *****
