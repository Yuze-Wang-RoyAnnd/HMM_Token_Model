i expected so much more than what i received from watching this movie. it is not that i object to literary license, (if that is what it should be called) especially when there is no overt attempt to say "based on a true story." but this movie is about beethoven -- a real historical person who is so widely known and so deeply embedded into our musical experiences and i expected the movie to be true to history at least in the primary elements. this movie took such great exception from the historic record it could only disappoint.<br /><br />my assumption (because i had not researched the movie at all) was that it was true. half way through, i stopped the movie to look it up on imdb. the rest of the movie was a remarkably different experience. i was relieved that this was not accurate with history because it was so hard to believe a major portion of the story. to enjoy this movie, i was required to recognize it as a fantasy, a "what if it was like this" story. the movie lacked this honest disclaimer.<br /><br />what disappointed me most was the fictionalized conducting of the 9th symphony. the very concept portrayed in the film stretched my imagination to the point of incredulity. i ended up doubting anything was true to history other than ludwig van beethoven and his relationship with karl van beethoven.<br /><br />i really enjoyed the performance of ed harris - an exceptional actor who knows how to play a role and keep himself out of it and that was about it and for that i give it a 3/10.<br /><br />those who portend that this movie is as good as or better than amadeus have not a clue about either either composers life and are looking only for what this movie really is, for in the end it was a cheap novel of a story - pulp fiction.
