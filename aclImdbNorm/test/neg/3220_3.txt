some weeks ago, at a movie theater, i saw a movie poster of el padrino (2004) with the tag "the latin godfather". how lame have we become, i thought, latin just because he is a mexican? let me remind you that anything latin comes from or is related to latium, italy, so the original guy in the godfather movie is more latin than the mexican godfather and this is why: we are called latin-american people because we speak spanish, a language based in the latin language that originated in rome now italy. so to place a tag in a movie poster like "the latin godfather", is not just ignorant, of course if we are trying to related this movie to the original godfather, but a desperate and uncreative attempt to get some credit by copying the title of a movie classic. now about the movie, i just hate overacting so from 1 to 10 i guess is 3 the most.
