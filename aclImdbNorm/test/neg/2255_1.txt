this usually all sounds a lot better in my head (so forgive me for rambling) i'm hardly tarantino's biggest fan (and will *try* not to stoop to calling him a 'hack'....which is quite hard) i don't like to mock or critique a movie before seeing it. so with cautious hesitation, i walked to the cinema today to watch 'inglorious basterds'<br /><br />now, to call it a 'rip-off of a rip-off' would be unfair here. tarantino is happy enough to take the title from enzo castellari's (less than spectacular) dirty dozen clone, but not it's plot points (that, he takes from all other genre of movies) 'inglorious' opens with a nazi officer and his lengthy interrogation against a farmer who is hiding jews in his basement. this is such an anti-climax, in that, it's dialogue is stale, and outcome signposted a mile off. of course, one of the hidden jews makes her escape (but more of her later) we (the obviously, easily pleased) audience are treated to the introduction of lt. aldo raine (ha-ha, that name almost sounds like b-movie king aldo ray....ha-ha quentin...keep those 'tributes' coming) and this character is played by none other than brad (dallas) pitt (sorry, dallas was about the only good thing he's ever starred in) and with jaw-jutting, mr jolie treats us to a hound-dogged, southern drawled, smirking nazi-killer. meanwhile mr tarantino forgets that actual grown-ups may be in attendance, so assumes that the teenyboppers won't have heard of the 'dirty dozen'?<br /><br />raines 'platoon' consists of (john cassavettes looking) blood-thirsty jewish soldiers, all looking to get the big payback on adolf hitler. tarantino in all his superior knowledge, pays special attention to two of these men, by casting his long time best buddy (and fellow homage-sycophant) eli roth (as the baseball bat wielding 'bear jew') the other man is called hugo stiglitz (and i'll wager more than half the qt fan-boys had never heard this name before this movie) keep up the good work tarantino, you've managed about 6 or 7 'hommages' so far (in the first 15 minutes) keep adding them, and it may detract from the plot (or lack of?)<br /><br />anyhow, cutting a long (and extremely boring and protracted) story short, both raine and his men (the 'inglorious basterds') and the sole survivor from chapter one, both have separate plots to kill hitler at the showing of a nazi-propaganda movie, in a french cinema (owned by the fore-mentioned survivor, now grown up)<br /><br />more boring (and pointless) conversations follow two and fro, as pitt mugs away at an audience past caring. and any genuine suspense, leading to the assassination of the most deadly tyrant of all time, is thrown-away by the directors insistence of placing a 1980's david bowie song in a wwii movie.<br /><br />my problems (and there are many) with this movie, is the re-occurring problem i have with most tarantino product.....he rarely knows when to either start or stop. i don't need 'homage' after 'homage' to get the *joke* (whatever it may be) i knew of inglorious bastards, enzo castellari, aldo ray, hugo stiglitz (and the ultimate crime of the entire movie) ennio morricone's haunting score from revolver. i go to the cinema to see the stars.....if the best you can do is the dire barad pitt, i'll assume you (mr tarantino) are the main draw here? i don't want the audience directing the movie. i pay to see your vision, your ideas, your creativity....not how you can patchwork (time and time again) endless scenes from endless movies. it's high time the fan-boys (on imdb) employed some 'tough love' on your 'idol' (god knows, if you don't....the studios should?)<br /><br />the tired old argument with tarantino worshippers is "well, if you can do better...do so" let me tell you, if i was a 46 year old director, with the (unfortunate) pull qt has.....i'd want to offer you a lot more than a warmed up muddled re-hash of better wwii movies than this tripe. the directors he attempts to emulate, made movies so bad by accident, or due to budgetary constraints. it's a cop out, time and time again, to hear his fans campaign his lack of imagination as 'art'. i'm sure he's capable of better (but after giving him the benefit of the doubt, once more....and not to mention 2 and a half hours of my life.....) maybe he isn't?
