well, i only caught the tail end of this film on hbo, just the final 10 minutes or so, but i must say that it contains probably the most laughable depiction of distance running ever put on film! i'm a serious distance runner and a dedicated fan of the sport, and i've sat through many painful demonstrations in movies before. however, nothing could have ever prepared me for what is shown on screen in the final 10 minutes of this movie, it literally defies belief! the depiction of the runners is even more ironic considering that african runners completely dominate the sport, and they are elegant and graceful. the female protagonist shuffles along like an overweight pregnant woman, and her "highly trained" male supporters are no better. well into the race this alleged world class runner is surrounded by pudgy, overweight people, many of whom are walking! i find it interesting that the director decided to have her lead the female competition, yet near the end she is shown passing people who look like they're staggering along on two broken legs! are we to believe that this amazing stellar athlete has only overtaken a crippled person at the very end of the race? maybe the director just thinks that female runners can't run faster than 12 minute miles, and he has obviously never heard of athletes like paula radcliffe or tirunesh dibaba.<br /><br />even if you aren't a running fan you'll be astonished by the insanely inaccurate portrayal of running, and this movie is only watchable as unintentional comedy. here is a note to the director: the next time you decide to make a movie about a sport, it might be worth it to hire at least one person who actually has observed that sport in action.
