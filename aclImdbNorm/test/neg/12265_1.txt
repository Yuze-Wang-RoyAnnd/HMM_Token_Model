this film proves a theory i have had for quite some time - in australia, as long as a film deals with the right topic, it will be a success regardless of how terrible it is. aussie park boyz could not possibly be any worse - the acting is beyond terrible, the plot is basically a poor warriors knock-off, and the filmmakers clearly have no idea about ethnic gangs in australia (an irish gang in twenty-first century sydney! the last time any irish gangs were in australia was about a hundred years ago in the time of the tinkers!) but because it's about ethnic rivalry, one of four topics guaranteed to be a success in australian cinema (along with struggling families, minority groups, and the biography of a famous australian) it won multiple academy awards. i've always suspected that australian critics will lap up any rubbish that deals with these issues, but part of me thought, or at least hoped, that they had their limits. this film proves otherwise. so to all you australian aspiring film-makers out there, don't bother putting thought into your film or choosing people who can actually act, or even getting your facts right - just write a script about some poor family trying to make ends meet, or someone of a foreign race coming to australia and having to deal with racial prejudice and stereotypes, or, if you want to take a leaf out of these people's book, some ethnic gang fighting some other ethnic gang that isn't actually plausible in the period the film is set, and your film will win five academy awards regardless of how pathetic it is!
