everybody loves to see a really bad movie sometime. you watch it, take a good laughs and forget it in the next half hour. but this is not one of those. it's the worst thing that will appear in front of your eyes for a while.<br /><br />i would like to see someone to take responsibility for dante - he's really the most stupid villain you can think of: a guy in leather pants that speaks with a voice over and has a victory laugh like a 50's dracula. how can someone came up with this guy?? and the hero..."the dragon" or whatever...my cereals box has better acting skills than him (maybe than all of them), it's unbelievable. but the worst are the fighting scenes where you would think there could be something in it. they're so lame, it's beyond any kind of description. there's no shame, i just can't believe how this movie was allowed by any studio. but i'm just thrilled it was. watching this is a self-mutilating pleasure. see this only if you're in a movie quest for pain, and in that case, this one is a sure winner.
