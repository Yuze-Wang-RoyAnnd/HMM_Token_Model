other reviewers seem to have held this film in high regard. for something made by an eighteen year old film student, i would say bravo, but that is not the case. if you want to watch a good movie about graffitti stick to the documentaries. it is filmed with the same quality as a digital home video. the two main characters are dismal actors and once again that would be okay if this were a student film. the plot follows a lonely artist who skateboards around portland writing graffitti. he is joined by another and they skate around together creating art. then comes the unnecessary gay love scene. then comes the dispute between them that is never actually discussed because this film has about as much dialogue as a charlie chaplin picture. this movie does show the gravity street artists give to their form well, and the music is nice, but overall i wouldn't really call it a film.
