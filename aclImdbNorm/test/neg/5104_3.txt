while i have seen and enjoyed similar movies to this one that were silent films about the russian revolution, such as potemkin and ten days that shook the world, i did not particularly enjoy this one. this was mostly due to the annoying and "artsy" way that the director chose to shoot the film. while potemkin excelled in its editing style, this movie used similar techniques with a lot less finesse--in some places, the editing seemed very choppy and amateurish. plus, and this was truly annoying, the use of zombies throughout the beginning of the film and late in the film really was over-the-top. what i mean by "zombies" is that to illustrate just how depressed and oppressed the ukranian peasants were, the people stand like mannequins in many scenes. and, they stand like this, unmoving, for a very long period of time, while the "evil" capitalists and exploiters of the masses walk by. gimme a break! this movie is a wonderful example of style over substance--and it's only a movie for those who enjoy or can overlook the overindulgent direction.<br /><br />by the way, the dvd for this film is improved, somewhat, if you leave the audio commentary on. this makes the movie easier to follow and gives a few interesting insights.
