originally i wrote what was a sarcastic,scathing review of this pathetic piece of dung,but every time i submitted the review i got "this contains a very long word which is not allowed", also words that were not misspelled were judged incorrect. <br /><br />now the word that was judged too long was never identified.after numerous attempts at eliminating words eventually i got the sneaking suspicion that the imdb site is politically sensitive and set to reject certain words automatically.nothing i wrote was obscene or racist in itself.but after eliminating all of the longest words the same message was repeated again and again,also words that weren't judged misspelled were all the sudden considered misspelled!<br /><br />the pc police are everywhere.
