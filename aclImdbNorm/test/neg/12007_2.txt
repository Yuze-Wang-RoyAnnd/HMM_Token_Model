i am having a hard time finding the words to explain just how much i detested this movie. the historical trial of henriette deluzy-desportes and the duc de praslin is a tragic and compelling story that, i feel, had the potential to be a fantastic film, but failed. <br /><br />although the cinematography certainly had something to say for itself, it in no way could make up for the terrible structure of the film, the badly written script and most of all the horrendously overacted characters. the worst of them were the duc's children who were so over-the-top-corny and sickeningly fake that it was almost painful to watch.<br /><br />in conclusion, this film left me feeling nothing more than irritated and profoundly disappointed.
