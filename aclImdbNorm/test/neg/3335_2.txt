first, i don't see how the movie is on any "best" list or how it won any awards. compared to la pianiste, which is also on a "best" list, la pianiste is gold. this movie lacked so many things, on so many different levels, but i can't quite explain why i disliked it so much. the lead actor was annoying, i felt as though i never knew what was going on, and i was bored!! even though this was supposed to be some worthwhile life change that pierre was starting, i wanted it to end.... as soon as possible. why did it have to be his sister and cousin? ugh. and why did thibault get mean? he just bipolarly turned mean. and also, was it me or did i miss the whole purpose of what that guy in black was all about? who were all those people playing music in the big basement of the big warehouse? why did they have all that weird equipment and the guns and all those extra rooms for people to live in? i mean this in all seriousness, but does incest happen a lot in french culture? european culture? i took 5 years of learning about the culture and i never heard anything about that!
