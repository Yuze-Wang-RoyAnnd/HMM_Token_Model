<br /><br />i rented this movie on 20 june 2001, and watched it for about 45 minutes. i concluded that watching a blank screen would be delightful by comparison. there was not a single person in the cast for whom i would have shed a tear if hell itself had opened up and swallowed the whole bunch of them.<br /><br />so, i e-mailed all of my friends and relatives warning them, and i am taking the time to urge everyone who may see this note to avoid this movie like the plague! i have seen some really bad movies in my time, but never one as bad as this.
