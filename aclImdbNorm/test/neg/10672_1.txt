ego. seems it's the only reason this movie was made. this movie is so wrong in so many ways that it's below one's dignity to write much about it. every character was only good at self praise and lead actors (i use this term liberally as has the director) emote in the likeness of stone. the little story, if that, fails on the basic aspects such as logic, feeling and drama. direction leaves much to be desired. blatant flaws are all over the place (character motives aren't defined, prospective husbands are found overnight, broken car windows mend themselves among other things)<br /><br />let's face it, himesh can't act. neither, it seems, can hansika motwani. in her defense, she's still a chubby child who looks older than she is thanks to tonnes of make-up. raj babbar overacts and makes his little presence as fake as possible. darshan jariwala laughs a bit too much. the actor who plays himesh's friend is the only natural. <br /><br />a few questions do come to mind: how can such a film cost rs.500,000,000?? where did the money go??? granted that one chase sequence was moderately well shot and mallika sherawat was paid an obscene rs.15,000,000 for her 15 minute appearance and 2 songs. but the sheer stupidity of the film boggles the mind. (including 3 mumbai auto rickshaws that show up and jump on a police car)<br /><br />the good: himesh shows courage by allowing the film to make fun of his nasal voice and trademark "topi." let's give the devil his due: himesh, as usual gives good music.<br /><br />the bad: direction, story, himesh's singing is still hard to ignore<br /><br />the ugly: dialogs and everything else!!!<br /><br />final word: painful in every sense of the word! watch this movie only if you loved subhash ghai's "yaadein"
