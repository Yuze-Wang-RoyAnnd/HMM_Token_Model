i picked this movie up because it sounded like a pretty decent flick, and i've always been a fan of foreign films. however, for someone who likes movies, i was surprised at how much i hate, hate, hated this movie.<br /><br />although it does aim to expose the lives of young, lowerclass men in lima, and to an extent it does succeeed, the characters are hopelessly shallow and the audience winds up having absolutely no feelings whatsoever for them.<br /><br />although the story chiefly revolves around m, he rarely ever speaks, and his dialouge is, at best, amazingly dry and dull.<br /><br />*** warning: some small spoilers ***<br /><br />basically, the story revolves around a young man named m who has been searching for jobs, but without success (he does gain employment twice, but quits because they're "not for him", when you're poor, the last option you have is to be picky). some amount of time is spent with his friends, who's idea of "fun" is to rape a little 14 year old, steal crappy tires off a piece of shit car for a dime sack of weed, and several other slightly retarded activities.<br /><br />m's friend comesup with a plan to make $25,000 a piece and move to the us by running cocaine to miami. when the drug lord gives them a job, we're treated to an extremely lame scene of the three friends buying clothes at the mall with some music playing in the background. we see them trying different clothes on like little girls given $200 to shop, get there hair cut, and then strutting off looking like slick gangsters (one character, carlos, will from this point on wear sunglasses always... even at night).the day before they leave, the leader of the group leaves to speak with the drug lord, leaving m and his friend to be dumb. they party up, take several samples of the drugs they're suppose to run, and break into thier old school, acting like animals and smashing everything in sight.<br /><br />the movie ends when m tries calling his girlfriend, who hangs up on him. the friends then proceed to set the pay phone on fire, which brings out a bunch of kids and some old man with gun. m and carlos' friend in charge of the drug run shows up on his motorcycle and wants them to leave with him now. then he takes off by himself, and gets shot by that old man. the police show up and arrest m and his friends (but not the man who shot the guy) and cover thier dead friend up with newspapers as music plays and it fades to credits.<br /><br />**** end spoiler ****<br /><br />i even watched this movie a second time, hoping to see some subtle, redeeming factor for it, but i did not. a complete waste of 102 minutes. although i must give it credit for being straightforward and not shying away from disturbing elements, the casting, acting, and overall direction still leaves much, much, much to be desired.<br /><br />imho, if you're interested in a movie that explores the issues this one was suppose to, go rent city of god (cidade de deus) instead. avoid this trash at all costs! you have been warned!!
