first the easy part: this movie is pretentious crapola!<br /><br />it put me in mind of "magnolia". and then i thought "wow-- somebody made a movie even dumber and more irritating than "magnolia".<br /><br />i know nothing about the polish brothers, but this film seems to have been made by someone who learned a lot in film school but knows nothing about storytelling. the trite plot elements and sledgehammer symbolism are bad enough, but the dialogue is just pathetic. <br /><br />detailed comments would just be a laundry list of failure. the parts that are supposed to be funny or satirical are not; the "elegaic" parts are nice coffee table pictures with mediocre music; the "emotional" parts are simplistic.<br /><br />the worst thing is that the movie shows no love at all for the characters, except for a little cornball dignity in the priest.<br /><br />i still can't believe the respect some people have given this picture.
