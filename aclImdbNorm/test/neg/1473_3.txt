i love documentaries. they are among my favorite genres of film. before seeing this film i hadn't seen one that i hadn't liked.<br /><br />the premise for this film is a great one. the execution is well done. there were some times early on when i laughed and smiled. yet as the film went on the more tedious and irritating it became. this could have been something special had the subject not been such an inarticulate, childish, inept putz. i appreciate his passion for film, but quit your whining. if you're short on funds, maybe you shouldn't have so many kids, or spend so much money on alcohol. maybe you should have gone to film school, or at least graduated from high school. maybe you should have lived life and gotten perspective and experiences that could add to your vision. <br /><br />there are so many people out there with stories that are interesting, funny and poignant. to see this guy chosen over any of them is nothing less than crass. if you want to do a documentary on a film maker, why not do one on someone from china or iran, a film maker with real problems? <br /><br />two final questions:<br /><br />who takes a little kid to see apocalypse now?<br /><br />how many times did this guy say "man"?
