a team of amateur journalists and tree-huggers catches wind of a secret government project, project carnivore, on a remote south pacific island. the scientists there are producing giant-sized corn, but the genes are spreading to other species, creating abnormally large komodo dragons and a cobra (one that's bullet-proof and swims underwater). with the help of the scientist's daughter, can they escape the island and tell the world? even if i hadn't seen this film on the sci-fi channel (which, sadly, i did) it would scream "sci-fi channel" with its low production value, weak acting and some of the worst special effects in history. the effects here are comparable to another creature film, "raptor island", although not nearly as bad. i would suspect that there must be at least a handful of people that worked on both films, but i haven't bothered to confirm that and probably won't. it will be a sad day when i see either of them films again.<br /><br />which is not to say it's not enjoyable. i watched it at two in the morning with my sister's boyfriend and i can't speak for him, but i thought it was a pretty good use of time. as bad the whole thing is, it's a fun picture if you like to make fun of movies and the scientist's daughter is attractive enough to carry the film (i believe the actress' name is michelle borth). michael pare also appears as a ship captain, and his poor choice of roles here actually makes his work on "furnace" look respectable (even if that movie is intolerably bad).<br /><br />i can't be too hard on this film simply because it was more or less exactly what i thought it would be. bad effects? low budget? no-name actors? i didn't have any higher hopes. yet, this doesn't mean that it's awesome, either. coming in at par is nothing to be proud of and this one will slowly fade into the distant memory department. for the one fan who likes this film (and calls it "kvc"), hold on to your copy because you'll have a heck of a time getting a replacement.
