as a serious horror fan, i get that certain marketing ploys are used to sell movies, especially the really bad ones. so i wouldn't call it naivet'e that i assumed this was softcore horror ripping off cannibal / zombi / jungle holocaust. unfortunately, i was completely wrong as this is very hardcore. i should have realized that when i saw the odd "no actual or identifiable minor was used" warning. notice the identifiable part as though he is daring us to catch him? a group of scientists, half of whom are pretty women in bikinis, are led by a sea captain with a penchant for 69ing on the beach, in search for a mutated native killing villagers. due to a nuclear bomb detonated on a supposedly evacuated island, the radiation turned this last man into a rapist/ killer.<br /><br />writer/ actor george eastman is the only one trying here and succeeds in keeping his clothes on. the sex scenes are whacked out. women walk around nude exuding a strange overconfidence and one even asks for rape when her husband turns her down. well, two chicks slapping each other naturally turns into a lesbo scene because women are horndogs. i saw the chick toss another chicks salad and finger herself.<br /><br />if there is anything you should know about this film, it is that. because the rest of this insane movie is just the same. oh, who am i kidding? there is a ton more to tell here. like the white "duchess" that pays for 2 black guys to tag team her in a parlor. or the "duchess" taking off her top to use as a bandage when the captain cuts himself. when he refuses her advances, she starts crying. so being the good gentleman he is, he reluctantly lets her pleasure him in front of the other crew members. i was honestly waiting for the pizza guy to show up and the "duchess" to ask if there is any other way to pay him.<br /><br />and all of this happens before they depart for the island to conduct their research. wait, i thought this was a zombie flick? but the zombie doesn't enter until the 73min mark, but by that time everyone else has been "entered" plenty. i found myself hitting fast forward a few scenes
