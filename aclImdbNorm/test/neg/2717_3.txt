i am easily pleased. i like bad films. i like films featuring attractive young women in small amounts of clothing.<br /><br />this film gives all the above a bad name. yes, you know going in that what you're getting is not high art, or anything like. but, even for the type of movie it is, beach babes from beyond isn't very good.<br /><br />some people have given it 10. i can only assume that these are people who have had the organs which enable rational thought to take place surgically removed.<br /><br />it isn't very good. it simply isn't very good.<br /><br />3 out of 10 solely on the grounds of a) novelty value for the famous relatives and burt ward and b) some of the girls are cute.<br /><br />oh, by the way, did i tell you that it isn't very good?
