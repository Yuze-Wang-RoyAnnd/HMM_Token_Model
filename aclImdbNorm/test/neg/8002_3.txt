mockney comes to brighton; despite a poor reception in the british press and state-funded-british-cinema written all over it i rather hoped that we'd get a bit of the grimy, hard-nosed london-by-the-sea of graham greene.<br /><br />it doesn't even aspire to this. characters straight out of their clone 'n crimp trailers reproduce guy ritchie's types. the format looks more like a british tv series than a film (brighton is a backdrop goldmine, wasted with plastic studio work).<br /><br />i watched this film in pursuit of a good performance from famke janssen... she's a bit slick for this company, her brand of big screen impertability belonging more to blockbusters such as deep rising. as for acting (a role even!) the search continues. circus is boring. 3/10
