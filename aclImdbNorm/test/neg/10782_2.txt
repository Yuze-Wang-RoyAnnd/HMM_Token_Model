in case you dear readers never heard, this movie was the main inspiration for last year's samuel l. jackson-eugene levy clunker the man. this 80s-drenched buddy action-comedy pairs short 'n stubbly billy crystal and the late ethiopian shim-shammer gregory hines together as some witty chi-town cops who don't play by the rules. that's pretty much the extent of the movie. interest is somewhat peaked by hines' line delivery that is spookily similar to will smith's and by cameos of now-more-famous actors like memento's joe pantoliano and "nypd blue's" jimmy smits. my favorite scene is, i dunno, the car chase on the tracks, i guess. basically, i just view this movie as a major helping hand in the demolition of action buddy flicks. well, this and lethal weapon 4... and rush hour 2... and the man...
