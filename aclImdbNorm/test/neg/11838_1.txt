this movie doesn't even deserve a 1/10 this movie was a scam.<br /><br />i swear that at least 30 minutes of the film were deliberetly copied from carnosaur 1, 2, & 3.the whole movie "raptor" was based of the movie and that was really a pathetic attempt to be a "thriller, action packed, dinosaur" copy. i loved that movie series and seeing it be put on a movie that cant even afford or willing copy it without doing there own models is what america is coming to.i recommend you see the carnosaur movie first (all of them) and then watch this, and you will know what i mean.<br /><br />- spencer
