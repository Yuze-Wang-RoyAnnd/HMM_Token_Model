as a ca resident, i'd like to see the jackholes who were shutting down the electricity plants to raise the prices get some jail time too. <br /><br />i thought the movie was pretty good and has some very informative pieces. while they stuck to how enron rose and crashed, i found it really interesting. however, when the movie focused on it's anti-bush slant, it made me wonder if they were really being accurate. <br /><br />it's fine to point out any connection the republicans had to enron, but the monster was created while clinton was president. the ca energy crisis happened under davis's watch. both were in office during enron's abuses, but neither are held accountable in any way. rather, many minutes are spent on how bush was friends with lay. so what? lay played golf with clinton and spent the night in the lincoln bedroom. why are democrats given such a free pass in this film? i think most politicians are a waste of our taxpayer money so i'm not partial to either party but i hate feeling like i'm subject to someone's political agenda when i watch a documentary. yes, politicians deserve some blame, but i really doubt that the only guilty one's have rs after their names. i found no value in portraying the bush's as kay-lovers when democrats received just as much enron campaign money as republicans did. like i said, it weakens the rest of the film for me because it makes me suspicious of the rest of the facts they lay out.
