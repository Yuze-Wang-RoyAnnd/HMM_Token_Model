fc de kampioenen's only reason for existence is it's local popularity. it has caused this sitcom to run for over 15 years (and still counting).<br /><br />it deals about an amateur soccer team with the emphasis "amateur". every storyline deals with the same subject: some misunderstanding that takes ridiculous (and predictable) proportions, to get resolved in the end.<br /><br />the show's been running for over 15 years now, and the production probably decided not to change a winning team. which means that the show has had minor changes over the course of years (besides a couple of actors getting replaced (they nearly all left by themselves rather than being thrown of the show)). the humor hasn't changed a bit over the years and it was already outdated when it first aired in the first place.<br /><br />i guess you have to be flemish to get this, and over 60 years old, to enjoy such an old fashioned tv show as this.
