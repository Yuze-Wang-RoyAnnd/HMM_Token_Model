anyone can make a movie these days. budget, production value, or experienced crew don't have to stop the self described "director" from "realizing their dream" these days.<br /><br />respect for the craft of film-making, or even just respect for any film aesthetic are no longer prerequisites for actually executing a film.<br /><br />director bill cowell must have thought he struck gold when lion's gate decided to market his original film as a sequel to a film he had nothing to do with.<br /><br />i personally find lion's gate far, far more in error than cowell in regard to dark harvest 2 being made available to the public. lion's gate's deceptive marketing of this film should be investigated by the state attorney general's office and lion's gate's officers should be pickled in sulfuric acid and kerosene for their utter disregard for film, film-making, and good sense.<br /><br />as for the film itself, it's not even worth commenting on.
