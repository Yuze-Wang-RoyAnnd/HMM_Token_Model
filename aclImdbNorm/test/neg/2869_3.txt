i like cky and viva la bam, so i couldn't resist this when i saw it for lb1.99 in gamestation. it is bam magera's debut scripted film, penned by himself and brandon dicimaillo, and stars the entire cky crew (ryan dunn, raab himself, rake yohn, jenn rivell, don vito etc etc). brandon also is in charge of the artistic direction - which is one of the film's greatest merits - its quite ckyish in its colour style - but also shows progression.<br /><br />basically it follows (very loosely) ryan dunn's break up with girlfriend glauren (played by jenn). vilo (played by bam, named after vilo valo by any chance?) and falcone (bran) play his best mates who reek havoc by doing various stunts.<br /><br />its a bit like the cky films but with a linear storyline (which is very basic indeed) and poor acting. its strange, the usually super charsmatic gang seem to have the life sucked out of them when they know what their meant to say next.<br /><br />the acting and script is pretty appalling for the most part, but the second half of the film is much better than the first (90 mins is a stretch for the flick though), and there are a number of redeeming factors, such as tony hawk's cameo, dicimaillo's sub plots such as 'the futurstic invention awards' and 'the diamond bike', the soundtrack is also very strong (its not all cky and him - in fact bomfunk mc's steal the film in terms of its use of music). in the second half of the film the sense of fun is much more real - especially since don vito has a fairly prominent role in the latter part - and he seems to steal every scene he is in.<br /><br />the film will appeal to those who like the cky antics, but only because of the core material and not the filler or story line bullshit. oh, and will someone tell bam that skating montages, especially in films, is sooo 1998.<br /><br />however, the best part of the package on the dvd is not the film - but the 40 mins 'making of' doc.<br /><br />the last 20 minutes of the documentary deal with raab himself's alcholism and the crew's real feelings towards each other amazing candidly (as usual bam comes across as a bit of a dick, especially towards raab's drink problem and ryan dunn comes across as a really nice down to earth guy). the last ten mins of the documentary deal with a friend (who is an infrequent cky member) trying to kick heroin whilst staying at the magera household with the crew - and a caring unitary side of gang (espcially ape and ryan) really comes across - a startling gem in an otherwise dull dvd.<br /><br />for lb1.99 i'm very satisified - although i hope bam stays to the improvised and short skits from now on.
