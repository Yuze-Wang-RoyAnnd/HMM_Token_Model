i can't believe i sat through this garbage. palm trees in d.c. (already mentioned), a dummy-as-dead-body bit so obviously artificial that i thought it was supposed to be a dummy ... until it left a bloodstain ... stilted dialogue, ridiculous plot. i think it's a shame that jill ireland's final film before her death was this stinker. don't waste your time - i wish i hadn't. the only saving grace is that it was on cable, so i didn't waste my money on top of everything.
