unfortunately, koontz seems doomed to die without seeing a decent adaptation of his work. whispers follows the original book very closely, seemingly until the production company ran out of money. all of the sets in the first half of the movie were meticulously recreated from the book - something which has been lacking in many other koontz films. despite its other (numerous) downfalls, i continued to watch in anticipation of some really great scenery. wrong. by the time the detectives show up at the crack head's apartment (in the book), the movie is out of funds, and one of the most suspenseful scenes from the book, is ruined. where the book offered grisly discovery, a search and a chase through the guys apartment, the movie offers the backseat of the guys car.<br /><br />let's face it - koontz writes without a budget in mind, because imagination is free. if a koontz novel ever gets made into a decent movie, no one will go and see it, because they have been let down so many, many, many times before. this is why dean koontz's frankenstein is now just frankenstien - if you had seen your work butchered that many times, you'd get out early if it looked like happening again!
