an insane assault on viewers senses. this is a mish-mash of assorted hindi and english movies - poorly done. the name carries over from a 70s' multi star cast, which the 2002 version also boasts of. the story is taken from the 70s' sunil dutt/reena roy starrer - "nagin" and visual effects taken (a horrible attempt) from the matrix, terminator 2 and mission impossible ii.<br /><br />set in a college environment (sunil shetty, akshaye kumar, manisha - college kids!!!???!!), manisha koirala is the victim, who mistakes a fatal assault on her by two students as a collective effort on the part of our heros. as it turns out manisha is a cobra (nag) snake reborn as a girl in this life and her mate from the previous life, now a super powerful-all-and-any-shape-assuming (ichadhari nag) - munish kohli, is out looking for her in this life. manisha appeals to him to avenge her violation and murder.<br /><br />so begins the mad killing spree, where the avenging lover starts singling each male of the group, with increasing powers and tricks with successive attempts. the effects are extremely cheap, with computer generated skeletons, morphing bodies and motorcycle stunts completing the farce.<br /><br />carry over from nagin includes raj babbar playing a catholic priest who provides temporary relief to our boys with a more "religiously correct" multi-religion locket (the original nagin only had an "om") . sunny deol plays manisha's love interest in her current life and the ultimate saviour against the all powerful munish kohli.<br /><br />music and songs are below average.<br /><br />avoid if you don't fancy cheap thrills.
