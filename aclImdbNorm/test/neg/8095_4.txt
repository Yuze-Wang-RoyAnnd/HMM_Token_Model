i mostly rented this movie to see shannon elizabeth. she played well in this movie, but the plot sucked. the movie wasn't really about anything just about trying to stay single after making a pact when one of jerry o' connell's friends gets married. the other friends put together this money and who's ever last to get married get's the money ($10,000) from all his friends. anyway the movie just try to follow through by making no since and trying to make it more funny then making since. i'm glad i only paid .50 for this movie. it really wasn't good at all. i rated it **** out of 10 stars!
