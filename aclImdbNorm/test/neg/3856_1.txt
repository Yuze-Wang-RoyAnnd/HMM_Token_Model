a friend of mine who has a mysterious knack for finding and - horrors! - liking bad movies recommended i watch 'the pest.' at the time unaware of just how truly pathetic his taste in movies was, i decided to give it a try.<br /><br />bad mistake.<br /><br />the story, although clearly ripped straight out of any sixth grade english textbook as far as the "manhunter" theme goes, would be amusing under the right conditions - good actors, writer, director, wardrobe, and so on and so on to almost no end. clearly these factors are absent.<br /><br />'the pest' is supposed to be funny, i think. i say "think" because i let crack nothing more than a slight smile throughout the whole film. not a guffaw, not a laugh, not a chuckle, not even a grin. a smile, at best. and that happened so rarely while watching this film i even remember how often i did smile - maybe 3 or 4 times at best.<br /><br />so do yourself an immense favor. never watch this movie. avoid at all costs.
