michael caine might have tried to make a larger than life character to a successful degree but the whole storyline and character's around him where not likable or interesting at all. it was all very boring and somewhat predictable. martin landau , a favorite actor of mine had a nothing role.he was useless. michael caine got a bit irritating after a while and the film couldn't decide if it was a comedy or a serious thriller. caine tries hard and good on him but i felt the direction and storyline let him down. don't waste your time. it starts off well for the first 10 minutes and then that's about it. a film for die hard caine fans only. stay away from this one...
