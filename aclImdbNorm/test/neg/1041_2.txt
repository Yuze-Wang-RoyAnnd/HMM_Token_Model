i mistakenly thought this was the 70's art film about the bed that eats people, which sounded interesting. it isn't. interesting, i mean, let alone about a man-eating bed.<br /><br />i assume stuart gordon put his name on this in the same spirit that lloyd kaufman puts "troma" on just about anything that's been shot with a video camera, in the interest of building up a franchise library. little more can be said about this opus other than the running time is less than 90 minutes. it is, of course, about a bed that is haunted by the spirit of a man, or something, that once killed a woman with a wig and long false eyelashes. along the way we get **a five minute opening credit sequence (is the one for "lawrence of arabia" even as long?) **a murderer with marylin manson contacts who kills using the same technique as the troll in "cat's eye" **demonstrations of a sexual practice michael hutchence may have employed **a preview of what emilio estevez will soon look and act like **soft core porn even cinemax would pass on **manbutt and one topless scene **a wacky (or is it "whack"-ee?) ending involving unintentionally hilarious hammer hits and leftover strawberry pie (well, it looked that way to me) **and a rudimentary surprise ending apros pos of nothing much. it's like the screenwriter even fell asleep on the "deathbed" before finishing the last draft.<br /><br />it's not scary, it's not sexy, it's shot on hi-def video and doesn't look bad but doesn't look good either, the acting is just good enough to not be bad enough to be fun and so is everything else. no one would probably have even seen or heard of it unless it was on a disc with another movie, the modern day "double feature." i wasn't paying attention for parts of it so i may have missed something. but for some reason i doubt it. rating: pass
