this is one of the worst movies i've seen in my life. if you're looking for a nice theatrical effect, skip it and watch something else.<br /><br />but if you're looking for camp-value, this is it. here's my advice: gather a few sarcastic friends and watch the movie strictly for the purpose of making fun of it.
