sorry, folks, but all of you that say this is a great documentary... and that award it won at sundance... well, you've all been duped. i've heard for a few years how i had to see this documentary and i finally watched it. maybe in 1999, when it came out, and reality tv didn't have such a dominant presence in the industry, this movie would have seemed entertaining. but mike and mark are so obviously playing themselves, mike and mark. at times they are funny and some of the lines seem off the cuff, but mostly they do not ring true. they are the reality version of jay and silent bob. yes the people are real, they are not actors, but it's put on, it's exaggeration of themselves, and it's so obvious that it's hard to believe so many people think it's the real deal. i wasn't fooled so it was actually a tad boring. mildly amusing, but not missing much if you miss it.
