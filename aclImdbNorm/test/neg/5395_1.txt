i got this in the horror six-pack from echo bridge home entertainment. this one is not the worst movie ever made, but it still sucks. in fact, this movie sucked so hard, i don't know how i'm gonna write this review, especially since 1. i popped it out of the dvd player because i couldn't even watch another second and 2. hurricane friggin' ike is coming and god knows how long 'til it take for me to get this review done. <br /><br />the movie starts off with a scientist and his wife. the scientist receives a valuable artifact and examines it when this supposedly urban legend known as the skeleton man kills him, and later on his wife. then... <br /><br />i'm sorry, but there's really not much else i can say about this pos except don't bother. i'm currently using the disc as a coaster, and if you see this, you might want to do the same. casper van dien and michael rooker must have needed cash...badly! <br /><br />ps. i'll pretty much be reviewing the movies in the boxset and might do a new review on ghoulies iv.
