i don't mind sequels; sometimes they're better than the original. however, many times the originals are best left alone....especially when you can't duplicate the cast. one of the big reasons "the magnificent seven" was such a hit was the very popular cast.<br /><br />this is hardly the "magnificent seven," when only yul brynner returns as one of the members of that famous group in "the magnificent seven." with six of the seven guys absent and replaced by much lesser-known actors, this loses its appeal in a hurry. in other words, except for brynner, these guys have no charisma! this is a like a championship sports team fielding all substitutes except one.<br /><br />brynner is good, once again: fun to watch, fun to hear with that distinctive deep voice of his, but the story, not just the rest of the crew, is lame. this movie should never have been made. in the original, we cared about the "seven;" in here, we couldn't care less.
