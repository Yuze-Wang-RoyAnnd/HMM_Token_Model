i, like many folks, believe the 1989 epic lonesome dove was one of the best westerns ever produced, maybe the best. and, realizing that most sequels (in this case a prequel) are certain to disappoint, my expectations were low. comanche moon met that expectation with its marginal directing and acting, poor casting and frankly, a lousy script. <br /><br />lonesome dove created western heroes of captains mccrae and call due to incredibly strong performances by robert duvall and tommy lee jones. prior to living in lonesome dove, we believed they bravely fought to rid texas of bandits and savage indians during their rangering years. <br /><br />if i had only seen comanche moon, i would think these two boneheads were a couple of incompetent, cowardly idiots. in lonesome dove, call and mccrae supposedly chased blue duck all over texas and never managed to capture or kill him. in comanche moon, a shot to call's boot heel convinced him to settle down and raise cattle. there wasn't a decent fistfight or gun fight in the entire miniseries. the best punch was mccrea sucker punching inez scull, a funny scene but out of character for mccrae.<br /><br />where was mccrae's wit and charm? clara's love for mccrae, a drunken, unshaven slob and philanderer was completely implausible. and maggie's love for call, a dispassionate and sullen loner, defies logic. <br /><br />the cinematography was excellent, superior to the original. credit goes not only to hd technology, but the cinematographer. the comanche moon miniseries was better than anything else on tv for three nights, but sadly that's not saying much.
