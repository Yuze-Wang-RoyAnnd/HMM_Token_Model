it seems to be a common thing in the 90's to play with cliches. some manage to do so with great talent. herv'e hadmar doesn't. on the paper, the movie looked interesting though: the weak plot could have been saved by great moments of comedy, dark humour, and a very "d'ecal'e" style. director hadmar, unfortunately, kills his direction with his camera angles and his absolute lack of rhythm. every joke is embarassing as no one reacts in the theater. the movie is incredibly slow, and the actors seem to be wondering what the hell they're doing in this ridiculous mascarade. what could have been a stylish funny mindless comedy ends up being a cathedral of boredom.
