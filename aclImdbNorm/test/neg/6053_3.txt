i hadn't heard anything about this project until i saw that it was going to be on, so i watched it with a completely open mind. and, gee, the cast is full of strong players.<br /><br />unfortunately . . . it's awful. i don't mean it isn't good; i mean it's extraordinarily bad -- sometimes laughably so, but mostly it's just boring. its strongest appeal comes from having attractive people as naked as us network tv will allow, but it's all tease and no substance, and having nymphs as backup characters can't justify several hours of bad tv.<br /><br />there are two basic problems that the cast can't overcome. first, the script is *awful*. yes, making changes to the hercules myth (which is certainly not a single monolithic story in the first place) is traditional, but this version is relentlessly dull and much too frequently dumb (and sometimes downright head-shakingly peculiar), with terrible pacing, bits borrowed from here and there (and several parts seemingly belonging in different films), and truly awful dialogue. the dialogue is frequently unbearably bad, in fact, to the point where you feel embarrassed for the actors. sean astin, apparently now typecast as second-banana, seems especially burdened by one awful line after another. there's no consistency of tone or atmosphere and little cohesion to the plot.<br /><br />second, most of the special effects are really bad. really bad. there's occasionally a decent bit of cgi, but mostly, again, you feel really embarrassed on behalf of the cast. i have no idea what the budget for this project was, but it sure looks like crap compared to "clash of the titans" or even "hercules: the legendary journeys" and doesn't even compare very favorably with the old lou ferrigno and italian 'spaghetti' hercules movies. just painfully miserable.<br /><br />there are plenty of other problems -- the story is needlessly complex and can't keep up with itself, and hercules himself isn't presented as a very interesting character. almost everyone who doesn't have a european accent tries to fake one of some kind, which is not merely amateurish and dated but never really made sense in the first place: drama doesn't become better just because the actors use british accents, after all. but the terrible script and equally terrible effects sink the whole thing right off the bat.<br /><br />in fairness, "hercules" was apparently intended as a four-hour miniseries but truncated (for this airing, anyway) to a three-hour tv movie. i don't know what they cut, but it's possible the edits made things worse. i don't think you could make "hercules" good by adding to it, but that doesn't mean that the continuity, say, hasn't suffered from the network edits. there's no way i'll watch the usa version to see, though.
