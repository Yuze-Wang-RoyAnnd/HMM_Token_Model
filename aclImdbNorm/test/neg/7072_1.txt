ok, fans, it's out on dvd. but the only reason to watch this is 1) to say you did (due to its notoriety), or 2) if you're a hardcore bill paxton fan. i am not a hardcore bp fan but he was fun to watch and it was the only thing that kept me from turning this off from sheer boredom. it's a shame, because this could have been a good movie with some script work and if made by someone with some intelligence (and with a cast led by someone besides the totally miscast and talentless judd nelson). sure it's gross, but it's bad, and not in a good way. if after reading all the comments on how bizarrely revolting and dystopianly filthy this movie is you are still interested, do yourself a favor and see some good bizarre revolting dystopian filth instead. films by john waters, david lynch, peter jackson's "braindead", henenlotter's "basket case", etc., all come to mind. there's lots better out there.
