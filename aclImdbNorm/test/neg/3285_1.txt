this is easily the worst, most offensive piece of crap on tv. i'd love to completely ignore it but fox has stuck it into their sunday lineup, forcing me to find something else to watch between american dad and family guy. the dink-head male star guy is just about the least evolved, pathetic excuse for a human i have ever seen on tv. nothing on the show is remotely funny and pretty much everything on it has been done already and much better by other shows.<br /><br />it's obvious that their strategy is to ram it deep and hard into the sunday schedule and hope someone starts liking it... but i have to break it to ya, fox, thats the wrong hole. the scam not worked on me - i simply look elsewhere - but come on, you freaking boneheads, this show freaking sucks, and it sucks even worse when compared to the rest of the fox sunday lineup.<br /><br />they cancelled arrested development for this steaming pile?
