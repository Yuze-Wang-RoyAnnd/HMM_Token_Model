this is the worst exercise in middle class pretentiousness yet to hit our television screens. i unfortunately did not see it when it was first shown but paid for the joy of watching six hours of excruciating drivel - and i'm still waiting for the laughs to arrive. i love tasmin greig having been a big fan of both black books and green wing and therefore know that she is capable of the very best of comedy parts. however, she played this part as well as she was able considering the lack of any decent comedy material provided. please broadcasters bear in mind that the trades descriptions act may well be invoked if you continue to bill as comedy material which is at best pseudo psychological romanticism and at worst a drama which poses as a quirky comedy to hide the fact that is neither fish nor fowl.
