how can any of you call this propaganda a family film. this is nothing but a pc, insensitive insult to small-town churchgoers. the film portrays a woman as the great white savior of some small midwestern town, and everyone else in the town (mostly men) are just mere damsels in distress, incapable of honor, who can't fend for themselves and have to rely on the main character for redemption. this film is just some love affair that the producer has with some undisciplined, arrogant, pushy little squirt, who he expects the audience to admire.<br /><br />the person who made this movie probably spent his whole life in a seeker-sensitive church, and had the freedom to dump garbage on small church members as wacky lunatics and not the majority. the same people who give money to the salvation army at christmastime, collecting donations to help missionaries, the poor and the homeless, singing, fellow-shipping, and making friends with each other. what is wrong with this humble group that offends these self-righteous traitors? most christians in this world would step in front of a train and give their lives for any person in trouble, even if they disagree with them. most christians wouldn't mind if the pastor, or some church worker, of some church took of his or her coat (or outer shirt). they would not condemn her. this film is ridiculous!
