this film holds 7.0 rating on imdb, so even i sensed something rotten in it's synopsis i decided to try it out. what a waste of 100 minutes. first of all, the 80's were not a good decade for crime and thriller genre. most of these, in those days were badly done with silly plot (if they had any), so there are very few that can stand out, and even if they were good they are still not very good. the hit, however suffers from everything that made silly crime pictures silly. it has poor character development, improbable plot and wasn't written or directed in a decent manner, and when you have such shortcomings the acting doesn't help. stephen frears often tried to emulate french new wave in english style film making and the two don't match.<br /><br />first of all terence stamp is 10 years in hiding because he testified against some of his former partners in crime. he hides in spain, of all places. he is finally caught up with, and than first kidnapped by a group of silly looking spanish thugs, just do be driven away some distance to the two hit man that are supposed to deal with him. these two are john hurt, who is supposed to be hard boiled, stone cold killer, and tim roth (in his first role) as the devil's apprentice. they don't kill stamp right away, they first dispose of the "three amigos", they shouldn't have hired in the first place, and then, they are driving stamp to paris, because one of the buddies he testified against wants to confront him. ok that's possible. but even with stamp being such a dangerous figure that they had to hire four guys to overpower him, they don't tie him down, don't incapacitate him in any way, and drive around with him, like he's one of the buddies. stamp doesn't object and is happily going to paris to be shot, not using any of a half a dozen chances, these "professionals" offer for him to escape. than it appears that tim roth is just a school boy bully, making the idea of big crime boss teaming him up with a hard core hit man like john hurt, even more improbable, especially on an important job like that. but than john hurt is not so hard core himself, he spends twenty minutes of the movie, killing or not killing the totally surplus australian, played by bill hunter, whose only purpose in this film is to introduce the lovely laura del sol, his mistress (who he says is 15, but she looks more like 25), and whose role in the story and acting capabilities suggest that she was offered the role, solely on the basis of being the director's or producer's mistress at the time. after much deliberation, hurt kills the australian but takes along his mistress for no apparent reason. than he wants to kill her but roth with his "subtle ways" convince him not to, so even she kicks him, bites him and scratches him through the entire movie, he stays true to that deeply buried human side of him.<br /><br />than you have plain idiotic scenes, like when hurt and roth lock the car from the outside, trying to prevent the people inside from getting out?!?! anyway the movie drags on. tim roth falls asleep, guarding terence stamp with his gun on his chest, and stamp just waits there watching the waterfall. than the whole shamble of a plot comes to the point where everything we've seen in the last hour and 20 minutes just goes out through the window. let's recapitulate, the whole point in not killing stamp right away (except for having a movie) is to take him to paris, so his former partner is to have a last word with him. and the whole point in him not running away is that he is prepared to die, saying "it's just a moment. we're here. then we're not here. we're somewhere else... maybe. and it's as natural as breathing. why should we be scared?" but my friends, here is where the plot twists, hurt kills the man while still in spain, and we ask why bother and drive around for days, he could have done it in the first 15 minutes, and than contrary to his philosophy stamp is very afraid of being killed, so we ask again why didn't he run, and he had plenty chance. roth gets killed too, but he shouldn't be in the movie at all, and del sol, well she's promised a role in this film purely for romantic (read sexual) reasons, so she stays alive again, even she attacked hurt for the 15th time in the movie. he killed all the others, but not her, she must have maximum screen appearance. the movie was made on a shoe string budget and it shows, but when you have no story and card board characterizations, it shows even more.and yes fernando ray appears and goes through the movie as the guest star, having a single audible line of dialog. awful
