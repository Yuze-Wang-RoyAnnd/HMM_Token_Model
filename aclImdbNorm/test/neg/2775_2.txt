this is a cheap-o movie made by al adamson--a man who was perhaps the worst film maker ever--even possibly worse than ed wood, jr.. adamson specialized in extremely low budget horror and skin films during the 60s, 70s and 80s and with such titles as five bloody graves, hell's bloody devils, satan's sadists and lash of lust it's obvious he wasn't making shakespeare!! his movies all had rotten production values, sensations, gore and amateur acting.<br /><br />here in brain of blood, several stock adamson actors (such as his wife, regina carrol, zandor vorkov and angelo rossitto are along for the ride and had appeared in adamson's previous film, dracula versus frankenstein. this is fortunate because the prior movie was so terrible and so poorly executed on every level that brain of blood can't help but look good! sure, the makeup is laughable, the plot dumb (it involves the ubiquitous brain transplant scheme) and acting is level z, but it's still better than their last film! <br /><br />about the only positive things about this film are that aging supporting actor, midget angelo rossitto actually had a better than usual part--with more dialog and a more important role in the plot--and there is actually some sense of danger and tension at times. as for ms. carrol, she still looks like a stripper and the rest of the cast limp through this silly flick. however, it's bad enough that it makes for good watching by bad movie fans--you've just gotta see makeup on the guy with acid burns as well as the ray gun that appears to be made out of an old tail light!
