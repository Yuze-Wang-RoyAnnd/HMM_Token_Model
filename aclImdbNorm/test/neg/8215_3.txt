**may contain spoilers**<br /><br />the main character, a nobleman named fallon, is stranded on an island with characters so looney and lethal he might have been better off drowning. count lorente de sade (pronounced "dee-sayd") talks to his own hallucinations and sees all intruders on the island as invading pirates. he routinely beats mute servant anne and tortures his unwilling guests in the dungeon. inadvertant laughs are provided by giant "nubian" slave mantis who talks with a deep south accent and helps de sade hunt down trespassers in the style of the most dangerous game. de sade's crazed wife, ravaged by leprosy, provides some truly scary moments as she prowls the dungeon and embraces a helplessly chained prisoner. (this scene was viewed on late-night tv by many kids who carried the memory into adulthood.) the one nearly-normal person in sight is cassandra, who has self-deprecation down to a science. ("i used to be a nurse, now i'm not much of anything.") she and fallon plan their escape and ultimately encounter an enemy more fearsome than de sade and mantis combined.<br /><br />	this movie was shot in san antonio and directed by a man more competent at drawing horror comics than making horror movies. (i'll say this much for mr. boyette--he does showcase his fixatation with contagion here, as he did in his comics.) it's rather like an andy milligan melodrama minus the meat cleavers. the period wardrobe, library music, abuse of the handicapped and all-around misanthropy makes one wonder if andy wasn't called in as a consultant. however, milligan made better costumes and wrote better dialogue. technical gaffes are too numerous to list here but you know this flick is in trouble when you see the opening shipwreck, which looks like it was shot in a fish tank. also, a film made in texas should have had real spiders and snakes rather than rubber ones. glorious eastmancolor gives this melodrama the garish look it so richly deserves. fallon's initial encounter with the leprous countess is truly horrifying, as is the movie's parting shot. if the rest had been half as harrowing, the dungeon of harrow would have been a terror classic. instead it's a funny piece of schlock that trash-fiends will love, for all the wrong reasons.
