it is definitely not worth spending either money or time. it is the same hackneyed plot of a guy and a girl meeting and falling in love. but this is with a western touch. but it fails miserably in either depicting a love story or giving it the western touch. never do we feel that the hero and heroin are in love. there is no depth to either of their characters. probably, with a better cast, some justice could have been brought about to the characters. finally, it is a movie with no fun, no acting, no theme, no plot, no comedy , no action, no thrill, no romance (i associate romance to something more passionate). definitely not a movie you would want to go with your family. overall, if you are looking for a movie with some content, this is definitely not an option. i shall wait for the day when bollywood movies are something that i can wait to watch and i can refer to my friends as a "must watch" movie.
