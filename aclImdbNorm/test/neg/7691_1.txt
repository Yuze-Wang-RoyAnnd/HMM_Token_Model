this piece of crap doesn't worth a critical review so i'll write some information for those who don't know the background of this movie. first off all it is not the first saudi movie, they used this wrong info for commercial purpose (they lied!). second they made it for money not for anything else so they picked the jerk (hesham) who won star academy (like big brother) it is a popular show and the jerk hesham is popular but dumb, cheesy & untalented then picked the famous kuwaiti actor mohammed al sairafi (also dumb & untalented) but has a popular (count how many times i'll use the word "popular" then email me to get your prize, however..) has popular show and the jordanian actress mais hamdan who appeared in popular comic show cbm (unfunny) so she is famous * popular! then they picked some saudi actors for .. blah blah blah. the funniest thing is the director! he is canadian with palestinian roots (i believe that the identity of the movie is the identity of its director) .. wait a minute! the screen play was written by an egyptian screenwriter (very awful one!) with some help from lebanese critic (famous as critic but actually he is a money collector!). this group of the multi races (money slaves) doesn't know anything about the saudi culture they don't represent it but when we know who is behind this garbage all our questions will be relieved! waleed bin talaal is saudi prince and (b u s i n e s s m a n) who doesn't care about the saudi culture or saudi people he even doesn't live in saudi arabia (even if he lives he will live in his own world, his world is far far far away from the real world the people world) so he doesn't know anything or care about anything except raising his endless fortune.<br /><br />*not saudi movie(not anything movie).<br /><br />screw them all.<br /><br />beep out of 10!
