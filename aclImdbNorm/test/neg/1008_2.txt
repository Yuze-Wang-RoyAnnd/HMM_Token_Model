this movie could very well have been a propaganda movie for the north americian falangist party - or some similar group... the strong man (kersey) places himself above the law (but not outside the law) and liberates upstanding citizens by killing worthless trash. the only thing that made me think it wasn't made by the kkk was the fact that a jew starred as a good guy... try watching it again while thinking of it as a propaganda movie for an extreme right wing group - and you'll see what i mean...<br /><br />it's a tragedy that jimmy page actually made music for this movie... :(
