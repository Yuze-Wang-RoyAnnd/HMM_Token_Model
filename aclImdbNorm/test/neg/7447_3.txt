for most people, robocop 3 is the film that really is the big disgrace for the robo series. it has few fans, and most people hate it for it's shameless commercial pg-13 approach. now, i'm not going to say that robocop 3 is any good. frankly, it pretty much sucks. but as far as being a properly shot and executed film, it surpasses this piece of circuit chaos. yes, the truth of the matter is that robocop 2 is the worst of two bad and unnecessary sequels to a near-masterpiece. so what if robocop 3 turns robo into a cartoonish super hero in a ultra mainstream production for kids to enjoy - at least it's doing it openly. i don't know where robocop 2 begins and ends, i don't know what or whom it's about, i don't understand what's going on in it, i don't understand which jokes are deliberate and which aren't, i will go insane if i try to understand the characters, i see nothing of any value in anything anybody is saying, i can't believe anybody looked at the shooting script and figured it would work and i can't believe that irvin kirshner saw the finished result and figured that he liked what he see. he probably didn't by the way, neither miller, nor weller nor allen did. it's not hard to see why.<br /><br />now, robocop 2 has it's fans, i know this. mostly they belong to this league of absolute anti-pretensions, dismissing anybody who expected any depth, or subject matter from the first film, as academic roger ebert sith apprentices. it's just a lot of fun, a good piece of action and great entertainment, the argument goes. yeah well, i guess if you just don't listen to what any of the characters are saying you could fool yourself that we might as well have arnold in the suit instead of weller. don't get me wrong, i like a good action film, with pure entertainment value as it's only - most satisfying - virtue. but robocop 2, sir, ain't no such thing.<br /><br />look at the first couple of scenes. this horrible actor makes robo repeat that he's just a machine, and then goes into this operatic speech about how he could never be a man, where-after murphy's wife (who's suing ocp for robot-stalkings) walks in out of the blue and have this sad little moment with him, and then is never heard of again! i surely would like to go in to this film scene by scene, because every one has these kind of absurdities in them. it's like a twelve year old fan boy has done the screenplay, the characters act totally random and first say this, then say that. ocp wants to stop crime with a new robo, especially this drug called "nuke" but then it seems they really just want to become this big capitalist empire and control the entire city
