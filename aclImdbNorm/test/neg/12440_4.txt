if you liked william hickey in "prizzi's honor", he resurrects his character, as don anthony in "mob boss". this is a very weak "godfather" satire with few laughs. stuart whitman looks perplexed as to what he's doing in this schlock-fest? morgan fairchild's performance is one of the better efforts in the movie, and that alone is not a good sign for sure. eddie deezen vacillates between "three stooges" slapstick and a bad woody allen imitation. fatally flawed, "mob boss" is so derivative that boredom quickly overcomes comedy and the film drags on with car chases, hidden weapons in a restaurant bathroom, and numerous other nonsense. - merk
