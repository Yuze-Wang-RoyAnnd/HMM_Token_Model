its incredible to me that the best rendition of this amazing story remains a cartoon made by walt disney in the 1940s, but its true. here another clumsy attempt sputters confuses and alienates would be viewers with admirable effectiveness while successfully antagonizing those of us who have actually read the story. irving's original work is short by any measure and making a feature length film is bound to be a challenge. one can either completely rewrite the story a la tim burton which is a discussion for another time, or pad the bust-line of the old girl with unintended detail. the latter is what is attempted here, and if i may say, pitifully so. unimaginative and thoroughly modern new facets to character personalities such as religious zealotry in crane or wanderlust in good old bram bones ruin the story's intent and betray a severe lack of talent by the filmmakers. by the time the tale's famous climax approached, i had completely lost interest. its the kind of film where you expect to see a stagehand smoking in the background.
