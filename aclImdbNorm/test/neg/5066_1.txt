i admire the effort of trying to reach out to the rest of the world with this tragic story. however, the movie is done so badly that most people i know couldn't sit through it. the movie was relevant to me since i lived in estonia when these events took place, but it is written horribly and fails to capture the attention of someone who knows nothing on the matter. the music choices do not flow well with the movie, it seems as if someone just turned a cd player on in the background to put the actors "in the mood". the acting... well, what acting? the only people acting are j"urgen prochnow and donald sutherland, even though prochnow seems uncomfortable in this role. as far as the relationship development goes between erik westermark (j"urgen prochnow) and julia reuter (greta scacchi), it is like watching a train wreck. there is absolutely no chemistry and it is painful to witness their "sincere moments." this is not a good movie. there is a difference between trying to get a message out (could've been a documentary!) and trying to make a good movie. this is a failure and anyone here who says otherwise makes me wonder if they are trying to promote it. as a matter of fact, as a native of estonia i am offended by this miserable effort. this tragedy deserves more than just a homemade low-budget ghost chase excuse of a movie. this could have been much more!
