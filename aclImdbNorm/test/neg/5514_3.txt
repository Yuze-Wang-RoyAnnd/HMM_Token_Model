as several posters have "hinted," this is a sorry "star wars" ripoff. now if you're going to rip off "star wars," at least do it right; "battlestar galactica" did, and there were a few other space operas that didn't do a bad job of it, but this is definitely not one of them. david mendenhall, the juvenile lead, actually isn't too bad, though he goes overboard on the "cute" factor every so often. vince edwards hasn't improved much as an actor since his "ben casey" days; if anything, he's even more wooden than he was ten. the other performances are nothing to write home about, either. even worse are the special effects; the best you can say about them is that they're lousy. it's glaringly obvious that the "aliens" are simply actors wearing rubber masks with a little foam or latex slopped on them, and the "battle" scenes between edwards' raiders and the aliens are poorly staged and badly shot. a very weak effort from roger corman. skip it.
