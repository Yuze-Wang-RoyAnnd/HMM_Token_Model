sam o'steen, the film editor on the superlative suspense flick "rosemary's baby" from 1968, here directs a quickie tv-made sequel, one in which rosemary woodhouse (patty duke astin, in for mia farrow) is shunted off early--and inexplicably--presumably to help flesh out the more ghoulish aspects of this flaccid story about satan's son on earth. most interesting is the return of ruth gordon to her oscar-winning role as minnie castevet (with ray milland well-cast as her husband, roman), but she isn't given much to do--and looks terribly uncomfortable at being involved anyway. this script is strictly low-rent goods, and must have shamed original author ira levin (who went on to write his own sequel). fairly dim and pallid, with poor photography and no suspense or scares whatsoever.
