one of the movies i just didn't want to see. i got it in the sneak-preview, but damn, the acting was very bad! at the end of the movie (i still am surprised i watched the whole movie..) i wondered why i watched the movie.<br /><br />also here in the netherlands, the writer of this movie (it's filmed from a book of giphart) thought it was very bad, and was disappointed that his movie came out like this. next time he wants a role in choosing people for the cast.
