i think the movie was one sided i watched it recently and find the documentary typical of western movie makers that was biased without substance. the fact is prostitution do exist everywhere in the world not in tanzania alone and not because of this fish business, there prostitutes were there way before the russian and other business people arrived in mwanza. poverty is indeed endemic in africa let alone tanzania and this is not because of fish fillet business, in fact the fish industry has helped millions to support their families on their daily life. this movie just tarnish the good image of this peace loving country. as for the arms trade the film could not substantiate if there is any truth in that indeed looking critically at the films one is doubting the authenticity of the film maker, it seems that their trying to prove their point by using a few characters which can be done for anything really. yes tanzania is a poor country yes there are prostitutes and street children but they are not the product this business, it is just a common scenario in most poor countries indeed the world over even in the western world...what a load of rubbish.<br /><br />the pilot themselves are talking of sending weapons to angola which is more than 2000km south of tanzania and the war was in drc also miles away from mwanza, the director could not give evidence how these weapons were transported from mwanza to drc!<br /><br />in short the films lacks focus and respectability, it is quite easy to find the character anywhere in africa and has nothing to do darwin's nightmare or fish fillet...what a load of rubbish!<br /><br />the truth is the nile perch has not decimated all other species in the lake contrary to what the movie portrays and also less than 25% of all catches from lake victoria are exported the rest is consumed locally so lets get that one right.
