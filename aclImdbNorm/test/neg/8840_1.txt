with great expectations i went to see this film, spain's contribution to the oscar-race this year. part from being completely pointless, banal, pathetic, badly written, edited, acted and directed, the movie is too long. it fails in delivering the "message" it tries to give, fails in its storytelling, clumsy historical settings and above all in its rhythm. there are some so extreme misfires i haven't seen in a movie in a long time (the story of lucas whose dead sister lives in his head, the divine revelations, all that lizard nonsense). the spanish-speaking audience around me was yawning and rapidly losing patience, and some of the commentaries i overheard was whether the members of the spanish academy had taken drugs before choosing the film for the oscar contest.
