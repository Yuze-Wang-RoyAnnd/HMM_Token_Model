following up the 1970s classic horror film carrie with this offering, is like ford following the mustang with the edsel. this film was horrendous in every detail. it would have been titled beverly hill 90210 meets mystery science theater 3000, but both of those shows far exceed this tripe. this film was scarcely a horror film. i timed about 3 minutes of gore and 90 minutes of lame high school hazing and ritual. wow, what a surprise, carrie's weird friend commits suicide! wow, carrie misconstrues her love interests affections! wow, the in-crowd sets up carrie! wow, the jocks have a sexual scoring contest! what this film needed was way more action and far less tired teen cliches. this film is totally unviewable.
