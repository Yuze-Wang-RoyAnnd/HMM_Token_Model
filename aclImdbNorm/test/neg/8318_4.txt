i am very disappointed because i expected a real ride as promised in the many reviews. the script is very bad with lot of holes and the direction too. the director failed completely to develop each violent scene with thrills and suspense. it tries very hard to follow a wannabe thriller. therefore i had to watch how every bullet was spent without giving any sense to me. i was always asking what kind of movie i am watching. then i didn't like that she smoked aggressively one cigarette after the other but perhaps the film was supported partly by the tobacco industry. the end is also very disappointing. i cannot understand how jodie foster could have been nominated for the golden globe in this worst role of her life. jodie, therefore i liked very much panic room or flight plan. this is definitely one of the worst i have ever seen. 4/10.
