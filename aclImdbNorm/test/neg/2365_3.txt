"tnt jackson" isn't completely unwatchable. but either the version i saw on dvd was edited with a weed-whacker, or the screenplay itself is the lowest level of grind-house/blaxploitation sausage. or maybe both.<br /><br />jeanne bell is supposed to have been a playmate at one point in her career,and the movie makes the most of the connection by displaying her breasts at least two times more than was really necessary (including a hilarious topless fight scene that i am pretty sure was meant to be funny). i will admit, they are quite nice. still, she's sort of average looking and doesn't have the charisma of a foxy brown, of even a cleopatra jones. she does have her moments as an actress in the film, though, but it would have been nice if the director had pushed her a little harder or the screenplay had given her a chance to do more than emote "attitude" and kick people.<br /><br />speaking of kicking people, the fight scenes (the other putative reason to watch a film like this) are pretty poorly done.there's no real choreography to speak of here, just people posing and sticking feet and fists in the general direction of their opponents. one minor exception is a nice moment with an opponent equipped with butterfly folding knives; another is a sequence near the very end where an obvious stunt double for bell (and maybe for stan shaw) leap around and do some decent sweeps and groundwork for a minute or two before bell/"jackson" punches her enemy's liver out, shaw collapses and the screenplay just stops. (again, i will admit that this is very much in the tradition of shaw brother quickies since time immemorial).<br /><br />there are a couple of supporting actors who are actually better than the film deserves (i'm thinking of "joe" and the fellow playing the drug lord's right hand man). there's a halfway decent funk laden soundtrack that complements the action on the screen and add a star to the rating by itself. there's a semi-dodgy sex scene that manages to be effective almost in spite of itself.<br /><br />this one is strictly for hardcore fans of blaxploitation. i saw it out of sheer curiosity, and i'm not sorry i took the time. but i can't imagine wanting to take the time to see it again unless i decide to write a dissertation on the pop culture intersections of "kung fu theater" and "foxy brown".
