i went to see this film because it was recommended to my wife and she wanted to go.<br /><br />we were both trying to look at our watches well before the film ended, in order to see how much more we had to endure. two hours and six minutes long, it is. it's divided roughly equally between battle scenes (about a dozen of them, all more or less interchangeable), and plot development.<br /><br />one would have thought that with the subject being the son of a minor tribal chief who conquers half the world, plotting would have been relatively easy. there's a fair bit of raw material there from which to make a pretty good story. however the writers fluffed it completely. we get no real history. we get instead a hollywood version of history.<br /><br />what sustains young temudjin through his long -- almost endless, actually, or so they seem to the viewer -- tribulations? why, the love of a good woman, of course.<br /><br />how does he get out of prison? well, an old monk, who recognizes his innate goodness and greatness, sets out across the continent to take to this good woman a talisman that symbolises temudjin's love for her, dropping dead just close enough to her for her to find him as he lies there, talisman in his hand. and of course she then goes and, having (inexplicably) become rich and powerful, rescues him.<br /><br />how does he escape from the shackles? well, he goes off to the shrine of the great wolf-god tengri (or some such name) and tengri sets him free by magic. yeah, right.<br /><br />why does he want to become ruler of the mongols? the wolf-god again, apparently. off goes temudjin to ask for guidance, and -- surprise! surprise! -- he gets it. "laws," he says to himself. "what the mongols need are laws. good, simple ones." golly, it was impressive.<br /><br />and then finally, how does he win the decisive battle against his rival's more powerful forces? better tactics, certainly, but also through the aid of the good old wolf-god again, who sends a storm at the height of the battle. all the troops cower as the thunder rolls and the lightning flashes (mongols are scared of thunder, you see) -- but not our temudjin. the troops, completely wowed by his bravery, acclaim him king! <br /><br />i don't know what induces people to keep producing this kind of garbage. the funny thing is it's interspersed with all sorts of gritty realism: lots of slurping of milk, dirt and violence. it's as if the producers of this movie wanted to get the trivial things right so that viewers wouldn't notice how infantile some of the big stuff is.<br /><br />there's heaps of violence in graphic close-up: slashings, impalings, spouts of blood, sprays of blood, clouds of blood -- the blood guys had a great time, actually. despite the realism, it's impossible to take seriously.<br /><br />i must mention the ludicrous cgi final battle scene. how anyone can think these things look realistic is beyond me. they don't. oh, and it's all shot in the standard hollywood style -- breathtaking panoramas for the spectacular scenery, and the super-close-up stedicam stuff for the battle scenes. and the standard dolby super-sound-effects of whumps and thumps and the constant low-frequency hum to sustain tension.<br /><br />tedious.<br /><br />avoid.
