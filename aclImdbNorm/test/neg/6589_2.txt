first, i'm sorry for my english. second, the true story of this episode: 39 soldiers, operation "magistral'". 6 soldiers were killed. hundreds of insurgents were killed too. within 10 years the soviet army has lost less than 15 thousand person and killed over 900000 insurgents and civilians. there is no insurgents without permanent help of usa the veteran of war: "traditions. there are no traditions in this film. there is no military oath, there is no first jump, no farewell to the fighting banner. there is no delivery of awards and medals. there is nothing sacred. there is only a hatred to soviet army. being in this area on investigation, we have revealed start-up jet shells by insurgents . an exact place could not define. so gunners have asked to give easier square. also have covered it. through pair minutes. here it was the reality of fights. so there was no feeling "oblivion". these feelings have appeared then. already on other war and in other state (chechnya). others were children. more kindly. more humanly. and "prapors" were as fathers. well and culmination fight - full orgy. shooting in anywhere. mental attacks young ben-ladens, not killed both not broken through. and full absence of mutual aid. that there was a main thing on this war. even americans accused us of inadequate application of force against insurgents. and here it is direct on the contrary. in the summer 1981 i about myself have firmly solved, that personally should fill up a minimum 50 insurgents. as a result accepted "plan" has been under-fulfilled, and on a demobilization i departed strongly contused and malicious as fig. after returning the first months there was a feeling of that i not was at war up to the end, not business there have completed all how follow. there was any vague, but an oppressive sensation of discontent with itself and caustic irritation. such here night ideas, can be and out of place at all. officers really in film are not present absolutely. in occasion of that, what is the time they spent with staff. on fighting-is constant. new year on fighting. from where did they take beds? in mountains? and so on..."<br /><br />if you want a fairy tale about war, "9 rota" and "shtrafbat" is for you. if you want truth, you must see "come and see" or "batallions ask for fire".
