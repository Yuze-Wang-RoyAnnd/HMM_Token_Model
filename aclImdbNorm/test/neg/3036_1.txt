sorry this movie was a bad made for tv movie. are the rest of you on drugs when you watched it? i thought the hair,make-up and characters were poor 2 dimensional types. the story is doubtful,especially since all of the main characters are dead,or nearly dead. i think it's not well acted either...what was up with that hair on the main guy in the turtles? it looked glued on badly, and the sideburns looked like they were going to fall off at any moment. it didn't feel like anything new was revealed in the story of the band and how the members met other bands,and people. i laughed all the way through it,frank zappa looked stupid,so did mama cass, and so did the beatles. they were made out to look stupid and ridiculous. also the other band people like jim morrison,donovan also took a big hit at looking stupid too. kind of terrible,if this is how you remember these people. it's a poor history lesson on music,it's fictional the way it was made.
