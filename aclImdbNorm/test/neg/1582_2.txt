it is beyond me why two million danish people each week sit down to watch this terrible show. the dialogue is terrible and not realistic. the characters are hollow and simplistic. there's a tough man, a tough woman and a sensitive man. the writers actually say that they have modeled the characters after greek mythology! give me a break! all the characters are of course brilliant policemen. when i have watched this show i have longed for "district hill street" and "nypd blue". these are brilliant shows, and "rejseholdet" is a lousy copy. this program is a symptom of the disease danish television is currently suffering from.
