i attended a screening of this movie. it was wrought with clich'es and very unfunny jokes and set ups. i think the other comments were by people who must've worked on the movie or been family members of the cast. i'm amazed this movie cost $3-$4 million without any real stars. where did the budget go? it obviously didn't go to writers for re-writes. nice thought to bank on the success of big fat greek wedding, but a major miss. there was little or any spark between the main characters and the inciting incident was a bit flimsy at best. the direction was uninspired and looked like a student film.<br /><br />i don't even know what it means everybody wants to italian. is that a real saying. i've never heard it.
