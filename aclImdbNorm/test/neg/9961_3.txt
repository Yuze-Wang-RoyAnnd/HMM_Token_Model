a scientist (george zucco) wants to create wolf men out of american soldiers to fight the nazis, but is branded as mad. he uses a simpleton gardener (glenn strange) to experiment on by mixing his blood with the blood of a wolf. strange, constantly embedding his dialogue with the tones of lon chaney jr. in "of mice and men", has no idea what's going on, only that he sleepwalks. the victims begin to pile up (including a little girl, which modern viewers might find rather disturbing, and two of zucco's rivals). there is some good dialogue on how man should not mess with nature (still prevalent today) and play god. zucco's motives may be honorable, but his methods are most questionable. and then there is his daughter, anne nagel, who is sympathetically nice to strange, yet has no idea of her father's deeds. johnny downs is a reporter who gets on zucco's bad side by questioning him, but wins nagel's heart, thus creating the usual and always dull romantic subplot in classic horror films. at 77 minutes, this is about 15 minutes longer than usual for a horror film of the early 40's (particularly one out of prc, who released this one), so the romantic story could have been trimmed for costs and to speed things up a bit. zucco, fortunately, is never hammy; he left that to bela lugosi (who always hammed in a deliciously theatrical manner which endeared him to audiences) and england's todd slaughter. but try not to think of "bride of the monster's" laboratory while looking at the one zucco works in, or some of lugosi's dialogue in that now classic cult film. "mad monster" lacks a cult following more because it is not delightfully bad, just has dull pacing in more than a few spots. for prc and monogram lovers, i would recommend "the corpse vanishes" or "fog island" higher than this
