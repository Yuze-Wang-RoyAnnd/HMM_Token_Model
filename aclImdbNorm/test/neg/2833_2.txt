this was not a good film. poorly scripted and acted - the concept was not new, the effects poor and not a showcase for arnold vosloo who really is a half decent actor. i watched this under some protest and only remembered having seen it before towards the very end - it's that forgettable. the acting seemed to consist of a number of glares & looks devoid of any sincerity. i kept expecting this to actually get going and before long i was just hoping it would finish. as for the medical bits - well i wasn't expecting a true version of er events but this was just comical - i am a dr so know what i am taking about - and the operative bits were just plain silly.<br /><br />do not waste your valuable time - unless you have absolutely nothing else to do - go out, ring up a long lost friend, watch paint dry, sort out your sock draw, do some household task. avoid at your peril.
