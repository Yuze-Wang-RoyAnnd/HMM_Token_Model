contains spoilers. <br /><br />the british director j. lee thompson made some excellent films, notably 'ice cold in alex' and 'cape fear', but 'country dance' is one of his more curious offerings. the story is set among the upper classes of rural scotland, and details the strange triangular relationship between sir charles ferguson, an eccentric aristocratic landowner, his sister hilary, and hilary's estranged husband douglas, who is hoping for a reconciliation with her. we learn that during his career as an army officer, charles was regarded as having 'low moral fibre'. this appears to have been an accurate diagnosis of his condition; throughout the film he displays an attitude of gloomy disillusionment with the world, and his main sources of emotional support seem to be hilary and his whisky bottle. the film ends with his committal to an upper-class lunatic asylum. <br /><br />peter o'toole was, when he was at his best as in 'lawrence of arabia', one of britain's leading actors, but the quality of his work was very uneven, and 'country dance' is not one of his better films. he overacts frantically, making charles into a caricature of the useless inbred aristocrat, as though he were auditioning for a part in the monty python 'upper-class twit of the year' sketch. susannah york as hilary and michael craig as douglas are rather better, but there is no really outstanding acting performance in the film. there is also little in the way of coherent plot, beyond the tale of charles's inexorable downward slide.<br /><br />the main problem with the film, however, is neither the acting nor the plot, but rather that of the theme that dare not speak its name. there are half-hearted hints of an incestuous relationship between charles and hilary, or at least of an incestuous attraction towards her on his part, and that his dislike of douglas is motivated by sexual jealousy. unfortunately, even in the swinging sixties and early seventies (the date of the film is variously given as either 1969 or 1970) there was a limit to what the british board of film censors was willing to allow, and a film with an explicitly incestuous theme was definitely off-limits. (the american title for the film was 'brotherly love', but this was not used in britain; was it too suggestive for the liking of the bbfc?) these hints are therefore never developed and we never get to see what motivates charles or what has caused his moral collapse, resulting in a hollow film with a hole at its centre. 4/10
