it's as if the stay-puffed marshmallow man from ghostbusters had been reincarnated in rutger hauer's body and is taking revenge upon a rival's pregnant wife! if seeing an obese hauer chase a very pregnant isabel glaser (imagine the spine-tingling thrills in that contest) sounds good to you, see this film! seriously, if hauer is what an iraqi pow looks like after six years in prison, then hungry people everywhere should make a bee line to a jail in baghdad. overall "tactical assault" rates 2 stars instead of 1 because mike mitchell as hawk is terrific. mitchell burns up the screen as a nato pilot until his plane is burned up itself (by an enemy missle), whereupon the film loses what little verve it had to begin with.
