this movie appears to have made for the sole purpose of annoying me. everything i hate about films is present: fake sentimentality, extreme corniness, bad child actors and more feature abundantly. that's ignoring the fact that it depicts the extreme ignorance of american sports fans, with many of the cast professing that a football is shaped like a lemon. what?! that's a rugby ball. the story follows a group of no hopers that get a new teacher that they like (who, coincidently, teaches the class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football. naturally, they're all rubbish (don't forget, they're no hopers) except for one kid who has moved from el paso. blah blah, etc etc and the kids still don't become good footballers, but good heart ensues and the no hopers are turned into a bunch of well-rounded kids. hell, even the adults start to come round; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are let off the hook...groan.<br /><br />this movie stars steve guttenberg. now, before you go rushing off down your local video store to grab yourself a copy, hold up a minute. guttenberg is rubbish. no, no; come on let's face it, how did this guy ever get to be in a movie? i have absolutely no idea, and there is nothing in this movie to give me an idea. olivia d'abo stars along side steve and doesn't impress either. she merely seems to be going through the motions and looking nice while doing it. although i have no problems with the latter part; her performance does the movie no credit. the child actors that make up the rest of the cast are just as bad as you would expect from a movie like this. most of them are disgusting and/or annoying and it doesn't make for pleasant viewing at all. there's a goat in the film who plays the mascot and he does a good job; but you wouldn't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother seeing this movie.
