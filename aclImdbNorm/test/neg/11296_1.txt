one of the worst theatrical movies of the year, if not all time. anthony hopkins belittles himself by even appearing in this joke. i can't believe david mamet and ridley scott's name appear on this travesty. the best career move jody foster ever made was turning this one down. julianne moore was as emotionless throughout as a female keanu reeves. gary oldman was of course, his brilliant self. he is a crippled victim of hannibal and the make-up is so good, i didn't know it was gary until the final credits. but eaten by trained boars??? give me a break! rumor has it that he didn't want his name even mentioned in the credits. and frying and feeding his own brain to ray liotta...i was laughing at the absurdity, no make that stupidity of this flick at this point. i haven't seen so many people walk out of a movie since who's that girl.<br /><br />pay someone else to go for you if you must, but miss this one at all cost!!!
