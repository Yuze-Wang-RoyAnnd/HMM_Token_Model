not a balanced point of view. the director shouldn't express her opinion as truth. the movie has some criticism of fujimori but it always gives him and his family the last words. so few critics of fujimori were provided that it seems the only reason they were included was to be able to say the movie provides both views. but that is not the case.<br /><br />the movie barely shows one of the massacres that fujimori is accused of. and it gives him credit for the masterminding the murdering of the mrta insurgents that took the japanese embassy. it is well documented that the cia did the planning. there is even pictures of a well known cia strategist on the site published by caretas magazine and other newspapers.<br /><br />the fact that such well known information was not used by the director gives us a few possible conclusions: the director is pro-fujimori and purposely and falsely chooses to give the credit to him; the director does not want viewers to note that the cia and fujimori worked together; or it was just out of ignorance since the director is not peruvian and was not present in peru at the time the events occurred.<br /><br />the explanation provided by other commentators, that fujimori is still fairly popular in peru, does not excuse the lack of accuracy and balanced explanations.<br /><br />also, the statistics provided in the movie for the actual support of fujimori were the highest i have ever heard of. most statistics by major poll agencies are much lower.<br /><br />another point to mention is that the intelligence that was key in the capture of the leader of sendero and discover the secret network was done by a police force led by ketin vidal and he had complete autonomy from fujimori and montesinos.<br /><br />the first government of fujimori did experience an improvement in overall economic trends (gdp) but this improvement was financed by the privatization of several national industries with contracts that were not beneficial for the country in the long term. also, the gap between rich an poor continued to increase during fujimori's regime. in his second term the economy was suffering and there was nothing else to privatize and by the end of fujimori's second term the economy was about to collapse.<br /><br />in terms of investments in infrastructure of fujimori's regime, they fallow the paternalistic pattern. they were created to raise support for fujimori but were not meant to last long. these structures needed continued maintenance but fujimori did not provide political power for the civilians in order to demand further investment. in fact, fujimori's regime was able to destroy most forms of political organizing such as unions and grass-roots groups and the increase in informal unorganized labor was immense.<br /><br />finally, the director chose to spend most of the movie talking to fujimori instead of citing the cases of massive corruption in favour of fujimori (the media, business owners, the military, etc) that were so wide spread it was impossible that fujimori was not aware of it.
