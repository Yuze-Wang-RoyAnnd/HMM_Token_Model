note to self. never ever ever again watch a serious movie with charlie sheen in it. great comedian, horrible seal. this movie makes navy seals look like a reckless group of rangers when, in fact, they are the most elite form of military in the world. charlie sheen helps destroy the navy seal reputation. thank you for making such an incredibly select group of individuals look awful in one of the worst action movies i have ever seen. this is a great story which could be made into an amazing action movie, but why charlie sheen? there are possibilities for a very passionate story here, but sheen decides to wreck them with "funny" comments.
