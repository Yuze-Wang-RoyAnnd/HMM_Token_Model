first, i should say that i've seen the '39 version at least 100 times; know all the dialog, and have read the '36 play, which is different from the '39 and contains nuggets of gold of its own. this version is as flat as a lifetime movie on adultery. there's a reason you haven't seen an expensive campaign of tv ads for it. according to entertainment weekly, bening hated the catty tone of the original and how the women spent the whole time going to war on each other. guess what??! that was booth's intent. it was a slick, theatrical take on gossip, adultery, and back-biting among a set of well-heeled manhattan socialites. the crowd that made this new version had no intention of honoring the original source material. they pick at it weirdly, putting in half a scene here and half a scene there that come from the first version. bette midler (who is in just a few scenes and acts the old countess part in a broad, grinning style) doesn't have any context in this version. she mentions going after "buck," which is a key element in the original -- then he's never mentioned again. this movie is so dull that i'm not going to over-analyze it, but here are a few things that i found unbelievable: > mary haines bragging to her domestic staff: "i can suck the nails out of a board!" right. great writing. norma shearer could've done a line reading on that & gotten an oscar nom, right? > a compassionate sylvia fowler!!!??? annette bening got what she wanted, and the movie just sort of withers away. claire booth used sylvia as the comic engine that swept through the play. as portrayed immortally by rosalind russell, she was an ignorant, spiteful woman who rattled off reams of petty, ridiculous, irresistible dialog that is still classic and quotable. she wasn't above biting paulette godard's ankle. the 2008 filmmakers decided that this character had to die. in killing her off, they killed the movie.
