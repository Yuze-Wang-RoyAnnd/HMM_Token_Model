i just saw this at the castro theatre in san francisco and had trouble staying awake during this incredibly repetitive, unenlightening little film. it is a 75 minutes film that felt like 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modestly engaging material. it's not bad in any offensive way, it just repeats things that have been said many, many times over and more interestingly and provocatively. with only a couple of exceptions, the interviews drone on and on and on, making little emotional contact or context to the whole topic. it's more like a "how to" guide for something that can't be done anymore. i was alive during the era but felt little connection or nostalgia for what was presented.
