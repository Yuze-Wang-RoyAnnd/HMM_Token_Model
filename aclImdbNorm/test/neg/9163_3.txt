when i finally got around to seeing this film recently, it turned out to be exactly what it looked like to me at first glance... yet another hollywood cg/live-action rehash of an established cartoon franchise. nothing special or memorable whatsoever. designed in every way possible to appeal to very young children and very immature adults, making heavy use of comedic devices such as farts, poo-eating, and the size of theodore's butt.<br /><br />this film would bother me a lot less if it weren't such an obvious step down for the chipmunks. even their characters i found were changed for the worse for this movie. while in the past each one of them had a very distinct personality, here they all behaved like immature, smart-alecky children with add, constantly bouncing erratically off the walls. it especially bothered me to see simon portrayed in this way... he's supposed to be the smart, serious nerd who acts as the "straight man" to alvin's crazy antics. but here he's pretty much a carbon copy of alvin. one joke in the film even implies that simon only *thinks* he's smart but really isn't... and honestly if i had never heard of the chipmunks before seeing this film, i would have agreed.<br /><br />in my opinion, this film is just another obvious cash-grab, and i'm more than a little sorry it was even made. the fact that it's a "kid's" movie doesn't excuse its flaws... to excuse a stupid movie that degrades a classic franchise just because it's for children is insulting to children, and any kid would deserve something more intelligent than this film.
