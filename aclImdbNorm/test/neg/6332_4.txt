i've got to say, i'm a big fan of these 'last house on the left' rip-offs, even the ones that most people seem to hate are often held in relatively high esteem by me; but one of these sorts of films that i didn't like much was aldo lado's 'night train murders', and unfortunately it would seem that trains and the last house on the left don't mix, as terror express is another lacklustre rip-off. something that this sort of film really needs is a resoundingly nasty lead character; and while terror express offers up three potential candidates, not one of them steps up and becomes this villain, leaving the lacking in the most important area. it actually gets off to a good start as three young men on a passenger train begin slightly irritating the guests on board. this leads the audience to believe that there is more in store, but unfortunately it never really gets going once the scene has been set. from there, the trio end up 'taking over' the train and use their new found power to terrorise the guests and rape the women.<br /><br />it has to be said that there's a fair amount of sleaze in this film, which will be pleasing to many viewers; but there's hardly any blood. director ferdinando baldi seemed to think that he could get away with replacing the blood with sex scenes, and he may have gotten away with it too; if he could film a brutal sex scene. the idea that these men have taken the train by force goes out of the window once it gets to the sex, as the people that you would expect to be powerful and forceful seem all too keen to show their women a good time, and despite one very tame 'sandwich' sequence, none of the sex is particularly interesting. since a lot of the film is taken up by these sex scenes, this becomes a massive problem. films like this are often lacking in style, suspense and credibility; but you know you're watching a bad one when it's boring you. as you might expect, none of the acting is up to anything; and the central three in particular stand out for being rubbish. the direction is lacking in style, and there's very little tension or suspense; making it difficult to care what is going to happen. overall, this is a pretty crappy example of an exploitation film, and i can't recommend it.
