i will commend it in only one respect.. it was innovative. innovative doesn't mean it's a good film, it means that it can give you an idea of what you can take and implement in your own films.<br /><br />the simple plot is.. well.. simple. i got to the point where i didn't care if they destroy the building or not. if i had to hear that girl's annoying giggle one more time, i swear i would hurl the dvd out the window. and there's also the protagonist. they try to make him lovable, but he's a freakin pervert! sniffing the girls bra, sneaking peeks at her when she's naked, putting her bra over his eyes when he sleeps, putting her bra on a blow up sex doll (which she takes her panties off while hes asleep and slips them on his doll.. umm)<br /><br />what irritates me even moreso is that crappy tinting. in the photo gallery on the dvd, you can see what the film looked liek before they greyscaled it and put in a color tint (digitally too).. the film looked a lot better without the effect.. so they sacrificed it being a good film just to be artsy... bah. i could understand using gimmicks like that if the film quality was crap..<br /><br />i think most people who liked this film just liked it because the chick was naked for a good 5 - 10 minutes. this doesn't compare to delicatessen ( like so many are tryign to do). delicatessen has characters you can get into and like.. these people here just grunt and giggle.<br /><br />lastly, i would also liek to point out that this was also tryign to be like a german impressionistic film liek the old silents. one of the problems with most foreign, especially artsy, films is that thety focus on making an artsy composition and forget about the 'space' of the scene. it results in the audience not really understanding what;s going on because they don't get a sense of the space of the surroundings.<br /><br />anyway, it's rubbish. the short film on the dvd, surprise, was a heckuva lot better.
