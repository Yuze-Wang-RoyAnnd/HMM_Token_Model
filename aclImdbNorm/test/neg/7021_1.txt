truly i love lucy as well...comedic genius yes.....mame...never...she was as ridiculous as mame...as was the film adaptation of divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood. both just completely missed the point. roslind russell was, is and always will be the first and only mame. perhaps as a young starlet, ball could have pulled off a role like this, where her inherent beauty and youth could have carried her through...but this seemed a desperate attempt from an aged star to show that she was still viable in the field. the reason there are sooo many more supporters of russell's version (aside from the fact that you cant improve upon the original) is that russell had presence, she absorbs every scene, whereas lucille ball might as well be a pattern on the wallpaper in mame for all the attention she commands in the role.
