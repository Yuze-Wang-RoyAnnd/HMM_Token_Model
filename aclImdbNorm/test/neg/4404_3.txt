i was very concerned about this film, it was scheduled to play at a jewish film festival, and was reported to be very hostile to israel, while using clever humor and irony.<br /><br />i was relieved that the film was not a diatribe, however as a work of film it was deeply disappointing. the film was full of random events, some of which eventually connected, most of which did not. some of the events were very clever and funny, but some were merely random and pointless.<br /><br />there are repeated scenes between two lovers where they sit in a car, wordlessly, and play some handholding game. perhaps in some cultures this is erotic, but it's like watching thumb-wrestling. after the third time, it really became tiresome.<br /><br />i have always found david lynch to be gratuitously bizarre, using strange stories and images to cause audiences to think that he is so sophisticated that they don't grasp his work; in fact, there is nothing to grasp. the same is true here, the stories do not add up to anything, and there is not much of a political point being made (in one scene a boisterous israeli soldier humiliates palestinian drivers at a checkpoint. that's news?)<br /><br />i don't understand why this film has garnered controversy, nor why it has garnered attention. it is an inferior work and seeing it was a waste of time.
