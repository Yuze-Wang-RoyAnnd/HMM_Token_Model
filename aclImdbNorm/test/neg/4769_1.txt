first off, i saw another reviewer said this movie was "fantastic". well nothing could be further from the truth! this movie is complete garbage!!! a moronic horror comedy that is not even slightly funny!! don't take that mean that it's so bad that it's good because it's not. it's a total waste of time and money!<br /><br />here's what i see in this waste of a dvd. a group of friends get together on a weekend, get drunk and then decide to make a backyard video. they grab mom and dad's video camera and start coming up with scenes on the spot. they all get a big kick out of watching themselves mug for the camera. they figure, if they think it's funny then everyone will think it's funny. well, they're wrong. this backyard home video is garbage. the "acting" and comedic gore effects are lousy but i guess that's to be expected since this is nothing more then a home video.<br /><br />on the bright side, i guess the fact that this crap got out there gives hope to anyone out there who wants to make a movie. if these people could get their movie made and released on dvd then anyone can!<br /><br />0/10-- save your money.
