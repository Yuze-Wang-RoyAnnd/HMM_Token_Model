ok, here's the short of it... this movie is full of corny dialogue, over the top acting, and a threadbare script.<br /><br />there are moments that intended to be very dramatic but simply come off humorous because of the over the top acting and poorly written lines. i couldn't help laughing at moments that were meant to be very serious. the bright spot in this movie is the circus. seeing the circus in its heyday was certainly a treat.<br /><br />there are moments that come through as good. but then it nosedives right back into b-movie territory. i was tempted to stop watching it several times.<br /><br />i certainly don't know how it won best picture, however. it must have been a slow year!
