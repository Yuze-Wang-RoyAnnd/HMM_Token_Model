the only time i seem to trawl through imdb comments is when i've seen a duff film. i guess i'm looking to find reassurance that it's not just me. for me, then, lonesome jim was a duff film packed with unbelievable characters in unbelievable situations which limped on lamely and boringly towards a cop-out hackneyed conclusion. so i check out what other people have to say and feel a bit like jim, out on a limb, alienated, as page after page of multiple star ratings and plaudits leave me doubting my critical faculties. yet maybe i should check the settings for the comments presentation, since after a while the gushing dies down and i'm relieved to see appreciations that mirror my own. i feel vindicated. it is a rubbish film, it doesn't hang together and it does constitute a wasted evening sitting through it. praise be to kindred spirits.
