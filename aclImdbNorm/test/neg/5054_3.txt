this absurd movie was about a "goodie-two-shoe," teen-girl that really wanted to be valedictorian but finds her obstacle in a teacher name mrs. tingle. katie holmes, who plays this "goodie-two-shoe," is faced with "the biggest dilemma of her teenage life" when this classmate guy of hers comes along with the final exams sample that should help them nail mrs. tingle's test. mrs. tingle comes along, catches holmes, the classmate guy and her best friend with the sample of her final exam. convinced that the three of them planned on cheating on here exam, mrs. tingle enthuses on her opportunity to ruin holmes once and for all with allegations that can take away any chance of holmes passing her class. and the classmate guy, who apparently has his eye on holmes, always wondered why she never gave him the time of day (he's an idiot)? feeling desperate, holmes and her friends visit mrs. tingle in the middle of the night to try to dissuade her in believing that holmes was planning to cheat. it all backs fire somehow when the classmate guy points a bow and arrow at mrs. tingle, threatening her to make things right for holmes. mrs. tingle fights back but ultimately ends up as holmes and her friend's captive.<br /><br />during mrs. tingle captivity under holmes, they do everything from tying her up and gagging her in her own bed to blackmailing her with false pictures that they took of the unconscious coach in bed with mrs. tingle. i found myself cringing when the kids were making themselves at home in mrs. tingle's house, eating up her food and going though her private work. at one point, holmes found mrs. tingle's grade book and purposely changes the grade in her favor, decreasing the grade of her challenge for valedictorian. the end played out like a childish attempt to bring back the comedy that was sparingly in the beginning of the film, resolving on pure irony, slapstick and absurdity.<br /><br />this has to be the most unlikable and wickedly evil character holmes would ever play in her entire life. i wanted to help mrs. tingle get free to really dig a grave for holmes. she was manipulative, selfish and conniving. she even slept with the classmate guy despite her best friend's overwhelming interest in him...and she didn't like him. from attempting to ruin her challengers grades by seizing mrs. tingle's grade book to taking her best friend's man, you would think that holmes would get what she deserves in the end, right? unfortunately, she obtains everything her heart desires, showing that being wicked, manipulative, selfish and whining can get you what you want.<br /><br />mrs. tingle was suppose to be the character you didn't like. they didn't bring me to that point once to believe that she was this woman that needed to be "taught this lesson." she was like every other strict teacher who even gave valid reasons for her resentment of the next generation. personally, i felt that her opinions about young people were validated with holmes and her friend's actions every time. i kept hoping she could get free to call the police and nail holmes. they kept her tied up in bed, ate up her food like a bunch of pigs, drank up the woman's wine, messed with her personal belongings and we're suppose to believe that she didn't deserve to take a bat to each of their heads? and the classmate guy has to be one of the most disliked characters in the history of film. forget idiot, we need a new word for him that isn't in the webster's dictionary. he brought the major trouble into holme's life then made things worse when he came into mrs.tingle's house, uninvited behind holmes, and corners mrs. tingle with a bow and arrow. i was thrilled every time mrs. tingle had a chance to slap fire out of him, or choke the wannabe actress best friend.<br /><br />if you're a teen out there and want to see when a teen's manipulation and wrong doing can get him or her the world, see this unfunny, caricature filled, unintentional film noir.
