i starred as eugene morris jerome in my high school adaptation of the play and this film definitely doesn't live up to the script or the imagination of neil simon. i know this play backwards and forwards and i can honestly tell you that the acting was off, the production was cheesy. the changes in the play's script were poorly done. if you want to really enjoy this play you should see the actual play, not a hollywood movie adaptation. the eugene character lacked soul and was overly sarcastic in all he said. the other characters were off key as well. a general disappointment, messy, disloyal to the play, amateurishly executed!
