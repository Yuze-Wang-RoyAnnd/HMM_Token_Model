for the record, i hate spoof movies. except for mel brooks and airplane! because those are classics and make fun of the clich'es, not the actual movies itself. i think that spoof movies are the bottom of the barrel for both comedy and film. i especially hate things created by jason friedberg and aaron seltzer, the "geniuses" behind date movie, epic movie, and meet the spartans.<br /><br />i decided to give the comebacks a look. since friedberg and seltzer had nothing to do with the production, i was as objective as possible. it was just like one of their movies. it was basically every sports movie rolled into one with lame kindergarten jokes, and disturbing images of bodily injury that's supposed to make me laugh and failed.<br /><br />only someone high would laugh at these jokes. toilet bowl? who wrote this? an 11 year old? i was surprised to see that this was the creation of the producers of wedding crashers, which was actually pretty decent. but there attempt at the spoof genre was about as funny as a burning orphanage. the only reason that i gave this two stars (when it clearly deserved one) was because friedberg & seltzer had nothing to do with this.
