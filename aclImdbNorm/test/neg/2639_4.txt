typical story of an evil kid going after people. i suspect that antonio fargas (huggy bear on "starsky and hutch") and vincent schiavelli didn't want to stress this junk on their resumes (actually, schiavelli left this life with a mostly good resume). sometimes i wish that the killers in these movies would just go after the idiots who decide that we need a new one of these movies every other month (note: that comment is not to be taken seriously; i just think that slashers have lost their touch).<br /><br />anyway, this is one movie that you'll do best to avoid. it's ninety minutes to two hours that i'll never get back.
