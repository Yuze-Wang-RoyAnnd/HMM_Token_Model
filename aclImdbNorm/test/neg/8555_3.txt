get the cd instead. the show is tame, and the editing sucks. the crowd gets way too much screen time, as does till lindemann. the cameras spend more time on the same kid shaking his head around in the same way (which leads me to believe it's the exact same shot) than they do during richard kruspe's solo in weisses fleisch. the scenes change so quickly it's impossible to tell where the camera is pointed, and the replays are simply redundant. not worth the tape it's recorded on.
