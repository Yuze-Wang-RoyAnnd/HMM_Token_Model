the positives: it's shot pretty well. has some interesting peripheral characters. likable main character (albeit weak).<br /><br />the bad: plot/story. editing. characters wasted. jessica alba.<br /><br />i'm a fan of sappy movies, but this movie is cringe-inducingly bad. i don't understand how anyone can hand over $12m to this guy jenkin. and before i go any further, i just want to say that i don't dislike jessica alba--i really wanted to like her in this film. however, jessica alba in her fake accent and her model poses made me miserable. she has absolutely no screen presence in this movie, and she ruins every scene she's in. needless to say, the romance does not come off as believable(not even a tiny bit).<br /><br />all i saw throughout was the actors flapping their wings, trying to get this thing off the ground with what little they were given--but sadly, all this movie does is sink. there is no emotional connection, no emotional conflict, and nothing is gained. it's a pretty empty movie.
