to start off, i love steven seagal, the man is a genius. but recent movies leave me to wonder, is he trying anymore? his latest movies show almost no effort on seagal's part. in out of reach, its too obvious that his lines are dubbed over. . what seagal does in this movie is not only a slap on the face to his fans, but even more to jean-claude van damme and his fans. in the 2nd scene or so, when he prepares to zip-line into the drug dealers penthouse to steal the jewels and money, it shows him set-up the gun and hook it on a neon sign. your might be saying to yourself, 'yah, so what does this have to do with van damme?'. well that scene was stolen from a jean-claude van damme movie called the order. rent both, watch both, compare both and you will lose respect for seagal. not only was today you die garbage, but it was, dare i say, an insult. seagal's aikido moves are still good, but why isn't he doing great movies like marked for death or above the law, hes still got the moves and the attitude, i'm just left wondering 'why seagal, why?'. there are such idiotic scenes in his newer movies that have nothing to do with the storyline, and such idiotic story lines on top of that. i hope the up-coming black dawn movie will be another exit wounds or beyond justice, because these last chain of movies he made, especially today you die, really made me wonder if he has the stuff to make more great action movies like double team. please, don't watch this movie unless you hate seagal, if you love his movies don't watch this, it will make you question his future in the action film genre.
