my first impression when i read the synopsis for the upcoming movie was that it was going to be very, very different from the book. the movie trailer said that the movie is supposed to take place when vivian is 19 years old after her parents were killed in a fire in america. she meets aiden, an aspiring graphic novelist. working in a chocolate shop in the day, she must accept that she will never be normal, because every full moon, she becomes a loup-garou--a thought-to-be mythical creature that can be closely compared to a werewolf.<br /><br />most of the little changes didn't sound too bad to me, even though i am a fan of the book with the shared titled by annette curtis klause. i knew it would be different, but i wanted to see it to support the book, thinking that an age change, a setting change, and a few little occupation changes wouldn't impact the storyline as a whole enough to make me want to tear my eyes out of their sockets and leave myself bleeding on the movie theatre ground.<br /><br />the movie unnecessarily killed off many important characters, one being esme, vivan's mother, right off the bat in the fire that was supposed to have killed her father. i pushed that aside and ventured forth into the movie, weary and slightly annoyed. running through romania, the camera angles were decent, the scenery was beautiful, and the music was... interesting... but it left me with the impression of, "why does vivian look like that, and why is she wearing a hoodie?" jumping to later parts of the movie, i must say that i am surprised that the screenplay writers seemed to support incest in a way and rather than sticking to the character relationship from the book between vivian and rafe, the leader of the five now became her cousin through her (surprise!) aunt astrid, who, in the novel, was the bitter and hated rival of vivan's mother, and, might i add, no way related to either of them.<br /><br />to top off character distortions, gabriel had somehow become the leader of the pack and obsessed over vivian being his mate so they could fulfill some nonexistent prophecy. not only did his physical appearance take a complete 180 from the description in the book, he was, apparently, also the father of rafe. yes, that's right, it's a nice little incestuous knot of wolfies all bundled up tight.<br /><br />little things that irked me were scenes like the forest hunts. there was a red-head that stood out from the rest of the crowd, the one who "kissed their enemy" before their prey was set free to run and be hunted. why was she there? why did she look like astrid? i suppose my mind is not vast enough to understand why such a character had to exist in the movie without any explanation as to why she existed other than to kiss pretty victims.<br /><br />i loved how the amoeba was completely cut out of the movie. i loved how legally entwined aiden's past was, what between the supposedly dramatic scene where he was telling vivian about how his father wanted him to learn self-defense, and then beat his father up "in self-defense" to make him seem like such a tragic character.<br /><br />character 180s are a lot of fun when they are completely unnecessary. at the end of the movie, i felt as if some person skimmed over the novel, scribbled down half the list of character names, drew a few connections here and there, mentioned that gabriel was a bit of a jerk, vivian fell in love with aiden, he fears her when he finds out she is a loup-garou of the legends, and "somebody" is "killed by a silver bullet" and there is some sort of happy ending because vivian finally feels accepted by somebody who loves her for who she is.<br /><br />i gave this movie a 2/10 because the camera shots were relatively decent, and the casting could have been worse, but as far as directing goes, why do the loup-garous leap into the air in human form as if they want to fly (with their arched backs and penchant to leap from high places), shimmer briefly, and then fall onto the ground as wolves? the only aspects of this movie that even had me watch it through to the very-sordid, sorry ending were the wolves, the beautiful scenery, and the eye-candy boys.<br /><br />all-together, i must say that in order to enjoy this film at all, one must be ready for misconceptions, strange happenings that are not always explained, incestuous innuendos, and have either not liked the book, or have not read the book.
