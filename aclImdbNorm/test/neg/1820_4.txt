it's not easy to find judas kiss on vhs (it's not available on dvd), but i wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my alan rickman movie collection.<br /><br />i can't understand how the talented mr. rickman gets into these mediocre films? judas kiss boasts several wonderful actors, an interesting plot and intriguing twists, but its strange visual wanderings and chopping editing ruined what might have been a great crime drama. many scenes seem to be missing vital information to explain the character's actions: why was our hero immediately suspicious of his bosses? why did he mistrust the detective he replaced? there were times when i honestly couldn't tell if the director meant judas kiss to be a legitimate crime drama or a campy spoof. why else would he toss in a topless/alien/lesbian porno scene in the first two minutes (that little surprise certainly made me scramble for the remote since my kids were playing nearby!)? did he purposely instruct his two distinguished english actors (alan rickman and emma thompson) to use such awful new orlean's accents? as an alan freak, i confess that i still thought mr. rickman was sexy: in a rumpled, weary, "take-him-home-and-tuck-him-in" sort of way.<br /><br />judas kiss isn't a great movie, but it does have some intriguing moments, but i don't recommend it unless you're trying to immerse yourself in alan rickman.
