just saw this movie on opening night. i read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it... i must say, i was not impressed. i'm so unimpressed that i feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money.<br /><br />first of all "the messengers" is very predictable, and just not much of a thriller. it might be scary for someone under 13, but it really did nothing for me. the climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movie's resolution.<br /><br />furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial. some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than the sub-par suspense scenes.<br /><br />if you've seen previews for this movie, then you've seen most of the best parts and have a strong understanding of the plot. this movie is not worth seeing in the theaters.
