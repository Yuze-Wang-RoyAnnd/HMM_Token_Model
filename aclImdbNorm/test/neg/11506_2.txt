when this show first came to disney, i love it started watching all the time. it quickly became one of my favorite disney shows ever but this show somehow transformed into something that is disturbing and disappointing.<br /><br />i do now find any of the second and third season fun, they seem like a re-watch of some teens shows. i hat that garbage. the first season was very unique because it showed sadie who loved science and animals and creatures. the first season was very entertaining. i mostly don't like the second season because of ben. he annoys me and pisses the crap outta me. the plot in the second season also sucks and is just awful
