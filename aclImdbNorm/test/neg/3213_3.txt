the clever marketeer is he is, jess franco naturally also cashed in on the huge temporarily success of psychedelic spy movies like mario bava's ultimately sensational "danger: diabolik!". franco is the ideal man to shoot a similar film, as he could freely insert as much sleaze, kitschy scenery and absurdly grotesque plot twists as he wanted to. and he partially understood this very well, as "the girl from rio" revolves on a man-hating organization, led by a funky dressed lesbo, that plots to turn all men into obedient slaves! unfortunately (for them, at least), the diabolical plans conflict with the daily business of a feared crime syndicate boss, played by george sanders. all the right ingredients are well-presented, yet this is a surprisingly weak and unsatisfying adventure movie. the plot is rich on imagination, but seemingly only on paper, as the action is quite tame. the film is also very colorful...but not too bright and especially shocking was the total lack of vicious sex. there's a bit of nudity, sure, but too few according to normal franco standards. all the characters are sick in the head, so the least i expected (or hoped for) were more perverted undertones or frenzied themes. franco obviously had a bigger budget as usual to work with, and i must say he spends that money well on more convincing set pieces and talented cast members. particularly the veteran actor george sanders ("village of the damned", "psychomania") is one of the best players ever to appear in a franco production. too bad even he can't save "the girl from rio" from being a huge letdown. a legendary euro-smut filmmaker like jess franco could and should have done more with this concept. shame, shame, shame...
