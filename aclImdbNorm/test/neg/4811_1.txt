ni~nas mal is not a movie is a bad episode of a cheesy badly conceived soap opera. <br /><br />the acting is not a bit better of that in soap operas, i guess the writer and director has seen too many mexican soap operas and can't conceive anything remotely different. <br /><br />give it up, go back to your soap operas so that you have an audience to please. <br /><br />stop waisting our time and money and giving a bad name to the once respectable mexican film industry. <br /><br />it is not an ok or good movie, it's a mediocre soap opera!
