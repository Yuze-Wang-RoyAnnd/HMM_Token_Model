perhaps the weakest film in the "kharis" series, despite the presence of john carradine (miscast as an egyptian high priest) and george zucco (as his predecessor, hilariously afflicted by a bad case of parkinson's disease) supporting lon chaney jr. as the titular creature - if indeed it was him under the bandages, as his contribution is negligible at best! it's a watchable 60 minutes in itself, i guess, but the standards have considerably lowered when compared even to the two previous entries, and the end result is strictly routine and not at all memorable. just about the only interesting feature here is the fact that the female lead happens to be the reincarnation of princess ananka, mentioned a great deal in earlier films but never actually seen.
