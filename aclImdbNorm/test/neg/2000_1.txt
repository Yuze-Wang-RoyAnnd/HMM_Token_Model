this is my first comment on a movie in here. i have to say that of all the bad films i ever seen, including braindead for an example, this is really worse! i promise. don't even look at it. it is boring, bad acting, bad script and plot, bad effects the whole movie is one big piece of crap! if i could i would give 0 stars out of 10, but since the lowest is 1 which is awful, i need to vote that. but i would say the movie is worse than awful.<br /><br />don't pain yourself by seeing this movie and hoping it will get better because i can tell you already now, it wont! i hoped that there might would come one single scene which would be worth watching. there didn't came any good scene at all. <br /><br />what an excellent piece of crap. <br /><br />and coolio as a vampire? lol! lmao! yargh!
