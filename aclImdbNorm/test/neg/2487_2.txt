purported documentary that tries to examine sci-fi films of the 1950s and how they affected (and reflected) america. steven spielberg, george lucas, ridley scott and james cameron are interviewed and mark hamill narrates.<br /><br />pretty terrible. the "insights" that are given are nothing new--for instance--the cold war and the threat of nuclear war affected a whole generation of children. well-duh! they try to cover all of the different sub genres of sci-fi films of the 1950s--the big bug movies, invaders from space movies etc etc. that's good but they choose the most obvious films and they've been over analyzed to death already. it was cool seeing clips from "rocketship x-m", "destination moon", "forbidden planet", "the thing" and "the day the earth stood still" but everything the directors said was so incredibly obvious to any viewer that it's insulting. even though it's under an hour i was thoroughly bored 30 minutes in. this gets a 2 for some of the clips but nothing else.
