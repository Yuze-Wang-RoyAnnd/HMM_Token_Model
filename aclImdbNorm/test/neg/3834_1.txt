i think it's two years ago since i have seen the movie and till this day it's the worst film i have ever seen. the only thing i thought after seeing this movie was that it was made for some tax reason. so after all this time i finally spilled my gut ;) and now imdb says i have to fill 10 lines with comments:<br /><br />"sorry, you must provide at least 10 lines in your comment. please return to the edit window (or use the back option if this isn't a new window)."<br /><br />please there is nothing to say anymore...<br /><br />sorry for some bad english.
