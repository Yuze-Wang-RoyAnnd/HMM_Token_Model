i generally loved the carry on movies but this one is actually pretty awful. there are very few laughs because the whole thing is so forced.there is plenty of talent on the screen and some come off better than others. june whitfield, kenneth williams, hatti jaques and peter butterworth are fine but barbara windsor looks tired and sid james is just tacky. joan sims comes off well but in the case of the usually wonderful charles hawtrey its just plain sad. when you think of the sad end to his career the movie is almost too depressing to watch. the homophobia of the movie is nasty and its a very unpleasant experience. the set looks cheap and unlike other movies in the series the movie is very clearly set in england. the sea side looks cold and there is little attempt to create any illusions here. it looks like a cheap production. you will be surprised at how miserable you become watching this especially if you loved the series.
