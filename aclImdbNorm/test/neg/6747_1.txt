only in the hollywood audiovisual fiction world could anybody, including fbi agents, be so unbelievably stupid. the good guys are stupid enough to pick up everything they're interested in, answer phones, go up stairways, all in search for a demolition expert who's out to get everybody. oh yes, and then we get the hollywood supervillain. he can be shot, even if he's got a vest on, and then fall down a long flight of steps and then still have the upper hand over his stupid pursuers. every clich'e you can think of in suspense movies were used. i only watched it because yuki amami is so hot. oh,,,,but yes, it's great to see how morally superior this fbi agent is, when she's pretty certain that there's a bomb in an opera house, and she doesn't sound the alarm. who writes these scripts????????????
