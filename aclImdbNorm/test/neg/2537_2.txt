abysmal indonesian action film from legendary arizal triumphantly sculpts a template for future cinemax pap like 'china o'brien' and 'do or die' with erik estrada while simultaneously burying poor rising action star pat o'brien with a hackneyed backyard script and three cans of hair-styling gel to perm his impressive 1984 mullet. this guy's physical prowess resembles a more femme mark gregory and his next credit would be second fiddle to chris mitchum as "tom selick." powerful. at least the action is mindless and non-stop with some daring asian stuntmen risking their lives for what is essentially a poorly constructed movie by teens and/or meth addicts with no concept of reality. one poor extra gets gorno-ly shredded by an electric hedge clipper and many more are killed by getting hit in the head by odd objects such as a motorcycle wheel or cardboard box. classic rape scenes are tasteless and priceless and quotable dialog such as, "i would rather trust a rattlesnake!" are delivered with such exuberance and fervor from the third-rate polizioteschi voice actors. random highlight: some crazy dude eating live lizards. movie also holds the record for most cars driven through walls. 2/10
