tom is about to tuck into a delicious jerry sandwich when a huge bird of prey swoops down and flies off with his snack. not at all happy with having his sarnie stolen right from under his nose, tom takes off in hot pursuit, determined to retrieve his mousy morsel.<br /><br />as much as i love tom and jerry, i have got to say that this one is a bit of a stinker: the story is rather mundane; it introduces a badly conceived peripheral character that lacks charm; and it flogs the old 'dress the cartoon character up as a woman' gag to death.<br /><br />in my opinion, 'flirty birdy' rivals 'fraidy cat' and 'mouse in manhattan' for the title of weakest tom and jerry caper thus far.
