the actors were not believable, the story was really weak, total sap, and completely predictable. really disappointed in depardieu. it was a shame that they did not focus more on the struggle of the canadian fight for independence. we have seen this love story many times before, only with better actors! we had to wait for the last 15 minutes for a small sense of drama! the soundtrack was totally disturbing. the underscore hit you over the head with sentimentality. but really over the top. the only thing we found ok was the fact that they let the indians speak their language. and we found the cinematography, of the indian village relatively realistic.
