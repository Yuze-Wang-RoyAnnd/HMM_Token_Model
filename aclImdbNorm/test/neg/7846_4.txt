tycoon will never be listed as one of john wayne's better post stagecoach film. it's good in spots, has some fine action sequences in the cave in and also in the flood at the climax. but the plot leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />what we have in tycoon is two men who thoroughly dislike each other and that dislike prevents them from working as a team. multimillionaire cedric hardwicke has hired john wayne and james gleason to build a railroad. but then he refuses to give them the needed funds to do the job right.<br /><br />things get really complicated when wayne falls for hardwicke's daughter, laraine day. after a night when they have to spend time alone in an inca ruin, by convention in south america, wayne and day get a shotgun wedding even though nothing happened.<br /><br />what should have happened is these two should have been locked in a room for 24 hours together to work out their differences one way or another. their petty spites cause some fatalities among wayne's crew.<br /><br />but what tycoon is most known for is another piece of pettiness. laraine day was married to leo durocher the manager of the brooklyn dodgers when this was being filmed. he was a constant presence on the set, insanely jealous of john wayne who he thought might be having an affair with his wife. nothing to it, but he made his wife's life miserable.<br /><br />not one of the duke's better efforts.
