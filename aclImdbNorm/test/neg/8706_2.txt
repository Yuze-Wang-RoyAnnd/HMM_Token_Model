with a name like "10 commandments" you would expect a film to be representative of the account in the bible, specifically exodus. not so here. this is standard procedure with any biblical hallmark-made film. remember "noah"?? that was utter fiction and one of the worst films ever made. at least this film had "some" truth to the original story. however, menerith, who was a major character in this movie - half-brother of moses, is not in the original story. other characters were absent, not to mention important events were completely eliminated. so what, you may ask? because this should be representative of the actual story; otherwise, some might and do believe that is the way it actually happened. in today's age, people get their religion from movies instead of church and reading the bible. also, it is a great error. see revelation 22:18-19. the script is already written. why change it? other than the account in exodus itself (which should be the main focus), you have the cecil b. demille film to compare it to, which is clearly a far better presentation.<br /><br />the night it first aired, my wife was anxious to see it. i told her not to get her hopes up because it was a hallmark-film. she looked puzzled and said, "why? hallmark makes good movies". that might be so, but they butcher the bible. i'm sorry to say that i was correct. not just the story, but the acting as well. with today's technology, you should be able to make a wonderful biblical movie. i'm still waiting...
