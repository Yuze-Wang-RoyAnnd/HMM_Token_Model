although i could sum this pathetic episode of night gallery in two words, those two words being "horse manure," i am obligated to write a minimum of ten lines. this is a very sophomoric episode, not worthy of the standards of rod serling, but rather an inept attempt at some sort of ironic black comedy. the premise of giant rodents inhabiting the moon, a lifeless orb to be sure, is totally ridiculous, as is the construction of a giant mousetrap. i suppose we are to also assume that the moon is made of green cheese and that is how these absurd creatures survive. i can only assume that this episode was presented as a filler to supplant the other two episodes first aired on that date. all in all, a waste of film, actors and air time.
