this movie made me watch paul w.s. anderson's avp1 and enjoy it! i am not even going to dream of comparing requiem to any of the alien or predator series' movies,this is a horrible teenage b-horror footage set in an american small town no one cares about.<br /><br />avp1 at least had heaps of handcrafted art carved into the movie sets,it had bags of eye-candy not previously seen in any of the original movies - but was ruined by unconvincing characters/acting.<br /><br />requiem takes bad acting to the lowest imaginable level,and it also lacks in every other department just as much...it's a sacrilege to include alien and predator suits in this kind of rubbish.
