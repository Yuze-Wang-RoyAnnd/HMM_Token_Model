the film shows relations of the dying mother, and the son, who is very attached to her, and definitely loves her. what does it show? it shows their living in very poor conditions. it shows how tenderly they "walk" (really he is bringing her). but what do we see further? after their promenade he walks alone at the same places, where they walked together. it is not possible. a person, who love and care about another dying one, would do everything to make the life of this one better. he would not have a free minute to ponder, to be alone with oneself, and if he finds a few minutes a month for that, he would run away from the places where he has usually to be. another thing. the author devoted this film to andrey tarkovsky. we see he learned many tarkovsky's visual effects. but in sokurov's film they are only effects, they do not support any senses or mood. someone has compared this film with "mirror" ("zerkalo"). there is nothing common except these visual effects. "mirror" is a great film and this one is just poor imitation.
