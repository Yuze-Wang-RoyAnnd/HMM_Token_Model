"undercurrent" features a top-notch cast of wonderful actors who might've been assembled for the perfect drawing-room comedy. alas, they are pretty much wasted on a 'woman's view' potboiler--and a paper-thin one at that. katharine hepburn is indeed radiant as a tomboy/old maid who finally marries, but her husband is deeply disturbed and harboring dark family secrets. director vincente minnelli has absolutely no idea how to mount this outlandish plot, concocted by edward chodorov from a story by thelma strabel, and the friendly, first-rate cast (including robert taylor, robert mitchum and edmund gwenn) is left treading in murky waters. ** from ****
