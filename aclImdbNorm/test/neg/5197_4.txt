i feel conflicted about this film - it is one of the most beautiful films i've seen, and provides insightful looks into a lost culture. there was an early scene of men in caps and moustaches sitting around a table, with a woman serving, and an accordion playing, that brought tears to my eyes, just because of the way it captured a way of life that must be incomprehensible to many today. it presents the lives of the characters as being inextricably bound up with the life of the village, another lost concept in today's world. symbolism is always fun but it seemed a little dated. the fatal flaws of the movie to me were the lack of any compelling dramatic drive, and a total lack of humor. i never felt like i knew any of the characters beyond very basic universal things like grieving over the loss of a loved one, etc. the people were stick figures in the director's tableaux involving natural disasters, war, etc. the film was just one beautiful tragic scene after another, with no involving narrative thread and no humanity. as a result, it seemed very abstract, irrelevant to the lives of real people. in the end, i was too bored to finish watching it.
