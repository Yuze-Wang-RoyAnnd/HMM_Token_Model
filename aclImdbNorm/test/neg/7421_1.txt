harlan knowles (lance henriksen) brings a group of people to a mountain to help find his missing daughter (erica durance). what they don't know is that she was killed by a sasquatch (taras kostyuk) and it's still out there... waiting for them.<br /><br />it was a late night when i poped this into my dvd player. i seriously wish i could go back in time and stop me. most people will tell you that films like "house of the dead" or "s.i.c.k: serial insain clown killers" will be the movies you wish you've never seen. wrong. this will be.<br /><br />i've seen a lot of crap, but this is the only crap that's haunted me. how i wish i never watched this! the acting actually isn't so bad. it's just the writing and the directing and the pacing and everything! i am actually a fan of sasquatch films. but not this one.<br /><br />please, listen to my warning. don't watch this!
