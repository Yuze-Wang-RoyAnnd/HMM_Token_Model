the opening scene of the beach at fircombe while amusing in itself, unfortunately provides a suitable metaphor for the film - insipid and washed out. it is actually not as corny as most of the others in the carry on series, but maybe because of that doesn't really deliver much fun. it's a fair bet that the title will appeal to fans of the benny hill show but those looking for attractive females in bikinis and miniskirts, while they will see some in this, will probably enjoy some of the other titles in the series, such as "carry on abroad" or "carry on up the jungle" more. the emergence of early 1970s feminism is used as a plot device which seems rather self-defeating.
