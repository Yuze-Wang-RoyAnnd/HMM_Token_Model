what offends me most about the critics following this film is the mentioning of 'originality'. this film does not contain one innovating element. if, by 'originality' you refer to pathetic action scenes, overacting, gluttony in violence, blunt humor and a script beyond intellectual belief. then, 'originality' is something swedish film can do without.<br /><br />how r"ose and karlsson can agree to 'act' in this poor excuse for a film is a mystery to me. and how eva r"ose after the making of this film can be seen at breakfast-tv promoting it just disappoints me.<br /><br />this film doesn't contain a story, the script is illogical, stiff and last but not least, just plain bad. these two young directors have put together a quite disgusting boy-fantasy containing violence, comic-strips and trivialized psychological portraits. i wouldn't be surprised if the scene of dd masturbating in the kitchen over a micro-wave dinner actually is put there to describe the everyday life of these two overgrown cinematic nerds that pose as directors.<br /><br />i wouldn't show this movie to my worst enemy.
