scarlet dawn casts douglas fairbanks, jr. as a russian baron rudely displaced by the forces of the russian revolution and now has to fend for himself in a world not terribly hospitable to former aristocrats. he's also not terribly suited for any kind of real work. <br /><br />doug might have been caught by the reds but for the fact that his former servant nancy carroll didn't give him away. nancy's got a big old crush on doug and they do marry once arriving in exile in istanbul which throughout the film is referred to by its former christian name of constantinople. they marry and settle down with doug now reduced to washing dishes.<br /><br />but fairbanks's former mistress lilyan tashman who's always playing bad girls of a sort on film spots him and offers to have him get back into somewhat the style he was once accustomed to as part of a swindle against father and daughter american tourists guy kibbee and sheila terry. <br /><br />good thing this film has the incredibly short running time of only 57 minutes, usually those were given to b westerns because it's both tedious and melodramatic. the ending is rather unbelievable. doug knew he was in a thanksgiving special and really overacts to cover up the defects of a unbelievable story.<br /><br />what i didn't understand was that fairbanks was trained in the military profession, why didn't he just become a mercenary soldier after leaving the new soviet union? that didn't make sense to me at all.<br /><br />i'd only see this if i was a dedicated fan of any the main players.
