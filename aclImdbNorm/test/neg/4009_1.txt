it has a bit of that indie queer edge that was hip in the 90s and which places an explicit sell-by date on the visual style. characters are uniformly apathetic and farcically deadpan. street hoodlums in greece wear new clothing out of the box without creases or stains. they all appear to visit the same marine hair dresser. all uniformly exhibit the same low iq when making their dispassionate underground business deals. when things go wrong its all because they aren't real greeks - they're pastoral sunshine boys caught in a strange night city world. makes a big whine about disaffected immigrants but never bothers to actually investigate the problems with russian/kazakh/albanian cultures. if giannaris had the proper perspective on this project it might have made a wonderful bel ami production. the fleeting glimpses of toned boy-beef is the only spark in this generic small-time mobster programmer.
