this is by far the worst movie ever made. i have no doubt. i have seen such crap as manos, space mutiny, and whatnot, and i can honestly tell you that they do not hold a candle to science crazed.<br /><br />science crazed has no discirnable plot. something about a guy making a woman pregnant via turkey baster, and the child born *hours* later is fully grown, and ready to kill. of course, being a newborn, it takes him about an hour to kill people. the director loops footage constantly, and takes about fifteen minutes to set up an awkward death. there is about a page of dialogue for the whole movie, however the dialogue arrives about a minute after it is spoken.<br /><br />sample scene: the monster is walking down a hall. we know this because there is about ten minutes of looped footage of his feet. in between loops, we are treated to two women working out. repeat ad nauseum for about 20 minutes. when the monster does show up, no one moves, and everyone looks like deer in headlights as the monster takes another 10 minutes to get to them to kill them. by the level of the acting, you would guess that the people are already dead.<br /><br />i know my description doesn't seem too bad, but trust me, i can not fully describe the pain that is science crazed.<br /><br />stay away, and boycott all video stores that carry it. :)<br /><br />
