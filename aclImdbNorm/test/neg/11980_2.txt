i am a huge fan of the farcry game, huge fan. it still holds a place in my top-10 games list of all time! the story line was new, fresh... a truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on... or so i thought...<br /><br />farcry the movie is no less than another directors attempt at cashing in on a successful game franchise (see doom: the movie, and many more...).<br /><br />the video game begins as the player (jack carver) awakes in a sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an rpg from an unknown soldier. jack then finds a communication device where (harlan doyle) guides him across islands, shipwrecks, jungles, installations and volcanoes, to find his (lady friend?) (valerie constantine), all the wile battling mutated super soldiers, and genetically enhanced animals.<br /><br />the movie plays out very, very differently: 1: there's a needless 30 mins (1/3 of the movie) of "backstory" before we even get to the 'boat blowing up' scene. 2: jack then walks onto the beach, kills some goons, then drives off... nothing like the game... 3: there is no communicator with doyle on the other end... 4: the 'modified soldiers' look like albinos with singlets on... and there was no mutated 'monkey-like' creatures jumping out of the bushes. a part of the farcry game i enjoyed allot... 5: there is no sun filled beach scenes, no aircraft carrier, no communications stations on huge cliffs, little reference to any in-game contents (characters/items/vehicles), in fact no attempt to follow the story line at all. 6: the climactic volcano scene from the game is replaced with an old industrial building. 7: there's an ending scene... where everyone (except krieger) live happily ever after... what the!<br /><br />i recommend avoiding this movie at all costs! if you are a gamer, you will hate this movie will all your soul. it is a movie clearly intended for males, so girls, stay away... so if your a male, 12-29 years of age, have never played farcry, and are not disgusted by directors attempts at porting books/games to the cinema... then this is for you...
