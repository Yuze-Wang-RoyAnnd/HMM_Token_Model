although i watched this film by myself(thankfully), i still felt embarrassed while watching it. i was tricked into renting it by the reviews on the front cover, and the bloody/gritty camera stills on the back-which led me to believe it was some sort of documentary. these actors are laughable throughout the entire film, not convincing at all. the story involves an italian australian(?) gang, just fighting other gangs, and then running,fighting,repeat. supposedly they train extremely hard, which makes them way better than other gangs. for some reason i don't believe that they could actually beat up some of these other guys that are twice their size. i could be wrong... no i'm not wrong, this movie is not enjoyable on any level.the jail montage looked like it was a summer camp, just instead of kids, it was a sausage fest of horrible actors, just hanging out and laughing and trying to look hard. this movie is not worth your time, save your money, or throw it in the garbage, just don't waste it on this movie.
