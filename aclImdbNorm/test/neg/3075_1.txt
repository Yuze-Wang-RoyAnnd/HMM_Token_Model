years ago, i caught a fairly well made tv movie entitled "linda". it was made in 1973, and starred stella stevens in the femme fatale title roll. imagine my surprise when, over ten years later, i once again saw the same story unfold on late night tv. however, it was this 1993 version, starring virginia madsen. don't get me wrong, i can handle remakes, even obscure ones. but this badly written and poorly filmed retread made me feel sorry for both madsen and co-star richard thomas. unlike the original, the dialogue here is cliched, making me wonder, "why did they bother to re-write it?" second, the camera work is very heavy-handed, and the the film stock is poor. at times i felt reminded of the student film competition at the beginning of christopher guest's "the big picture". finally, the cast looks either bored (madsen) or suffering (thomas). in fact, the only one who seems like he's really enjoying the work is ted mcginley. of course, with his perfectly coifed hair and capped teeth, he's really stretching himself from his previous work on "the love boat". bottom line, to borrow a critique from opus the penguin in bloom county:<br /><br />"this movie does for film what jonestown did for kool-aid."<br /><br />thomkat
