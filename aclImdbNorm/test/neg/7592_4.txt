"house of the damned" (also known as "spectre") is one of your low budget haunted house horror flicks, filled with mediocre performances and cheap effects. it is about a family that inherits an old irish mansion, and after moving in begin to experience strange phenomenon and ghostly apparitions, including the ghost of a young girl who was murdered and buried within a wall in the mansion's basement. the couple's young daughter is then whisked away into some other dimension and they seek help from a group of paranormal investigators for help.<br /><br />the ideas this film borrowed from the 1982 haunted house film "poltergeist" are obvious. i will say that this movie does have some slightly creepy sequences, but it is sometimes very, very boring. the acting here is nothing special, the mood is alright, the score (which was mostly this dramatic irish opera music) was somewhat annoying, and the cgi special effects are really horrible. i mean, it was 1996, you would think they could have done a little better than they did. the ending where the house was on fire was the poorest special effect i've seen, very very cheap. but hey, this was a cheap movie.<br /><br />also, the translucent monster wolf thing that their daughter sees looks horribly fake. and what was it's significance in the film anyway? what the heck does a wolf-monster have to do with a haunted house? the special effects in here are what really ruined this movie. the acting was pretty bad too. i usually enjoy many low budget horror films, but not this one. "house of the damned" is nothing special at all, only consider watching it if you have nothing better to do. but you'll probably want to pass on it. 4/10.
