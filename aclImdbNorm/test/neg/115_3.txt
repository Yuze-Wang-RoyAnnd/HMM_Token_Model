i first watched this movie back in the mid/late 80's, when i was a kid. we couldn't even get all the way through it. the dialog, the acting, everything about it was just beyond lame.<br /><br />here are a few examples... imagine these spoken real dramatically, way over-acted: "oreegon? you're going to oreegon? why would anyone want to go to oreegon?"<br /><br />"survivalists? nobody ever told us about any survivalists!"<br /><br />this movie was so bad, my sister and i rented it again for her 16th birthday party, just so our friends could sit around and laugh at how awful it was. i don't think we were able to finish it then either!
