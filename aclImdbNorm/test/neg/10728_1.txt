see dick work.<br /><br />see jane work.<br /><br />dick and jane are married.<br /><br />they are successful.<br /><br />they have a son. <br /><br />they have a nice house.<br /><br />they have a latino housekeeper.<br /><br />the housekeeper teaches spanish to the son.<br /><br />the son speaks spanish.<br /><br />ha-ha.<br /><br />see dick get promoted.<br /><br />the pompous ceo is a crook.<br /><br />see dick take the fall for the pompous ceo.<br /><br />jane quits her job.<br /><br />oops.<br /><br />see dick and jane out of work.<br /><br />dick & jane turn to crime.<br /><br />as a plot device, they decide to rob the ceo.<br /><br />see the robbery get botched.<br /><br />see dick & jane fund the company's pension plan with the money from the robbery.<br /><br />yay. see the end credits.<br /><br />okay, so you've got the plot. beyond that, dick and jane careens from one scene to the next. one barely connecting with the last one or the next one. the whole thing is terribly episodic in nature. <br /><br />jim carrey didn't bother to bring his "a" material, he just seems bored and slightly ashamed of the whole thing. but heck, when you're getting paid $20 million plus, why bother. tea leoni is frantic. i guess i would be frantic not to get blamed for this flop.<br /><br />there's just something sort of off about dick & jane. carrey and leoni aren't funny and have little chemistry. the script isn't funny. and it's not well-plotted.<br /><br />but it may be bigger than that. the reality of dick and jane is, perhaps, a little too real. maybe it's just not funny for people to lose their jobs in an enron-like situation, when real-life still lacks a happy ending.
