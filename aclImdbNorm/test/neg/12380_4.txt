personally, i have no problem with the acting, nor the script. i do have a problem with the giant bird. it was simply awful. plain and simple.<br /><br />one's first impulse is the roll around laughing when one sees it. what were they thinking!? budget be damned. the monster bird was a monstrous joke.<br /><br />of course, in my opinion if the producers could obtain actors such as ankrum, corday and morrow, then they would have the special effect people come up with a much better beast. oh well. what is done is done. this will be the case of the eternal joke on them that was unintended.
