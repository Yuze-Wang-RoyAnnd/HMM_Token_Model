a movie like this makes me appreciate the work that professional actors do. i think movie-goers, in general, are a little too hard on professional actors and are ready to bash them for the most minuscule reasons. just watch a couple minutes of "cheerlader massacre," and trust me, you'll change your views. a razzie would be almost a compliment for these no-talent actors. but then again, it's a jim wynorski film. wynorski is a popular director of these ultra low-budget b-movies (having worked with roger corman on many an occasion). the problem with this movie is it actually tries to develop a plot. and when you have actors delivering lines like they're reading letters off an eye chart, how am i supposed to care? in wynorski's "bare wench 2," he didn't try to develop a plot. he simply tried to make a softcore porn/goofy takeoff on the "blair witch project." it was fun and it was titillating. "cheerleader masscare" is no fun. there are a couple obligatory female nude scenes, but they are few and far between. so it's not even worth enjoying on an erotic level. i must say, the worst scene is the one where nikki fritz walks across a bridge that's about to collapse. first of all, her character didn't have to walk across that bridge. second of all, as the bridge starts creaking, rather than try her best to run across, she just stands there and acts helpless. and top it off, we don't actually see the bridge collapse because the filmmakers made this for a budget of 2 dollars!!! unlike a lot of b-horror films, this one's actually boring. and that's what makes it the worst of all bad movies. one of the few bright spots was lunk johnson, who's probably the most natural actor in the film (though certainly no more than halfway decent). he was funny in "bare wench 2," and had some funny scenes in this movie too.
