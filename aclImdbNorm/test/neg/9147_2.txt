this version of "the magic flute" is not only the worst production of mozart's great opera that i have ever seen, it is also the worst video production i have seen of any opera.<br /><br />i'm a big opera fan and i have more opera on dvd than movies. the sets are cheap and cheesy. papageno doesn't even have a bird costume. he is just dressed like some guy. the sound is in mono. the color is really bad. it is saturated in orange. most dvd's from this period have the color digitally restored, but they did not bother with this one. also, the language has been changed to swedish instead of the original german.<br /><br />this is not a movie version of "the magic flute." it is a filmed performance and it is not a good performance and it was not filmed very well. you can pick any other available dvd of this opera and i guarantee it will be better than this one. my preference is for the version conducted by james levine with sets by david hockney.
