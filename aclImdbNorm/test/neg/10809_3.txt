ok, i read the director's comment about this movie (featured as the 'frontmost comment'), and i have to admit that i can identify with his position.<br /><br />micheal, i hope your career recovered from this particular setback and you went on to other, better things. i've seen this movie in the mst3k form. even with all the chopped continuity and snotty remarks being tossed out by the robots, i saw a potentially decent movie with an ambitious set of ideas trying to struggle out from under the limited budget and limited actors available to it. and this is one of those films ("mitchell" is another) where the mst3k crew took a lot of cheap shots at the lead character even when she actually deserved better. you know they had some unfair fun at the actress' expense because it made for a livelier episode.<br /><br />imo, the fact that the movie actually tried to be about something, and had a few decent, effective moments here and there, should keep it out of the 'bottom 100' ("tangents/time chasers" is another movie with a plot and a heart that doesn't deserve to be there either).<br /><br />but it is still not a very good movie. i don't blame the writer/lead actress for being who she is. it's just that her acting and writing skills needed a few more years to mature before she could pull off a vanity project such as this or carry a feature film. the writing and characterization is amateurish and slapdash, and the dialog is often barely up to abc afterschool special standards. the cast sincerely gives it their best effort, and the acting in general is definitely head-and-shoulders above abortions like "future war" or "space mutiny", but there aren't any really professional level performances here, with the exception of 'big joe' estevez, who is hammy but suitably intense. i never saw the full original cut, but mst's sampling of "soultaker" was representative enough to make these facts plain.<br /><br />oh, and the film has robert z'dar in it. that is, imo, a real 'kiss of death' for any movie that hopes to be taken seriously. yes, he's big and scary looking in his role, but i just hate the guy as an actor. (in real life, i wish him well and hope he is financially comfortable).<br /><br />there were little things i liked about the film. for instance, the camaraderie between the male lead and his dead buddy added some warmth and humor to the movie and made it a lot more watchable. the idea of an elevator in the hospital that opened its doors to the afterlife was an inspired way to invoke some spooky vibes without springing for special effects, and i respected whoever worked that into the script in attempt to keep the budget manageable. it didn't really work, but it might have with just a little more tweaking.<br /><br />so anyway, mr. rissi, better luck with your other projects - your involvement with this misfire wouldn't keep me from watching something else you did if the 'buzz' was good. and ms. miller has nothing to be ashamed of - she was young and ambitious, and the movie wasn't that bad.
