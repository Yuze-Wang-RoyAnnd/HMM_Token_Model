i like underdogs. so, 12 years after having first seen star trek v, and thinking it was bizarrely bad, i gave it a second watch, hoping i would find some redeeming quality which i missed the first time around.<br /><br />i didn't.<br /><br />the writing is half-baked, and although at first the quality of the acting is stable enough to keep the movie on its feet (albeit shakily), the further we get into the plot the sillier it gets. the last quarter of the film is just plain ridiculous. what was even worse, from the original cast's pov, is that this was the first st movie to be released after the franchise returned to television with next generation, and the average episode of next generation would put this to shame* - including the special effects! what an embarrassment.<br /><br />the final frontier isn't thoroughly wretched - i gave it 4 out of 10 - but it's so far below the standard of its predecessors (yes, including the first one) that the only reason i can think of to watch it is because you'll appreciate the other movies more.<br /><br />* unless it's an episode with troi's mother in it.
