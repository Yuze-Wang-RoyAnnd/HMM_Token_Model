'it's supposed to have got good reviews' says the g/f. if so, i can't find them. she goes off to sleep and i endure. michael douglas as a good ol' boy - now there's a new one. matt dillon all screwed up. john goodman losing his cool. paul reiser running around in bdsm leather. oh it's a riot all right.<br /><br />the hitch is you're probably going to lose interest pretty soon on. liv tyler plays the femme fatale and critics complain she might not have the register for her part. but it's immaterial: this movie is not about character development. in fact i'd go so far as to say there's no character at all. what you're supposed to appreciate here is the plot.<br /><br />no one is 'bad' in this movie. some people wonder why all these 'stars' - reba's even in here for goodness sake - sign up for such a junky project. odds are they thought it would be fun. maybe they did have fun. who knows? hey - maybe they got paid good too.<br /><br />but you have to fork over money one way or another to see this turkey. and that's probably not a good idea.
