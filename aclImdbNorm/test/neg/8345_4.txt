volcano is set in los angeles where a minor earthquake has just hit, vacationing boss of the o.e.m. (the offcie of emergency management) mike roark (tommy lee jones) decides to cut his holiday short & go in, once there he sees that everything is alright but then drives off to the epicentre of the quake where seven underground workers have been killed by a fire or intense heat of some kind. mike isn't sure what to think so he brings geologist dr. amy barnes (anne heche) in to try & explain things, unfortunately a huge underground river of molten lava has been released after the quake & erupts at the la brea tar pits sending the lava pouring out into the city streets engulfing anything & everything it touches in flames. mike, his men & the emergency services have their work cut out trying to stop the river of lava & save as many lives as possible...<br /><br />directed by mick jackson this was the second big budget disaster flick revolving around the idea of an erupting volcano during 1997 with dante's peak (1997) being released a mere two months or so before volcano was & while dante's peak is hardly any sort of masterpiece at least it's slightly better & more plausible than volcano is. the script here is total nonsense & is not based in reality at all, underground rivers of lava that seem to appear & then disappear just as quick, various character's standing inches from a river of lava yet not being affected by the heat (when that guy is on the train the metal seats around him start melting but he remains perfectly fine, as far as i am aware human skin is not as heat resistant as metal, is it?) & it constantly happens, helicopters flying is clouds of ash (in reality it would be impossible), one simple blockade at the end of a street will stop the flowing lava (what about down the other streets & other directions?), being able to blow a perfect trench in a street & then blowing a huge building up to make a massive dam & when kelly sees the lava heading towards her car she gets out just like anyone would but then for some reason just stands there & watches two firemen get burned to death & waits for her dad to save her even though by this stage her leg has caught fire, despite all those concrete blocks being placed together to make a barrier in less than twenty minutes the guy's do such a great job not one bit of molten lava manages to seep through & loads more besides like that massive building falling on tommy lee & his daughter yet then both being fine afterwards. the character's are awful too although they were not as clich'ed as usual with no romance blossoming between tommy lee & anne heche & minimal city official's who try to shut tommy lee & anne heche up before the event labelling them scaremongers. there's a few badly written & at times embarrassing moral moments as los angeles pulls together, the black guy & that semi racist cop who warm to each other & by the end are wishing each other well & that little kid at the end when he says 'everyone looks the same' is cringe worthy & is surely a ham-fisted attempt & trying to say whatever colour we are we are still human beings & we can all get along in time of a crisis as it brings people together. having said that i think volcano is one of those so bad it's good films, it entertains & it moves along at a decent pace but just don't expect anything grounded in reality or any human drama either.<br /><br />i suppose a film like volcano could be seen as an updating of a 70's disaster film such as the poseidon adventure (1972) or earthquake (1974) but on a huge budget with modern effects work. speaking of the effects they are alright but none stand out that much & the set-pieces are also surprisingly forgettable, sure there are a few impressive explosions & a few ok river of lava flowing through los angeles effects but little else. generally volcano just isn't very exciting & while occasionally unintentionally funny & completely ridiculous it doesn't really work in the way the makers intended.<br /><br />with a supposed budget of about $90,000,000 it opened to a little under $15,000,000 at the box-office, it looks alright & there's lots of fire but nothing stands out & volcano is a pretty forgettable film overall. filmed in los angeles i think most of the places featured here were shot at their real life locations. the cast go through the motions with some terrible dialogue & ridiculous set-pieces to contend with, tommy lee jones deserves better than this.<br /><br />volcano is a bit of a disaster in both senses, it is a disaster themed film that ended up a bit of disaster itself. worth it for a few unintentional laughs & the ridiculousness of it all but it's nothing great & i doubt i would ever want to see it again.
