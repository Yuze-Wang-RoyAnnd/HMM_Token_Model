i saw a great clip of this film, which i'll talk about later, and then the cast list, and thought i might as well give it a go. basically, a down-on-his-luck bartender, randy (matt dillon), his cocky cousin carl harding (paul reiser) and murder investigation detective dehling (john goodman) all have something in common, they have seen the girl of their dreams (whether married or not), and they would do anything to please and be with her, even die. all three met/saw her "one night at mccool's", the bar that randy worked at, they have no knowledge of each other, but all three cannot stop thinking of femme fetale jewel valentine (the lord of the rings' liv tyler). all three are telling their stories to someone they hope will listen to their pretty intense and revealing stories, randy talks to hit-man mr. burmeister (michael douglas, who co-produced the film), carl to psychologist/psychiatrist dr. green (reba mcentire) and dehling to priest father jimmy (richard jenkins). they confess all details of what they have been willing to do, their sexual contact with her, and eventually they are all brought together in one place, all intent on being with her, and all involved with the final shootout that leaves one dead, one running away (and eventually dying) and one stunned, and the unexpected guy she chooses (but at the same time obvious, cos it's sex-obsessed douglas). also starring andrew dice clay as utah/elmo and sandy martin as bingo vendor woman. if i had to pick a favourite moment, it would definitely be what was mentioned at number 11 along with cool hand luke on the 100 greatest sexy moments, where tyler copycats the woman washing the car with suds all over herself, and in front of goodman, very sexy! apart from that, not the most memorable film. okay!
