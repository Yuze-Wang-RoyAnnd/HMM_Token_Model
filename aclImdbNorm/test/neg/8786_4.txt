i rented this when it came out on video cassette in 1995. after rewatching it again,my idea about it hasn't changed much.<br /><br />i was an adult then and i'm still an adult now!lol<br /><br />the illogical elements mentioned by other reviewers didn't bother me. this isn't a documentary,it's a fantasy story where animals can talk!<br /><br />while i didn't care for much of the songs,i liked the one at the end of the picture where it's sang by barry manilow and another person.<br /><br />some people seem to make an excuse for it's primitive animation by saying that cgi wasn't used often in animated features but let's not forget that the lion king was released about a year earlier and that packed possibly more excellence than any animated feature that came before it!!<br /><br />but i think it's pretty fair to say that the pebble and the pingoin was made on the cheap while the lion king wasn't....<br /><br />the high points for me in 1995 as well as today is the suspense generated by the few dangerous(mostly) underwater chase scenes.<br /><br />i also liked the opening scene which takes place on a music notes page and a little bit of the love story. but most of the time,the story dragged on and was boring.<br /><br />worth a look if you like animation but if you're an adult and not a risk taker,go get another walt disney production instead of this!
