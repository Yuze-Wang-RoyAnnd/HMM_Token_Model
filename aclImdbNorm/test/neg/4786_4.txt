it seems like people are attracted to shows that showcase pathetic lives that have no purpose what-so-ever. to me i give my sincerity to nbc for their dire efforts to make new changes in television, making laugh track free shows. they seem to always find big success, like the office. when i first started to watch it seemed to me that it could have potential to be a smash hit. but after a couple of episodes, i really felt like going to church and donating every penny in my entire bank to pathetic people showcased in these lowlife, poor, disgraceful areas. and the end where they show earl and the brother in bed together, it just seems to me that this show is trying to show the bad side of life, like street beggars or people who struggle to pay the rent and have no sense of what the real world of normal people in society are like. i just seem to always be disgusted when i watch the filth the people in this show live in. it's like venice beach in california, beautiful but so many hobos. believe me i'm no rich guy, middle class, and not a clean freak either, a bit sloppy, but it just seems to me that the show just can't seem to get off of all the gruesome, schmuck people out there who have one leg. i just wish that they would show a little more class, not all filth and poorness and trailers and just below average life, it just seems to depress me. to me this show is nothing more than a showcase of what not to do in life, what not to be. it also shows me that education is the most important thing you can have because apparently these two don't have an ounce of smarts. this is a schmuck-u-mentary.
