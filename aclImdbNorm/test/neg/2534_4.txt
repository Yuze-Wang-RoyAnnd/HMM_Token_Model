this movie starts off promisingly enough, but it gets a little to convoluted and caught up in its stylistic charm. the set designs, costumes, and music were wonderful- as close to perfect as one can get. but the more i got into the movie, the more i felt like all this effort was for the director's entertainment, not the audience. although, i loved looking at it, except for a few brief musical scenes, i can't say i enjoyed it. the director shows enormous imagination, but if he had fun with this film, he failed to share that with the audience, or at least with me. i didn't get a sense of whimsy and i didn't get sucked into this universe.<br /><br />a big cause of this was (surprisingly) zhang ziyi. you can tell she's trying very hard, but she seems to have been so miscast that she comes off almost amateurish. she's a capable actress but she has her limitations. i've noticed in her acting, that she has yet to truly react to her fellow co-stars, a flaw that creates a void of chemistry. the language barrier in this film seems to have only exacerbate matters. she and odagiri act as if they're on separate planets. she's also not a very good singer which made me cringe every time she sang, but thankfully there weren't too many scenes of that. odagiri was ok but doesn't make much of an impression.<br /><br />i didn't even care for the characters separately. there really is a sore lack of characterization. the only reason to care about them seems to be that they're good-looking royalty. without the compelling love story at the center of the film though, it's hard to care what happens. the film also takes detours into minor scenes that added nothing to the story and was actually distracting. i had to rewind because after going into a subplot i couldn't remember what the heck they we're doing in the main storyline. there were also scenes where it was hard to tell what the action occurring was because it was so stylized.<br /><br />mostly i'm just disappointed because i really like the concept behind this and there are a lot of things i do like. the music and dance choreography are really great.the supporting performances are uniformly excellent, fantastic in both the acting aspect and the singing. it's just too bad the lead actors were so bland.
