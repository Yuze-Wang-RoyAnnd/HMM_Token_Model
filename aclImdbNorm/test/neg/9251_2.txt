this was shown on a premium channel, so i didn't realise it was made for tv. even so, i like some of the movies on lifetime (lifestyle here in uk), but this was awful. the family were so cheesy, "love you mum" "love you even more honey" then after they were broken into for the second time, 10 mins later, they were at it again, "love you mum" big cheesy smiles etc... she phones her husband, and tells him not to bother coming home. they were only broken into by a guy that wanted them dead, have a nutter living next door, who needs help? she has her teenage daughter and a cat (not for long) to look after her.<br /><br />however, as a comedy, i'd give it a good 7. i might even show it to my friends next time i have them round. could be great fun after a bottle of vodka or 10!
