i don't care what anyone says, this movie is hilarious! it combines the bleak seriousness of threads with an anarchic blend of alternative comedy, and the results are a severely dark, but outrageously funny satire on the brinkmanship policies of both the western and eastern blocs at the time. you gotta give the filmmakers credit for even attempting to top the real life lunacy of "duck and cover" or "protect and survive"!<br /><br />imagine someone made a movie based on the dead kennedys track 'kinky sex makes the world go round', and you're pretty close to whoops! apocalypse. add rik mayall on top form as an insanely ott sas commander and you've got it exactly. a worthy companion piece to dr strangelove, and that's saying something.
