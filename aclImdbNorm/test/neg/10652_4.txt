i just purchased this movie because i love to donate to operation smile, the charity on which the movie was based...but i found the writing of the movie to be very strange. it t does not really focus so much on operation smile or similar organizations like the smile train and their herculean efforts to relieve the suffering of children born with facial deformities in third world countries. no, it concentrates on an american teenage volunteer, katie, whose "over-privileged" life in malibu, california, includes a mother who brings her to a doctor so that she'll have birth control pills in her before she sleeps with her boyfriend. what is this birth control nonsense supposed to do, titillate the audience? it's 2005. i'd be more surprised if in 2005 a malibu teen wasn't on birth control, and even if she is, so what and who cares? contrasting katie is the character of lin in china, a girl with a facial deformity who missed last year's chance to get an operation and this year does not want to have one. neither character is written in such a way that the audience can really identify with, let alone understand the motivations of, either girl. on the other hand, the actors do an adequate job of trying to play the bad hand they were dealt by whoever wrote this ridiculous script. the best performance was by the gentleman playing lin's father although much of his dialogue is in chinese and subtitled. operation smile deserved to be honored by a much better movie than this!
