as a true lover of film i must advise you to avoid this appalling effort,, god knows how funding was approved, seriously this is one cinematic experience which delivers zero dramatic tension and plods along until nothing happens again and again and again ,, the only connectivity is two scares which at least keep you awake possiby the worst film i have ever witnessed and the acting by the female lead is bordering on criminal intent. one blessing with modern technology you can fast forward and watch it on 12x and it will only last 25 minutes, ,, and you won't miss any of the plot<br /><br />no idea how people find this at all interesting and some are giving it high marks !
