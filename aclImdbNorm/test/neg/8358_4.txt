i found it almost impossible to empathize with ricci's character in this film. if she was supposed to be a depressive, i think the screenwriter and director neglected to research depressives before making this film because ricci's character was more a depiction of a self-centered, worthless sh!tbag than a victim and survivor of depression.<br /><br />the forced attempt at introspective narration was as ludicrous as the pained interactions between her and the people around her. <br /><br />sorry but i couldn't buy it. this is straight to video schlock. i'm glad i didn't pay to see this.
