as a kid, i never understood why anyone would watch this very crappy show. it was pretty stupid and i always wanted spridle and jim-jim to get in some sort of fatal accident (they were that annoying).<br /><br />now, almost 40 years later, i have a new attitude about the cartoon. while i still think it was complete crap, this is only in regard to the american version of the show. that's because i was reading a book about anime and found out that the shows we watched growing up were completely different from those originally shown in japan. you see, the idiots in charge of syndicating the series thought it was too violent so they cut this out of the episodes. that's bad enough, but what else they did is beyond belief--they actually chopped the episodes apart and spliced them together to create shows that were nothing like the originals! for example, one episode might be made up of parts of episodes 3, 6, 18 and 27! as a result, i really don't know if the original show really was bad--it might have been brilliant. but who can tell considering all we have to watch is this americanized mess!?
