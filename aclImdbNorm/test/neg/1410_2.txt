i was kinda looking forward to man of the year, a couple girls at my work said it was a pretty good movie, and my mom said that she liked it, so i waited for the rental, and watched it last night. i have to honestly say that this movie was a huge disappointment. i barely made through it, because to be honest the beginning was pretty good and very well paced, but then it got too dark and not into the movie i saw from the trailer. it looked like a good comedy, then it turned into a very dark drama, that wasn't even that interesting, considering how many of these types of stories we've had about government conspiracy.<br /><br />tom dobbs is a very popular comedian with a top ranks show and has an act where many people would want him to get involved with politics, just because it seems like he has a good grip on what should be improved. so he does it, he runs for presidency, but many people doubt that he can win due to the fact that he's a comedian, but he does win! but elenore green who makes sure all the votes are accounted for tries to fix a computer glitch, but when the government tells her not to fix it, they try to get rid of her, and tom soon realizes that this may not be the job he wanted.<br /><br />the acting was fine, the direction was ok, it was just the story that didn't work in my opinion. like i said, it just turned into a dramatic change of genres, because if you see the trailer, you'd think it was a comedy, and when you start watching it, that's what you get, but then it just turns into a very dark and somewhat scary drama. i wouldn't really recommend this movie, it was one of the biggest disappointments i have seen so far.<br /><br />2/10
