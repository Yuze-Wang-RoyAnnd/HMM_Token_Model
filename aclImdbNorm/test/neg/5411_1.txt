to be honest, the movie was so horrible that i loved it. never in my life have a seen such a terrible movie. i was in shock. i mean, i don't even know what to say.<br /><br />the characters couldn't even keep their own guns, one minute a guy had an m16 and his friend had an mp5, then in the next scene they switched guns. (don't ask, trust me i know my guns)and i will never understand how they got from a place that looked like vietnam, to an arizona highway, to my backyard, and then to a chemical plant in california, that is what i took from it.<br /><br />why would you be afraid of a guy in a halloween mask wearing a trash bag for a cape and shot plastic arrows at you? how is that frightening? i wanted to swallow arsenic halfway through the movie. i love how the "skeleton man" randomly decided to go on a killing spree at that particular day. but hey, whoever made this movie should be shot in the knees and fed to a mound of fire ants.<br /><br />good day.
