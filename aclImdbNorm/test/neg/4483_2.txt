ok, let's start with the good: nice scenery, channing tatum is easy to look at, amanda seyfried has nice hair, that's about it. how much of this movie went on the editing room floor? probably the plot, action, good dialogue, and point. terrible acting, horrible choppy dialogue. let me tell you how bad it is: my friend who always cries at movies got to the part that was meant to evoke tears, and she laughed so hard we thought she was crying! the movie seems to want to take a stab at too many issues- war, loss, autism, cancer, but fails so miserably to cover any one topic satisfactorily. make sure you have something to munch on and your cell phone to return text messages!
