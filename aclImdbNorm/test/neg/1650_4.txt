frantic, somewhat mean spirited, infantile humor abounds in this city boy turned wannabe farmer tale. it is not outrageous enough to appeal to the will ferrell crowd, and not interesting enough to carry the feature length. the most i can praise "son in law" would be to say that for the most part it avoids toilet humor. the main problem is that all of the characters lack warmth, and pauly shore is so abrasive that he is a most unlikable hero. there are a few amusing bits involving farm animals, and that's about it. the story, what there is, is so simplistic and predictable, it makes "jury duty" seem like "gone with the wind". - merk
