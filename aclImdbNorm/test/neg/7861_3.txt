during the 1990's, several attempts have been made to revive old matsumoto's series. yoshinobu nishizaki tried to revive old yamato saga in form of a laughably bad "yamato 2520", which was completely abandoned after mere two episodes. captain harlock suffered a confusing and pointless "harlock saga", while galaxy express 999 suffered having this hack of a movie stapled to its name.<br /><br />if you've seen "queen millennia", you'll recall that it was a wonderful movie in its own way. maetel legend tries to tell a sequel to this already concluded chapter, also finding a way to suck at doing so.<br /><br />this movie takes all the annoying aspects of a generic pulp science fiction movie, mixes it with badly paced melodrama, and to add an insult to an injury, tosses in some of the most renowned characters from matsumoto's universe.<br /><br />the only redeeming aspect of this movie is good artwork, but the remainder is so amazingly bad that it can't save this movie from being a total loss.<br /><br />if you've enjoyed queen millennia or galaxy express, do yourself a favor and skip this hack of a movie. you'll thank me.
