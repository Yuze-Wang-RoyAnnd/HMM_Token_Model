i have been a rabid star trek fan since 1966. still am. one thing i learned from star trek is that the special effects are secondary to the characters. encounter at farpoint fails in its mission.<br /><br />superbly produced.<br /><br />poorly directed, written, acted. d.c. fontana really blew this one. this episode is so embarrassing the master tape should be burned.<br /><br />the first half of the first season didn't fare much better.
