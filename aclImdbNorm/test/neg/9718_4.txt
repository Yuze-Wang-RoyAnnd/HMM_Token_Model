think 'charmed' with testosterone instead of estrogen and you get the general idea for this picture. a very lame story with mediocre effects and an anti-climax ending to let the door open for a part 2. let's hope someone has the sense to spend their money wiser. i'd suggest a 'charmed - the movie' because compared to this 'charmed' kicked ass and i only watched that show to please my girlfriend!!!! wait and watch it on dvd on a rainy sunday when you've got nothing better to do. or better yet download it so you don't waste your money. the first 15 minutes were alright. but the funniest line from the movie and also the only highlight of this movie is when reid says : "kiss my ass harry potter", while driving of a cliff. although they are not worthy to kiss potter's ass, because potter is way cooler and at least his movies have a story. the goblet of fire was even scarier than this!!!
