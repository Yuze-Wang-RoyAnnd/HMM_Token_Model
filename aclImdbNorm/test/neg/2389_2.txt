on paper this movie has some chops: a street kid overcoming past trauma, rebuilding his life and succeeding when the world would have written him off. great stuff, everyone loves a happy ending.<br /><br />in the theater though, there were some omissions that left the movie dead inside. the dialog was hollow and uninteresting, the characters were almost cartoonish in their lack of dimension and complexity, and why did everyone need to be gay? i have nothing against homosexual themes or characters in a movie but when it's used in this fashion not only is is offensive to homosexuals, it trivializes the lifestyle and cheapens the movie. if the story works without this cheap trick it should have been cut.<br /><br />every character seemed to come out of the same cookie cutter form: each had one major flaw and one minor flaw, every character is good hearted were they succeed or not, and everyone one of them had or is in an abusive relationship with someone.<br /><br />the most annoying fact of the movie is that they never let you get over that the name "pip" comes from great expectations. they give it to you once and that should be enough. the story shares enough with the dickens classic to make this fact obvious.<br /><br />the most interesting part of the film is the story of the grandfather and the cassette he leaves for pip and how pip, the main character, learns how to grow up from the lessons learned from the tape. in the end, with lessons learned, pip confronts his dark past and movies forward with his life.
