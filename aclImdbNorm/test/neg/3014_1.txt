after having seen this show a few times; i am thoroughly offended as a female that there are so many stupid, women out there that fall for this bullshit. im a little more mature than some of the "players" in this show, but am still appalled that the whole dating game has been boiled down to a gameshow: where goofy dudes can score points on their lame ass attempts to pick up chicks. if young guys are watching this and using it as a learning manual: don't!!!. save yourself the effort and hire a prostitute if all you are after is a piece of ass. maybe there are girls out there with the same mind set;but some how i don't think so.
