while this isn't an all time classic comedy it is a pretty good little movie to watch if you catch it on a rainy saturday morning with not a lot else going on right then.<br /><br />harold lloyd plays ezekiel cobb, an american coming home after growing up in china where his dad was a missionary.he has come home from china to find an american wife and plans to return to china to continue his father's work.cobb unwittingly is recruited to run for mayor of his corrupt home town when the existing political machine that controls the town realizes that he would make a perfect patsy to run against the current mayor who also is the head of the town's underworld.they figure the bumbling ,stumbling cobb has no chance to win and therefore the current mayor continues to run the town and run his schemes which makes them all rich.<br /><br />lloyd isn't doing the physical comedy here like he did in his silent films.he does a convincing portrayal of cobb with a reserved understated dignity.the acting was good from all involved and the story and script were also quite good.<br /><br />being made in 1934 the film does have some rather racist language when talking about the chinese and it also has a typical black character from that era but these stereotypes aren't nearly as mean as i've seen from other films from that time.<br /><br />although not close to being lloyd's best film ,this movie does entertain and lloyd is very good as cobb.you won't be blown away by this film but it may be enough to peak your interest in lloyd and make you want to see more of his work.
