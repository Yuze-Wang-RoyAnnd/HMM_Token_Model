i watched this movie for the hot guy--and even he sucked! he was the worst one--well, okay, i have to give props to that freaky police officer rapist guy too, he was even worse. the guy wasn't that cute in the end, he had the most terrible accent, and he was the most definite definition of hicksville idiot that can't stand up to his mom for the one he "loves" there's ever been. overall, and if this makes any sense to you, when i go to pick up movies at the video store, i think to myself as i read the back of a movie that looks so/so, "well, at least it can't be worse than carolina moon." the most terrible movie, and the most terrible writing, acting, plot--everything in it made my gag reflexes want to do back flips. it was the most horrid movie i will ever see, with gabriela way up there too. i hated it, and trust me, if there was any number under 1 imdb had for rating, i'd choose that in a heartbeat.
