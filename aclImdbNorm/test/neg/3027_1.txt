begotten is, no doubt, someone's attempt at originality, but, what we have here is art in its most morbid, grotesque form, so, for that, begotten has my respect, but, to be realistic, it makes no difference what this abomination is about, but for the record...<br /><br />in the ultimate in incoherent horror, we begin in an unknown time, in an unknown place. right off the bat, we are plunged into the psychotic nightmare that is begotten, a god is, seemingly depressed, mutilating himself with a razor, i mean, really trying like hell to end it all, it takes a while (why wouldn't it?) after this ultra-morbid introduction, something is happening, something is rising from the corpse, say hello to mother earth. what does she do? well, she gives birth to a thing. the thing would have probably preferred to stay in the womb, but that's life. the psychotic nightmare realm of begotten welcomes the thing the only way it knows how. the thing, along with mother earth is mutilated by unknown, hooded, assailants, with evil intentions being the only clarity available. from this point on, things drag as they've never dragged before. interesting, grim images, with a totally decent soundtrack, is the high points of the remainder. not to give the impression that i don't recommend this evilness, because i do, but only once, and only for people with an appreciation for the dark side.<br /><br />from my description, it may appear that i don't "get" begotten. trust me, i get it, and yes, begotten is art if i've ever seen it. everything in this film, regardless of how unrelated it may seem, is significant. that, perhaps, is the only thing that makes begotten art. with that said, most of us require some form of entertainment value, and this is coming from someone who enjoyed the chooper. probably the most intriguing first five minutes, i've seen in a film, but let's be realistic, the next 7 hours and 55 minutes would put one in a coma, that is, unless it's just meant for some kind of psychedelic purposes, in that case, never mind. but, how would one rate such a uniquely boring masterpiece? depending on how much your attention span can take, it should be either 1 or 10, any other number just wouldn't make a statement. it hurts to do this, but as far as entertainment value goes, begotten just ain't it. 1/1
