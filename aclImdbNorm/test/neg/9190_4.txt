this film basically try to portray the heroism of firefighters by making the whole movie revolve around a american dad with a good heart that puts others before himself. now i know they try to show jack morrison(joaquin phoenix) as a typical american father that is a firefighter but like there is just nothing interesting in about him what so ever, thus when the movie gets to the climax there is just little to no emotion. this movie basically tries to make the life of a firefighter exciting but it just comes off as boring as any other jobs except you save lives or property by extinguishing the fire. john travolta plays the captain of the fire station but anyone could have played his role and he is a dull character as the rest of the film. what could have been a good film is that the firefighter are put way up as heroes because they are firemen and turns the whole scenario into a uninteresting melodrama.<br /><br />4.9/10
