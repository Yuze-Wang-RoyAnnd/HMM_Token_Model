seeing the names of the starring actors (statham, snipes and phillippe) i thought that the movie should at least be decently funny or interesting. instead all i got from it was not just boring 92 minutes, but the frustration of knowing everything that was about to happen, and hearing tons of lame and shabby "bad cop" phrases.<br /><br />the main problem is that the movie doesn't have a good story to begin with. and when you have that, than no one can help you, not statham, not wesley snipes...not even john mcclane could save this movie :-) it could be cool for the kids, if they aren't over 12 years of age, because they don't care so much about the story, and there are some big explosions in the movie.
