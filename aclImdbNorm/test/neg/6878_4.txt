i never intended to see venom, but i caught it on cable. it does have good elements. the louisiana swamp atmosphere for one, something we will unfortunately not see so much of in movies because of hurricane katrina. it is based on an interesting concept, a regular man imbued with the spirits of evil. his confrontation with his son could have been interesting, as could much of the movie. but as tends to happen in hollywood, an interesting idea goes down a familiar direction: <br /><br />kill off all the characters save the good girl, starting with the black guys. i'm a fan of agnes bruckner, but the other characters, the villain's afore-mentioned son, cece who must become a voodoo priestess, are more interesting. and for the love of god, just once i would like to see the virgin get killed. we all like the easy girl, why can't she live? in this case it was bijou phillips, and we love her.<br /><br />the ending made no sense considering what had been established about the villain's invincibility. all the carnage and atmosphere, and it leads to nothing.
