i don't know where to begin. perhaps the whole idea of this movie was just a disaster waiting to happen. there is nothing slightly humorous about a kidnapping. i don't know what was more offensive--the subject matter or david arquette's "performance". it was like watching a bull get it's penis cut off, although i think the bull felt better afterwards. the filmmakers should find something about sinatra other than his son's kidnapping to show (like, i don't know, his talent as a singer!!!!). his family shouldn't have to relive that horror. thank god it was just shown on hbo and not released in theaters. please don't watch this if you have any self respect.
