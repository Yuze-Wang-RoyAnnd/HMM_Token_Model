i was in this movie as an extra in the dallas filming in july 1975. some of the things you see today,and take for granted in movie making, were implemented in this movie. the movie premise, the costumes, the special effects, the acting. it all was ahead of its time. it opened the door for movies such as "star wars," the "terminator," the "matrix," and "x-men" movies. now people look at it and they say, "well this does not add up to this new special effects story..." it did not have any computer graphics and such as the new movies do these days. it did have a story, and a wonderful cast, and a hell of a director! the places it was filmed like the dallas' world trade center, and the zale building,and the ft. worth water gardens were at that time the most modern and futuristic backdrops in which to film. the director michael anderson was very creative and he tried to show a perfect future that was flawed by human desires and frailty's. it was my first film experience, the first of six films i have been in. just because it was filmed in texas does not make it any less a wonderful piece of filmmaker's art. watch it again and appreciate it more. this movie was the foundation that set the standard for many great films that we now enjoy. well, my hand is blinking... i got to run. santuary awaits...
