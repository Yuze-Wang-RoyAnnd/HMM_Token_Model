we sought out this hard-to-find vhs after watching two excellent merchant-ivory pictures back to back. knowing it was an instant box office failure, a failure as a rental, i thought it might be worth seeing anyway based on m-i's reputation. too bad! nine years ago, it was very much a liberal agenda objective to trash the founding fathers and indeed they had some success in eradicating the founding fathers from many american classrooms including, for example, new jersey; whose eradication of our great founders quickly ended when the washington times shone the spotlight of truth into the nj school board and their subversive deed. a small part of this was headlining the alleged sally hemmings-thomas jefferson connection, disregarding the inconvenient dna findings which failed to support the wacky left's agenda. never mind! they got james ellis, an author of dubious reputation, to put it in a book, and columbia university sealed the deal by giving ellis a pulitzer.<br /><br />as to jefferson in paris, the liberal agenda spin begins in the opening scene wherein james earl jones is claiming to be the son of jefferson. the spin simply continues in flashback mode to paris. the unmistakable truth is that even if a person assumes the lie is true the hemmings allegation would be an insignificant detail into the larger matter of jefferson's prolonged and vital diplomatic mission to paris (as well as to the netherlands where he secured crucial financial backing for america when our infant nation was without funds).<br /><br />besides the liberal spin job, there is nothing else of interest in this drab and tortuously dull movie. some of the other history is indeed accurate --- adding credence to frame the lie --- but this movie takes one of the most interesting moments in american history and reduces it to a remedy for insomnia.<br /><br />please do not ask me why liberals set out to trash the founding fathers, because i don't waste time explaining the acts of such people. don't ask them either; they usually respond to such questions with the same answer: "shut up!"
