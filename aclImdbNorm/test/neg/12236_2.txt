there was nothing remotely funny about this movie. it makes fun of various sports movies and clich'es but nothing about it is remotely funny. most of the movies they parody doesn't even fit in with the film and are really only their so they can be in it. non the main actor was well cast in it but that's really the only good thing about this film. also the various cameos in it were kind of cool to see but i have no idea why they would waste their time being in this piece of garbage. thank goodness i only spent $4 on it as this is not something worth spending money on. only watch if you have absolutely nothing to do or just want to waste an hour and 30 minutes.
