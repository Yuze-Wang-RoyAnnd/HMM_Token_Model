awful in a bad/good way...this movie has officially become the worst "made for tv movie" in my book...except for the camp value it offers, i give it a 1 in quality and a 10 for the camp value. suggestion: watch with friends, champagne and plenty of popcorn...you'll want to throw some at the screen! preferably friends who like chris noth from his 'sex in the city days'...this movie is dreadfully funny. this is definitely the lowest point in the careers of all cast members...honestly, i don't know how they controlled the laughter as the lines were delivered! daniel j. travanti is absolutely pathetic. everyone participated in the school of over acting; and poor joan van ark, i believe she was the only one taking this theater of the absurd seriously...she is credited as a producer though. her "mom" jeans and bad plastic surgery are scene stealer's. this movie also crosses the oh so delicate line of social incorrectness when they introduce a mentally challenged character into the plot. this is an obscure movie showing on lifetime listed as {with harmful intent}....has anyone else had the pleasure?
