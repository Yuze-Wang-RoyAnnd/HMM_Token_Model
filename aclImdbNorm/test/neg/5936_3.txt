based on the 2007 spy novel by david ignatius, body of lies tells the story of a cia operative roger ferris (dicaprio) who is sent to jordan to track down an al-qaeda mastermind, all the while treading a narrow tightrope of loyalty to his jordanian hosts and his manipulative american boss ed hoffman (crowe).<br /><br />anybody who's seen the trailers could be forgiven for thinking the story revolves around double-agent action and the betrayal of ferris by hoffman, but the actual story is much more mundane. instead we are served a tepid broth of ridiculous subterfuge as white pretty boy american ferris moves with virtual impunity through the teeming streets of amman jordan with nary a worried look over his shoulder or the attraction of attention from the locals. only during a scene where ferris takes his new-found iranian sweetheart out for tea does reality intrude as the couple are bombarded with glares from jordanian men.<br /><br />compounding the film's problems are plot twists and turns which seem designed as nothing more than padding. ferris flies to jordan, ferris gets expelled from jordan, ferris flies to washington, ferris flies to the uk, ferris flies back to jordan, hoffman flies to jordan, hoffman returns home to take care of his kids
