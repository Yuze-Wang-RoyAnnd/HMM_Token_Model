....you get this stupid excuse of a child's play rip-off! man, what were they thinking? first they mess with a rumpelstiltskin horror movie then they make crap like this. fariy tale haters! well to be honest, i've seen this as a kid, and it scared me a bit a lot, simply because i was under aged with the assumption that pinocchio wouldn't do that, wah wah wah. but i've grown and come to think of this as child's play rip, a fairy tale bashing nonsense, and a lame tales from the crypt episode, or trying to be one at least, with a lame ending that was stupid, and it had many plot holes, and i still can't understand how it came to life. was it the work of an evil geppetto? then what, after a few evil deeds, he becomes a real boy who becomes america's most wanted? personally, i think the concept of an evil geppetto sounds better, he builds an army of wooden killers, and starts a crime wave, funny. but this is awful, awful, awful, awful, awful! awful! stinky like a shoe, and awful! it sucked it sucked! if you want killer puppets, settle for the killer doll, specifically child's play, instead, no strings attached. or if you want a fairy tale figure turned upside down, watch leprechaun, or if you want pinocchio, watch the animated disnet version or live version with jonathan taylor thomas and martin landau instead. >>>>> -10/10(negative 10)
