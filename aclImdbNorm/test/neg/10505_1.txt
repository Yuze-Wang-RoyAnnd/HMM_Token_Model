this movie has got to go down in the history of bad movies as the worst one i've ever seen. it wasn't even a bad b movie...i would have rated it at as a z. the special effects were ridiculous...err if you could even call them special effects. i think the reviewer before hit the nail on the head...it was the box that sold the movie, while the cover art was great and the synopsis intriguing (which both is why i rented it) it was a waste of not only time but money as well. i didn't last long. i took it back to the store and switched it out for another movie i believe my local video store took it off the shelf because they had soooo many complaints about this horrible movie. my 6 year old could have done a better job filming it/writing the script!
