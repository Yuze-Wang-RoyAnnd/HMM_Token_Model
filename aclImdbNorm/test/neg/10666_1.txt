i have been watching movies from i think last 10 years , and i must say that i never felt that bad, which i felt after watching this extra large bore movie, it was bad, very bad. there were songs & songs. nobody should watch this movie. the director has shown germans speaking english which is so rubbish. germans does not speak english. & in one scene there was a white girl who asked himesh for autograph. (obv that he must have gave some money to her) in the promo they have shown prepare for laughing riot. but i could say there was only one scene where that himesh was laughing for no reason may be he thinks he's funny. hansika is very good. she is like an angel. but too young only 16 yrs old. if you have plenty of time and don't know what to do then you should watch this movie or else its waste of money
