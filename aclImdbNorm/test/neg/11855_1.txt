the only reason there is a question mark in parenthesis is not because i haven't seen every film released in 2001 thus far. it's because this film was only made partly in 2001. the rest of it was stolen from roger corman's other dinosaur films, carnosaur 1-3.<br /><br />i have a confession to make. "carnosaur 2" is perhaps one of my favorite b-movies. it borrows so much from james cameron's "aliens" it's not even funny. but i love it. i can't explain exactly why. it just works for me. i liked the sets, i liked the cinematography, i liked how they borrowed from "aliens". it's all a bit ironic that cameron at one point was an understudy of corman's, with films like "battle beyond the stars" (1980).<br /><br />i own the carnosaur trilogy on dvd, and the most i can say for part one is that it has moments. the most i can say for the third is that it took me five years to find it watchable.<br /><br />now we have "raptor," which does not continue that series. instead, it borrows entire scenes from the carnosaur trilogy and builds a movie around it. and somehow roger corman was able to get eric roberts and corbin bernsen to do it. now, i'm not saying either roberts or bernsen are at any kind of career high. but they were both at one point what could be called respectable actors. not here. sure, actors react to effects they won't even see while filming all the time. here, however, they are reacting to mismatched footage from films that are between five and eight years old. there's even a sherrif whose costume was modeled directly after a character in "carnosaur 1." apparently it made too much sense to get the original guy back.<br /><br />when "raptor" was announced i was a wee bit excited. i was however disappointed when corman said that they'd be using the old dinosaur models from "carnosaur." apparently corman decided after this interview was conducted that he wouldn't even do that. and its not that he couldn't find an fx crew to do it. the script for this was clearly written keeping in mind that the story had to be built around pre-existing stock footage.<br /><br />don't compare this to ed wood. ed did better than this. at least he only used the stock footage of bela once, in one film. there are ways of incorporating stock footage into a movie, and "raptor" takes this frowned-upon technique to a new low. even if you liked "carnosaur 3: primal species," stay away from "raptor."
