this movie looked like the out-takes of the deleted scenes from a high school film class experiment. it made no sense! it was well acted, but i only felt sorry for the characters because they had to appear in this slop. the alien machines were created with pentium i technology and no creativity, they were crabs! the under-lit and barely seen aliens were frisbees with legs. where were the tripods? the editing, done by director/writer/producer/make-up artist/gripper latt, jumps all over the place, with some scenes repeated numerous times. most of it seemed to have been filmed in the wake of hurricane katrina. the next time latt wants to make a movie, someone needs to slap him. in 2005 alone he produced 11 movies! that doesn't include the writing, editing, directing or visual effects credits on other movies. if the rest are like this snot-load, then he's just making fun of us. this was a slapped together rip-off of spielberg's movie, nothing more. i'm looking forward to latt's "backbroke ridge', "x-man iiv", "the hillocks have eyes."
