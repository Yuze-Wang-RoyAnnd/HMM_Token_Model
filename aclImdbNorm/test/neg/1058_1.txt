well, you know... rutger hauer and robert patrick both are really good actors. but wtf with this movie? the story was lame and the script was just terrible. the poor actors didn't have material to work with!<br /><br />the dvd cover invited you to a flight action flick. you would expect something like top gun... huge disappointment! the flight action in this movie is so cheap that makes you puke. the aerial scenes are clearly taken from documentaries and some other footage sources, not made for this movie. and they didn't even care about the marks or the fighters models, taking for granted the audience will not notice it.<br /><br />as i said the story was lame. with a little effort from the writer and director it could have been very interesting. in short, it seems a b-movie made in the 70's.<br /><br />i feel very sorry for these actors who put their names here. they sure must be ashamed.
