strained and humorless (especially in light of its rather dubious psychology), but well-paced and comfortably lurid, this genteel body count movie highlights the unusually hypnotic presence of angharad rees as a young woman periodically possessed by jack the ripper, thus allowing for some nasty gore effects amidst the edwardian propriety. it's all pretty standard stuff for hammer, but is handled with a good deal of visual elan, even if the central relationship, between psychoanalyst porter and rees, drives the narrative without ever being satisfactorily explained.
