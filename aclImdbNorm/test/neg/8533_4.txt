this movie has all the ingredients of a great horror story and loses it in the last half. few movies can actually give me chill bumps. this one did. few horror movie give me a sense of dread. this one did. it kept me guessing. i cared about the story. i cared about the characters. the acting was decent. unfortunately, about half way through the movie, the story just doesn't have many good directions it can go. it becomes evident that everything cool about the plot is going to self-destruct. it does. what builds in the first half as a great horror concept shifts away from horror and towards the absurd. a plausible fear turns into a series of implausible reactions from the characters. the story concludes with disappointment. while this movie seems complete, there is one loose end that could setup for a sequel. the movie isn't good enough for a sequel. this movie is worth seeing in the theater, just don't expect to be stunned. this is best suited as a movie to rent. it's probably not a movie you'd want to own.
