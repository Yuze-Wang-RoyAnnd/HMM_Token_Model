i challenge you to watch this film and deny the above statement. that is, if you can stop looking at her practically flawless face. she also does a bit of fighting and a bit of shooting, but not nearly as much as i was hoping for. the film is extremely slow-moving and low-budgeted, though at least they tried to find an excuse for the spaceship being so underpopulated; nearly the entire crew is on "suspended animation", and the ship moves on auto pilot! and the heroine doesn't rescue any of them, or bring anything useful back "home"; it seems that tricking that evil lady into traveling through space was the only part of her mission that couldn't be more easily accomplished by the missiles that blow up the ship at the end. there are also some long but rather tame soft-core scenes, and a couple of "alien"-rip-off monsters that kill about 2 people. *1/2 out of 4.
