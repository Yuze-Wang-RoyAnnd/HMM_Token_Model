there are shows and films i've seen and subsequently read reviews of on imdb.com that i've disagreed with, and been happy to accept that there has just been a difference of opinion.<br /><br />reading positive reviews of this filth merely puts me in mind of a sinister conspiracy involving tv network employees being ordered to browse the internet, posting unconvincingly positive reviews for programmes they themselves are responsible for.<br /><br />how else would one explain a review opining that this show is "sure to become a phenomenon" a full year after it's become clear its going to be nothing of the sort?<br /><br />i won't waste words describing this mess, but suffice to say if you enjoy, wives who emasculate their husbands, husbands who emasculate their sons, children who are disrespectful jackasses towards their parents and absolutely no other threads of behaviour or subtext to legitimise characters that are basically just unfunny one-liner spewing automatons, then watch this show.<br /><br />i, on the other hand, have some seinfeld dvds to get through.<br /><br />futurama - cancelled. titus - cancelled. arrested development - cancelled. the war at home - renewed.<br /><br />no justice.
