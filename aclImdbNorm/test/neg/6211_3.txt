first of all let us discuss about the story. it is a copy of the movie "hitch" with an added indian flavor to it. one guy, who is a love guru, and another man who is seemingly a sucker when it comes to ladies, and how this seemingly sucker becomes a charmer with the help of the love guru forms the story. salman khan is the love guru, and govinda is the lame guy.<br /><br />now coming to artists' performance, salman khan overacts throughout the movie, he tries to be funny, but fails big time. you can see salman shouting throughout the movie, no real acting is seen in his performance. govinda pairs opposite katrina kaif(oh, my god, she is one heck of a girl. a real beauty)is in real life a 50 year old dude, and katrina is a girl in her early twenties. in the movie govinda looks like grandpa of katrina kaif. what a pity! coming to execution of the movie. this movie feels like a b-movie, and a poor imitation of the movie hitch. where hitch looks like a movie with a purpose and depth, this movie is shallow and purposeless, nowhere there is justification or clarity.<br /><br />just forget this movie, for it is nothing but boring, typical bollywood fare. actually i give 3/10 because this is the lowest i go.
