i disagree with dante portraying the democrat-supporting zombies as creatures with an average iq of 23. i do believe their behaviour should reflect a lower iq than that, something in the order of a pelosi iq... a single-digit figure, please.<br /><br />the moh series is quite uneven, and this is the very worst episode. dante, yet another mindless hollywood liberal (or an apolitical nerd who sucks up to the leftist establishment in order to re-kindle his pitiful career?), must have finally realized that his directorial pursuits had been stuck in a low gear for nearly two decades now, hence came up with this cringe-inducing, unsubtle, left-wing "satire" of the bush administration, republicans, and capitalism. perhaps he felt he hadn't been overtly political before. he wouldn't exactly be the first no-talent to use asinine political propaganda to further his career, when all else fails. the maker of turds such as "piranha", "the howling", and "matinee", dante has been as useful a contributor to the horror genre as adolf hitler had been to world peace.<br /><br />th uses lowest-common-denominator humour, cheap and predictable gags which even the bluest of all blue-collar union members wouldn't have trouble understanding. or have you ever seen a clever, subtle, intelligent liberal satire? populist manure has the basest of all messages, hence the language and manner in which this message is communicated has to be as simple and basic as sean penn's name. and what better people to send this message to the popcorn-munching sheep than a couple of cocaine-sniffing tinseltown losers who've all fallen so low that they're forced to write for tv...<br /><br />i don't want political propaganda, either left or right, in any type of movie. but placing it in horror - of all genres - is a testament to the endless stupidity that reigns so supreme among hollywood's anti-intelligentsia. so vapid was dante that he even failed to notice the hilarious suggestion that zombies would vote democrat... (that's what you get for finishing a movie school: not a source of wisdom or useful knowledge by any stretch of the imagination.)
