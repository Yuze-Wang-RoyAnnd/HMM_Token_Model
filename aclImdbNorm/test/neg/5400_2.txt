a delta force army unit, assigned to find a batch of missing green beret bad-asses not known for going completely missing, will be in a fight for survival against a cloaked skeleton man, the supposed spirit of an ancient indian warrior who was revived when archaeologists disturbed his grave. the skeleton man rides a horse and has the ability to propel to and fro using a type of dimensional portal, and seems unaffected by bullet-fire and explosives. the skeleton man's horse leaves no hoof prints and he can ride from behind and around his prey silently. the film's point-of-view through the skeleton man's eyes looks at his prey with a different color. in other words, he's not seemingly human, so how can captain leary(michael rooker, as grizzled and intense as ever)and his gang of would-be commandos stop this menace? for some reason, the skeleton man murders employees of a nearby chemical plant. what are the skeleton man's motives for slaughtering endless human beings? and, why is a blind indian living in the forest our commandos inhabit spared if the skeleton man, as a human, slaughtered his entire tribe to prove himself? <br /><br />as completely stupid as it sounds. just unbelievable horrible. this is the kind of film that can deaden brain cells. casper van dien gets second billing in the credits just under rooker, yet is saddled with a ridiculously underwritten character who exits the film quite early. rooker deserves better than this. if i were an actor, i wouldn't want this movie in my resume. the skeleton man is a reject templer knight from a de ossorio film. he has a spear which can merely knock certain people down while exploding the head of a woman on impact. an arrow shot from the skeleton man's bow actually destroys the propeller of a chopper plane. for nearly 99 % of the film, bullets are shot at the skeleton man and he can go in and out of that portal thingee yet, at the end, all of a sudden, he becomes vulnerable to attack. oh, and the horses also change as the skeleton man freely moves through the forest from that portal.the film is written and edited by clowns. the attack scenes are poorly constructed and the characters, who are supposed to be experienced pros, make really bad decisions throughout this film. the mind boggles with this film. good for some laughs, and some gore scenes make this hunk of pure crap watchable as a trash movie.
