i was struck by the awful acting and script for this movie. all the characters seem rendered immobile by personal issues - rather like deer in headlights. they dither around whining and moaning about their emotions when decisive actions need to be taken. i found myself yelling at the tv screen trying to wake them up to their situation and do something! the plot line is implausible. every time there is a key decision to be taken by a lead character, one of the other characters has to bring up all the problems with the obvious decision as though to further render the decision more difficult - it is a tried melodramatic ploy and just wants to make you groan. clearly the import of the decision is obvious - you don't need to treat the audience as idiots. overall - there is just too much emotional melodrama in the whole movie.
