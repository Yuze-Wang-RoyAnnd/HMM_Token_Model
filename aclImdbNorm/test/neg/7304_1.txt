this has to be the greatest practical joke ever. i'm amazed that all the other actors kept a straight face. i might be wrong but the impression i get from this movie was that they duped frank stallone and joe estevez into acting in this movie that has a budget of just under $40, depending on how much those nerf bats and spray painted catcher's equipment cost, create the most incoherent movie ever created, and sit back and laugh at the fact that joe estevez and frank stallone weren't in on the joke. <br /><br />if by some chance they weren't kidding and they legitimately tried to make a real movie then i feel sorry for everyone involved in the creation. i've had quite a love affair with cheesy movies, but this movie is so bad i can hardly watch it. they repeat pointless "special effects" so many times that it's obvious they were just trying to cover up the fact that they only shot 30 minutes of footage. if i were forced to watch this movie on repeat i would bludgeon myself unconscious with my own hands after about one and a half times through. no offense to the great frank stallone, but i would rather watch sylvester teach a fingerpainting class for 10 hours than watch that movie ever again.
