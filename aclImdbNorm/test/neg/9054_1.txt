one imdb reviewer calls eaten alive a passable film for the "cannibal connoisseur." are there such people? i didn't know. but if you are one of them, hey, have a ball. the rest of you might find this tripe a bit hard to swallow (pun intended), even if, like me, you consider yourself a horror film connoisseur. i have been an avid horror fan for about 15 years now, although i never got around to the cannibal subgenre until a few weeks ago, and i guess i owe my short-lived interest in these groan-inducing movies, strangely enough, to china's total disregard for copyright laws. you see, i bought a two-disc dvd collection of all of wesley snipes' films for 20 yuan (about $2.75), which turned out to include last cannibal world, mountain of the cannibal god, eaten alive, cannibal holocaust, next, with nicholas cage, and something called voodoo lagoon, along with blade 1-3, in chinese. nice.<br /><br />being a second sequel, i immediately got a sinking feeling when the movie opened with a cannibal in street clothes wandering around major american cities, shooting unsuspecting americans with poison darts and then scrambling away at full speed. having run out of ways to keep movie cannibals scary, it seems that now they have made their way to the mainland. later, you may be shocked to learn that this guy is on a "training exercise." lock up your daughters! <br /><br />before long the movie settles into the old missing sister routine, as a young blonde woman named sheila begins her own investigation of the disappearance of her sister, who looks nothing like her in any way, but she's willing to spend most of the movie naked so i guess that doesn't matter. it seems that, after shooting one of his victims, the hapless cannibal we met early in the movie, not used to big city life, ran into the road and was struck dead by a moving van. <br /><br />the brilliant police force find a mysterious bit of film on him showing sheila's sister involved in some bizarre ritual behavior, but other than the film, the guy is a complete mystery. as the piteous police chief laments, "we know nothing about him except that he's dead!" poor guy, he must be getting a headache from all this. i recommend a nap. luckily, sheila is the kind of girl who can throw around tens of thousands of dollars like it's nothing in the search for her sister. perfect for hiring a plucky backwoods guide caricature, since the police are clearly going to be no help.<br /><br />obviously, nothing new is added to this miniscule sub-genre. quite the contrary, cannibalism almost seems like a background to a completely different kind of bad movie, about the rescue of a missing person from the dangerous elements. thickening the plot of that clothesline is not difficult, all you have to do is add in a cartoonish jungle cult of people who follow some guy who calls himself jonas, who believes in using pain as a way to reunite man with nature, a process they call "purification." personally, i prefer just peeing outside occasionally.<br /><br />one of my favorite parts of the movie is when sheila is caught by one of the cult members - an overweight guy who looks like he took a three-day weekend from the office to appear in this movie. as he pulls out his trusty medical kit to give her an injection, he warns her, "if you don't believe in jonas and purification (through pain), god help you." he then gives her a shot and, when she winces from the tiny pinch, he politely apologizes to her. i sense a true believer in this guy!<br /><br />as far as the gore, there are plenty of nasty sound effects over random shots of animals getting slaughtered and more than enough disgusting footage of women being cut up and eaten alive, so i guess right there the movie lives up to its name. the acting is astonishingly bad, as can be expected, and interestingly enough, the editing is also spectacularly botched but still strangely effective. <br /><br />unfortunately, i think you have to be able to relate to people who believe in utterly insane cults in order to relate to anyone in the movie. there are plenty of outlandish religious ceremonies that take place, which make it more and more difficult to understand why sheila's sister decided to turn her back on normal society. i'm all for individualism and doing your own thing, but come on. <br /><br />after a while the movie descends even further into your basic, run of the mill escape movie, just before we witness the most wildly inappropriate rendition of glory, glory hallelujah in film history. wow. <br /><br />note: in this movie, a woman is raped with a severed snake. if you need any more reason never to watch it, seek professional help. avoid this mess at all costs.
