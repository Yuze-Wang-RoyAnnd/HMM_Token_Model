i wouldn't exactly call this a good movie, in fact it might even be a bad one.<br /><br />but there are at least 2 good reasons to keep watching this movie, those are the performances from agnes bruckner (eden) and jonathan jackson (eric) whom both deliver solid performances.<br /><br />they are much better then the rest of the cast whom are pretty bad, especially meagan goode (cousin skeeter).<br /><br />bijou philips was excellent in the "suburban kids goes to the hood"-drama havoc, but here she's far from good on the edge to being annoying.<br /><br />the story is decent enough although nothing special, but it would have been much better since it takes place in lousianna that any of the kids actually incorporated a down south-accent, but they don't (!).<br /><br />especially in a movie where "the monster" is actually bounded so deeply into the lousianna folk-lore, with voodoo and such it's just plain stupidity not to include that accent into the characters.<br /><br />the only one who does this is rapper method man, he plays deputy turner and puts down a pretty good accent in his few scenes, and i mean if a rapper is able to do this then why shouldn't the "proffesional" actors be able to do the same? mister tical aka meth is highly enjoyable in his very very small role, who know the ticallion stallion would ever be a cop? even if only on the big screen.<br /><br />anyways besides that it's a pretty stupid but fairly enjoyable slasher-movie, but if bruckner and jackson was as bad as the rest of the young cast this could have been really bad, thankfully they are good as usual.<br /><br />4.5 out of 10, decent but there are hundreds of better slasher-movies out-there.
