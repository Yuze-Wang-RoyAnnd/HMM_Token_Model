how could this get a 6.0 rating? are we as horror fans so used to horror films being so utterly bad these days, that when one comes along that has some, and i repeat 'only some', redeeming quality's, we get much too excited and give a rating that is just a wee bit too high? the director has a certain visual flair. no doubt about that. but in between some decent shots he forgot a good story, mood or scares. it had a very slow first act, lazy killing scene's, annoying and flat characters and a very stupid and very unbelievable twist. and what's with the portrayal of american teenagers in so many of these kinds of films? do they always have to be this stupid, irritating and so godd#mn superficial. i don't remember teens being like this when i grew up here in holland. all things considered, in can't give this film anything more that a 4 out of 10 rating.
