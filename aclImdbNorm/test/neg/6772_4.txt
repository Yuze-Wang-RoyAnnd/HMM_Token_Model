danny is beyond sorry.<br /><br />he keeps making the same mistakes, and is no longer interesting to watch. at first i could feel for him, as an addict myself. my heart went out to him at the beginning, and somewhere along the line he went over the line. it is almost as if he is continuing this behavior to keep the show going, and at the same time is seriously risking his life, and the welfare of his family, especially his children. it is difficult even to have pity for the poor boy. i think he needs to watch this show, maybe then he might have a chance a saving this marriage. i can't understand how gretchen stays with him, and i keep wondering how much is just for show, and how much is love. danny, get a life - a new one that is! ...and don't get me started on dr. gary. what is with him and his face? his skin looks like it's stretched to the max. besides that, looks don't mean a thing, yet he seems not to be particularly impartial. i think, he too, is keeping this going for his own monetary gain and often not in the best interests of either gretchen or danny. these people are few confused and each remind me of a dog chasing its tail. sad, very sad. c'mon pull yourselves together.
