obviously, this is not the "piranha" directed by joe dante and produced by roger corman. it wasn't so obvious, when i bought the dvd for only $2.95, as the dvd cover art matched that of the corman produced comedy/horror "piranha", even the dvd menu (no features of course) matched the cover. half way through watching this odd movie, my girlfriend and i started thinking, where are the piranhas? once the movie reached the climax we realised that we must have been watching the wrong movie as we had seen the trailer, which had completely different footage, the blurb on the back of the dvd did not match the story we were watching and the credits (actors, producer, director) were also completely different. instead, we got some jungle melodrama about a a girl and two guys who go searching for diamonds and end up confronting a vicious animal hunter. this tame, exploitation thriller is boring and pointless and is only mildly amusing for old-school, camp value. strange that a dvd can be manufactured with the wrong film in tact, but i suppose it is an easy mistake to make seeing as though they are both b-grade movies of the same name made in the 70's. reading other posts made on this film, i noticed that i'm not the only one with the wrong movie on the dvd. how could this be an international error? is there perhaps, some sort of dvd phenomena where unsuccessful films try to get recognition by being put on the wrong dvds? what is going on???
