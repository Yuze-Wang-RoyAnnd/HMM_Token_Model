it is often hard to decide what the best film is that you've ever seen, since this may vary by genre, preferences for actors/actresses, or even the mood you're in on a particular day! having said that, this movie is by far, in my opinion, the worst movie i've ever seen!! i thought the acting was terrible (was there any?), the plot was just idiotic, and the props were totally fakey. could a lower budget production be created without being an amateur production? i don't think so. even the friends i watched the movie with agreed that it was the worst video we ever rented, and to this day we still joke about the night we saw this movie.
