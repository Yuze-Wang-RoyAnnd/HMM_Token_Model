man oh man, this was a piece of dog sh#t. i read a few reviews on here after seeing the case in the local video store, and thought to myself........ ah this seems like a half decent movie.vampires.swords. thailand.how can you go wrong? right? no,no,no way f*cking wrong. jesus, if only i could gouge out my eyes and not remember this film, i would be happy. the lead actor had the whiniest, gayest voice ever.man!it really was bad...."amandaaaaaaaa....","i gotta save my girlfriend...." f*ck off! my buddy and i actually changed the audio track on the dvd to portugese just so we didn't have to hear the guy's voice. subtitles and all...and this improved the film. i'm serious, if your anything like me and wondered what this film was like..stop wondering. i have the answer. worst vampire movie ever! no good action, no good gore and only the smallest smattering of nudity. just pure sh*t for 90 mins. don't rent this,buy it,think about it,or watch it at 3:00am. it just doesn't cut the cake......at all....in any way. f*ck this movie and watch all anal 7: real deep cover. you'd have a better time. i'm sure.
