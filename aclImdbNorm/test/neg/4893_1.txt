this movie was ridiculous from the start. let me save you all time from watching this movie. a woman who sells corn liquor to the locals takes in her cousin or nephew and he convinces her to open a caf'e downstairs from her home. she does and she and the cousin become close. there is a scene later where she is locking lips with him. later, the woman finds out an old boyfriend is coming back from jail and its tense between them, leading to a down and out fist fight in the caf'e. the woman's cousin/nephew is enamored by the man. the ending was awful, the story was awful, and if i could get back the time wasted on this movie, i would appreciate it. a definite skip.
