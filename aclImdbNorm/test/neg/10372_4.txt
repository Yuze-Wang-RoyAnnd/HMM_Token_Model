i absolutely love the first three movies, they were great! i once caught part 5 on vhs 10 years ago, and i was disappointed. but perhaps that was because i never saw the fourth one, because they were shot back-to-back. but after finally viewing a copy today, i have to say it was no way better than number 5. my expectations weren't high to begin with, but this is cheap direct-to-video stuff, not even a horror movie, it's pg-13. the acting was not convincing, the story was rather dumb without any excitement and there were not many effects. but the main problem is that there were no kills or any gore (the annoying kid who gets killed in his car was supposed to be the highlight, but come on..)<br /><br />surprisingly, both parts 4 and 5 were directed by sequel-director jeff burr who gave us the excellent stepfather ii and leatherface: texas chainsaw massacre iii. i liked puppet master: the legacy, even if it was nothing else than a tribute with the best scenes from all movies.<br /><br />overall, puppet master is very much like the hellraiser series: a great trilogy but forget the rest..
