the costumes are outrageous and the australian outback scenery is fun to view, but there is an edge to this story - a mean edge - about drag queens. i particularly noticed that in terrence stamp's character, "ralph bernadette bassenger." perhaps that was appropriate since there is nothing "good-guy- like" about ralph-bernadette and his group of "queens." <br /><br />once again, we get the strong liberal slant which says anything goes and if you're not "with it" - or in this case, pro-homosexual, then you are a homophobe. (gasp!)<br /><br />what's really disturbing is the ending when a young boy goes off with his "alternative-lifestyle" father and embraces his gay lifestyle, not because it fit the story but because it fit the agenda of the people who wrote the script. pitiful.
