since the magus is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution, one should sit back and enjoy the scenery. set on a "remote greek island," it stars a very uptight michael caine as a teacher working at a school for boys who gets caught up in mind games with local wacko/mystery man anthony quinn and his daffy girlfriend candice bergen. quinn, looking like pablo picasso with white hair and striped sailor shirt, is actually pretty good but caine looks like he's ready to explode. bergen, although stunning, should not put on a british accent ever. she's not very good at that type of thing. guy green's direction is fine, but unless you have infinite patience with the circular logic of the film, you will not enjoy it. a real sour note is the casting of the effervescent anna karina in the completely joyless role of caine's girlfriend. after seeing her in the likes of a woman is a woman and a band apart, her presence here is quite jarring.
