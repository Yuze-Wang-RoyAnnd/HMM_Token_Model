ok, first of all, who in their right mind would remake hitchcock and second, who would do it shot for shot? i admit i had no intention of ever watching this movie for that very reason. the original psycho is one of my favorite films ever and this just seemed like a degrading photocopy of it. i did watch it because my girlfriend wanted to compare it to the original and we both agreed less than five minutes into this crap that it was awful. first, as mentioned, they did it shot for shot. where's originality? why remake a movie that is almost perfect exactly the way it was done the first time? why remake such a movie to begin with? if you are going to remake something, remake something that doesn't work and make it better!<br /><br />second, they used the exact same script from the 1960 version. the dialog no longer works. it works fine and sounds perfect for the 1960 version, but seems odd and stilted coming out of modern actors. why not update the dialog? hitch didn't write the script, you could have rewritten. <br /><br />this film had some very good talent and they were wasted by imitation of the original actors. the actor who played the car salesman seemed like he was just playing john anderson's performance as the car salesman in the original. all the actors seemed like the only direction they were given was be the characters from the original movie. vince vaughn may have seemed a little creepier than anthony perkins, but in doing so, you loose the sympathy you are supposed to have for norman. having norman masturbate while watching marion undress was going too far and lost the innocence of the character that i think tony perkins captured so well in his performance. viggo mortensen's accent was annoying and rita wilson was far too old to play caroline. her lines came off as someone desperate rather than just young and fun like patricia hitchcock's performance. <br /><br />the only good thing i saw about the film was that gus van sant was able to open the movie with the shot hitch had envisioned. hitch wanted to open with 1 long shot going over phoenix but couldn't at the time so he had to settle for a series of shots cross-dissolved together. this film fulfilled that vision with a helicopter shot going into the window of the hotel. after that, though the film became a worthless waste of celluloid. <br /><br />if you are curious about how to destroy a wonderful film, watch this, but do not under any circumstances watch this before you watch the original. this is a faded photocopy of the original and should never have been green-lit. stick to the master's film, not the imitation.
