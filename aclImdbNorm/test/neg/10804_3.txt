soultaker was written by and starred vivian schilling. it also starred joe estevez, gregg thomsen, and robert d'zar as the angel of death.<br /><br />the story begins with introduction to soultaker, played by joe estevez. we quickly learn what soultaker's role will be in this movie.<br /><br />next the college aged young people are getting ready for a summer festival, aptly named "summerfest". in this film, the battle of the classes is omni-present throughout the film. the girls come from a wealthy class, and the guys come from roughly middle or lower class. the class roles seem to play a role in the film for some reason which isn't really clear or pertinent to the story.<br /><br />at summerfest we learn more about the apparent class struggles of why zach isn't encouraged to date natalie. soultaker makes an appearance as well, with apparently his boss the angel of death. here d'zar's character points out who is to die and who's souls are to be taken. it's revealed as well, that soultaker will have a character conflict regarding natalie, and how he deals with her because of someone in his past.<br /><br />meanwhile natalie is ditched by her ride to summerfest, and zach convinces her to ride home with them. during the ride home, soultaker takes an active role causing them to wreck horribly at high speeds.<br /><br />the rest of the story surrounds the soultaker collecting the souls of the dead passengers, and zach and natalie trying to outwit him to return to their bodies so they can continue to live. the class and character conflicts lay in the story, but are really never brought to the forefront or resolved.<br /><br />there's an attempt towards the end to drag out some of the drama, there's a lot of chasing and running which does tend to be really boring. it's not really acceptable, and it would've been nice had this been dealt with differently, somehow to maybe increase the drama but not bore the audience.<br /><br />the story and acting are decent. the soundtrack is ok, and even the production values are good.<br /><br />robert d'zar in his brief on screen appearances does a nice job as the angel of death. joe estevez does ok, however sometimes his role acting a bit flat. vivian is pretty and does a decent job as natalie, although perhaps over acting a bit in a few scenes.<br /><br />this may sound odd, but this movie definitely could've benefited from some pointless nudity. vivian teases us a bit but that wasn't enough.<br /><br />in my opinion this was a pretty serious attempt at making a movie. the results, it's worth watching. just don't expect a perfect production.<br /><br />3/10
