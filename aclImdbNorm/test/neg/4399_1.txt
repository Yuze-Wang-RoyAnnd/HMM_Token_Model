national lampoon's dorm daze is easily the worst movie i have ever seen, and i've seen the movie kazaam. anyone reading this who thinks this movie was good in any way, shape, or form has no idea what a good movie is, and should never watch another movie again because they are indeed so stupid.<br /><br />its hard to name everything wrong with this movie. first off, the plot is all over the place and can't follow all the multiple "misunderstandings" very well at all. the acting is awful to say the least, and the whole thing was poorly made. any and all who worked on this movie should not be in another movie of any kid ever again!<br /><br />it is too hard to sum up this movie in just a paragraph or two, because it is so bad, but for anyone out there reading this please do not watch this movie!! if you want a good movie to watch, go turn on anything else on television. even u.s.a. has better movies than this.<br /><br />_friend.
