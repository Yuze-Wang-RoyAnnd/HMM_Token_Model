not sure if this is just a lousy movie or if it was intended to be a mockery of a "b" western. story line was so-so but the filming, editing and acting were just plain bad. plus the music in the background was irritating to no end, too loud and just non-stop. many times you could not make out the dialog over the background music. i'm in sass (single action shooting society) and do some old west shooting with them, and a lot of the actors are members of this group, so that's why i bought it. if you have no interest in this group of people, or that sport, you certainly most likely wouldn't even have this little bit of interest to help out with the film. the acting of even the veteran actors (particularly stella stevens) left a lot to be desired also.
