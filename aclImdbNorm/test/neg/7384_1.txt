this movie was the worst movie i've ever seen. no story, no point, it wasn't even funny at all, not sure why people say this movie is hilarious because it sucked so much!! felix bean the main character sucked. susanna sucked. this movie was made in 1996 and it really was set in the 80s. what else, i'm never letting my friend pick movies ever again. hmm, the movie cover said it was from the producers from super troopers, who kidnapped them and stole their identities. wow, what a waste of time. the only minute thing that was funny was freaky ricky, he was funny, especially when he and emily ended up together. that was funny. all and all, it sucked, waste of time and sleep. wow, never thought a movie like this could be made, so dumb for watching for watching it to the end.
