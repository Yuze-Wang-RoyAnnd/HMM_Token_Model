this quirky and watchable film is the story of a deluded dentist who starts out on his mission or crusade to fight tooth decay in the back and beyonds of patagonia. hailing from northern ireland, via new jersey, the main character, fergus, sees his crusade as a mission of mass importance and approaches it with all the enthusiasm, vitality, discipline and attention to detail one would expect from a trained dentist. which adds to the hilarity, as his grand plans unravel and gradually fall to pieces as he goes from disaster to debacle in the patagonian outback on the back of a customised motor bike or his, er, mobile dental unit. we never get to meet his wife, nor the rich philanthropist who is sponsoring the ill-fated mission, but, we do get a solid display from lewis. fans of his work will not be disappointed with his very believable performance as the deluded dentist who is gallantly adored by the, innocent but sexy, 18 year old female lead who tags along on for the *ahem* ride.<br /><br />this film is not for everyone and i can understand why it wasn't pushed by the suits. it's a low budget, sometimes charming, always disarming, mildly amusing and instantly forgettable film that sets out with low expectations and almost succeeds.
