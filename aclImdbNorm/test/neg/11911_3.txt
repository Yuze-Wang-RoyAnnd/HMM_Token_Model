jack lemmon was one of the finest actors that had ever graced the screen. he could effortlessly switch from dramatic roles to comedic with ease, making most of his peers green with envy. while his performance in "save the tiger" is oscar-worthy, i feel it was given to him as he had missed out on his other opportunities to win the award due to other, better roles that had preceded this current one.<br /><br />this is also one of those pretentious movies that comes out to basically showcase the talent of the cast, or in this case, one particular member. it's too bad the screenwriter's output didn't match that of lemmon's. don't waste your time with this one.
