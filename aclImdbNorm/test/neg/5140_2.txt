like the previous poster, i am from northern vermont, and i was inclined to like this film. however, not since "red zone cuba" have i seen such a confusing plot. the things the people to bootleg make no sense. two of the gang paddle across the border send a second party across in a car. uhm, why? then they meet two others, and drive up at night in to the bad guy's hideout in a luxury packard. --wouldn't just two people in a flatbed truck make more sense? then, parked outside the garage that holds the targeted hooch, the four fall asleep! when they waken in the morning and and start hauling the whiskey out, of course they're spotted and shot at, losing some of their precious cargo in the process. then two of the smugglers put the whiskey in a boat and float it over the border. again, why? i am told by someone whose great uncle really did smuggle in the area, all one needed was to drive a vehicle that could outrun than the u.s. canada border patrol, which back then had a fraction of the resources it has now. <br /><br />and don't get me started on the last half hour, which made no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />the only good thing i can say about the film is that kris kristopherson has actually grown some charisma with the years.
