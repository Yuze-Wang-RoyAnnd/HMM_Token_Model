the only redeeming quality of this film is that it shows bands and their music when it was changing in ny during '81. as for the film itself it has at least three major flaws. first of all, there is narration throughout the film, which is not required at all. in the few places where there is some explanation necessary just adding a little dialogue would have gone a long way. secondly, there was no obvious attempt to synchronize any of the audio, in fact it is quite apparent that most of the dialogue was recorded later with no attempt to match the film. the third flaw was in the ending. i will not give the ending away for those brave souls that would endure the torture of sitting through the film, but it commits a cardinal sin in screenwriting. not worth the money or time it takes to see this, unless you are a fan of one of the represented bands.
