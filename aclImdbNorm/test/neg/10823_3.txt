i rented this film from blockbust because of the cover and title! sounded intriguing!! this movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense. the "monsters" needed more face time. we needed them to have some sort of special power and definitely more "oh sh--" moments. the photography didn't bother me except for the scene where a re-breather blows up. there were too many close ups. but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom. overall, i would say everyone put in a lot of time even the writers. but this movie is definitely a below average rent.<br /><br />there are definitely better picks. i would recommend anacondas 1 or 2 over this pick.
