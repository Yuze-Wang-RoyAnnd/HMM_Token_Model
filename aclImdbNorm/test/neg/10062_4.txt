when at the very start of the film paleontologist donald sutherland arrives at the argyle family's house and it comes out he is the undeniable alibi for one of the members executed for murdering his mother two years ago your sensation is that you are about to watch a top thriller; an innocent man has been convicted and a killer is still around. but as the film runs along your disappointment increases inevitably.<br /><br />"ordeal by innocence" is a dull and at times even boring film that doesn't raise at any moment. nothing interesting happens all along and even the final revealing of the facts lacks surprise and intensity (wether you guessed or not).<br /><br />donald sutherland, cristopher plummer, faye dunaway and sarah miles (far from her good performance in "ryan's daughter") just pass through their roles and not very enthusiastically either.<br /><br />you won't miss much if you skip this one.
