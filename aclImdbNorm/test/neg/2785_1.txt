this is an irredeemably stupid, boring, unimaginative, lazily put together piece of garbage. when watching a direct to video slasher pick, it is only fair to expect the film to be trashy on some level, but this goes beyond trashy. it is just horrible on every level, with a clich'e ridden script that manages to be both incredibly stupid and incredibly boring at the same time, a cast of no name over actors, and some of the worst special effects i have ever seen. even fans of slasher movies won't be able to find anything here that would make this film a worthwhile use of an hour and a half. <br /><br />the plot focuses on your usual group of young people who decide to spend the weekend at a remote farm in west virginia that one member of the group has recently inherited. unfortunately for the teenagers, the inherited land was once owned by a farmer who made sacrifices in order to help his crops grow, or something stupid along those lines, and now some evil scarecrows are out to kill everybody. i don't know anything about writer director paul moore, but i am assuming he is over ten years old, and therefore he ought to be able to come up with something more original than killer scarecrows. honestly. <br /><br />the special effects bringing the scarecrows to life are laughably poor. they often look like hardly more than haloween costumes on sticks. special effects such as these would have been considered rather rather poor twenty years ago, but by todays standards, they are nothing short of embarrassing. <br /><br />this is a total waste of time for all viewers, whether or not they are into horror movies. if you must watch a slasher film, rent any one of the "friday the 13th" or "halloween" movies. most of them aren't very good, but are certainly superior to crap like this.
