nine out of nine people who watched this have declared themselves to be mentally scarred for life. no-one should ever have to see this abomination. the english language is poorly equipped to express how utterly, dreadfully atrocious this "film" is. it's really not worth the plastic it's made of. no greater crime has been committed by the human race in the entire history of creation; never is there likely to be anything worse.<br /><br />it was agreed unanimously that the scene involving the shrunken head of tommy and the young girl's blouse was unbelievably sick and twisted; in fact many of us have not yet recovered from the ordeal and are currently sitting in the corner of the room rocking, sucking our thumbs and whimpering.<br /><br />the fundamental question on everyone's lips, however, has to be "why???". how is it possible for anyone to create such a monstrosity and then subject it to so many innocent people? after viewing the trailer we thought that this film might be a laugh: how wrong we were.<br /><br />please sign the petition to rid the world of "shrunken heads" so that no other poor civilians be exposed to it. please, for the good of humanity.
