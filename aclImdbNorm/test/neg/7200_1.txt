i absolutely hated this movie! i was 9 when i saw it. it is the only movie i have ever walked out of in the theater. my mom, dad, and i all looked at each other during the movie and knew we were wasting our time. this movie stole approximately 45 minutes of my life. everything about it was ridiculous. the entire premise was too warped. being 9, i was always easily entertained. this movie proved that i couldn't subject myself to anything and still be entertained.
