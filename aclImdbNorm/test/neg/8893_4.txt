this movie came very close to being a good flick. the direction needs to be a bit smoother to progress from one piece to the next to make it more plausible. in particular: the main character's need to escape is not explicit enough. is he trying to kill himself? is he trying to escape? his life does not seem to be that bad, so it makes it more difficult to swallow that he wants to leave his life so much. also, it is not very clear how much "in love" he has fallen with jennifer jason l. if the movie was reworked with some more attention to these details, it would have been great. on the other hand, for an indy flick, it's pretty good! maybe if you have a couple of drinks, to dull the logical thinking, it would be more fun...<br /><br />
