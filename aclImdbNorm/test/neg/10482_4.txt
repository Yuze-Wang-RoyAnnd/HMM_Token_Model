okay, when i bought this flick i though this gotta be the ultimate b-movie, space monkey landing to the earth and starts right away to kill people! <br /><br />well, it was almost everything what i expected, typical low-budget scifi movie from the 60's. acting has to be the worst i've ever seen, especially the girl playing the lead role and the girl that played the waitress made me laughing my ass off. <br /><br />so why 'night fright' doesn't fall in to category 'so bad that it's good'? reason why is that some of the scenes were just too long and boring. for example the scene were the police officers are searching clues in the woods it was just minutes of walking without purpose. and then the grand finale, the people's waiting for the monster about 5 minutes and when the space monkey appears it get wack'd in 20 second, end of film.<br /><br />yeah, 'night fright' is boring, but it got couple of funny moments. i can recommend this movie to all who liked films like 'zontar, the thing from venus' or 'curse of the swamp creature'.<br /><br />i give 'night fright' 4 space monkey slaps out of 10..<br /><br />-rob gruesome-
