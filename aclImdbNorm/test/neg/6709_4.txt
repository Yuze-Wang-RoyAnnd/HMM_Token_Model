to call a film boring is not something i would usually count as a valid criticism. however, when a film is crassly made of spare parts from other films that weren't that good to begin with, and it is slow as molasses with no real payoff, i think it's fair to call a spade a spade. and the ghost is a very boring film.<br /><br />a movie that is about as original as its' name, the ghost tells the story of a young girl with amnesia being haunted by a ghost that holds the secret to her past. only, it's a whole lot more complicated and less interesting than one would think.<br /><br />the plot line is almost incomprehensible for most of the picture and the hook, the amnesia element, only makes things worse. it seems that no one, including the screenwriter and director have any clue what the hell is happening at any given moment. instead they chose to do what roughly amounts to the filmic equivalent of a sitcom clip show. there are scenes taken directly from ringu, dark water, shutter, the grudge series, and a smattering of pulse for good measure. making matters worse, the half dozen female leads all dress and read their lines alike, making them impossible to tell apart.<br /><br />there is just nothing to grasp onto with this film. the story isn't all that well thought out. the amnesia gimmick is lazy. the mystery element is un-involving and handled with little grace. the characters never deduce anything, all the information is just handed out through the lead remembering her past whenever it is convenient for the plot.<br /><br />the cinematography, full of reflections and shots of water at least attempts to add to the subtext, a thematic link with the amnesia and the final twist (which i won't reveal) is nice, but often overwrought. even the score feels borrowed and clich'e.<br /><br />worst of all, the inciting action for the curse isn't very interesting and the final twist is predictable and lame. "wait, you mean that one character who has 15 minutes of screen time but appeared to have nothing to do with the plot comes back in the end? no!" audiences are too savvy for this kind of tripe. anyone who has seen any of the films that this rips off will find very little to even keep them awake with this feature. i used to think shimizu was the bottom of the barrel for this kind of crap (remaking his grudge film no less than 5 times) but even his second rate work like reincarnation, a film i couldn't even bring my self to finish, is miles ahead of this.<br /><br />for more reviews please visit www.collider.com
