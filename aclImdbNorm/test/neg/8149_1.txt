with the little respect it deserves, i would like to state that this movie was horrible. the filmmakers had good intentions, but the overall quality of the direction and production value was obviously lacking a great deal. i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good hard laugh and then wasting two more hours of their life enduring a truly painful experience. i'm surprised i even found this movie on the $1 dvd rack where it was aptly placed. i thought maybe it was going to be good and that i might discover some amazing independent film - i was wrong. i wish i had never seen this movie. my 3-year-old cousin couldn't make a worse film. i'm glad i saw the film because i can finally tell people i've seen the worst movie ever made, and be sure of it.
