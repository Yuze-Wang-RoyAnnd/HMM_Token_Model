horrendous "comedy" in which a beautiful, crazy woman (liv tyler) "comedically" destroys the lives of three men (matt dillon, paul reiser and john goodman). dillon hires a hit man (michael douglas) to kill her. what is happening to comedy? the year 2001 has produced some of the worst comedies ever (saving silverman, sugar and spice, freddy got fingered, tomcats, etc etc). this is one of the worst. there's not one, repeat, not one funny moment in it. the jokes are either stupid, unfunny, smutty or real sick. also there's a strong hatred of women in this garbage--the only main female character (tyler) is constantly used as a sex object. also extreme, bloody violence is thrown in at the end. the only bearable moments come from reba mcentire as a psychiatrist and andrew dice clay in two roles--both psychos. dillon, goodman and reiser have hit an all-time career low with this--the only way to go is up. and poor tyler! she quit doing intelligent, gutsy independent films for this? and douglas???? what was he on when he agreed to this? an utter piece of crap--to be avoided at all costs!!!!!!!!!!
