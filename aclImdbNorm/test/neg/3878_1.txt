this was a hindi movie. hindi=horrible. reasons: cheap dialogues, cheap special effects, cheap directing + stretching a 2 hr max movie into 3 hrs. <br /><br />%^^^^^^spoiler...little bit%%%%%%%%<br /><br />specifically for this movie: 1. dialogues are not funny. they are cheesy, and cheap. though akshay tried his best acting for which i admire him, comedy was not funny at all! i laughed only 3 times during this movie. 2. first half of the movie was useless to the story of the 2nd half. the 2nd half was the actual story/movie. the first half was time pass/build up. 3. the characters are not developed properly at all. paresh rawal is smart in the first half, an idiot in the 2nd half/rest of the movie. we don't really develop any feelings or caring for akshay, and govinda. their characters are stupid nothing more. they do not seem to struggle in their difficulties. jokes are funny, but they are not funny in a very serious scene. the characters of the gang and the drug smugglers are cheesy and have been used in last 20 movies. there is nothing new about those characters. again, they are shown to be stupid for being funny. however, stupid=funny when stupid is the norm throughout the whole movie. the only character that made sense was that of lara dutta with a real story. 4. special effects were crap. at the end, ppl r fallin off the ladder of a fire truck. you notice that they are not actually on ladder in air. secondly, ppl start to fly off when the ladder starts to move around. ppl can't fly off a ladder when its moving...they fall directly to the ground due to something called gravity. 5. the whole movie was dubbed. all the dialogues were recorded after the movie. the actors' lips hardly synced to the dialogues. <br /><br />there are probably many other reasons why this movie was crap, but i can't remember them. look at this masterpiece of crappy indian movies by non-intelligent, even stupid, director yourself and you will agree with my review. ppl who like hindi movies, please increase your expectations for decent quality in hindi movies. <br /><br />let me say that not all hindi movies are bad. i like some. i did not like this one. <br /><br />1.5/10 (1.5 for the effort by akshay and lara)
