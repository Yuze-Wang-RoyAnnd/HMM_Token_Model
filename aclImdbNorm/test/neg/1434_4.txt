this sounded like it was going to be like silence of the lambs or zodiac or something, but it wasn't. it really was more like one of the halloween movies without all the jump scenes. it was a little like plan 9 from outer space in the sense that the main bad guy kept making inane speeches that made me want to go get a snack without pushing pause. the idea of a person who is so crazy that he would abduct people and torture them as a form of spiritual enlightenment is actually an interesting idea, but the execution was too made-for-tv feeling. i have to say it was better than i expected for a movie written and starring dee snider. a good first effort. maybe he'll learn some lessons and his next effort will be less clumsy.
