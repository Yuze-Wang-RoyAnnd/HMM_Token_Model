this is by far the worst british comedy ever, how it made it past the first episode let alone the pilot is beyond me. the acting is weak from the main character played by ben miller to sarah alexander (from the fantastic coupling)right through the cast. the plot/story lines were unfunny and very very predictable using many worn out ideas. a very painful series to endure but sadly put in a slot between two excellent shows. describing it as britain's answer to ' meet the parents' does a disservice to 'meet the parents' and is as about as fresh as an old shoe that has a run around with the family dog. britain should have learned that rip offs from other countries never work from looking at america's sad attempts at doing so.
