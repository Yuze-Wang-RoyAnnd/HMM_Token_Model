how in the name of decency did this film ever get made? <br /><br />one presumes the subtitles merely say 'awful' on every single frame of this truly dismal effort.<br /><br />horrendous acting, woeful dialogue and the lack of talent from everyone involved in this nightmare make for an excruciating 90 minutes.<br /><br />overall impression? <br /><br />a bunch of excitable drama students got lucky with a lottery grant and proceeded to make one of the most painful films ever made.<br /><br />this makes hammer horror tv shows look like oscar material.<br /><br />and don't for a second think this falls into the 'so bad it's good' category. it's not even that bad.<br /><br />but the fart lighting scene is probably worth another look.
