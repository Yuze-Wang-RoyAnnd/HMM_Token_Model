the characters was as unoriginal it hurts. the little skinny dorky computer geek, the funny african-american with stupid clisch'e punchlines, cool white guy with a compassion for cars and the handsome leader who ends up with the pretty girl. the actors is at best mediocre. ecsept from norton who does a pretty good job as the bad guy. <br /><br />the rest of the movie is also stupid and a total waste of time. its all in all about a group of spoiled boys using the world as their playground where every safe in a big house is what keeps them with food on the table. i mean, why work for a living when you can rob people?<br /><br />and,.. who the f**** messes with the traffic lights in a major european city?!? and in the middle of the friggin day!? think of all the damages and not to say deaths among innocent civilians. what about all the ambulances and firetrucks? <br /><br />i created no compassion for the main characters, and weather mr wahlberg gets his bloody gold or not, i could not give less of a fart.
