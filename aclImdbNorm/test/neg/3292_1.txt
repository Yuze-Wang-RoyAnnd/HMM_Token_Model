how can stuff like this still be made? didn't seinfeld, arrested development, the office etc etc kill this old-fashioned unfunny crap off? apparently not...<br /><br />i'm actually quite a fan of michael rappaport and have enjoyed his various cameos and supporting roles (copland , friends) but in this he sucks but anyone would struggle with this script.<br /><br />my wife enjoys it. but she's brazilian. and if you've ever seen a typical brazilian sit-com you would understand why she would think this so funny.<br /><br />just to demonstrate how predictable the show is and to prove a point with her i guessed what the next 3 or 4 plot developments/lines would be while watching it for a while and was correct almost word for word! i felt very smug. this annoyed my wife as she hates it when i do that (can understand why but i felt good so screw-it!)
