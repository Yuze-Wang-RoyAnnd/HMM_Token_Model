i've always been a fan of chuck norris for what he's accomplished and his movies. for while i had been meaning to watch this film, but for whatever reason didn't have chance. apparently i didn't miss much. this has to be one of chuck's worst films. so this trucker, billy dawes (augenstein) is given the chance to make his delivery, but on the way he is detoured and forced into a jerkwater town where a foolish local corrupt judge trimmings (murdock) who runs the whole town, has him arrested and phony charges brought up on him. he denies the charges and makes a run for it. the local hick cops beat him and he disappears. but now his brother jd john dawes (norris) another trucker goes looking for him. he soon finds that the town is run buy the loser judge and that his brother is nowhere to be found. not long after he begins to beat off just about everyone in town. in the meantime the female of the film calls on local truckers on a cb radio, and they all come rushing into town demolishing it. lol with there big rigs. eventually norris finds his brother and beats off more thugs.<br /><br />this movie was pretty bad. it actually starts off ok and you feel great when norris starts to smash some of these local corrupt cops, because there such losers. but there is virtually no story, the acting is bad, and the ending
