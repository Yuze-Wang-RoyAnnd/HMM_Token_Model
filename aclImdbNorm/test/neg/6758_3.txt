remnants of an ambushed army unit hook up with a group of cowboys to fight their way through indians on the warpath. sounds like it could be an exciting western, but this one is dull, dull, dull. it moves like molasses, the action scenes are uninspired, the acting is pedestrian, the writing is flat, even the photography isn't very good. eastwood, in a very early role, plays an ex-confederate who doesn't like the idea of fighting on the same side as yankees. that's about the only remotely interesting situation in the whole movie, but eastwood wasn't experienced enough an actor to pull it off, and his character comes across as petulant rather than angry or embittered. a very ordinary western. actually, a very less-than-ordinary western. worth a look if you're a die-hard eastwood fan and want to see him at the very beginning of his career. otherwise, don't bother.
