very poor quality and the acting is equally as bad. this movie is a prime example of present day england and the mindset. there is no mention of jesus in this movie nor does the movie feature any type of scripture christianity as most know it. <br /><br />i am also very surprised because this film is a bbc program and the bbc is quit well known for their quality programing, but it looks like the bbc's attempt to rival the hollywood psycho/drama films are failing completely. <br /><br />poor acting, poor plot, poor culture that seems to be without religion. i would not even bother buying this, instead better to try to rent this one or buy it when it goes to the 2 dollar bin.
