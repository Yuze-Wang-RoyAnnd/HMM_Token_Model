pathetic nri crap.....appeal to all who are not indian's....this is the worst of indian cinema,made by the worst piece of nri trash.....the story is boring and clich'ed (the way nris and westerners view india).....go for it if u want to be bored to death.<br /><br />the movie deals with the plight of widows in india before independence.a lot of it is true even now in remote rural areas but not to the extent as depicted (maybe because its a period movie).....<br /><br />there are plenty of other indian movies directed by extremely talented directors that are worth savoring...this one is a definite miss...watch a documentary instead or look up information on the net if you are genuinely interested in the plight of the downtrodden in india.<br /><br />i wasted my time.
