i only bought this dvd because it was dirt cheap and it seemed interesting in its own special way ("special" meaning "retarded"). the movie turned out to be quite uninteresting - boring camera work, nothing really driving the story, and of course the acting is horrible. it wasn't even "bad" in a campy way - it was just plain bad. there are actually a handful of great lines of dialogue but for the most part its awkward and weak. all i could think about while watching this was that this could actually be a good movie if the script was given a major overhaul (if it were written by someone who actually understood drug culture) and if some decent actors were cast. i wouldn't recommend "weekend with the babysitter" unless if you plan on a career in film and want to learn what not to do in a movie.
