i enjoyed the mr. magoo cartoons i saw while growing up. and i enjoy leslie nielson's comic skills. so, i thought, this marriage must produce a funny child.<br /><br />i couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />this movie was just awful. i don't recall a single funny moment. this is one of the two or three times (in hundreds of films over the years) i've wanted my money back. you will leave this film dejected because you won't ever have that time back to use in a better way. in a comedy, the plot must draw in the viewer and serve as a framework for gags. this plot does neither. it just kinda lies there, gasping like a beached fish.
