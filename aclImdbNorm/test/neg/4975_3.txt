this movie was an all around uninspiring film. it was a non-moving story that definitely does not get you thinking anything other then where is all the strong moving material the other critics say about the film the 3 main actors are good, and there is a few laughs but once again it becomes another movie that you keep watching in hopes of it getting better and it just doesn't. i watched this movie last night and wished that we hadn't wasted our precious time (while baby is sleeping) watching this film. <br /><br />i plan not to recommend this to my family and friends, as well as obviously anyone looking to rent it. i was pretty much non-impressed with everything about this film.
