nbc had a chance to make a powerful religious epic along the lines of "the ten commandments" and "the greatest story ever told," and instead they chose to make some halfhearted cartoon that was more like "waterworld" than anything else. i don't recall a bible passage where lot turns into a pirate and attacks the ark, nor do i remember one where noah's son develops a serious friendship with an orange, nor do i remember noah being some crazy old loon who suddenly acts like he's commanding a naval fleet and runs around shouting nautical terms like "hoist the mainstay!" this was possibly the worst marketing decision in history. obviously the majority of people watching this were going to be jewish and christian parents with their kids, so why on earth make the movie so offensive to those people? if they were intentionally trying to offend, why not advertise it that way and at least reel in the right audience?? i hope they make a real noah movie someday, one done seriously and thoughtfully, one that actually appeals to people and makes money. until then, don't waste your time with this trash.
