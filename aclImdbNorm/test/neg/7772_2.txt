lazy writing, bad acting and wooden direction lead us to a 2005 canadian-made tv movie called hush, not to be confused with about eight other movies using the same name. tori spelling and her doctor hubby move from sanfran to his small hometown, where they run into his old gal pal, who decides she still loves him. she gets pregnant with tori's baby (don't ask) and starts knocking off anyone who might get in her way as she plans to reunite with her old flame. the actors playing the old gal pal and the doctor are not worth mentioning, as they act flatter than flat. tori isn't much better, but at least she is something to focus on as the plot meanders here and there before arriving at a very lame and all-too-familiar conclusion. watch instead the hand that rocks the cradle.
