a true yawner and a bad film even for the chan series. i like a good charlie chan film or even a reasonably good one, but this one falls way short of the mark. charlie is enlisted to help figure out the murder of a scientist working for our government when someone in the house has stolen the plans for another power. the mystery is very pedestrian and the acting doesn't fare much better. the only saving grace for me in the film was the presence of mantan moreland as birmingham brown. he gives the film a little comedy and has some good scared faces, but after that the pickings are rather slim. benson fong is here as tommy chan and pairs up with chan's daughter of all things. what about sidney toler? he is pretty decent but looks like he is straining to carry the film. what i noticed most was the way the film was shot. chan director phil rosen, of whom i generally like most of his entries, uses lots of long shots with no action(like charlie's initial walk into the house from outside). why? the film is only 64 minutes long for crying out loud! shots like that tell me the director had to fill time up because the script was even weaker than he was accustomed to. this probably isn't the worst chan film ever made, but up to now it is the worst i have sat through unfortunately.
