why did they have to make such a dreadful adaptation? the whole "complete jane austin" series as a part of masterpiece classics looks like a huge disappointment. characters are totally miscast and there's no chemistry on the screen. the whole thing feels rather rushed. the 1999 movie release based on the same novel seems like a masterpiece compared to this. i really want to forget it. i'm really happy though that "pride and prejudice" won't be re-made as part of this project and we will see the iconic and magnificent colin firth and jennifer elle as protagonists. if you skipped this "mansfield park" production consider yourself lucky!
