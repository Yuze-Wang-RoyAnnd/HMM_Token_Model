i've watched this movie, after having seen the original "spoorloos" a few times, in anticipation of the chilling ending.<br /><br />i can't even begin to explain the anger and disappointment that i experienced when the ending came, and went, and the movie continued to have a happy ending. what a waste of time it was watching this us remake...<br /><br />if you have a choice, please skip "the vanishing" and watch the dutch original "spoorloos". the suspense is very well built-up. you feel the frustration of rex, in search of any trace of what might have happened to his girlfriend saskia, after she entered a gas-station and never returned to his car. the search takes him three years, and when he finally gets in touch with the person who knows the truth about what happened to saskia, he must agree to undergo the same thing that saskia has undergone. the ending leaves you speechless in your chair....
