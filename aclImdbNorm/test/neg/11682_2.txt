hmmm, not a patch on the original from shaw brothers. the fighting is average and looks very clunky. the story line is as to be expected from a 70's kung fu film, confusing and daft. stupid voices for women,dubbed in posh english accents for men. i turned this off early and i love martial arts flicks. get the original, its so much better than this average movie, don't be fooled, i bought the wrong flick what i wanted was the shaw brothers movie. i have just started commenting, i'm only doing foreign and martial arts films this is just the beginning of my movie collection, i personally own most modern martial arts flicks. hope you don't waste time watching this one, its for die hard fans of 70's kung fu only.
