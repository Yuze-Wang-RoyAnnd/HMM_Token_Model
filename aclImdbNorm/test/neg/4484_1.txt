after reading the reviews i am so relieved to know that i am not the only person who was very disappointed in this movie! i am a huge nicholas sparks fan, have read all of his books, most of them more than once. of course i loved the notebook and a walk to remember...i haven't yet seen message in a bottle or nights in rodanthe so i can't comment on those...<br /><br />but i did go see dear john this past weekend and i was terribly upset! the movie was not good at all! when looking at the movie alone, and not thinking about the book at all, it was still a terrible movie. i did not get the rush and range of emotions from this movie that i have got from other movies i enjoyed, especially the notebook. i was not smiling and laughing and crying and worried and scared...ever! from the very beginning all i could notice was how they changed everything! the only thing about this movie that is similar to the book is that there is a guy named john who is in the military and a girl named savannah who is not....the part about his dad being obsessed with coins is about the only other part that went along with the book. everything else was totally off!!!! first of all, in the book, allen was tim's little brother, not his son! why they had to change that, i don't understand. it made a lot more sense how it went in the book when tim was just a little bit older than savannah and they grew up together and allen was savannah's inspiration for wanting to work with horses and autistic children....that didn't happen in the movie....ugh...and in the book they spent a lot more time together than just those initial 2 weeks and then the 1 night...why did they leave those times out??? i could go on and on and on but then i would run out of space! so basically, if you are a great fan of nicholas sparks, don't waste your time or money on this movie...just read the book again...because it's terrible and nothing like the book!
