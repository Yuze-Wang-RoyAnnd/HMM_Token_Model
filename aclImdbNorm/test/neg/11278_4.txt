for this movie, based off of a tv show, and a serious finale. i thought that it was a lousy way to end off a serious. 'm*a*s*h goodbye, farewell, and amen' was pretty good, but not this one. unless you really love the series (like myself) skip this movie.<br /><br />i was a loyal fan of the show even stevens, but the plot was too gimmicky, and dave coulier, man, that guy hasn't done anything good...well, ever. they shouldn't have used tim meadows, he's a great actor, but he was too good for the script.<br /><br />i thought the movie was pure cheese. i would give it a 4.5/10
