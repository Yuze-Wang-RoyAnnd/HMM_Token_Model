sometimes full moon makes entertaining movies. this isn't one of them. full moon is like a low-key troma. their movies aren't as violent or off the wall, but they're usually just as devoid of talent. the acting in this movie isn't terrible but the script is pretty bad, and overall it's pretty boring and it doesn't even contain any nudity (like many full moon movies) to somewhat redeem it. skip this one, and go rent "head of the family".
