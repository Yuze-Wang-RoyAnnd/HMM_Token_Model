this is the first recorded effort to put sound with a movie, and a the oldest that, obviously, is still in existence. this historic piece of film is the opening segment in the "more treasures of the natural archives" dvd.<br /><br />it's only a 15-second clip of a man playing a violin in front of a huge recording cylinder. next to him are two men dancing. near the end, another man walks on the stage. william dickson, the director of this experiment, is the violin player. this "movie" had several titles over the years but the sound experiment was not really a success. it took over 30 years from this point to the synchronize sight and sound to the point where something could be issued to the public for entertainment. however, this was a start, no matter how primitive it came off. <br /><br />for more of the technical information and history of this film process, see the other review here by "boba fett1138."
