red spectacles<br /><br />i loved avalon, i think this director has made some awesome demented visions of the future. this film however was boring pretentious crap. the opening scene showed great promise for what the cover art and description promise a surreal live action amimae style future noir. i feel i got that with avalon.<br /><br />with red spectacles i was only driven to feel a uncomfortable to desire to what the hell the point was. the film barely made sense to me and i could not care less about the people in it. this would all be ok if the film was effective art. while the opening scene looked interesting and the scene with the giant robot-suit person holding the giant machine gun in the rain looked cool, it did not watch the film worth watching.<br /><br />thumbs down.
