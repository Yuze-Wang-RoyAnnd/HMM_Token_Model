horrible horrible movie, i still can't believe my friend talked me into seeing this! no plot, bad acting, unfunny scenes, and very very stupid dialogue. all i have to say is that this movie is the worst movie i have seen and it's worse than halloween iii which i gave 0 stars too. so i give it 0 stars and a 0 out of 10, well on here a 1, but you get the point.
