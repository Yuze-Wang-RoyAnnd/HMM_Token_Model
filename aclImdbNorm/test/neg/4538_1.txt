this was an awful short film that tries to be funny in a dark way but wasn't funny at all. say at a film festival in chicago. it really is what the title says and i simply wasn't into it at all. the bad storytelling was what did it in. if you re-wrote it and re-shot it, it "might" work. this attempt fell in "the hole". horrible filmmaking.
