let me begin by saying that i had been eagerly anticipating this film's release for awhile. after finally getting the chance to see it last night, i'm sorry to say that i was incredibly disappointed. it's hard to imagine a film that could make last fall's "exorcist: the beginning" look good, but "dominion" does just that. no wait...it makes it look like a great film. <br /><br />perhaps i got myself too excited about this movie, and that contributed to the let down. after all, the idea that warner bros. was releasing two versions of what is essentially the same film within six months of each other was an exciting attraction. plus, i'm a huge fan of stellan skarsgard, and in true fashion he gives a great performance, despite the often ridiculous content of the film. on the other hand, the supporting cast in this film is abysmal. clara bellar seems to be capable of only one expression - blank stare, and delivers all of her lines with the same monotonous tone, while gabrielle mann's father frances is just ridiculous. the effects in this film are laughable at best and the sheer cheesiness of it all is enough to rob the film of any chance of being taken seriously. this movie brought about more stifled giggling than anything else, and with the exception of one really chilling shot that lasted about three-seconds and made my friend cover her eyes and whimper, it neglected to offer anything in the scare department either. i could go into more detail and possibly give away some spoilers, but frankly i'm too exhausted from thinking about how bad this film was to write all the things i'd love to say.<br /><br />the saddest part about the whole thing is that the basic idea that both versions of the film tried to give...a story about a priest who has lost his faith and then regains it after coming to terms with his troubled past...had huge potential, especially with skarsgard as leading man. unfortunately for us, that potential was wasted. go and see this film only if you're really curious about how it differs from the harlin version, but don't expect to see a good film or you'll regret wasting your money and two hours of your life. otherwise, be content with the version first released and move on.
