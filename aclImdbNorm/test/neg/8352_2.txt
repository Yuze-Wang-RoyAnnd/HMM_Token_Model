comparisons to the original series are inevitable. it's a shame diana rigg left the original show in the 1960's due to mistreatment on the part of the producers, and macnee probably regretted this as much as any fan - there's no telling how long the show might have lasted otherwise. linda thorson was ok as a replacement and her episodes still retained almost all of the quality and aspects of the rigg episodes - only the rigg/macnee chemistry was lacking. the new avengers should have been left on the shelf - a declining macnee, an annoying purdey, and a who the hell is this guy gambit. also, the humor was forced and poor - granted i only watched a few of the episodes, because that was all i could watch, but i think i got the idea. try as many might and do, it's nearly impossible to resurrect an old show as a new format or movie.
