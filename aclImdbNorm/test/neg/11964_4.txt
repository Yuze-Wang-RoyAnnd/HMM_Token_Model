this third installment in the scarecrow series is by far the best of the lot. i know, i know...but how good is it? well, let's not be silly. it's still pretty bad, but by comparison to the first two, it's a fine film. again shot on digital, with decent lighting and good camera work. <br /><br />****spoiler****<br /><br />when a college baseball team hazes new members, one is left in a diabetic coma. of course, they abandon him in a cornfield, tied to a scarecrow. in keeping with the legend, the boy's soul is transferred into the body of the scarecrow, which comes to life and wreaks terrible vengeance on, well, pretty much everyone. the co-eds drive to the beach, which is somehow very close to the cornfield. on the sunny beach, they are killed one by one by the whistling scarecrow. <br /><br />writer/director brian katkin does a credible job of bringing some much-needed drama to the film. unfortunately, the drama leaps over good and lands in common cheese. much of the acting was fair, but there were some really terrible bits, including an awful piece of poorly done lip-synching. some plot points were left mostly unresolved, and most were used to get someone alone so they could be slaughtered. again, better than the previous installments, but still lacking.
