it is easy for a movie that tries to be suspenseful to wind up being merely uninteresting. it happens quite often. not only is dark harbor uninteresting, but it is very poorly done. scene after scene is tacked on to an otherwise overdone premise. a troubled couple picks up a troubled stranger only to find more trouble.<br /><br />some movies build tension by building the story. dark harbor keeps adding on to its story but never building upon it. i was hoping that like other movies, the suspense would finally explode. it never does. also, the characters have no continuity from scene to scene. they may act one way in one scene, but then act a completely different way in another scene. at first, you think that they are merely out of character, but by the end you realize that they are not really characters at all. they are just props for the final twist. the final ten minutes try to be shocking. instead, it's rather lame and uninteresting. the only thing that was shocking to me was that the movie finally ended. at less than ninety minutes the movie still feels way too long.<br /><br />this isn't one of those low-budget gems. it's more like a counterfeit watch that breaks as soon as you take it home.
