i was not expecting a classic, but at least a funny film. there were only a few scenes that makes you laugh but nothing more. you don't scare it is full of american teen-slasher cliches and you can guess what will happen easily.<br /><br />but it tells much about a senior student in a turkish high-school. pressure of student selection exam (oss) that 3-hour-exam determines which university you'll go and thinking about the exam when a ghost is after you is not exaggeration. the movie is bad. don't waste your time to watch it.
