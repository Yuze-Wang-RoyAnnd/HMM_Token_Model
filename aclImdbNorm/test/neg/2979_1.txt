this feels like a feature-lenght treatment of a comedy-routine that could have also been told in a ten-minute short. also, technical credits are sup-par. the film really feels like a film school diploma project.<br /><br />the cast is a mix of seasoned stage pros and talented newcomers but the problems is the superficial scrip. their lines feel constructed, exactly like cued tv show material.<br /><br />the director fails to take his protagonists seriously, therefore we are not touched by their problems and conflicts.<br /><br />the film has been cleverly marketed and offers a unique selling point, but in the end the film disappoints on all levels.
