jealous husband holds car dealership hostage while williams burdens the viewer with his worn out mork shtick at every turn. yawn.<br /><br />pay channel grist. an uncommonly bad script coupled with a less than convincing robin williams as a slick talking, philandering queens car salesman caught up in a hostage workplace crisis. the laughs aren't there, the message(s) or morals are just all wrong, and the film cant ever decide on whether its a comedy or drama. pretty good cast all acting pretty badly. when a movie ages so badly so quickly, you got yourself a stinker. not much else to be said other than maybe, avoid at all costs. textbook mediocre movies like this are actually more tedious, and less enjoyable than the over the top bombs.
