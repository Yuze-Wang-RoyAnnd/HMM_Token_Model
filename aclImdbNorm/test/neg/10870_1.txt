this film is so bad it's hilarious. i watched hell ride half thinking it was a comedy, although i couldn't quite work out if they were actually taking the p*ss, or if this really was a serious attempt at making something decent. i notice it isn't listed here as a comedy so they must be serious! it's basically seems to be about a gang of pensioners who ride round on motorcycles shooting at each other and exchanging the most hilariously bad dialogue you can imagine. one scene inexplicably has two characters smashing bottles over each others heads, then showing each other 'get out of jail free' cards that they've made! also check out vinnie jones' accent, where the hell is he meant to be from?!? oh and there's a load of naked girls in it too, who for some unfathomable reason seem to want nothing more than to have none stop sex with these leathery skinned b*stards! the guy who wrote and directed it - a pee wee herman lookalike with a greeshan 2000'd beard and an orange sunbed tan - has for some reason cast himself in the lead role, maybe this is part of the joke, i don't know. actually, the more i think about it the more i'm sure this film is a p*ss take. it's produced by quentin tarantino and it's possible he's released this in humour as a bit of a laugh. it is a total rip off of tarantino's style, but just done really really badly. it is very amusing though, and i guess either way it could go down as a cult classic, either from being an amusing parody of the tarantino/rodriguez style, or something that is very very unintentionally funny. has to be seen to be believed.
