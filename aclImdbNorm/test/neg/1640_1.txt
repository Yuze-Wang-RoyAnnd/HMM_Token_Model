boooooooorrrrrinngggggggg and stooooooopiddddd. kept falling asleep. if you want to see miles o'keefe loping around in a furry speedo by all means rent this movie. if not please don't bother... rife with anachronisms. was this supposed to be set in the ice age, the iron age, the steel age or the age of reason? what was the reason for the black nylon wig on the guy dressed up as genghis khan? was that really supposed to be genghis khan? if ator had access to so much advanced technology and science why did we have wait another 1000 years for leonardo? it's never clear where ator comes from or if he's supposed to be some superior sort of being. you wonder if it was all explained in the first movie but after seeing this one you know you'll never bother.
