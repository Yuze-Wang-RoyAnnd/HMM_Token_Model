conquerer of shamballa shows what happens when creators of an anime fail to understand what their fans want. i as a fan did not want a 1920's evil nazi movie. what i would have liked to see is a real final showdown between ed and dante, as we don't really know what became of her. i also would have liked to get ed back to his world much sooner and have him stay there, to finally get a chance to be normal. you know, raise a family with a certain blonde mechanic, that sort of thing. no, instead i got a convoluted plot involving nazi mystics, fritz lang and about ten minutes of al, a joke of a cameo by roy mustang and only one armstrong joke, one short joke and no winry hitting ed with a wrench. above all, it just didn't feel like fullmetal alchemist to me.
