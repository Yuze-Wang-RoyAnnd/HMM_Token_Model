this looks decidedly like "the amateur" hour. how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's all wrong. why lance henriksen accepted this will remain one of the great mysteries of cinema. maybe he was in dire need for money or maybe be was under the influence of some illegal drug.<br /><br />it is pointless trying to explain you what this movie's about. it deals with the big foot legend but done in the worst possible manner. in fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.<br /><br />avoid at all costs! 0* out of 10*
