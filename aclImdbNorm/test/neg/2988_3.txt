silly and violent thriller that is a rip - off of 'deliverance' but without any charm and intelligence. the plot is ridiculous and the cast seems to be tired and anxious to be free of this obnoxious entry. this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way. it's a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this.
