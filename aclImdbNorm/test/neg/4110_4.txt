(synopsis) in the year 2055, the rich are able to travel back in time and hunt a live dinosaur for a huge price. sonia rand (catherine mccormack) has developed a machine that can take people back in time. charles hatton (ben kingsley) has taken this technology and opened a business know as time safari. anyone with the money can travel back millions of years and shoot a dinosaur. dr. travis ryer (edward burns) leads his team together with the big game hunter on a floating walkway to a spot where they can kill the dinosaur. the trip protocol is that they must stay on the walkway and not disturb the land or anything creature around them. unfortunately for the human race, one hunter steps on and kills a butterfly. this insignificant act causes major impacts to the earth's climate and creates new species of animal life. the course of evolution as we know it is now being changed by time waves. travis and sonia try to stop the changing process before it becomes permanent, and man becomes extinct.<br /><br />(comment) the movie was a little slow and the concept of going back in time and changing things was a little overdone. the death of a single butterfly causing the tremendous changes in the world's atmosphere and evolution is simply ridiculous. they changed the skyline of chicago to look modern, but the new cars of the future were silly looking. you can wait to see this fantasy on dvd.
