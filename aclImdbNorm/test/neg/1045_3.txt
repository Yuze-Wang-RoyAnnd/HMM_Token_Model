the twilight zone has achieved a certain mythology about it--much like star trek. that's because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner. they are the ones who score each individual show a 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the show. because of this, a while back i reviewed all the original star trek episodes (the good and the bad) because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive. now, it's time to do the same for the twilight zone.<br /><br />now i was very surprised when i saw reviews for this bland episode that described it as being "among the best" and gave it scores of 10. if this is the case, then why is it that everyone i know who has seen this episode hates it as much as i do? it's possible that me and my family and friends are all cranks but it's also possible this is yet another case of rabid fans rabidly inflating the rating on an average or below average episode.<br /><br />the episode itself stars william windom and others as various archetypes--a soldier, a dancer, etc. they are all stuck in a cylindrical room with no escape and only at the end do you realize the "shocking truth"--which isn't at all shocking and is in fact majorly lame. no, this is a badly written and unengaging episode. yes, there were plenty of episodes of the series that deserved a 10, but few as undeserving as this one due to a shallow script and an unappealing resolution.
