i saw this turkey in the theater, but i had a good time. the special effects aren't worthy of a grade school production. a toy boat, representing a freighter, moving at speedboat velocity on flat waters while wind driven fog blows in the opposite direction. the red and blue flood lamps add that extra dramatic touch. whatever cache vincent price was supposed to bring as narrator is completely overshadowed by dreadful production work. calling this a documentary is like calling britney spears a musician. about 20 minutes into this, something struck me as very funny. maybe it was price's overly dramatic intonation of the oft-used line "they vanished into the devil's triangle! [cut to black; next story] once i started laughing, my friends joined in. next time vinny said the crucial line, someone in the back yelled out: "good!" after that, it got almost as many laughs as a marx brothers film. nobody stayed for the dreadfully serious second feature "chariots of the gods."
