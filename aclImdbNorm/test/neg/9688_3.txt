i just wanted to say that i was very disappointed after seeing this movie! i was expecting a biblical story visualized with great special fx, etc. but during the film i found out that this was an absolute disaster... it wasn't biblical at all... only the boat and the animals were similar to the story... if you want a visual 'translation' of the bible version of noah then don't go watch this movie!
