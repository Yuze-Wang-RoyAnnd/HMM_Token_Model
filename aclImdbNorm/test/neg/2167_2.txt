"tales from the crapper" is gory, disgusting, tasteless, offensive, lowbrow and scatological. but that's ok, i was prepared for all that from my previous troma experiences. what i wasn't prepared for is that it's also witless, unfunny and boring. very little of the genuine anarchic spirit of films like "class of nuke'em high" has remained intact; in its place, we get endless fart jokes (to the point where you start wondering if lloyd kaufman is going senile, thinking that adults find loud farting so darn hilarious!) and a cynical, shameless exploitation of the viewer, who is essentially investing time and money to see a "film" that even kaufman himself seems to know should never have been released in the first place. oh yes, there is plenty of female nudity on display, but let's face it: the average porn film probably offers a better storyline, higher production values, funnier humor, and above all more respect for its intended viewer than this atrocity. <br /><br />p.s: kelly powers aka suzi lorraine (the blonde lesbian student in the "how to make your own movie" segment) is one of the most beautiful women i have ever seen.
