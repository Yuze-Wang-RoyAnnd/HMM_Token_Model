my wife invited my son and i to watch this on cable tv on a lazy saturday evening, thinking that it might show an unusual role for juliette lewis. on this promise, at least, the movie delivers: her character is ineffectual, adhering to nearly every slasher-type horror movie cliche. as does the movie. a cataloguing of its studied adherence to them would be an exercise in recall of something i hope to quickly forget, so i won't make one. basically, this is a whodunnit, heavy on the red herrings: everybody appears guilty, rather than just the two one suspects from the beginning. the "rule out the logical and obvious, and what's left is it" rule of bad horror movies works well on this one. the only surprise to have any impact on me was its final snagging of the indeterminate ending cliche: will jane keep her appointment with her attempted rescuer, who will tell her the (obvious to the audience) identity of the 2nd conspirator, propelling her into another round of hysterical victim-play. mercifully, i will never know.
