2001 wasn't perhaps eric roberts best year. both raptor and this came out. watched raptor a while ago and really thought it sucked and being erics worst. but that had it's share moment of fun and d-standard. this one doesn't have a thing.<br /><br />tommy lee thomas is the name of the probably worst actor in these days. the story lacks any punch and the whole thing feels even slower than a snail breaking in curves.<br /><br />the two thing that stands out are martin kove and eric roberts. you could argue about their effort being good or what but compared to the rest they are above all criticism.<br /><br />i say thank you roberts see you next time (and hopefully a better one).
