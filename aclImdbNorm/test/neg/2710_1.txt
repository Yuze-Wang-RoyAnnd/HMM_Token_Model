for people who have absolutely no idea of what a comedy is. that not only includes the people who liked this movie, but the people who made it. what could they possibly have been thinking? madonna playing judy holliday? please, she can't even play madonna (if there actually is a madonna). i hope griffin dunne was paid well. he deserved every penny he got, because if this didn't kill his career, nothing will. i'm sure that the few people who actually paid to see this movie left it feeling like their pockets had been picked. madonna is apparently past the point of feeling embarrassed by her virtually complete lack of talent as an actress, but you can't help feeling embarrassed for her anyway. she has no connection with the rest of the cast; it appears like she showed up on the set and said, "ok, i'm here, i'm gonna embarrass myself by doing the absolute worst judy holliday impression anyone's ever seen, now stay the hell out of my way" and then proceeded to do exactly that. i know the phrase "rotten madonna movie" is redundant, but it certainly fits this. it's painful to watch a totally inept and talentless "actress" make a complete fool of herself, but it apparently doesn't bother her, as she does it again and again.<br /><br />the only remotely funny thing about this "comedy" is that she actually managed to find people who gave her the money to make it. now that's funny.
