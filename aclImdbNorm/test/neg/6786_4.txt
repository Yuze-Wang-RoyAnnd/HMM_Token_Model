*spoilers!* when i first saw the preview for this, it looked like a good old fashioned hallmark movie. i love bluegrass music, so i couldn't wait to see it. when we rented the movie, we read the back and it sounded even better. the film was pretty boring for the first half, every now and then a song would be played. then (i'm embarrassed typing this)a lesbian love seen came in. i that ther was something more then friendship between the teachers but i certainly didn't expect nudity and prolonged make out sessions. i was watching this with my mother and i was quite embarrassed, because i picked this movie. but besides that, it was an okay movie. the acting was fine, the actress who played deladis was great. to be honest, the soundtrack was the best part of the movie. i don't care to see the movie again but i bought the soundtrack the day after i saw the movie. and there are continuation discs that follow. if i were you, i would skip the movie and just get the music.
