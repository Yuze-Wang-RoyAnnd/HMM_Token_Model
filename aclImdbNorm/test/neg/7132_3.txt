let me start off by saying that i loved the original grudge. it was bar none one of the scariest, most hair-rising experiences i've ever had in a filled movie theatre. i'm not kidding. being a self-declared japanophile also made the flick look better in my eyes (if the setting had been changed to some american suburb i probably would've ended up hating the film).<br /><br />that said... this movie is a complete mess! i won't say it sucks, because a) the movie does have some good points, b) "it sucks" is the lamest put-down in the history of lame put-downs. so what does the movie have going for it? well, for starters it has a pretty cool look: through filters and the use of bleak, washed-out colours, takashi shimizu almost recreates the downbeat, angst-ridden atmosphere of the original. a few scenes are genuinely shocking and unpredictable. unfortunately, the rest of the film is just plain bad. period.<br /><br />the story is all over the place, needlessly told tarantino style, i.e. the scenes are out of chronological order. this technique is pointless in the case of this movie and it merely makes things more confusing. frankly, a straightforward plot would've worked better. the original was also lacking plot-wise, but it did make sense and the film more than made up for its thin plot with lots of scares and a genuinely tense atmosphere. grudge 2 has none of these elements and is just a waste of time.<br /><br />let's not forget the tv-show acting skills which make the cast of the original grudge look like emily watson and katherine hepburn. simply put, the movie doesn't work. it's too slow, too dull, and just not scary enough to make up for the confusing plot (which adds nothing new to the story, by the way, so not even grudge fans will be pleased).<br /><br />oh, and what is it with the old man playing japanese peek-a-boo on the bus?? is this supposed to be comic relief? artistic statement? or what?
