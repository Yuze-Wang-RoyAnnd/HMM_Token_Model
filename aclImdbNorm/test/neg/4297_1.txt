as a flying and war movie buff, this ranks at he bottom of my list. it is historically completely inaccurate and the cast sounds and acts like they just stepped out of a high-school play. the acting, script, direction, production standards and casting are all garbage. the only saving grace is some of the flying sequences. if the people they portray were fictitious, i might rate it a 2, but if there is one thing that annoys me more than anything else in movies, it is pretending that this is history and that the great people they are trying to be, actually did this! its almost as if they tried to write in as many notable ww1 personalities as possible.there are many good ww1 flying films and this is not one of them.
