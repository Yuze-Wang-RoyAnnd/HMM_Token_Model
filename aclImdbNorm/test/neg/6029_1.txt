this is the worst war movie i have ever seen, possibly the worst ever made. i find it incredible that some people have actually rated it as a 10. it has a stunning lack of even rudimentary traces of realism. almost every war movie cliche appears in this film and is done badly. on the other hand, i wouldn't have watched it to the end if it hadn't been so remarkably bad that it amused me.
