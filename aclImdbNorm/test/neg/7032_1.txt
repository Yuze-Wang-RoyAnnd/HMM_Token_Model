i am a huge shirley temple fan. when i saw this movie, it made me appreciate what a talented child shirley actually was. ashley rose orr made possibly the worst on-screen shirley. imagine an 11 year old playing shirley temple from the age of 5. that in itself is wrong. but getting her to 'mimick' shirley's voice? and her singing is woeful. the dancing was good, i'll say that. as previous users have said, there was little dramatic scenes, nothing to make the story interesting. not even amelia earhart... i would have liked to have seen more of the world wide phenomenon that shirley temple created. there was too much focus on the wizard of oz, when in reality, shirley was just considered for dorothy. the film portrays it as though it is the end of the world when she does not get the role. shirley herself said that she is glad judy garland got to play her. for me the star of the show was the lady who played gertrude temple. otherwise, stay away! for great shirley temple films, watch heidi, poor little rich girl and little miss broadway.
