if you just watched all dogs go to heaven, and learn that there's a sequel, don't watch it. it's horrible. it's absolutely awful. they rush the characters to develop. sasha, for example, begins singing about how you can count her out for love. and at the end, this seems more like a dramatic romance flick than a comedy-adventure film. they rip charlie out of his character and replace him with a gushy, soft, but still rebellious version of himself.<br /><br />the humor behind carface's character is just completely lost. he's a totally different dog. he doesn't have a cool voice anymore, he isn't that villain you love to hate anymore, he's just a wimp voiced by none other than mermaid man from spongebob. speaking of voice actors..<br /><br />charlie has a completely different voice. and while it isn't horrible, i don't like it. it's terrible in comparison to the excellent job that burt reynolds did for the character in the first film. dom deluise is wonderful as always, as itchy. that character stays true, and that's why this film gets a 3/10. purely because dom deluise was still voicing itchy.<br /><br />oh, and my last complaint. i know ann-marie's movie was done and gone, she has parents now, etc, but did charlie completely forget about her, or what? no mention at all of her in the second film. i mean, even a small mention from itchy would have been acceptable. (ex. "charlie, we have to get back. you can't take care of every kid that needs rescuing.) or something of the sort. i mean, he died living with her, she deserves some kind of mention.<br /><br />don't watch this if you're looking for a wonderful sequel.
