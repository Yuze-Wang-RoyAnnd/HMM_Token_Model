as the title suggests there is a philosophical, meritocratic thread running through this film: if a man has the talent and looks to find his way into society and money what might be the outcome if he is denied it for failing to have the x factor? this question is unsatisfactorily dealt with in this adaptation of patricia highsmith's book and left me rather cold along the way.<br /><br />matt damon is the ripley of the title and apart from blagging his way on a funded jaunt to europe falls under the spell of his commissioned target, dickie greenleaf (law). homoeroticism and social insecurity get all tangled up in a violent conflagration which escalated and complicate themselves for the rest of the movie. law, damon and the damningly pleasant paltrow as dickie's girlfriend are ok. i liked philip seymour hoffman's cameo-ish freddie miles, the bluff society friend that ripley can never be. the problem is that the story is lumpen without arc - or redemption, for that matter - which makes it rather difficult to swallow. 4/10
