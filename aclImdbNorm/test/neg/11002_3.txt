the fanglys is set in a small texan town called layton on the eve of halloween as the townspeople treat it like the second coming of christ or something, i mean halloween isn't that important is it? anyway, sheriff pete (burton gilliam) has been called out to yet another murder as local boy ned (co-associate producer john william galt) has discovered a body in the local woods. could it be the fang lady (justin hamilton)? the central character involved in a local legend about a witch who kills teenagers, who knows? being the fun sort of guy he is mark (asisstant director & producer robert harvey) convinces his missus kelly (laurie reeves) to ride out to a cemetery that his mate steven (josh gobin) found the night before for a halloween party. the idea of spending the night in a cemetery in the middle of the woods obviously appeals to kelly & she agrees, along with steven & a girl he picked up named camille (natalie woods) & their nerdy friend jerry (tim boswell) they all set out for a night of fun, well as much fun as you can expect to have in an isolated cemetery. however they soon discover that the legend of the fang lady is far from the bedtime story many make out...<br /><br />edited, executive produced, written & directed by christopher abram the fanglys is a pretty rubbish attempt at a horror film. the script is very predictable, dull & doesn't deliver any sort of entertainment value whatsoever, in the right hands & with a decent budget the fanglys could have been an effective horror film but as it is it isn't. it moves along at a fair pace but the on-screen 'action' is so poor that it doesn't matter, i don't quite know what else to say other than the fanglys is a really bad film & i can't see anyone getting any sort of enjoyment out of it. the dialogue is basic, the character's are clich'ed & lifeless while as a whole the film seems a lot longer than the 90 minutes running time. there are a few lame attempts at humour which don't sit that well along side the horror elements & what was that retard keeping in that cage? i'd imagine the budget didn't allow the filmmakers to show it. oh, if you want to know what happens to jerry at the end then you'll have too keep watching past the end credits as the lame truth is revealed, assuming you can actually make it that far of course (believe me it takes some doing).<br /><br />director abram doesn't do anything special. abram thinks bathing scenes in neon light is stylish, i can tell him that it isn't when your film is supposed to be set in the woods. there's no atmosphere, scares, tension, excitement or any of the elements that makes a good horror film good. forget about decent gore, there's a bit when someone eats some skin off an arm & a pitchfork stuck through someones throat.<br /><br />apparently the fanglys had a filming budget of $2,837 which makes it one of the lowest budget films ever to have a commercial release, & to be brutally honest it shows. what about the retarded guy & his false joke shop teeth that look ridiculous? the terrible special effects, the camcorder cinematography & the terrible acting from everyone involved that makes it even more of a pain to sit through.<br /><br />the fanglys is straight-to-video crap, it has no redeeming features whatsoever & it's low imdb user rating score is fully justified, it's one of those films that within half an hour i was looking at the clock & wishing the thing would just finish.
