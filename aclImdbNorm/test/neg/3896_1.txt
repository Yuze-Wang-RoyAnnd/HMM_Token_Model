this is definitely one of the weaker of the series of carry on films. it lacks the usual fun and sparkle and even the cast seem embarrassed by the poor dialogue. by the time this came out, the series was in terminal decline and boy does it show! if you're coming fresh to this series, avoid this one till near the end.
