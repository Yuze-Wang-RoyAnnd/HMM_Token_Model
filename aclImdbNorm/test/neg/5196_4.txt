this must be one of the most annoying, arrogant, poser films i've ever seen. what a waste of budget and actors. angelopoulos has reached new levels of pretentiousness. it is clear there is virtually no plot, even if this part of greek history is material for great movies. he simply had some supposedly symbolic (actually shambolic) scenes in his mind and he built a whole movie around them. death is the main theme and is repeated ad nauseam, along with litanies, processions and the like, which should only be a vehicle for the movie but unfortunately it is the movie itself. a totally incoherent result, which can only leave you saying "huh?" or "oh dear" every two minutes. <br /><br />there is no character development at all, nada, zilch. i'm usually complaining about some movies having two-dimensional characters, but oh boy, he managed to create one-dimensional characters. this is irritating for us and degrading for some of the actors. he even managed to make one of my favourite greek actors, giorgos armenis, seem wooden. <br /><br />and going to the core of angelopoulos film-making: no we're not idiots. we do not want chewed food. please someone tell this guy symbolism has to be subtle. theo do you really underestimate your audience so much or you're simply incompetent? personally, i think he tried to make a greek "underground". no matter how he tries, he can't reach kusturica.<br /><br />only saving grace: photography, costumes and the music.
