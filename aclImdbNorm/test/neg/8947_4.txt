great acting, great production values, good direction.<br /><br />but the script starts out with great pacing and interest in the first half and then falls apart in the second half. we're clear on character and motivation for the first half but then the second half leaves many questions unanswered.<br /><br />the conflicts raised are compelling but the follow-through is weak. for instance, we're very clear that rudyard kipling is pro-war but we don't know if that philosophical stance changes through the course of the film.<br /><br />this is the sort of picture that makes me want to look up the facts in history books. i don't feel i can rely on the film to get a clear idea.<br /><br />the depiction of the war itself is heart-breakingly accurate, though the women's lack of enthusiasm doesn't reflect the war hysteria that swept britain at the time. perhaps this is historically accurate; like so much in this film, i simply don't know.
