this was a very good show. i enjoyed the construction of real time and flashback, seeing the old diggers meeting again and recalling the terrors of their captivity in changi pow camp. the main problem with the way the show was written is that the scenes of life in changi are more like a holiday camp than what the place must have been like. i am old enough to remember film footage of the men being liberated from changi and other japanese pow camps. no actor could lose enough weight to have a resemblance of the state of those men. they made the jews of belsen look like sumo wrestlers. i have met several veterans from changi over the years. many would never ride in a japanese car, let alone own one. the physical and mental torture those men endured was too horrific for them to even talk about. what percentage survived? john doyle might be ok writing comedy for "roy and hg" (i hate that too) but this is a serious sugar coating of history that should never have been tolerated. i'm happy for satirists to write "the life of brian" and make fun of the crucifixion because it is obviously comedy, even if some consider it to be in bad taste. "changi" is written as a portrayal of a real event and, as such, might be regarded by younger people as a true record. great performances by a fine cast cannot redeem this lightweight screenplay.
