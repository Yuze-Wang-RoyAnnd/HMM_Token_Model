the critics were like "a movie that will break your heart" etc. so a friend of mine and i had great expectations when we decided to watch this movie.<br /><br />i'll make it short and leave it up to others to write about its content. this movie tries to touch you, to reach your heart. but it fails. at least for me. and for my friend, too.<br /><br />everything that happened happened only on the screen. it was always there, not here, where i am. i thought most of the time "hmm, something's happening on the screen, but it's only on the screen. it's not real."<br /><br />movies which succeeded much better in touching me: east of eden (1955), terms of endearment (1983), jerry maguire (1996), babe (1995), mies vailla menneisyytt"a (2002)
