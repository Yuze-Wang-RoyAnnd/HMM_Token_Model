and one of 'em are bad movies. the title, as it turns out, refers to a killer of the human male variety, not fish. this is not the dante-directed "piranha" of '78 (which did have the fish) and is also known as "piranha, piranha." a trio of photographers, 2 men and a woman, hook up with a local hunter/trapper named caribe somewhere in the amazon jungle. unfortunately, they are not familiar with the film resume of william smith, who plays caribe; otherwise, they would have known immediately he is the villain of the piece. smith may have also refused to film the ending or cut out before they finished filming (see end of this comment).<br /><br />as mentioned elsewhere, this pic has a lot of filler - lengthy shots of the local wildlife (birds) - and the central set piece, a motorcycle race, which goes on too long. the reason this gets a second star from me is, of course, william smith, who can't really save this sludge, but once again proves why he was the 'go to' guy 30-35 years ago if you needed a really nasty villain; at his best, smith could be really terrifying. he's the type who enjoys killing, possibly in sadistic fashion, and you get that sense from the evil grin he usually puts on when a mood strikes him. physically, he's very imposing, and you know the other 3 characters are pretty much doomed within the first half-hour. this was what smith brought to most of his roles; it seems hopeless for the other characters against this manlike monster. unfortunately, the movie continues to muddy things up to the very end, as if a minute of footage was lost - a confusing, incomplete climax.
