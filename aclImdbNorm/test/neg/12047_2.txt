tediously long dreary cinematic waffle. i couldn't believe how bad this film was. i watched it merely because of the numerous people who gushed about it on this site. was i watching the same film? the entire episode is one-dimensional. nothing that happened in garps' past affected his (or anyone else's) future and no-one was affected by their past. i think it was socrates who said about plays that if a scene can be removed from a play without having any effect, then it shouldn't be there. obviously, the director didn't know this rule and, so, stuffed his 'work' with one dire scene after another. even the plane crashing into the house was unexpected, it wasn't a surprise, but it was unexpected!<br /><br />it is worth mentioning that at the time of writing this (1st dec 2002), even though many people say it is one of their favourite films, no one has bothered to add a memorable quote. the reason being that there simply aren't any.<br /><br />don't waste your time watching this, watch a plank warp instead.
