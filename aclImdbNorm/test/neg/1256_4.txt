well, the movie was no terrible, but whomever created the screen play did not do a good job of even creating the essence of unger. this movie was slightly below average and did not tell the story correctly on one of the most interesting persons ever born. i suggest reading the book "one of a kind" the real unger story. they left out huge parts of his life. they also at times did not understand the real caractor that he was. the actual facts of his life were at times out of order. and in the end they really did not portray the actual personality that he did have. so please don't watch the movie; read the book. by the way i'm not just some prick who feels you have to stay 100% to the real story, but they did not even come close!!!
