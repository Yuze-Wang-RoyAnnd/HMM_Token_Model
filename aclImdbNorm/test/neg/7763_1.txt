"sex and the city" has some great things going for it. the problem is that it's saddled with a number of negatives that really hurt the ultimate rating and review for its' six seasons.<br /><br />the good things about "satc" is that a lot of the conversations ring true to life, the romance stories are interesting, and the characters are fun.<br /><br />the bad things is that few women act like complete whores. these four women have so many partners, even going lesbian in some episodes, that you have no choice but to roll your eyes at the utter absurdity. men on the show are for the most part depicted as shallow, degenerates, liars, cheats, and buffoons. the foul language these women use is far in excess as to what a normal conversation entails. why do the writers do these things? clearly, to be over-the-top and to get your attention.<br /><br />another thing that bothered me (without spoiling) is how some of the relationships ended. they simply didn't ring real to me or to others i discussed this with.<br /><br />but, even though i gave the show 2 stars, in the end, i'm glad i watched the show. i've actually watched every season multiple times. i do recommend the show to anyone that won't be offended by strong profanity and soft-core pornography. i could have done less with the offensive language and the nudity and sex acts but the romance was very good and the saga ends pretty well.
