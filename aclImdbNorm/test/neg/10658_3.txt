two redeeming qualities of this film were the cinemaphotography and a storyline that was hard to resist. however, the script, the direction, and some scenes, were just awful. i kept asking myself why such a good cast would have produced such a bad movie. my only conclusion was that these actors must believe in the charity which underlies the plot of the movie, but knew the movie was filled with flaws.<br /><br />this film could have been so much better, and reached a larger audience accordingly. what makes me think this is that with all of the problems of the film, some scenes being painfully bad to watch, i still wanted to see how the obvious conclusion would resolve itself.
