yes, said title line does actually appear in this movie. why? i'm not sure. when the line was actually being said, didn't somebody in the crew filming, at some point, laugh? i would have liked to see the outtakes from this movie, mostly because i think they would be more entertaining than the movie itself.<br /><br />helmed by director jim gillespie, ("i know what you did last summer,") comes a teen slasher movie that seems to assume we haven't ever seen a teen slasher movie before. of course, he's not to be given all the blame. there are also three writers responsible, and this is somehow based on a video game that's still in production. the title of said game is "backwater," but upon looking for information on it i came up with absolutely nothing.<br /><br />and so we begin the movie... i would like to say before i continue that i wasn't expecting this to win an oscar. when i am in the right mindset, i enjoy a fun horror movie to pass the time. i think there exists an opportunity for an effective, original, and smart slasher movie. "venom" is not this movie.<br /><br />there is almost no character development at all. that's fine. you don't expect a whole lot. however, instead of a well-knit cast of a few, this movie decides to introduce us to the following many horror movie clich'e characters...<br /><br />1. the final girl: she has just broken up for her boyfriend. this means that at some point in the movie when they are in peril, they will decide to get back together again. which more than likely means he will die and she will be the last remaining survivor of the movie. "eden" is played by agnes bruckner, without much enthusiasm, i might add.<br /><br />2. the boyfriend: he's just around to co-exist with the final girl until his demise. sure, he can save her, but he's doomed and we know it. "eric" is played by jonathan jackson.<br /><br />3. the bimbos: usually horror movies only feel the need for one of these, but here we have two. they shoplift, they steal, they might show their breasts, (not in this case,) or they might possibly be alcoholics. a staple of the genre. they also wander around in dimly lit areas all on their lonesome, usually saying things like, "hello? is there anybody there?" "tammy" and "patty," suitably named, are played by bijou phillips and davetta sherwood.<br /><br />4. the jackass: sure, he looks pretty, but he's the idiot in the movie that's inserted purely to be an idiot. he says stupid things, does stupid things, has obviously never seen a horror movie, and is one of enjoyable kills you watch this kind of thing for. "sean" is played by d.j. cotrona.<br /><br />5. the girlfriend: she loves the jackass even though pretty much nobody else does, and she's usually the one left alive for a while so she can scream and cry until she starts tripping and gets left behind. "rachel" is played by laura ramsey.<br /><br />6. the creepy janitor: in this case, the creepy gas station attendant. enough said. "ray" is played by rick cramer.<br /><br />i could continue, but i think you get the picture. the remaining characters aren't so much common as they are equally killable. there's "the gay guy," (pawel szajda as "ricky,") who definitely got robbed as far as screen time is concerned, and "the one who knows what's going on." of course none of that matters, because at first everyone always thinks that one's crazy. "cece" is played by meagan good.<br /><br />there are a couple other characters, namely a deputy played by method man, but he and others are killed off pretty quickly and get even less character development than the following clich'es.<br /><br />so, you're probably thinking, "why does this movie require such a deep analysis? it's just a summer horror flick, for cryin' out loud!" based on that question, does it deliver the goods? yes, and no. the acting isn't particularly convincing, even given the amount of talent involved. bijou phillips was hailed for her performance in larry clark's bully, and agnes bruckner has been an up-and-coming talent for a while now.<br /><br />so, what about the gore? there's some. that's really about it. a lot of the juiciest bits are cut-aways. namely a scene involving somebody's face and a sandblaster used to remove paint from cars.<br /><br />to the filmmaker's credit, there are a couple interesting scenes. i liked the bit where part of a house was literally ripped off so that the unstoppable villain could get to the characters.<br /><br />if this had all been centered around a smarter screenplay in which the characters didn't make the same dumb mistakes literally hundreds of horror movie characters had made before them, it might have made for a more enjoyable experience. all of the most interesting characters are immediately killed off in the first third of the movie and then it just becomes a not-particularly-interesting countdown until we know it's just the creepy janitor and the final girl.<br /><br />i suppose i must be a little jaded, but as a horror film fan, i'm left wondering why i should have bothered when i could easily have written a better screenplay myself. i won't even mention the numerous instances of terrible cgi.
