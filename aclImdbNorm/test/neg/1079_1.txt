i must admit, i was against this movie from the outset but i tried my hardest to be impartial, i really did, but the very idea of remaking a sophisticated, witty, entertaining, quirky british classic full of character has to be dubious from the outset.<br /><br />people in my house were watching this so i swallowed my pride and told myself to be professional about films (i have studied them at uni after all).<br /><br />as expected for an american film of this sort, the movie began with a chase which wasn't bad. indeed, many of the action sequences are credible and this alone lifts the mark.<br /><br />yet the characterisation was abysmal, the set-pieces could very easily have been spliced from any american schlock blockbuster you might have had the misfortune to watch and it lacked all character.<br /><br />seeming to take a skewed angle on the original film with a failed initial robbery, the us version does the predictable thing and introduces an emotional factor with the death of donald sutherland's character. this allows our us cousins plenty of opportunity for sycophantic, dewy-eyed vengeance-seeking against the 'evil-doers' which it milks to predictable excesses. this is never more so evident as in the scenes featuring charlize theron (oh pretty! oh so pretty! look at her pretty, wounded bambi eyes, everyone!) which were thoroughly nauseating. her entrance scene, particularly, was like something out of resident evil or tomb raider which were both a) more entertaining and b) had better beginnings because they couldn't mess up a game like they could with british cinema which was already chock-full of spark, people you genuinely feel something for and moments of inspiration. but i digress, the whole inclusion of a pretty girl for the sake of it just seems like the most ham-fisted manoeuvre i've seen in some time and exposes cynical hollywood blockbuster-lust for what it is.<br /><br />if you like any of these actors, by the way, and you agree with any of the above comments, do not go to see this film! if i had the opportunity of watching 'fight club' or 'american history x' after seeing ed norton in this, i would have declined. likewise jason statham with 'lock stock' (and i suppose 'the transporter' is okay if you like that sort of thing).<br /><br />sadly, all the set-pieces are designed in the most transparent possible way to get you thinking, 'wow! he's smart!', 'coo! he's cool!', 'hey! what a tough guy!'. then there's the 'funny pc guy' who has 'comic relief' splattered across his forehead but whose humour content can be anticipated two minutes in advance. to be honest, if you've seen one or two films like it, you might easily confuse the two as clones from the jerry bruckheimer stable. not that jerry is irredeemably awful, by the way, but he just uses the clich'es to excess as everyone knows (or should).<br /><br />this is where i have to come clean. i didn't manage to make it to the end, so i couldn't even say whether the brilliant ending in the michael caine version made it but, i'm sorry, it's just one of those extremely rare films that, if i'd seen it at a cinema, i would have walked out and staged a small protest outside. it's not just that it is another identical by-the-numbers ocean's 14 or something (ocean's eleven was fine but don't bother with the rest!) with all the glitz, glamour, fake sass and pantomime heroics of such a film but i couldn't recognise anything from the original at all.<br /><br />so, if you are expecting 'the italian job' and not 'ocean's 14' albeit badly written with a less established cast and characters, some disingenuous elements and cardboard cut-out script-writing then do not watch! i don't mind people liking a bit of mindless fun but this is a criminal hatchet-job that does not deserve in any way to parade itself under the title of a classic. seriously, show some pride! i felt thoroughly justified in my outraged and sickened reaction when i first heard that the film would be made. avoid at all costs!<br /><br />p.s. some of the action sequences aren't bad at all so add an extra '1' to the mark if you like this sort of thing.
