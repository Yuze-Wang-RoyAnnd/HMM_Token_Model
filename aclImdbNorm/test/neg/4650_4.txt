this is a treat for fans of z-grade movies. here you will find writing and acting bad enough to rival anything ed wood ever produced. veteran bad movie actor cameron mitchell is a former makeup man from "paragon studios" who, after a nasty acid-in-the-face incident at a social gathering, becomes an embittered mad scientist (tm) with a rubber scar on his face who takes revenge by kidnapping paragon actors and turning them into living statues in his secret laboratory (tm) handily located in the local wax museum. or are they zombies who do his bidding? he's not sure. <br /><br />happily, many of your favourite movie clich'es are here. check out the villain's lab! are those mysterious steaming vats of liquid? test tubes of coloured water with no explained purpose? yay! and what ho, do we see spare arms and legs arranged kinda casual-like on a wooden rack? you betcha! marvel at the bumbling detectives acting with straight out of plan nine! now, enjoy a stupidly tame car chase, and hear more dizzy bimbo screaming than you could possibly want. raise an eyebrow at the screwy plot line, made even more opaque by the totally meaningless ending that seems to have no connection to the rest of the movie. <br /><br />cheesy trash and much fun for the bad movie connoisseur.
