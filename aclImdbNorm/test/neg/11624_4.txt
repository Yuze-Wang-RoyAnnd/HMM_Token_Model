i was disappointed with the sequel to the swan princess. i can see what they were trying to do with the story, show how married life was going for odette and derek but the story wasn't interesting enough to hold my attention and it seemed to cover the same bases as the original.<br /><br />it isn't funny. the only bit i found humorous was when jean-bob was turned into a prince and then back into a frog and no-one saw it happen and he was trying to convince them that it really did.<br /><br />the villain is rubbish and the animation isn't as impressive as the first film.<br /><br />the queen is a very irritating character and instead of cheering with derek to rescue his mother, you're hoping that the villain puts a spell on her voice box to stop her talking.<br /><br />it is a shame because i really liked the first movie but it didn't live up to my expectations.
