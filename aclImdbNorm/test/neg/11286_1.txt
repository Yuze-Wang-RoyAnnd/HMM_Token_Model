cobb. it sucked. i learned nothing about the man i had not heard before. the performances were over the top. a scene where cobb and al are driving down a snowy road in search of women in reno has to be one of the worst conceived scenes in recent memory. it's just plain stupid and unentertaining. the flashback sequences were terrible. and they used the same sequences over and over and over again. if i saw the same shot of cobb fighting with someone at a base one more time, i would have become physically ill. by watching this 'movie', we get to learn nothing of what it was like in cobb's era. we learn nothing about his relationship with his players, nothing about his days as a manager, nothing about his relationship with his family members, other than that `they don't like him'. i thought when i sat down to view this film i would learn something about the era of baseball in which cobb played. instead, all i got to see was a retread of how cobb hated everything and everyone, and how they hated him. boy, what a great movie (sarcasm intended). cobb is portrayed as a constant liar in the film, so which one of his stories is supposed to be accurate? who knows? who cares? no one will after viewing this piece of crap. if you decide to rent this film, make sure the fast forward button on your vcr is working, as you will be tempted to use it repeatedly. hopefully someday someone will make a good film about ty cobb. i liked this film about as much as the people in it liked cobb, which is to say - i hated it. now i know why i found it in the rent one get one free section of the video store. i think i will ask for my fifty cents back from the video clerk, since i can't get back the time i wasted watching this trash. oh well, what could i have possibly been thinking about a movie that would feature robert wuhl.
