yet another cookie-cutter movie about a hardened adult who meets an adorable, street-smart kid (cop and 1/2, gloria, etc). and once again, it is not funny or interesting, for anyone to watch - kids or adults. i'm sure some people might find this movie amusing, but i have no earthly idea why. once again, i feel sorry for the poor kids who were forced to work in this movie, so that everyone else and their parents could make some bucks at the price of a cheesy cheesy movie.
