it's hard to tell who this film is aimed at; the characterisation and style smacks of a "children's itv" series crossed with an aussie soap, yet the subject matter, nudity, and language aims it at an older audience.<br /><br />the first half-hour has the heroine justine philosophising about losing her virginity, and is excruciatingly embarrassing to anyone over 18. a complete rip-off of "ferris bueller", from the talking-at-the-camera bit down to the on-screen graphics.<br /><br />her nerdy friend chas brings her to a computer fair where an explosion during the use of a virtual reality machines turns her into a man. or actually, creates a male alter-ego of her, called jake. don't look at me like that; i'm just relating it the way it was shown.<br /><br />after this the film is mildly amusing for a while; amongst all the drama-school mugging, only rupert penry-jones brings a real comic touch to his woman-trapped-in-a-man's-body role of jake. there's some funny scenes with jake dealing with his new body, and new feelings; nothing you haven't seen before, but then in this film you'll clutch at anything that's entertaining.<br /><br />unfortunately justine and jake meet up, and hilarious antics ensue (i wish), involving the owners of the virtuality machine who want to kidnap jake in order to have sex with him, or examine him, or something. anyway, it's just an excuse to fill an extra half hour with some explosions and car chases; for such a cheap looking movie, the explosions come often and loud, suggesting the money was spent in all the wrong places.<br /><br />in the end, the heroine realises she can't fall in love with herself, deletes her alter ego, and ends up in a one-night stand with the nerd to lose her virginity (this presumably is what is meant to pass for a happy ending in the 90s). but only after he removes his glasses and puts some hair gel and a leather jacket on; god forbid she actually have sex with someone who _looks_ like a nerd. of course, this is a bit subversive - in these days of pc movies which tell you to love and be yourself, and that everyone is special in their own way, it's refreshingly reactionary to have a film which screams "conform!" at you, and treats virgins and nerds with the contempt they deserve.<br /><br />the characterisation is simple dire; the nerd is very nerdy (room full of computers, thick glasses, social retardism, virginity, no leather jacket), there's a slut, she's very slutty (blonde, tight dresses, orange tan, vampy accompanying music), there's a jock, he's very... well, you get the picture. you can get away with this kind of characterisation in a broad comedy, but "virtual sexuality" isn't very funny. it's only mildly amusing in parts, and excruciating in others. it takes a lot for a woman as cute as justine (played by laura fraser) to annoy me, but she manages it.<br /><br />don't be fooled by the title; there's absolutely nothing erotic about the film, and it doesn't deal with the topics of how the new communications technologies are changing the way we view and acquire relationships (unless you actually think there _is_ a chance your playstation might blow up and change your sex).<br /><br />
