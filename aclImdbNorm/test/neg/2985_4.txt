sometimes you just have to have patients when watching indie horror. if you can just toe-tap your way through the slow-paced early scenes, sometimes a real gem will present itself... this (unfortunately) was not the case with "satan's whip".<br /><br />written and directed by jason maran, "satan's whip" attempts to drag us along on a boring snore-fest of a film, with no real pay off at the end. i'm guessing that the black & white (and blue) cinematography must have been for a reason, however it is never explained why the majority of the blood is blue, and i found this increasingly annoying as the film went on. the story in itself is not that bad, and actually had some originality and decent content but the acting is simply pathetic. this, combined with the slow-pacing and lack of any real (red) gore made "satan's whip" one to forget quite quickly. i will give it a "4" rating for some witty dialog that made me chuckle, but alas that could not save this boring waste of my time.
