when i think about tv movies, i always think of this film, i have watched it a few times on sky movies, it was terrible.<br /><br />its been a long time, since i have seen this film, was just browsing, and came across it on here :-s.<br /><br />a microbiologist (linda flemming), goes on holiday, with her son (william flemming), at this holiday resort kinda place, they meet up with paul johnson (taxi driver / owns a bar?), and kathy johnson.<br /><br />its like a weird romantic thing, william starts to fall for kathy, and paul falls for linda.<br /><br />some guy passes out in a street, he has some mark on his arm, joseph (joseph was a deep sea diver, who on some dive, saw a light, or something, and converted to religion), says he will take care of this person, there is a gap in my memory, then there is a wide out break of the virus, i think linda offers her help, to come up with a cure, kathy gets infected (william notices a mark on kathy's arm), with the virus, also does joseph.<br /><br />paul says some lines to joseph, then joseph stumbles away, the next time you see joseph, he is cured some how, that information is used to cure the infected, then there is a beach party, the end.
