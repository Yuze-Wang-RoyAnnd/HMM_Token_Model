stylized hollywood westerns, full of familiar conventions, seem to have eternal life and this is an avatar. everything in it seems to have been scraped out of the back of a drawer from 1939, a larger budget applied, and this production its issue.<br /><br />gary cooper has played this sort of role dozens of times -- the displaced southerner, fast on the draw and firm with honor, though kinda easy going whenever possible. he plays blayde hollister who travels to texas looking for the gang who destroyed his cotton plantation. he wears a buckskin-fringed shirt and packs two ivory-handled six shooters. he speaks with a countrified accent -- "a feller could get hurt doin' this." (cf., "sergeant york.") the gang is led by sneering raymond massey, who buys and sells land, usually by underhanded means whenever possible. the gang includes steve cochran, who cannot play a westerner though he's very good at scum bags in general. the requisite woman is ruth roman, daughter of the mexican plantation owner, who looks and speaks about as mexican as a boston brown betty.<br /><br />i don't think i'll bother too much with the plot. no doubt someone has gone into it in some detail and it's not worth much more mention. as in any 1939 western, it's labyrinthine. everyone except cooper and his friends are underhanded and there are multiple double crosses and switched identities and hidden secrets.<br /><br />everything is retro. the plot, the dialog, the wardrobe, even the music. the score is by warner's stalwart max steiner. he's the guy that scored "king kong." that was 1932. this movie was released in 1950.<br /><br />cooper's name, by the way -- "blayde hollister" -- prompted me to look through the records of the raca -- the real american cowboy associaton -- to see if that name cropped up in their archives, which date from the beginning of time to february 4th, 1911, when the last real cowboy passed away due to an unfortunate encounter with a deranged peccary. there has never been a real cowboy with the name blayde. hollister, yes, but not blayde. as a matter of fact, there is no record of any real cowboy named wade, luke, cole, or matt either. the most popular names for genuine cowboys, in descending order of frequency, were clarence, mortimer, noble, nebukadnezzar, plautus, pinchbeck, and hortense.<br /><br />if this movie had been released in 1939, it would have been routine. in 1950, it is a calamitous monument in the history of human recycling.
