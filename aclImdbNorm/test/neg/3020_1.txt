this is just what we need, a show about the people nobody likes in high school or in university. man or woman. people objectifying others and congratulating themselves for doing so is exactly the opposite of intelligent thinking. and this show is just disgusting for doing exactly that.<br /><br />so four men sit in chairs and watch two other guys try and pick up women to have sex with them. and in the end one of the two wins, great...just f-n great. i'm also supposed to accept these four douche bags as being "judges" of people's "game". the term "game" has got to be the most moronic thing to come out of modern english since the term "bling bling", added to the fact that these men are called the "experts" just makes me want to throw up whats left of my respect for modern culture. these are not god damn role models, they are the result of mtv culture coming to bite us in the ass. if you enjoy the bullshit spilling out the sides of this monstrosity then you probably think paris hilton and britany spears have talent. its not true and you should be ashamed of yourself for thinking so.<br /><br />and for all those people who will say that i would like this better if i got laid, or that i'm just jealous. go screw yourself, because its obvious that a real girl certainly won't.
