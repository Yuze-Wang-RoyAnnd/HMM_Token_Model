it is truly saddening to see a once-great director such as deodato delivering such a second-rate giallo such as this. this movie was so terrible it effectively put an end to his movie career. the box lies, this is no "erotic thriller", hell during the film's 97 minute running time, charlotte lewis barely shows us one nipple! i thought it would pick up once william burger showed up (in one of his last roles), but his character is killed off rather abruptly and lamely. this movie fails in pretty much every way. claudio simonetti's music is little more than noise, and the plot made very little sense at all. for some reason, lewis is terrorized by ghosts which attack using phones. (?) by the end, the characters all seem to have forgotten the previous 90 minutes of hell they went through, and casually laugh as they sick the evil spirits on someone else, lewis's ex-boyfriend. what?!? this movie did little for me besides anger me.... and bore me half to death. for genuine 80's deodato fun, watch the barbarians or the atlantis interceptors, let this one rot on the video store shelf. argento could make a better giallo than this!
