in this film, there is a loose plot of a man (bardem) who wishes to obtain financing for his construction business, and marries a woman he does not love (the wide-eyed maria de medieros) in the process. he maintains his passionate relationship with his first and true love, and ultimately gets entangled in his own romantic web. he never gives up his juggling act, until the three main characters come face to face. the film results boring, with lots of free sex (well, both girls are really good), all the reactions in the film are absurd, incoherent and of course, too much stupid. none of the characters are believable, which makes the movie a little annoying. anyway, the acting is surprisingly good for such a bad directed film, which makes it a little interesting, but, if you can, watch another film please!
