avp2 is an awful movie. the dialogue was pointless, the acting was pathetic, it had virtually no story line and you can't really tell what the hell is going on half the time due to the continuity errors and plot holes.<br /><br />but! you will love it anyway. because it pushes the boundaries on gore, violence, death, destruction and chaos. they even kill children, newborns and unborn babies in this movie. you will be sitting there thinking "oh my god, that is disgusting" and they surprise you by killing the 'sexy chick who always makes it out alive' when the predator and aliens are fighting in the hospital.<br /><br />it's like the movie industry has said "we know what we did in the first alien vs. predator movie was was bad, so we're doing it again but this time we're getting help from psychopaths with vivid imaginations" it's predicable, moronic and down right pointless....but you will be thinking about it for a while after you see it.
