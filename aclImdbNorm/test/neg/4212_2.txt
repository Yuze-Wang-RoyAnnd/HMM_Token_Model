breaker! breaker! has chuck norris as a truck driver and a karate master, talk about juggling two disparate careers. he gives a load he can't deliver to his younger brother michael augenstein and then when the young man doesn't show up, chuck goes looking for him.<br /><br />what young augenstein has got himself into is a speed-trap run by judge george murdock who comes from the roy bean school of jurisprudence. of course norris deals with matters in the usual chuck norris way and when he gets in trouble, the call goes out over the cb for all the truckers to come and help their good buddy. this speed-trap known as texas city has a bad reputation and the drivers are only too happy to help a pal.<br /><br />chuck's of course quite a bit younger and with no facial hair in this one. he's got the tight lipped look of a man who realizes the academy won't be looking at this gobbler. george murdock is overacting outrageously as the judge roy bean wannabe.<br /><br />this one is strictly for the fans of chuck norris.
