i watched this out of curiosity. i enjoyed stargate sg1 and i've watched many of the other tv shows and movies that the principal characters have worked on.<br /><br />my expectations weren't high, so i was surprised to be so monstrously disappointed.<br /><br />the acting throughout is appalling, and the script is worse. <br /><br />zero research into the bad science that is spouted throughout the movie, or into martial arts (which several cast members engage in throughout the movie, despite clearly having no martial arts training (baton twirling does not a warrior make)) training makes the already implausible plot even less credible. the same weapon (carried by michael shanks), when shot at the side of a mountain, causes extreme damage, but when shot indoors at the wall made of wicker, creates a small fireworks effect without damaging the wicker structure - ok, i suppose michael shanks fans will be sued to seeing that in stargate sg1, where a staff weapon creates either a surface burn on a main character, or blasts a hole in a section of castle wall as required), but still... a bad cgi snake 'god' eats one of the faithful in the way a dog would eat - snakes just don't behave like that.<br /><br />the basic premise of an amazonian warrior cult on a distant planet is silly at best. matriarchal societies have always been based on a lack of understanding that men are required in the process of propagating the species - for instance, the picts, who didn't figure out the role of men in sexual reproduction until the ninth century - at which time, the balance of power moved from the women to the men. they carry technological weapons and demonstrate some knowledge of science - particularly of medicine, so the idea that a matriarchal society could exist with this level of scientific knowledge is based purely on the original author's wet dream. of course, the few references to stellar science made in this movie demonstrate that the author knew nothing about that either (except for a few keywords that he must have heard in other movies). still, it could have been done better - like 'she' in 1965 for instance, which showed matriarchal society with a certain reverence, far more believably, and even after 45 years it seems fresher than this fetid exercise in stupidity. marching a few women around in 'armour', pouting aggressively, and spitting out their lines like a kiddie looking for a fight in a nightclub ("come on then! i'll do ya!" style), seems to be over-simplifying the complexities of a matriarchal culture.<br /><br />the cultural references are so simple - 'all hail the snake mother' pretty much sums it all up. even the tiniest hamlet shows more cultural variation. <br /><br />there is nothing clever, thought-provoking, interesting, visually exciting, or remotely entertaining about this movie. the soundtrack is of similar quality.<br /><br />i can only assume that the few, overly-charitable positive reviews this movie has received are from blinkered michael shanks fans who will give a thumbs up to anything he's involved in. don't be fooled. low budgets are not a reason for a film to fail - cheap b movies can be brilliant. this isn't one of them, and there's no reason to inflict this movie on yourself.
