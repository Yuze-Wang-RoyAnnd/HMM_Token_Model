a pretty transparent attempt to wring cash out of the thriving british club scene, sorted is a film that shows promise in certain departments, but does very little else. a perfunctory thriller plot (which is there merely to string the club sequences together), variable acting and a pretty ludicrous script, all stop sorted from being the showcase that director jovy obviously intended.<br /><br />however, although jovy is sometimes over indulgent (especially when using the often ill-fitting dance music) he does show potential, and the lack of an anti drugs message is enormously refreshing. overall however, the film is a wasted opportunity, and the prospects for a great clubbing movie remain out there somewhere. watchable nevertheless.
