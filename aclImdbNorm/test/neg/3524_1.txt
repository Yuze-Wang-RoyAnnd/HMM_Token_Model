what can i say? this was hands-down the worst movie i have ever seen in my life (and believe me, some of my favorite movies are admittedly horrible). the acting was amateurish, the sets were boring, and the camerawork was shoddy and sophomoric. this whole movie seemed like a college final project. i had to keep convincing myself that it was done by a teenager to make it seem somewhat good. the most disturbing factor of the "film" is that it's not even film at all-- it 's shot on video. that was extremely distracting. on top of all that, the dialogue is simply disastrous and the plot line is so basic it makes my eyes water. not to mention they steal from at least four other horror movies in the first 20 minutes or so. if there were such a thing as zero stars, this movie would get it.<br /><br />the only thing scary about this movie is how bad it is.
