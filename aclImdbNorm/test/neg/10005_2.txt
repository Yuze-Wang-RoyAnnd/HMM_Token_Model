this german horror film has to be one of the weirdest i have seen.<br /><br />i was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism, but this is supposed based upon a true character.<br /><br />our hero is deaf and mute as a result of repeated beatings at the hands of his father. he also has a doll fetish, but i cannot figure out where that came from. his co-workers find out and tease him terribly.<br /><br />during the day a mild-manner accountant, and at night he breaks into cemeteries and funeral homes and drinks the blood of dead girls. they are all attractive, of course, else we wouldn't care about the fact that he usually tears their clothing down to the waist. he graduates eventually to actually killing, and that is what gets him caught.<br /><br />like i said, a very strange movie that is dark and very slow as werner pochath never talks and just spends his time drinking blood.
