if movies where virtual reality characters come to life and they are all either male tough guys or female eye candy sounds good to you, then perhaps this movie may not be a total waste of film. needless to say, the overwhelming majority of people will find this to be an absolute bore, with little acting talent, and even less of a script. yes, athena massey is nice to look at, but that is the only positive thing that i can say about this disaster.
