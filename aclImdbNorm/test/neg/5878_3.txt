technically speaking, this movie sucks...lol. however, it's also hilarious. whether or not it's intentionally funny i don't know. horrible in every aspect, it also is the only movie i know of that has 1) a fat kid being played by a slim actor in a (very obvious) fat suit, 2) an attractive 30-something actress playing a character who's supposed to be in her late 60's, and 3) the most compliments for plastic yard daisies ever. don't take this film seriously, just watch it for laughs....a great party movie.
