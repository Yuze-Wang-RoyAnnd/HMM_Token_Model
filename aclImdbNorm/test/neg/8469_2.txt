i found this movie immensely interesting yet a little jaded, it talks of violence and what there doing, i still don't see the point in becoming terrorists in order to stop the terrorists. we have similar people in the united states and other countries justifying the use of violence and war tactics because they think they are right. think of the puritans,and the christian crusades against the islamic people during the medieval times. lots of blood and death far exceeding the violence of today, the western world has had a negative impact on the religion. i do not justify their actions but western culture in the past has had a very negative effect on some. but still do remember the majority of the islamic people are peaceful! people of any nation feel some sort of patriotism but to start a war on the fact that i'm right and your wrong needs to be rethought. again i repeat you cannot stop terrorists by becoming like them.
