i actually saw the movie before i read the book. when i saw the movie i was upset because i wondered why dean koontz had made such a bad book/movie. the movie was confusing and didn't have a flow at all, it was choppy and made me want to throw a rock at the tv. i couldn't connect with the characters at all, so i didn't care about what happened to them(normally i love the characters because i can relate to their personality or problems). then i read the book and loved it. i often re-read the book, and the movie is collecting dust. i wish someone would make a koontz movie that follows the plot of his books, then the movies wouldn't suck so much. do not watch this movie unless you need to waste money!
