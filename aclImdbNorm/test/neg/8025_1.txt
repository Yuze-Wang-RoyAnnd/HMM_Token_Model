after hearing that some of the people behind the low-budget flicks "terror in rock'n'roll "onsj"on" and "it came from outer space... and stuff" were involved in making this movie, i decided to buy it unseen on dvd. i wish i hadn't. the other movies were funny, tongue-in-cheek and kinda stupid. while kraftverk 3714 is devoid of any humor at all. and it is so god-awful that i'm getting angry just thinking about it. the worst actors possible, the worst script possible, the worst special effects available. and the most unsexy sex scene ever. uhhh. and the whole thing goes on for 2 hours and 45 minutes. please, do not ever make another movie.
