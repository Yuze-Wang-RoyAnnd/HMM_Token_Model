there's nothing to say except i want my time back that this movie took from me. i'm not racist against latinos. hell, i'm half brazilian. i loved the movie kids. it doesn't make any sense. these kids just go around and do nothing. they're not even good at skating. the whole time i'm just waiting for something, anything, to happen! but it doesn't. nothing happens the whole movie. did i mention they suck at skating. i might make a movie called beat up rockers, and the whole premise will be about kicking the sh*t out of poser moron punks like these kids. i'm not even going to get into it, this movie sucks. please do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you come in contact with it so some other poor soul won't make the same mistake.
