this asterix is very similar to modern disney cartoons. soulless, technically good and the usual in-jokes for adults. maybe it's because this is the first cartoon i watched after laputa: castle in the sky, but it was quite disappointing.<br /><br />the plot is contrived and forgettable but it involves asterix and obelix going to the viking's territory to rescue a spoilt teenager who then learns humility and finds love as well. oh and initially they don't get on but after facing adversity they all share a deep bond of friendship... yadda yadda.<br /><br />the best bit is to watch out for the little jokes. the vikings get all the best ones. such as vikea (the viking's chief's wife) giving a list of furniture and skulls to bring back from the next raid. or the vikings not knowing the meaning of mercy (literally). oh, and olaf the dumbest viking is actually hilarious (as much for the voice acting as the dialogue).<br /><br />for example, aboard the viking ship: (after a speech by abba, the captain's daughter) olaf: who is this new guy? captain: that's my daughter, cod-brain! olaf: your... daughter's... a man?
