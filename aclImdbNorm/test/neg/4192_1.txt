this is the worst movie i have ever seen, as well as, the worst that i will probably ever see. i see no need to rehash what all the others have said previously, just be forewarned...<br /><br />this is not one of those bad movies you think you want to watch because you want to be able to make fun of it, its just plain bad bad bad bad bad.<br /><br />this movie is the equivalent to having a "pet rock" as your friend. you wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen. unfortunately, it never does. at least with a pet rock you knew what you were getting into. lion's gate completely deceives on this bombshell... no...this is a disaster. after watching this film, you would swear george w. bush had his hands all over the making of this film... yes its that idiotic.<br /><br />stay away, unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time. its probably how lion's gate figured it would make some money off this piece of tripe.
