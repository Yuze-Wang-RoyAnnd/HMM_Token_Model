some ugly weirdo who had three families, cheated on and neglected all of them, built ugly useless buildings all over which are now unappreciated and crumbling. his bastard half-jew son runs around interviewing random jewish senile people who we care nothing about and shows his dreadful narrating and writing skills while tragic piano music plays. this goes on for almost two boring hours and amounts to nothing.<br /><br />all you shallow hippie people who watch these stupid documentaries, eating salads and yogurt, think all this crap is so important. it's not. save the whales. no one cares.
