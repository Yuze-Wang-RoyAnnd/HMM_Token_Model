what is the deal with all these ethnic crime groups copying italian mafia related movies ? we all know the godfather as in don vito corleone, now we have this mexican one which is just a strait out copy. i cant see why other ethnic groups have to mimic and imitate italian mobsters, but it sure makes them look silly. they sure seem to be wanabee italians. i would much prefer to see mexicans perform there own ideas and like to see there own culture, and the way they do it, instead of copying ideas from the godfather trilogy. apart from that the movie was disappointing, seeing mexicans acting and trying to be italians is not my thing. after watching this, i'm now going to watch the "real" godfather so this movie can be erased from my memory.
