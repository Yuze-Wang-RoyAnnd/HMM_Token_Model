i was initially excited about this movie and fully expected it to be a combination of equilibruim and farenheit 451. unfortunately, i was continually disappointed in the lack of depth and interest of the plot and subplots. midway through the movie, i divulged into poking fun at the characters and sets to avoid having to turn it off. i did enjoy the premise of a future with merged cultures and separation of the have's and have nots. what could have been an artful and intelligent look at the future is morphed into a plodding, semantic scifi channel midnight flick with horrible acting, cheap sets and a final gratuitous shot of tim robbins vagina. maybe he should stick to his socialist political ranting - it has all been downhill since shawshank.
