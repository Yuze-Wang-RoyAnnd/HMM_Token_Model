it's great to hear the 3 or so comments, that point out what 'footballers wives' signifies for women. the title alone, washes away any supposed equality women have in the media industry or society, reducing them to two dimensional cartoon caricatures of how men think women should behave . it is a post modern moronic farce. it might as well be called, 'footballers wifey who stays at home and knows her place'.<br /><br />on one hand, it could actually be some sort of parody on the u.k.'s, gutter trash press representation of celebrities and the role they have in maintaining a patriarchal society. so women can undermine stereotypes by acting like those stereotypes and own the image that has been created for them by mens desire. nah, that would be to ironic and clever. i also sound like i should be praising it.<br /><br />zoe lucker is simply too camp and over the top to be taken seriously. just like an even cheaper cruella de ville. she just needs some maniacal, condescending, yet at the same time, self appraising laugh to show off her true acting range. oh she does? right. anyway, it just about sums up whom this is aimed at. either 'clever clever' journo's, who think its an up-roaring send-up of vaudevillian proportions, or people who think its 'real'. "finest actors"? omg!! stop watching this afterbirth of a pantomime and get a life.<br /><br />its utterly sexist and is of such low quality, that maybe those who enjoy it think they are "in" on the "joke". do the actors really care or understand what they are communicating? its so demeaning to women and men. they are not all self centred, selfish, football loving materialistic jerks, who think women are nothing but another trophy to be put on display for the public. it's so humiliating. i am sure ms lucker would easily stand up to them in her "real" life, and twist them round her finger as so easily done in 'footballers wives' .<br /><br />but of course, its doesn't really matter. i mean its only a t.v. programme after all. so please let it stay axed. it's dreadful and will only be looked back on in the same disbelief that 'prisoner cell block h' was so fondly remembered for.<br /><br />how did it come to exist? it sure ain't subtle or complex. it could only come from the same mind set who read fhm magazine, and think its "alright" to look at soft-porn, and "do" as many women who bow to their "will" and chant patriotic and racist comments whenever "their" football team losses/wins. it's totally crass.
