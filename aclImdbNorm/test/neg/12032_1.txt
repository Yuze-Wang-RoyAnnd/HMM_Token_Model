a low budget may be an excuse for poor acting talent and pathetic looking fake gore. however, it is not an excuse for poor writing. it is a talent to be able to write dialog without making it sound forced and mechanical. the dialog in this movie was on par with most instructional videos shown to fast food staff in training.<br /><br />i also understand that one must make a few exceptions when it comes to acting talent when you only have 20 bucks to spend on it. with that being said, no serious director would have looked at these scenes and said to himself, "that was perfect". i see better character acting on canadian television.<br /><br />this movie had a paper thin plot, bad acting, poor dialog and holds no intelligent ideas at all. this simply proves to me that some independent films are that way for a reason. if your looking for a quick scare, rent anything else. even the "cable guy" was a scarier film. after watching this film, i think i would have been better off watching a re-run on the x-files.
