after three hours in the cinema hall,the strongest impression garnered was that their is something amiss. what was clear was that the directors forgot to direct, the actors to act and most importantly the script writer to write. evervbody shouted without reason and made one cringe. the script moved on and on with lots of avoidable twists and turns ending in now, too familiar priyadarshan theory of converging actors at a single point. this theory worked well in hera-pheri and hungama but somehow managed to irritate this time, so did the habit of every actor's incapacity to answer asked of them directly. simplest questions such as " what is your name would be repeated n times".<br /><br />finally what was amiss was that the director forgot that his audience have something called intelligence.
