it was like someone was trying to make a scary video game and a documentary at the same time. the historical aspect was great. everything else was horrible, the plugs for the directors other movie that seemed to happen every other minute, the video of the actual ghost hunting was edited like a scary movie rather than an investigation, they had haunted house music and sound effects that would distract you from what was happening. thanks for wasted 2 hours of my time! when there was evidence, it would fly by! most of it was just people talking about the place.the episode of the ghosthunters show that went there absolutely destroys how this show was. i am so upset with sci fi channel for playing this, i haven't watched it since it aired.
