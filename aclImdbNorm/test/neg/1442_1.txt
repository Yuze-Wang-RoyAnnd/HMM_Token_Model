everybody i talked to said that this movie would be good and really weird so i figured that i would rent it. half way through the movie i was thinking to myself what the heck was going on and what is the point to this movie. this movie from start to finish is so bad that even the sick parts of the movie didn't even bother me. i mean what are they going to come up with next volcano 2 the return of the lava. i mean come on this movie is so stupid the characters are so poorly developed,and eve robert englund makes the movie worse i mean he might as well be transformed into freddy kruegur and spook people. i was actually rooting for the bad guy to win that's how bad it was. i mean look the father is a cop he didn't seem to care real much about the fact that his daughter is going through one of the most moments in her life. i mean if my daughter was treated like that i would do everything in my power to keep the guy behind jail. also it seems kind of obvious that dee snyders character would turn bad again. this is one of the worst films of all time right there with volcano and 8mm. do not waist your time you will not enjoy it....!<br /><br />grade if there were a no grade on this site i would pick that ,thats how bad this movie is!
