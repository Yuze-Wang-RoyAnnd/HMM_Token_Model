this movie is about 3 stories put together revolving around 3 separate individuals. one of the worst movie that is available and even better if it is not available.<br /><br />the good : 2 pretty lesbians actress 1 true and touching story about theresa chan<br /><br />the bad :the main story that revolves around the blind and dear woman theresa chan does not need to be told in a movie format and more appropriate in a documentary format. no linkage between the 3 story lines. minimum dialogue in the film, substituted by smss and chat programs on pc. no cultural insight by the movie and it makes you forget even before you step out of the cinema.
