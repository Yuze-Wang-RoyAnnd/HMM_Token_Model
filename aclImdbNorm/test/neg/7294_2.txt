i will not say much about this film, because there is not much to say, because there is not much there to talk about. the only good thing about this movie is that our favorite characters from "atlantis: the lost empire" are back. several of the bad things about this movie are that it has horrible characters, it has horrible comedy, horrible animation, and james arnold taylor trying to copy the wonderful, one and only michael j. fox as milo james thatch. the reasons for my criticisms are that all the characters are changed into something that they never were, and never should be, animation that has been downgraded to the lowest extent possible, and finally, why would somebody who did wonderful voice-over work for obi-wan kenobi in "clone wars" want to copy michael j. fox? i happen to have an answer to this. because they are the same person who thought he had to copy eddie murphy from mulan in mulan ii. yes, sadly, it is true.<br /><br />.
