in the last few years of ron miller's (son-in-law of walt disney cum producer) reign he churned out live-action crap on a stick often starring the very boring dean jones, whose entire career was based on that kind of light, empty-headed fare. other horrible films from that same period include pete's dragon, the last flight of noah's ark, unidentified flying oddball and the dreaded condorman. i'll not mention tron because i thought it ambitious and miller was only the executive producer on it, so he had little to do with the actual production. however he was in full force when this god-awful piece of human junk was expelled from the bowels of creativity. herbie goes to monte carlo. second sequel to much- loved love bug tale finds herbie in love with another car who has a brain and heart too. there's a race, some lame bad guys, a diamond and barney fife. shot in france, the film actually is nicely photographed and the countryside is lovely. but one gets the idea the film was made so all involved could have a three month vacation in france. the rest of film is a wreck. prat falls, bumbling thieves, wicked german racing competitors and a pretty bouncing feminist all fall under the category of stock supply. the biggest insult of the film: trying to further develop herbie's lover personality via shakes, beeps, flashing lights and movements indicative of a horny seventeen year old, disney's writers do an injustice to our cute little vw. then again i would think it'd be tough for anyone to top helen hayes driving herbie around a skyscraper ledge in the second outing.
