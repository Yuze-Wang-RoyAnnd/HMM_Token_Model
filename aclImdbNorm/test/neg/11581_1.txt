i can admit right away that this is one of the worst movies i have seen in my life. and that is not saying a little, because i consider myself to be somewhat of an aficionado when it comes to crappy film. but this is beyond bad. this movie is so awful that there is no fun left in it, it's just bad.<br /><br />reviewing this is almost impossible. there are no strong points and nothing positive to say. i'll just ramble about a few of the points that sucked. first off, the cgi has to be one of the worst i've seen. i can't believe this movie was made in 2005, the cgi reminds me of something i might have seen in babylon 5 way back when cgi was new and fresh. it's poor beyond belief. second, the actors all seem like they belong in the worst kind of daytime soaps. and looking at their resumes i see that i'm correct... thirdly, being able to breed enormous reptiles is no match to the other technology they invented in this movie: the recoilless pistol with infinite ammo! seriously, michael par'e fires 100-200 times without reloading in every other scene... as if that was not enough there are also shape-shifting planes! at first they are regular f-16 fighters, in the next scene they are something else completely, and in the third scene they are f-16 again! if you're buying stock footage, please don't mix it like this! <br /><br />honestly, there is loads more to say, but i think i'll stop. you all understand what i'm saying. honestly i didn't think this kind of movie was made any more. it's like something ed wood would do. completely ignorant of quality, not caring how anything looks... it's almost amazing in all it's awfulness. if i could give it 0/10 i would, but 1/10 is the lowest grade. so that's it.
