after sitting through this god-awful 82-minute excuse of a film, and having previously wanted to gouge my eyes out after having watched another james toback-directed mess called "when will i be loved", i've come to the conclusion that he has the best agent in the world. how else can these horribly written, painfully-directed pieces of trash get made in the first place.<br /><br />i like robert downey jr., but perhaps being in this movie drove him to substance abuse.<br /><br />heather graham has to be embarrassed about her zombified performance. half the time the camera is on her she just is looking off in a daze.<br /><br />such a crappy script. prepare yourself for hollywood name-dropping galore (example: five minute meandering discussions on denzel washington's acting....etc.)<br /><br />there's a great character in joseph heller's novel catch-22 named dunbar. he spends most of the time in the novel shooting skeet, which he abhors. when asked why he shoots skeet all the time if he hates it so much, he replies that it makes time creep by, and he'll have a longer life. well....if you really want to feel time creep by, watch this film! i swear...the 82 minutes will feel longer than a 4 hour david lean epic. it goes on and on and on and on...<br /><br />i hope i never watch another james toback film again. if i could give this no stars, i would.
