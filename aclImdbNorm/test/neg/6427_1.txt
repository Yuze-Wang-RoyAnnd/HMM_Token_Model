wow, what a bad film. not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible. the plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling. what's that line from a famous critic? "she runs the emotional gamut from a to b." yup. that about sums it up. not even good for camp value! i wasn't expecting oscar material, but this? and gosh, her friend's a ghost? you'd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.<br /><br />this film (and i use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public. if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative! this gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower. on the bright side--at least it's not a full two hours long.
