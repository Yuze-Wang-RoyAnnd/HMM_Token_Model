i feel terribly sorry! where the lubitsch-pic was enchanting, marvelous, full of spirit and elegance, this one here is only - colored! lana looks like 51 (in fact she was 31 at that time, but obviously depressive) and tries to play a shy and dull girlie. think of jeanette mcdonald, who gave the role of the widow a double-faced depth by "playing" with count danilo. that lana had to play an operetta although unable to sing - crazy! she only sings one song - the title role of an lehar-operetta, that is really funny! the only really good thing is the great waltz scene at the end: glamorous! and - after watching this scene - have a look at the introducing waltz scene in "gentlemen prefer blondes"! any similarities?
