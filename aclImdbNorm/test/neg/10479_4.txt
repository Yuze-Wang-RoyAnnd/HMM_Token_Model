sheltered young woman, home-schooled and possibly quite gifted, harbors a disturbed, overly-emotional side which comes to the surface after her absentee father pays her mother a visit, asking for a divorce. directed by celebrated cinematographer william a. fraker, this ill-titled psychological thriller falls into the trap that most films helmed by directors of photography find themselves in: each shot is composed for the utmost style, but at the sacrifice of fluid pacing and a tight, gripping narrative. fraker (and his cinematographer, l'aszl'o kov'acs) are very fond of gauzy whites and golden tones, giving the picture a burnished, tableaux feel. the mansion at the center of the action looks like a funeral parlor, and fraker paces the wheezing yarn just like a funeral. robert shaw and sally kellerman (as shaw's fianc'ee), two of the most interesting actors of the 1970s, manage to cut through the plastic overlay and are quite compelling despite the jagged editing (which turns their scenes into little bits of half-realized business). sondra locke, another interesting screen personality, seems cast for her resemblance to catherine deneuve in "repulsion". pale and saucer-eyed, with imposingly thick and long hair, locke is a curious human puzzle, and she's initially quite intimidating and dangerous; however, this role is so old-hat that locke can find nothing fresh to bring out of the deep freeze, and she flounders. fraker allows locke's freak-out scenes to go on and on, while shaw (looking terrifically debonair) is put in the impossible position of playing touchy-feely daddy to her. all of this nonsense might be worth slogging through if the screenplay had been peppered with a modicum of tangibility (or, at the very least, some dry wit or humorous relief). as it is, lewis john carlino and edward hume's limp script, adapted from stanton forbes' novel "go to thy deathbed", strands the viewer early on, and only the charisma of the players gets us to the finish line. *1/2 from ****
