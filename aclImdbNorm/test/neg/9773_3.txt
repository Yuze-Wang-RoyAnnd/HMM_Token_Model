the name of this film and the clips that i saw caused me to believe that this film would have excitement and interesting moments. i was disappointed. the desert sands were interesting but this film inched along at a snails pace. it started fine with an underground cave and something coming out but then tried to involve us with the lives of some very unlikeable human beings. as they found dead bodies, or should i say, skeletons with some flesh on them, they began a search for the reason why? at times it became somewhat different as something was following them in the desert. some type of black ooze or something that would begin to eat the flesh of humans. as the flesh was munched upon, a bag of bones began to creep after the remaining humans. the reason for this black ooze as we find out was pretty bad, ants? unbelieveable! then the ending made no sense. i guess the motto of this film will be, when you have an itch and see an ant, quickly kill it before the ant's friends smell your flesh.
