if one wants to have a character in a movie have a disturbing sexual encounter that would shame that character in later life the only thing left that an audience would see as shameful was bestiality and now it has been done. judging by some of the other comments even that did not succeed that well. i cannot remember one funny scene though i have to admit, i had to turn it off before it was finished. i did watch a part of the director's commentary and it appears he was as surprised as anyone that the movie was doing well. if you want to get the same feeling you get from this movie but only cheaper, stick your head in a pile of manure and breath deeply.
