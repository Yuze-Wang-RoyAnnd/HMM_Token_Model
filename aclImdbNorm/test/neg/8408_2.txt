the first film is somewhat good to me, i enjoyed it for the most part, but i thought it was really nothing all that special. however, when compared to this mess it looks a whole heck of a lot better. why they felt the need to make the movie is beyond me, but they should have known it could not match the acting of the first movie when they only could get ruth gordon back to reprise her role. the story kind of follows rosemary's baby around and stuff, but in reality it is kind of a mess, it does not help that the movie is a television movie and the television look shines through very well. it has more of a comedy tone to it as well which hinders it greatly, if they really felt the need to make a sequel they should have made it an r rated movie that had some nudity and gore in it. i am sure it would have still been quite bad, but at least it would have been more watchable and fun which this movie is not despite its trying to be funny. i saw this one on monstervision and joe bob had nothing really good to say about it in the intro and i do not have to much to say either. i do have to say it was a sequel that should have never seen the light of day.
