if this movie is coming to a theater near you, consider it a threat. i was unfortunate enough to see this movie here in tokyo. since i'm dutch, i was surprised to find a dutch movie playing in a metropole like tokyo is. i figured it had to be somekind of special if a dutch movie makes it all the way to japan. so i went there with some friends, and we were happily telling the theater's staff that we were dutch and that we were so curious about the movie. as it turned out, this was one of the most infantile, silly, dumb, worst acted, with worst spoken english movie i've seen in maybe 10 years, and i left the theater trying to avoid the staff, because feeling almost responsible for this disaster movie. sometimes you get the feeling you know what the director was aiming for: lola rennt, trainspotting kind of like movie. instead it was more like macgyver on drugs with outdated breakbeat music as a score. but if i wasn't feeling too annoyed, the movie was unintentionally quite hilarious once in a while, as it showed holland at its smallest.
