the film is visually stunning: from the dusty interior of the church with the lighted stove, through the drizzly street and the run-down garage to the blaze that is the climax of the film. it also has a wonderful sense of time, both 1950's (the film's opening) and 1960's. all of the performances are top-class, especially mathew macfadyen as the psychotic preacher and gerard mcsorley as the father who finds his own intolerance terrifyingly magnified by his son. what a pity, then, that the story is so ridiculous. for a start, in concentrating on the relationship between gabriel (mcfadyen) and his family, it utterly fails to show how he has managed to hold so much influence on the community. in the church, we see five or six of the main characters at the front, and another two or three at the back, but the rest of the congregation might as well be mannequins: they show no sign of hearing him, heeding him or dissenting from him; at the cockfight, nobody says yea or nay when he disrupts the proceedings, but neither does anybody applaud or condemn when caroline throws a pint over him; a situation that results in a stone thrown through the pub window is mysteriously resolved by the onset of labour pains. secondly, middletown (which isn't actually a town, but a tiny village) seems to lack some essential services, such as police and fire service: murder can only be dealt with by a family member with a crowbar; residents watch an inferno that threatens to engulf the whole town as though they were at the cinema. for that matter, everyday things such as telephones and newspapers are conspicuously absent, the rural community is strangely devoid of farm animals or wheat-fields, and most puzzling of all for a 'typical' north of ireland setting, there is only one christian community - not even a couple of anglicans to season the mix. even if you're willing to suspend disbelief, the story itself is pretty threadbare, a pale imitation of an a.j. cronin melodrama. and the music? well, it's beautiful for the first two minutes, but when the same four chords are repeated non-stop for 90 minutes it gets more than a little irritating. my advice: watch this with the sound off.
