esther williams plays a romantically unattached water-skiing secretary who longs to stop "walking on the water" and be some man's wife; van johnson and tony martin are her potential choices for a husband. despite fine aquatic sequences filmed at florida's cypress gardens, this romantic comedy is awfully stale. as helmed by plodding director charles walters, everything here is made to seem intentionally innocuous, which doesn't lend the picture much staying power. even esther's big moments in the water are not quite up to the mesmerizing leaps from her other swimming vehicles, though they are preferable to the asides with the men, both of whom are colorless. carroll baker, in her film debut as martin's disgruntled ex-girlfriend, is the liveliest of the bunch. flimsy stuff, indeed. *1/2 from ****
