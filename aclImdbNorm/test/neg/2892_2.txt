this movie is honestly one of the greatest movies of all time...if you suffer from insomnia. it is a fool-proof way to guarantee hours of sleep at a time. as the movie slowly progresses, the audience slips into a state of unconsciousness and gradually loses sight of any sort of plot that the movie might actually contain. this effect is surely created due to the lack of sweet action/sweet babes.<br /><br />also, mr. eisenstein was obviously unable to master the art of montage. a prime example of this is the scene on the odessa steps. for no apparent reason, an event that in real life would have taken a matter of seconds is transformed into a seven minute nightmare for any sane viewer. this editing flaw tarnishes any sort of realism in the entire film. honestly, i've seen more realistic editing watching cartoons.<br /><br />some individuals who have commented on this title have hailed battleship potemkin as: "one of the greatest movies of all time" and, "truly a masterpiece". well i'm writing this comment to persuade readers to avoid watching this film at all costs. my best guess is that my fellow potemkin critics simply wrote the wrong words in their summaries. surely what they meant to say was: "one of the greatest snooze-fests of all time" and, "truly an epic fail".<br /><br />in conclusion, don't waste your time. if you are interested in watching a movie of far superior quality, go to www.youtube.com and watch a halo 3 montage. if i played the movie "battleship potemkin" in a game of slayer on guardian, i would shoot it in the face with my sniper rifle and then teabag its dead body. peace!
