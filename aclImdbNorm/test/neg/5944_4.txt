recap: a band of five young american men, all that is left of a platoon hit hard during the ardenne offensive during the wwii get the assignment as a forward outpost and to look for enemy activity. they're in really bad condition, both physically and mentally, and think they have struck gold when their outpost is in an abandoned but once plush mansion full with food. but after a while there is some enemy activity, and it is very odd. not hostile, but odd. it seems like there is a german squad out there, in equally bad condition, that want nothing more than to surrender.<br /><br />comments: based on a novel and my guess that the novel is much better but the story doesn't seem to translate very well to the big screen. indeed it is a different war movie, much more about the mental pressure during wartimes than fighting and battles. but i can almost feel that scenes that must have been full of suspense, full of uncertainties and unknown elements, just fall flat in the movie. it is not suspenseful, just different and in many ways absurd. many times people just act insane, and the reasons are unclear or at best hinted at.<br /><br />so when this mental pressure fails to come through, the main building piece of the entire story, i thought the story fell through. it wasn't good, it wasn't interesting, it didn't keep me on the edge and it didn't really send a message. actually it did nothing.<br /><br />the cast is interesting, many young actors that then turned into stars in beginning of their careers. the acting is good, but not stellar, and a few characters also fell through into the absurd zone. much of that too i feel is due to that this story, these characters need the time, space and pace given in a novel, that they can't be given here. and going halfway definitely isn't good enough.<br /><br />4/10
