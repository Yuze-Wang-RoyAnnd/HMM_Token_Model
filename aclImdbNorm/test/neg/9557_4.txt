the movie was supposed to release in 2002 and was much awaited due to the promos but it finally released in 2003 after the producer died<br /><br />the movie is good in parts but overall isn't great<br /><br />the scenes between rani and ajay are okay but the other scenes are not well handled<br /><br />the film is too similar to bollywood hollywood and though this was planned before that got released first so originality is lost<br /><br />milan luthria disappoints overall after kachche daage<br /><br />music is good but too many songs<br /><br />ajay devgan looks jaded and his appearance gives away that the film was delayed and his acting looks boring too rani is good sonali is good too rest are okay
