i laughed twice watching this movie and in case you were wondering, i wasn't having a bad day nor was i subjected to anything else that would've skewed my opinion while watching this cinematic bowel movement. this movie is bad. i wanted to enjoy it and i just couldn't. with all of this talent, you'd think this would've been at least watchable, right? wrong.<br /><br />let's play sucked and didn't suck! john travolta- very likable. though obviously buried under too much makeup, i found him to be enjoyable to watch. didn't suck.<br /><br />uma thurman- after kill bill 1 and 2, the girl deserves more than this atrociously written character. this character's big moment was showing someone how to operate a t-mobile sidekick. sucked.<br /><br />vince vaughn- the done to death role of white guy who thinks he's black goes to vince "money" vaughn. is this character template still considered to be funny? i love the guy but i want to see him in something better than this. it felt like he was slumming. sucked.<br /><br />cedric the entertainer- this guy is good. he delivers a great monologue after being called a racial slur (you can probably guess as to what it is) that was probably the best part of the movie. he was funny and truly elevated the material he was given just with his presence. didn't suck.<br /><br />harvey keitel- sucked due to a phoned in performance.<br /><br />james woods- sucked but not his fault. actually, yes it was. reminded me of his role in casino for some reason. i don't like manic james woods, i like slow burn james woods. victim of bad writing, maybe? andre 3000- sucked but he went down swinging. i think he has potential, as long as he's not being directed by a hack on his next picture.<br /><br />christina milian- she's absolutely beautiful and obviously talented but this movie isn't going to make her a star. didn't suck but needs a better vehicle for her talents that isn't directed by a hack.<br /><br />the rock- this should have been the role that catapulted him to movie stardom but as directed by f. gary gray, winds up sadly mishandled. in this movie, the rock projects this charisma that makes him so likable that i wound up feeling sorry for him. he tries really hard and while he doesn't succeed completely, he gets an a+ for effort from me. this guy is not afraid to embarrass himself and go completely against type, playing a gay bodyguard with his eyes on stardom. i really want to see him make it big. he has what it takes as long as he's not being directed by a hack.<br /><br />which brings me to what i feel was the weak link in this production. i might as well just come out and say it, right? f. gary gray's direction was about as solid as really bad diarrhea. wow, it was bad. who had the bright idea of letting this guy direct? the negotiator was good but what else on his resume convinced people that he was the man for the job? between his direction and the atrocious writing, i'm willing to chip in for both culprits to get a nice lead salad to the knees. wanna see john and uma dance? i might be able to think of another movie with those two that i could recommend watching instead of this. not worth the ten dollars and fifty cents it cost me to get into the theater.<br /><br />this movie could've been okay and it wasn't even "just okay".<br /><br />rating: * out of *****.<br /><br />p.s. fergie from black eyed peas is noteworthy to mention. sizzling!
