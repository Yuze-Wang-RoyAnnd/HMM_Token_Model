i love the jurassic park movies, they are three of my all time favorite movies.<br /><br />and i hate this game, if there was one game i wish i never own for the super nintendo was this one.<br /><br />how can a game based on a classic movie be just too awful? and to make it worst, i was scare of this game when i was a kid.<br /><br />how dumb was that but then again i was a kid when this game was first out.<br /><br />the game play in this game is just odd. one minute it's a action game and then it's a shooter. what in the world is wrong with making up your mind when making a video game.<br /><br />the sound in the game is just terrible to listen.<br /><br />the music is just too sick to listen to.<br /><br />the controllers in the game don't work most of the time.<br /><br />jurassic park the game is just a waste of time and money and won't be a classic.<br /><br />avoid at all cost
