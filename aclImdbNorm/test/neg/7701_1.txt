want a great recipe for failure? take a crappy, leftist political plot, add in some weak & completely undeveloped characters and then throw in the worst sequences a movie has ever known. let stew for a week (the amount of time probably spent making this trash).<br /><br />the result is 'steal this movie,' a cinematic experience that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotically low places never before conceived.<br /><br />this movie utterly blew chunks at my face for its entire run time. words cannot convey how painful it was to watch. this is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and make fun of. this is not 'plan 9 from outer space.' this is a long, boring and sad waste of time. 'steal this movie' is the biggest waste of energy and talent i have ever seen. it depresses me when i realize that people *actually* took time out of their lives to act in this tripe, if you can call it "acting." but then again, when you have poor direction, poor writing, poor everything - "acting" is the last thing to criticize.<br /><br />this movie is like a huge, disgusting turd that you yearn to quickly flush out of existence, fearful that a friend or loved one might somehow see it. i really wish i could somehow destroy every copy of this film so it will not pollute the minds of aspiring filmmakers. thank you, robert greenwald, for giving me newfound respect for every other movie i have ever seen. you have shown me what is truly awful and why i should appreciate all those movies that are merely crappy and/or boring.
