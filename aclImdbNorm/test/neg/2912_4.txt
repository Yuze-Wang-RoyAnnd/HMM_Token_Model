let's get tough is one of those movies that people probably regret years later that they made. full of awful racist jap talk and jokes, this east end kids story details how the kids want to join the military to defeat the japs. since they're too young, they decide to clean the town out of those dastardly japs. they find one, throw fruit at it (without anyone doing anything to stop them) and he pulls a short sword out to menace them! the cops say to stop annoying him! he's only chinese! he's on our side! when the kids go back to apologize, the chinese man's dead! it's all part of this huge jap and german spy ring! the kids see to it that this is stopped at all costs! i'm sure all of this was fine when it was made (1942) but viewed now, you realize of course, that this is clearly a product of it's time. full of stereotypes, german and japanese. funny how the east end kids have a black kid in the group, and he's not spared either. gee whiz.
