now i have seen two movies by the director chen kaige, a very good one (farewell my concubine), and this bad one, the assassin. both movies depict crucial events in chinese history, fmc in the 20th century and ta the first unification of the whole chinese nation in the 3rd century bc. fmc succeds with memorable characters, gorgeous cinematography, convincing sets, good acting and an interesting story. the assassin fails on nearly every level (okay, the sets are great, the cinematography is good, and the few battle scenes are quite exciting). but...the pathos. call me a cynic, but too much is too much. if you felt that saving private ryan was too pathetic, be aware, this here will make you sick. the dialogue is lifeless, many lines seem like political statements, subtle or entertaining is this pic not. the film is overpowered by its own pompousness. i am really surprised that the assassin gets such high votes here on imdb. 4/10
