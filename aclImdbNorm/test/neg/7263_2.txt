roy rogers (as roy) and sidekick raymond hatton (as rusty) join teddy roosevelt's "rough riders". soon, they get suspended in order to "round-up" the killer of partner eddie acuff (as tommy) along the mexican-u.s. border; they discover creepy gold runners in the process. notice how, even suspended, mr. rogers is able to get the rough riders to join in his round-up! <br /><br />this is not one of the better roy rogers westerns. the fighting scenes look like choreographed dances. rogers sings/yodels "ridin' down the trail", one of two relatively ordinary songs; and, a stand-out moment, overall. <br /><br />** rough riders' round-up (3/13/39) joseph kane ~ roy rogers, raymond hatton, lynne roberts
