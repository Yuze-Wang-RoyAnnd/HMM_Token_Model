does anyone care about any of the characters in this film? - or for that matter what happens to them? - i doubt it. that is the key problem - for a tragedy to work we have to care about at least one of the characters and none of them inspire any sympathy or appear to have any redeeming qualities at all.<br /><br />what may have worked in the 16th century, certainly does not work in one can only assume 'post apocalyptic liverpool' if that was indeed what it was meant to be. the problem is the characters in post apocalyptic liverpool, whilst still driving around in cars, using mobile phones and watching television, have reverted to speaking in shakespearian language - with a liverpudlian dialect. oh dear! bad enough you might think - but this often lapsed into pure scouse - with comments such as 'eh lah are you a cockney? and was that a merseyrail announcement during one of the scenes filmed in the underground? well the good news is that in post apocalyptic liverpool - the trains are still running.<br /><br />the characters without exception are badly drawn, wooden and more like charicatures on the lines of the joker/penguin in batman and robin except there is no real storyline to speak of - or if there is - it is one that doesn't work in a modern setting where half the sets are gloomy and 'blade runnerish' and the other half are fluorescent garish or just 21st century normal. costumes are also mixed up with half wearing their everyday clothes (parkers are big in post apocalyptic liverpool - apparently) and the other half wearing costumes from the leftovers of a fancy dress party?<br /><br />the film explores the ideas of lust, incest and revenge in the most inane fashion imaginable - the tragedy is that this film was made at all.<br /><br />
