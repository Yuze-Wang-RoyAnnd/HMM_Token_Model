poorly acted and poorly directed, "congo" unsuccessfully tries to recreate the feeling of "jurassic park". but the truth is, the book wasn't all that great either. still, the movie's first problem is that tim curry's character was added; the second problem is that the talking arm was added; the main problem, though, is that the cast members don't create realistic characters. i guarantee that this movie will not make you think that there are killer gorillas anywhere on earth. also starring laura linney (happy birthday, laura!), dylan walsh, ernie hudson, grant heslov, joe don baker, james karen and bruce campbell; i'm guessing that they don't wish to emphasize this movie in their resumes.
