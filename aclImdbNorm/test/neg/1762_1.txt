<br /><br />this movie really has nothing going for it. with the reverend played by phillip seymour hoffman complaining about his constipation and other toilet humor in a 2.5 hour movie, you know that they made no cuts at all and left the crap in, literally. it's a waste of good talent, and a total embarrassment. dreadful!<br /><br />
