the previews were so funny that i couldn't wait to see this movie. i just got home and i have to say i couldn't have been more embarrassed at this movie. yes there were times where the jokes were funny, but the stereotypical roles were painful. joan plowright is a fine actress but the scene with the "negro spiritual" was just in poor taste. needless to say the laughs were few and far between in the movie house for a largely white crowd (i was one of a very small handful of blacks).
