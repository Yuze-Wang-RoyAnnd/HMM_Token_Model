this is the result of the town of milpitas california making a home movie and subjecting the rest of the world to it. legendary in some circles as the biggest cinematic turkey this movie is rightly thought of as a bad movie. part comedy, part giant monster horror movie this movie is full of non actors not acting. the plot has something to do with a giant monster being created from the garbage and pollution in the area and going on a rampage. the monster, which we don't see until the final 20 minutes, is rather cool looking but isn't cool enough to warrant watching the preceding hour of boredom. frankly even hardened bad movie lovers are going to have a tough time getting through to the end. this is a stinker.
