this screened at sundance last night to a receptive if mute crowd. clearly the story is worth relating, it's powerful and true, but did the director have to cast every single role with a recognizable face? i mean, really, you spend have your time saying "oh look, it's the guy from 'armageddon'", or "hey, it's easy rider!" and you lose sight of the story. perhaps it's the only way this guy could get his movie made, but it's a little distracting, sort of like 'the love boat", or those old towering inferno movies, that were 'chock o' block with stars!'. i wish he's just told the story simply with less famous faces. also, the camera work seems kind of lazy, like there wasn't any thought about where to put the camera to best tell the story. all in all, i thought it was okay, but could have been really good.
