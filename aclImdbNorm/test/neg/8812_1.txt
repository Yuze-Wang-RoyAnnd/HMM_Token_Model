why is it that every time i mention this movie to somebody, i have to hear 10 minutes of praise about it. i have come to the conclusion that any movie that has a twist upon a twist is deemed "genius" by anyone who watches it. is that really what film has become? or is it that any time someone says "wow, that is so cool" everybody has to agree with them and has no opinion of their own? how this movie has a 7.5 rating is a disgrace to the film industry in general. it has also become yet another movie that "needs" two sequels for it, so i am going to have to hear about this horrible franchise for quite a while longer.<br /><br />now to the film and why it is so bad. the original concept of it is actually not that bad, as there has not been a good serial killer movie in a while. the writing for this film is horrible as well as the execution. ok, so its a low budget movie, but that should not change the story or writing. the actors could not be worse in their attempt to make us scared of this killer or just scared of this movie. so they go out and get a big name in danny glover, but his talents (whatever those are) are wasted because his character is worthless. why was he even in this movie? what was his whole fight at the end turned out to be useless and misleading for what the audience believes is happening. this is of course the filmmakers intent, but couldn't there have been a better way to do this without making us watch all that garbage. and then the "big" twist comes (was this the third or fourth?) and the whole audience is shocked and walks out of the theater like this is some kind of masterpiece. sure the movie gets people talking about the storyline and what not, but that was not the only flaw in this film. the direction was trying to be way too creative with what it was working with, and the flashback sequences were used merely as a shock effect.<br /><br />after watching this movie, even if you enjoyed it, go back and review the film and you will soon understand why it is not worthy of the praise it is receiving. for an amazing serial killer film check out se7en if you have not done so. that is what this film wanted to be. i have gotten into more arguments about this film than probably any others and will continue to argue against it. please do not support this franchise for not only your sake, but mine and everybody else's sake as well. hollywood needs to find a good horror movie to make, rather than 1,000 remakes, sequels, and "shock" factor films (such as this). oh yeah the saw 2 tag line sounds real promising: "oh yes, there will be blood." yaaayyyy!!!! sweet!! blood, that must mean its good right? give me a break. sorry everybody who love this movie, but poor writing, flashy direction, and bad acting does not make a good movie.
