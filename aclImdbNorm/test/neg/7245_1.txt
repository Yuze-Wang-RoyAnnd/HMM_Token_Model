this was by far the worst movie i've ever seen. and thats compared to alexander, fortress 2 and the new world.<br /><br />i should go back to blockbuster and ask for my money back along with compensation as it was a truly traumatic experience. for the first ten minutes i was changing the zoom on my widescreen tv because the actors seemed to be out of screen. i didn't think it was possible to make such a bad film in this day and age, i was wrong. while typing this message, i've thought of a good reason to buy this movie. a joke present at xmas. i'm blaming the mrs for this one as she picked it, thanks babe.<br /><br />be warned.......a true shocker all round!!!!!!
