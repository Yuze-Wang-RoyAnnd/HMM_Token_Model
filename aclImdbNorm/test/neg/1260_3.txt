this was more of a love story than one about an angel who comes down here to earth, although both angles of that story are given a good share of the movie.<br /><br />if i took this movie to heart, as someone who knows and believes the bible, i would have canned it pretty quick, but i don't think the general atmosphere was either mean-spirited or blasphemous. it was just ludicrous or just plain stupid.<br /><br />i mean, john travolta as a grubby angel? smoking? scratching his groin? quoting the beatles? a "warring angel" who knows nothing about heaven? an angel who flirts with all the women? yes, it's all absurd and certainly biblically- incorrect. <br /><br />i could tolerate all that but i don't know how many people, whatever beliefs they hold, who could stand a boring film which this turned out to be during the second half of it. it begins to drag when the romance begins between william hurt and andie macdowell. some of the dialog during that romance is so stupid it's insulting to any discriminating viewer.<br /><br />this is another nora ephron-directed film. man, i can't believe how many incredibly stupid movies this woman has either written or directed. at least she's consistent.
