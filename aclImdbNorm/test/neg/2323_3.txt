i watched this last night for the first time in 40 years. it's bad. really bad. but it has enough hilariously awful moments, that it's worth watching. first of all, was it deliberate to make the boy being babysat completely effeminate? he even says to costello a la mae west "you fascinate me!" as costello does a double take. god only knows what would have have happened if the babysitter had been a hunk. this kid would have seduced him in a heartbeat! then there's the principal male dancer. he is totally inept. roar with laughter as he leaps and prances with no talent whatsoever over the giant's grave during he never looked better in his life. the two romantic leads are zeros, wastes. abbott gets to sing one line and that was dubbed in by another singer. geez, i guess he couldn't even carry a tune! costello does manage to be charming in his i fear nothing number, and i guess very small children might like it, but there's not much to recommend it. but oh that seductive effeminate boy! that aspect alone blew me away! plus the fact the family accepted anyone off the street with no references to babysit a child! today, little femmy boy would be taken away from them!
