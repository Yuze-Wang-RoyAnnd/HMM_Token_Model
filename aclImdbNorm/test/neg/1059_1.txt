well, this movie shows us that mark griffiths and producers think we all are idiots. if not how should we understand this:<br /><br />american pilots take off on mig-29s. suddenly all aircrafts turn to f-16s. ha, a magic! after an action... migs land. the magic again!<br /><br />oh, did i mention that f-16s had israel markings? <br /><br />another magic: obviously unarmed l-39 trainers are bombing enemies.<br /><br />and more magic: while all movie is situated in europe, we can see a desert in almost any flying scene.<br /><br />maybe the director wasted all his magic on things above, because action scenes are incredibly chaotic and also explosions look awfully as if pilots bombarded with molotovs.<br /><br />ok, ok, this is a movie. i should write about its story... wait. a story? yes there is some story in this film. and its horrible as well.
