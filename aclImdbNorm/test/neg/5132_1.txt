my friend and i rented this movie for 3.99 at blockbuster. if i'd have known how absolutely horrible this movie was going to be, i wouldn't have paid a cent. i had no warning for this bs. the acting can't even be called acting, the inevitable sex scene is awkward, and you can tell that both girls feel completely uncomfortable doing it, and the male villain... god, who couldn't tell he was going to attack emily and the musical cues... my lord. this movie makes me want to cry. never rent this. in fact, if you happen to look upon it, gauge out your eyeballs. this movie isn't of god- it's from hell. i'm just gonna take the last couple lines to write blah blah blah shiz cause i really don't want to continue on with this review.
