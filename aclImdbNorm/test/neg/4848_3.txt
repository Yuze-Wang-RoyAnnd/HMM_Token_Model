i saw this film while i was in france and i must say that it confused me. it is a story of a jewel thief and a young singer who each end up in morocco at the same time, run into one another and form a connection. simple enough? well, the problem is that this is the sort of film that has ambiguity in both chronology (the film is not played entirely in order) and in reality (did what i just saw really happen, or was it only a dream?). given those parameters, as well as the film being bilingual, it was really hard to follow, and i was not sure as to what happened at the end. i imagine some deep artsy types could understand this film better than i could, and it may require more than one viewing to understand.
