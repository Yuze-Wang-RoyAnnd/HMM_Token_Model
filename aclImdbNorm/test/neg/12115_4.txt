childish storyline ripped off of a lame hollywood movie, terrible acting, cheesy dialogue, and not quite "up-to-par" sex scenes. that's right another great softcore parody! i enjoyed this film greatly! sure the acting is terrible, but that part of the fun! the storyline is ludicrous, but some things must be sacrificed when the story has to revolve around girl-on-girl sex scenes. and because it's only softcore (no penetration) the sex scenes were a little bland. but it's like the great god of softcore smut russ meyers said "who really cares what goes down beneath the waist." i don't know if i'd agree with mr. meyers on this one but what the hell... the flick entertained me for an hour and a half. i give it a c+, it would've been a solid b if they coulda cast more of the girls to look like russ meyers actresses. vavoom! vavoom!~
