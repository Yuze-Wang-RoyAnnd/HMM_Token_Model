i love sandra bullock-she's one of my all-time favorite actresses-but this is a movie that she should have paid a long time ago to be trash-canned. i realize that it's almost 20 years old-but my dead grandmother can act better than these people did. beware-it's not even worth the $ 5.50 walmart rack...you know that when the acting stinks this bad that it's not even worth a couple of bucks-the sound quality is horrendous-there's no closed captioning to even hear the hideous dialog, and it looks as if it were filmed on a $ 1.98 budget. i thought that i'd like to see sandra in an early role to see how she evolved as an actress-but yikes is too kind a word to use...
