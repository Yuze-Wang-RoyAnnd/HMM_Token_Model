i was surprised that the makers of this movie actually came out said that this movie was a true story. the majority of the scenes looked fake to me. for instance when the one girl was eating her sandwich and there was a roach in it. while she was eating the sandwich the camera on the opposite side of it showed that there was a roach on it. it's funny how the camera just happened to be filming on the sandwich when the girl was eating it. another scene is when the gang went to open a clothes closet and a cat flew out of the closet or should i say it was thrown out to give it effect. this movie was not realistic at all. it's highly doubtful that the events that happened were true that evening when the "st. francisville experiment" took place. i believe that the house may be haunted, but not on the night this movie was filmed! the ending was amusing when tim and and other girl were chained down in the some sort of basement. paul and madison found them and rescued them! i would rather watch the blair witch project again then have to sit through the st. francisville experiment movie again. as i said, if the makers of the movie did not state that this was a true story with true events i may have like it more. your better off getting more entertainment from the blair witch project (even though this is not a true story either)!!!
