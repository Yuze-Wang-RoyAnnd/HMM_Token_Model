if you are having trouble sleeping or just want to take that nap in the afternoon but just can't seem to drift off, pop in this movie. the only neat thing about this movie are the electric planes. aside from that prepare for some sweet zzzzz's. it boggles the mind how big name stars such as those in this movie can be part of the one of the dullest movies i've ever seen. now, if you will excuse me, i will finish my nap.
