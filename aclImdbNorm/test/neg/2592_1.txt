"the new hope of romanian cinema"...if this is the new hope, then i wouldn't really like to see the saving hero of such a prolific cinema(romanian cinema, that is). now seriously, where should i start? 1. the crappy scenario: are you kidding me, this is not even believable not to mention it's high degree of stupidity 2. the direction: what direction? this movie should have had psychological tension, at least that, since they have decided to make it look as trashy as possible. oky, i admit, radu muntean is no polanski, hitchcock, fincher or lynch(the list could go on), but at least the minimum of effort would have been appreciated. 3. the language: oky, i don't understand why (almost)every single romanian director believes that if you make the movie as miserable and obscene as possible, then you have art. i don't mind explicit language or bad image quality as long as the final result makes it worthwhile. in this case, it doesn't. there is nothing to comment upon, since everything this movie wants to say was already told thousand times, the characters are far too thinly portrayed to become memorable, the "shocking events" that occur are also poorly illustrated and become unimportant. this film relies only on the self-induced emotions, on the "we must" hype. someone was found murdered so "we must" feel sad, frightened or panicked, someone went through this and that so "we must" feel in a certain way. that's baloney. because a movie is a piece of fiction, nothing is for real here. so the only true emotions are those that you discover when you wander deep into it's world(the movie's, that is)<br /><br />*/* * * * *
