i was 19 in 1970 when it came out and having heard how funny it was when it came out and reading the reviews here, i finally rented it and watched it. i didn't laugh once - a very unfunny flick - and i usually love reiner. i cannot for the life of me figure why this is seen as funny. i had not one chuckle. and i love comedies! oh well, at least now i know what all the shouting was about. not my idea of a comedy. go rent the navigator or the love nest by buster keaton - now those are comedy classics! if you rent this one - have a back-up rental so your whole evening isn't a loss. score 3 out of 10
