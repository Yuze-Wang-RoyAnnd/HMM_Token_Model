i saw this movie when it was first released in 1986. at the time i was young and enjoyed all the normal comedy available, i.e.; monty python, jim belushi & snl, steve martin, cheech & chong, so i believe that my judgment represents most "sane" individuals.<br /><br />the absolute best part of this movie was the trailer played at the beginning of the movie for the new "my little pony" movie that was coming out.<br /><br />this movie was so atrocious that it was actually yanked from most theaters before the initial week run was completed.<br /><br />i'm surprised that anyone would waste there corporate money to duplicate this steaming pile of human waste.<br /><br />don't waste your time or money to rent or watch this "movie".
