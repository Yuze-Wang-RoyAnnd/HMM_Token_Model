its gonna be hard to make this fill 10 lines.... but ill give it a try (just to prevent others from making the same mistake as i did - to watch this (awful and boring) movie.<br /><br />i like patrick swayze - he did a excellent performance in films like ghost - dirty dancing - point break - north & south (tv series), but in this movie..... argh....this movie is so booooooring, the acting is awful - the script sucks - well.. i cant even find one good thing, nothing, absolutely nothing. i was watching it with 2 other friends and we all agreed that this was one of the most boring films we had ever seen, and the fact that it lasts for more then 3 hours (which we didn't know) - when part 1 was over and it said "to be continued", we almost cried "nooooooooooooo, do we have to watch 90 minutes more of this movie!!!!".<br /><br />its painful to see this movie: at no time do you get the impression that the actors are russians, the action scenes are extremely bad. the only good scene is when the truck explodes in the beginning of the movie! the rest is crap! go clean your toilet, instead of watching this movie (and don't come running, crying if you do see this movie - you were pre warned!) personally i would recommend patrick swayze to call his agent and have them recall this movie - its that bad.
