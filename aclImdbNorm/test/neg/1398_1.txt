this is the most pitiful excuse for a comedy show i've ever seen. i'm confounded that this guy was given his own show. it smells of complete and utter desperation on the part of comedy central, trying to fill the void left by the talented and incomparable dave chapelle. he's a tip from ned's bag of comedy gold: is a punchline not funny? need to give it that extra push into hilarity? f***ing yell it at the top of your lungs. simple, no? and as an added bonus....finish half your jokes with...then you're re-tah-ded!! or duh-du-duuuuhhhh! oh man. so....funny. beaner...hilarious. wetback....does the laughter ever stop?<br /><br />to illustrate my point in a more cerebral way, i'll cite an example. mencia jokes about how "retarded" it is to rebuild new orleans, because it's so close to the water. genius. the line of distinction between a great comedian and a hack has never been drawn so clearly. while a good comedian would find hidden humor in the tragedy, finding subtle ways of weaving a joke into something that we can all laugh at and take solace in, ned goes for the obvious. move the city. great. wait, is that funny? ned doesn't have the intellectual capacity to find the deepest meaning of things. the hurricane didn't flood the city, ned. the levee project was underfunded and in serious need of federal dollars...and behold! they broke. i guess that's god's way of telling us we shouldn't be there. after all, he's got a seat in congress. what a fool.<br /><br />chapelle was a master of turning a tired racial comedic spin on its head. he was effortless at it, and at all points, we were laughing with him. while mencia talks about black people not being able to swim *yawn,* chapelle took it 300 yards further with the black and blind white supremesist. you don't have to be scathing to be edgy. you have to be original. <br /><br />mencia and his legions of fans are like that closeted gay dude who laughs all too emphatically at gay jokes, thinking it somehow masks his own insecurities. except of course, with ned, he's laughing all too emphatically at the "retards." du-du-duuuuh.
