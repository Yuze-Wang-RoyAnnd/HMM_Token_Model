skeletons in the closet takes the father-teenage son genre to new levels of low. this is a movie that serves no purpose. the plot is layed out in the first few minutes, there is no suspense, the characters are clich'e and despite plot twists that try to confuse and obfuscate, everything plays out exactly as you think it will. halfway through the movie i could no longer stand the snail pace and started fast forwarding. the movie ended exactly as i expected. linda hamilton is great as always and the other actors are above average considering there seems to be a complete lack of direction. if you really believe you need to see this uninspired lackluster wannabe whodunit, watch it on fast forward.
