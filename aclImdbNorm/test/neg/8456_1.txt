so you've got a number of models on an island, and one by one they're picked off agatha christie-style. we get somebody lost at sea, pushed off a cliff, poisoned by a solvent, driven off a cliff, blown up, etc. nothing terribly graphic.<br /><br />before any of that starts, one woman inexplicably has a dream of a killer in a weird human face mask.<br /><br />the owner of the magazine is a sleaze who had an affair, and somebody had photos taken of her before she was of age.<br /><br />in the end, it's all about business, or something,<br /><br />there's an 80s style montage of a photo shoot, most of the bathing suits being one-pieces, surprisingly. a couple are fairly translucent. there's camera clicks during the montage where the frame of the camera appears as a white square or rectangle within the picture. the photographer is rather bad at framing!
