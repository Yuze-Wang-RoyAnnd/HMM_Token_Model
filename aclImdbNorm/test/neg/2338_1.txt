i get the feeling a lot of people liked this movie (not all people, but a lot of them) because they don't want to admit they don't understand it. people of middling intelligence, if you will, who pretend to be ever so avant garde and trendy who think lynch is a genius.<br /><br />lynch, to me, is like tarantino. they're both great, but neither one is the messiah as so many fanboys want to believe. no director can change the world, so chill out. and both make sucky flicks sometimes, it just happens. everyone has a bad day. and clearly, since this movie was actually designed as a pilot first and then hack-jobbed into a feature film, it wasn't made with all the passion and forethought one should put into a movie. face it, much of the movie is gibbering unintelligibility which cannot be understood. we can all make up meanings, lynch may have his own view, but none of that matters. it was strewn about the screen incoherently. admittedly, the first portion had the semblance of an intentionally convoluted passingly interesting story, but then it falters.<br /><br />the cowboy, the mysterious organization of men with their phonecalls, the lawyers... come on. i can almost picture david lynch yelling cut, forcing the crew to gather around him and explaining to them all "look how crazy and weird i am! isn't it great?? it's so weird and crazy!" weird and crazy works if it's a by-product of your style. however, it's pretentious and tired when you go out of your way to do nothing but that. it's like all those half assed pulp fiction throw backs that came out after pulp fiction. it's just not cool.
