in this movie everything possible was wrong and i don't know why i bothered watching it until the end. it would have been more fun watching paint dry. for crying out loud i even liked d-tox and it was much better than this. here is the basic plot for you: a redneck gets bitten by snakes that hold the evil of 13 murderers and becomes an undead killing machine murdering teenagers that have zero personality. during the movie i lost hope when it didn't scare me at all, when the kills were bad and there was bad cgi blood and cgi snakes. it got worse with the cardboard thin characters killing their friend by holding her from her legs and not letting go so she got impaled by a tree and when the bad guy moved under water like the shark in jaws. i'm still upset why i even bothered with this. i guess because i'm a horror movie fan.
