this film is right up there with the oscar and moment by moment as one of unintentionally funny films of all time.<br /><br />it is worth the rental for a some wildly great laugh's.<br /><br />the story is absolutely ludicrous.nothing in life would happen like this.it's so completely unbelievable. the way james woods tries and hustle heavy hitters, than they give this supposed two-bit hustler a job 3000 miles away in la what a joke<br /><br />i love the old beat vw bug to signify how low they've gotten in life because of all the `tootski's'.<br /><br />sean young is as unbelievably bad as the, "i'll love you forever, no matter what, wife" you'll ever see.if it wasn't so funny you would throw up at how sugary sweet young tries to project herself.and as bad acting as you'll ever see.<br /><br />james wood overacts throughout the whole movie and he's so extremely funny and is way, way over the top, it's just not to be believed, woods seems like a parody of a cocaine fiend off saturday night live.but watching woods on `ludes' is worth the price of the rental.<br /><br />i love it when woods tells the guy who wants to give him some more `ludes' that he doesn't do that stuff anymore, right before that, woods just did three giant lines of coke.<br /><br />this is some very funny stuff.<br /><br />the ending is so comical but right on par with the rest of the movie.
