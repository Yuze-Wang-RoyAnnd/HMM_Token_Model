i think purvis starts out to do a gay "gone with the wind" if so, sorry, tag, it didn't happen. it also didn't happen as a gay "sexploitation" flick. i guess i'm confused; what are we trying to do here? much as i'd like to, i simply can't get to where i care even a little about these characters. this movie is effective in capturing a taste of the decadence that lives in the south; it does nothing to explain, enlighten or advance my understanding of a gay relationship, or the conflict the protagonist seems to be grappling with.
