ok look this show is the worst show on nick@ night. i love so many shows on nick@night and i love them. when this show came on to nick@night i was so annoyed. it's such a boring show and it is corny. out of all the times i've watched i found one episode slightly funny. this show has some of the most unfunny and stupid jokes ever. this show sums up to terrible. give props to fresh prince of bel-air and george lopez. this show is boring and not the least bit clever. this show should have been canceled much earlier. i don't think it deserves to be played on nick@night alongside some great classic shows. this show is lacking cleverness, good jokes, and style.
