this is a good time to say how good i think of this site: it gives me the opportunity to feedback all the frustration i lived for two hours, awaiting for something to happens, for something to be said, to be shown, to be insinuated subtly, for a symbol, an idea, whatever. no, just long, endless violins, alternated by a tired piano. tired voices, tired actors and bored characters and situations. boring is the long death of the mind, and this movie is, from that point of view, a public enemy. how many thousands of live hours will be still stolen to another thousands of innocent spectators. i don't claim for my money back, just for my time and the time of persons i invited to watch this thing... oh god !
