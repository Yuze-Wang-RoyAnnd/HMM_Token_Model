without doubt, this is the worst movie i've ever seen.<br /><br />poor acting. poor script. poor direction and poor production.<br /><br />why did they even bother? this entire movie was total nonsense. suspension of disbelief can only carry so far, but this pushes the limits completely.<br /><br />for a movie with no humour content, the audience laughed disturbingly often...
