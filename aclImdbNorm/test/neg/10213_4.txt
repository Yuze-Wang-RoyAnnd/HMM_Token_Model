hulk hogan stars as a champion wrestler (a real acting stretch...) named rip, who is forced to defend his honor, his title and his girlfriend from a greedy corporation that wanted him to sign for their network (because wrestling sells!) however when rip declines, the network gets a circuit fighting championship called (and i'm totally serious) "battle of the tough guys" who's champion zeus (played by tiny lister jr) maybe the deadliest man alive. rip refuses to fight, until his brother is attacked and put in a hospital. no holds barred is pretty much what i expected from vince mcmahon production starring the least versatile actor in the action genre (hogan) it is basically lots of unintentional humor, tons of awkward sequences, a couple okay action sequences and tons of stupidity. in other words it's not unlike wrestling itself, so i give it a fair rating mainly because anyone renting this knows what they're getting. the movie is cheap but well made enough for what it is and really wrestling fans will probably enjoy this. i myself found this to be ultimately hilarious. they're are moments of such absurdity that you only chuckle to yourself. (such as the way hogan jumps 20 feet in the air after being stuck in a limo, how he forces a guy to crap himself and of course the way hogan recites from his cuecard. (i.e:"i'm not going to be around when this check clears!") no holds barred is a lot of fun, true, though it's mainly because of how ridiculous it is. fans of camp should really enjoy this clever clinker.<br /><br />* * out of 4-(fair)
