this appalling piece of tripe was (conveniently) loosely based on a true story that involved two family members of mine (played by jack thompson and jacqueline mackenzie).<br /><br />this film is offensive; besides the fact that it wasn't a particular good film anyway, it does not in any way capture what it was like to lose such a close family member and completely omits those who were really affected by the true-life tragedy.<br /><br />as for the director; he managed to cash in on a family's misfortune for the price of a porsche.<br /><br />if i could have given this a zero i would have.<br /><br />avoid this film at all costs.
