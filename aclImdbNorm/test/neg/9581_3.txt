mount godwin-austin (otherwise known as k2) is the world's second highest mountain, and if the evidence presented in this film is to be believed is the hardest mountain to climb successfully without getting yourself killed. "k2" is basically a buddy flick set in the breathtakingly dangerous world of mountaineering. while the outdoor photography takes in some truly awesome scenery, the characters standing in front of all those glorious landscapes are a crashing bore - and therein lies the fault with the whole film.<br /><br />cocksure lawyer taylor brooks (michael biehn) and his quiet married friend harold jamieson (matt craven) spend their free time rock climbing. during one of their trips, they meet up with another bunch of climbers funded by wealthy mountain enthusiast philip claibourne (raymond j. barry). claibourne's team are in training for a forthcoming shot at the infamous k2, a mountain that taylor and harold would both love to tackle but could never afford to do so. during their training run, however, two of claibourne's team get themselves killed in an avalanche. taylor and harold put themselves forward as potential replacements. despite initial reluctance, claibourne gives them the nod of approval and the pair find themselves joining his team in the himalayas. harold's wife cindy (julia nickson-soul) is distraught that her husband is going to take on such a dangerous climb, especially since he has recently become a father. tensions in the climbing team mount as taylor repeatedly clashes with another member of the group, the equally brash and arrogant dallas woolf (luca bercovici). meanwhile, claibourne himself grows increasingly ill as altitude sickness takes its toll on his body. will the guys reach the peak of k2, or is their quest destined to end in disappointment, or even death?<br /><br />"k2" spends an inordinately long time introducing its somewhat dislikeable characters. biehn as a foul-mouthed, pushy, adventurous type is especially hard to like, as is barry as the hard-nosed mountaineering millionaire. but on the other side of the coin, craven is so dull that it becomes difficult to believe his wife could possibly give a damn about him going off to climb k2 - heck, she'd be better off if he never came back!! rounding off the main characters is bercovici, whose characterisation as dallas woolf is as campy and over-the-top as every other role he's ever played. the story itself is totally tame and disposable
