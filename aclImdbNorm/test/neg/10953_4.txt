down at the movie gallery, i saw a flick i just had to see. it looked like a fun low-budget horror/action/western that i could get into. yeah, i knew it would suck, but i rented it anyway hoping for laughs. only a few laughs were to be found. this was an extremely stupid movie. it begins with a bounty hunter, our protagonist, who is possibly the weakest main character in the history of film. he looks/acts like he could take on chuck norris, but he can't. his dialogue sucks too. anyway, he goes into a village, shoots some zombies. you could tell they tried to make this longer by putting in these boring scenes where he takes 3-5 minutes to reload or watch some zombies. at least the zombies look cool. so anyway, some people get shot, some zombies die, and in the end, everyone is dead except our main character, who should have died at the beginning when he was shot down by four people.
