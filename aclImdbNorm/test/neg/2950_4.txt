1st watched 2/18/2007 - 4 out of 10(dir-leon leonard): fair adventure movie based on a novel by the author of moby dick fame, herman melville. this movie is about the captain of a ship who had stolen the eyes(that were extremely rare black pearls) from a native tribe's god sculpture and hidden them somewhere that only he knew about before leaving the island of tivi. he got very sick and was on a secret voyage to go back to the island to retrieve the pearls for himself while others(like his daughter) thought that he was going back to be treated by the local medicine man. others didn't know the reason for the voyage. a stowaway actually knew the real reason for the trip -- to return the eyes to their god. the silly part is that the pearls were hidden very close to the statue and all this time the natives ran their tribe without their god having eyes(causing them all kinds of problems). along the way, we are treated(for some reason) to a short underwater nature show with an electric eel fighting a local octopus(i guess only herman melville knows what this was all about). once they get to the island, the captain dies but passes the whereabouts of the pearls to his daughter but she also gets the sickness curse as well. one of the bad guys finds out where the god is housed and convinces the daughter to go there and steal back the pearls but at this point the good guys find out what's going on and a fight ensues. i won't tell you the results of the fight or the ending, i'll leave that up to you to find out if you want. as i said earlier, the movie was ok, but some very silly things that i've already mentioned lessened it's impact. i wonder if that new "pirates of the caribbean" got some of it's plot from this one ---hmm
