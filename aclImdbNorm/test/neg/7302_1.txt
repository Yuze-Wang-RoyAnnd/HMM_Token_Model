i bought this movie from a market stall three years ago.. i gotta hand it to you when i sat down and watched it.. i thought 'ok! this is gonna be another big action b-movie..' obviously i was wrong.. while watching this film.. i began to realise that this movie was taking me to another planet.. full of cr*p!<br /><br />i began to get really bored and fed up with this film.. although i wanted to see was gonna happen in the end.. i really felt like it was really getting on my nerves..<br /><br />the people behind the film may've brought some well known name actors into this project.. but what were they thinking..? even these actors couldn't save this film..<br /><br />at the end of the film.. i felt like this was a waste of money.. just buying this low life sucker of film for a small amount of money. a few months later, i sent the tape off to charity.. i didn't want to see it again..<br /><br />sorry! but if you're thinking of watching a movie and then nodding off to sleep.. i can highly recommend it you.. me? i'll rather go on pro-plus and watch something decent..!<br /><br />disappointing 1 out of 10!
