what can be said of this independent effort beyond the fact that it was shot with television cameras, and whether that was by conceit or budget constraints doesn't make the watching of this variation on a theme by romero any easier. i was constantly reminded that i was watching somebody's school project, at best derivative, at worst cheap.<br /><br />writer/director georg koszulinski (who also appears in the film) does some interesting things with stock footage, but that says more about his editing style than his directing style, which consists of in-your-face close-ups with tv cameras which made me think i was watching public-access television instead of an actual, honest-to-goodness film.<br /><br />the story copies and pastes bits and pieces from various sources, including the aforementioned romero's dead trilogy, the road warrior (dig that stock footage of a "future" that looks like the past) and the blair witch project.<br /><br />what results is an hour-and-nothing's worth of zombies tracking down and eating humans. (okay, the "humans" in this case are clones, but that doesn't change anything. it's the same menu.)<br /><br />the year is 2031, and the first strand of people who were cloned nineteen years before have started to malfunction, particularly in the dietary area. of course, when clones go bad, the first thing they have a taste for is human flesh (or, in this case, cloned human flesh). it's not safe to be indoors, it's not safe to be outdoors. it's just a matter of time before the flesh-eating ghouls devour our heroes. have you seen this before? <br /><br />i don't mind people ripping off romero, if it's done well, but no new territory is covered in this film. it's night of the living dead meets the blair witch project, shot with television cameras. what is particularly disappointing is that the dvd cover makes it look like it was shot, at the very least, with 8mm film. this wouldn't have been a problem with me if the story had not been equally cheap. the film offers a bleak vision of the future in which technology has evolved to the point where human cloning is possible. must we continue to clone our favourite movies?
