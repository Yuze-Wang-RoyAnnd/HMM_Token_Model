star rating: ***** unmissable **** very good *** okay ** you could go out for a meal instead * avoid at all costs <br /><br />the tale of the titular adam (mark o' halloran) and paul (tom murphy), two heroin addicts in the slums of dublin and their daily amblings about in their meaningless lives searching for the next fix that will make their day. along the way they try and reconcile with close family and friends who they've managed to let down and destroy over the years.<br /><br />i know a lot of irish people like to drink, but it seems some of them have problems with heroin, too by the looks of this movie. i know there is a bit of a drug problem over there, like there is in many parts of the world, so another humorous take on the subject matter is not an entirely unexpected thing.<br /><br />i don't recall the last irish movie i saw (the film is shot in a style that makes it stand out from any film i've seen lately!) and, judging from that, obviously i'm not as enlightened on their humour as i could be. the film is rather funny in certain parts, but it's obviously another comedy that isn't afraid to raise near-the-knuckle laughs. the scene in which the mentally disabled boy is robbed down the back of an alley is certainly true of what a pair of junkies might do to feed their habit but is nonetheless utterly despicable and i'm not sure if it was meant as dark humour in any way but it certainly didn't put a smile on my face! it's also in stark contrast to their previous actions where they're seen showing their soft side rocking a baby to-and-fro. in light of this, some may find the ending sad, others may see it as just desserts.<br /><br />overall, i just failed to see the point to the film. i didn't see any motivation in the 'story' it was telling. it just seems to amble along without really involving the audience in any way. unlike trainspotting (which dealt with similar themes!) it's an unsuccessful effort for the most part that had me on the verge of nodding off despite it's very short 83 minute running time. really no more enjoyable than following two real life junkies around for a day. **
