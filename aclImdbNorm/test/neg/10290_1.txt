i am not sure who recommended surveillance to me, but i think i have an idea: one of the "fat guys at the movies." the person said they were astonished by how great it was and said it was one of the goriest/disturbing movies. (i'm paraphrasing and doing this only by memory, so forgive me if i misquoted.) at any rate, i made the decision to watch it. so i take full blame for my own miscalculation in watching one of the most horrible, predictable and stupid movies i've ever seen. strange, i doubt i've ever called a movie "stupid" but that was the first word that came to mind about one-third in and stayed in my mind until the end.<br /><br />where to begin? unbelievable premise and reactions, incredibly brain-dead characters (could blame the writing or the actors, or i'll just blame both) and enormously bad acting. i'd sooner believe bill pullman as president of the usa than a fbi agent here. (of course, there's a reason for that, and i'll partially go into that.) and to top it off, if you can't figure the so-called shocking "twist" in the first 5 minutes, then you must have arrived late to the theatre or came into the room to watch it late. don't worry, they'll tell you the "twist" every five minutes thereafter.<br /><br />there's been some serial killer(s) on the loose in the most depressing town in the county, or world. but there's more to the story! some dumbass and corrupt cops like to blow out tires for their own amusement. could there possibly be more? oh, yeah, there's a family, well maybe not, but there are four humans, one boy, one girl and an adult couple. the girl says she sees things with much less conviction than cole sees dead people in the sixth sense. there's gotta be more to this than what i mentioned! that's what makes a movie interesting! adding as many subplots that may/may not be developed is the way to go! okay, then i'll continue. we have goofy fbi agents that made me laugh. a pair of giggling druggies who's shocked at first their dealer od's but then resorts to robbery. a gosh-tooting great-guy cop who must've been put in for comic relief who's always battling an angry/suspicious cop. and finally, (poor, poor) michael ironside who didn't just phone his performance in, he barely text it in.<br /><br />none of these work. they're all told in various forms of presence tense or flashbacks, and believe me, you'll lose all sense of caring after the first of many subplots begin. in addition, the reaction some of these characters are the most shocking of all. i guess i'm referring mostly to the cops, but mainly the girl who did or did not just lose her family and barely blinks.<br /><br />this stupid, stupid movie stinks. it's barely gory as the person that recommended it said it was, unless his exposure has been limited to goosebumps stories. and what's with the title? surveillance? oh, i get it; it's because it was used in 1/50 subplots just to film interviews. since that's so random, it might as well been called cop car, bullet or coffee. just stay away from this horrid mess.
