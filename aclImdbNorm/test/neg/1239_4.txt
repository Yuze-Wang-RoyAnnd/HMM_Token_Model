i viewed the first two nights before coming to imdb looking for some actor info. i saw the 9+ rating which surprised me since i was not that impressed by what i'd seen. (as reference, i happen to believe lonesome dove was the best tv western ever. i grew up next to the mgm back lots in culver city in the 50s and have a certain sense of reverence about the western genre.) <br /><br />so i saw the glowing first review and decided to read "more". there i found several reviews with 1 or 2 stars that summed up my feelings well about the lack of character development, poor editing, feeling that it was shot on the universal back lot (mgm's is long gone), and overall impression that it was not going to come close to changing my feelings about ld. my impression is that the overwhelming vote of those who chose to write was "less than a 4.0".<br /><br />this got me to wondering about the process that yields a 9+ rating. if the people giving the 10s and 9s do not take the time to justify their vote, is the ballot box being stuffed by people with a monetary motivation? i have long used imdb as one tool to screen movies and thought it the best available. now i am not so sure.
