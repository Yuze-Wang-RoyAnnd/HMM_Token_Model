i'm giving it a three instead of the lower number it deserves because of its history. a full-length movie made by high school students! it shows, too, but that's part of the charm and appeal. get ahold of some of the stuff george lucas did at ucla; this is better. maybe due to being a group effort.<br /><br />a monster made of toxic waste and too much garbage--these kids were way ahead of their time!--starts ravaging the town of milpitas during a high school dance. the monster destroys randomly, leaving garbage and smelly footprints.<br /><br />the movie has local tv and radio people, the milpitas mayor, the samuel ayer high school principal, and a whole bunch of the high school students and their parents, not to mention the mayor's daughter as the ing'enue.<br /><br />dumb? yeah! fun? yeah! great screen writing? c'mon, they're untrained high schoolies! copy that comment for the acting, cinematography, directing, et cetera.<br /><br />milpitas is right next to san jose in the heart of silicon valley; maybe one of the graphics geniuses there will update the video somehow. now there's a challenge.
