an art student in rome is possessed...or something. she has dreams of being nailed to a cross and satan himself raping her. he possesses her (i think) and turns her into a sex addict. that's about all i could take and i turned it off.<br /><br />a pointless "exorcist" rip off. i caught this on cable back in the 80s and was horrified...and not in a good way! this movie is supposed to be a horror film but turns into nothing more than a sex film disguised as a horror movie. there's tons of pointless female nudity and the actress playing the lead has to degrade herself more than once. we see her being raped by satan (a hot-looking guy), masturbating, coming on to her own father...gotta give her points for bravery. add to that bad dubbing, editing (the rape scene looks like it was cut a bit), lousy acting and a story that makes next to no sense. the one disturbing sequence (her being nailed to the cross) almost works but the lousy "special" effects ruin it. this is one of the few horror film that was so bad i stopped watching. skip it.
