ever went on youtube? well, the definite question to that is yes. do you see the boatloads of icarly and nickelodeon rants? no definite answer.<br /><br />many people think icarly is a dull and idiotic program, and others think it's the best program on the face of the earth. i have seen many of the loads of reviews panning icarly in the head and some giving it a bouquet of roses. in my opinion, icarly is for the kiddies, but the show is just awful.<br /><br />if you did not read the last review, here are reasons 1-8: #1: steryotypes #2: goofed-up drama #3: everything is silly(taco truck for example) #4: carly thinks she's nice but she's mean #5: anyone over the drinking age is stupid #6: sam is petite but strong? #7: no real companies #8: mean teachers<br /><br />#9: the webshow overuses 3dfx. just look on the webshow to understand what i mean. #10: the webshow also spills personal information. #11: almost every famous thing is insulted. icarly insults the japanese race, solitare, mercades-benz, and pac-man, to name a few. #12: there are too many reoccuring jokes(sam's obsession of meat, freddy's computer, gibby pulling his shirt off, etc.) #13: the video games based off the show suck. #14: freddy has a lack of masculinity. why? it's getting unoriginal. #15: the show is targeted towards a female audience. i also hate shows directed to a male audiences too, so i prefer icarly to be for both genders. #16: the words "nub" and "no chiz". #17: the overuse of laugh tracks.<br /><br />part 3 coming in early spring! just in time for spring break!
