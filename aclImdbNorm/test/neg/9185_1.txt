john candy was very much a hit-or-miss comic actor. his death was a tragedy and we all miss him a lot, but wagons east, in which he plays a bumbling wagonmaster who agrees to take a group of pioneers out of the wild west, is even sadder. i don't understand why it was even released. the story is pointless and weak, and the jokes aren't there. it saddens me even further that candy's last film would be his all-time worst movie. so let's forget all about this one and remember him in his better films such as summer rental, planes, trains and automobiles and uncle buck.<br /><br />0 out of 5
