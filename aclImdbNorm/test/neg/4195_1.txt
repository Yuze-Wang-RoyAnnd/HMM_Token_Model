besides the comments on the technical merits of the production, or lack thereof, the acting is absolutely horrible. what is really scary about this movie is that i actually own a copy of it, of course, it was in a bargain bin and had been renamed as "dark harvest 2", and after having seen it, i can understand why it was in the bargain bin - they should have paid me for taking it out of their inventory.<br /><br />the majority of the movie, if you want to call it that, is spent by a frantic father running around a corn field maze looking for his daughters because he has a premonition that something is going to happen to them. i suspect that the camera that the girls were playing with at the beginning of the film was probably one of the production cameras for this fiasco. in the maze, he runs into the ghost of some children, which are poorly done, and the movie goes horribly south from there.<br /><br />i can see why they renamed this movie, otherwise, they would never have gotten rid of them. absolutely one of the worst movies i have ever had to sit through, and it wasn't worth the $2 i spent on it.
