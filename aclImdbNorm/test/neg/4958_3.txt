i've seen many horror, splatter, monster movies in my life. and of course also a lot of monster movies from the 50's and 60's. when i first stumbled over this one i thought this is from the 60's until i recognized it's from 2007.<br /><br />in fact the character of jack brook is interesting and the acting all in all is for a splatter movie quite good, but.... i expected a splatter movie and not a drama story about a aggressive plummer. the movie runs 80 mminutes and i think the first kill is after 65 minutes. although it takes hours to explain the story the reason where are the monsters come from takes at least 3 minutes... the we have another 20 minutes boring dialogue and finally a, in my opinion, not that well managed splatter sequence. although we have robert englund starring here i only recommend this one to real hardcore horror fans.
