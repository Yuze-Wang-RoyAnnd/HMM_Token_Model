alfred hitchcock made this comedy of mis-marriage in 1941 but his heart doesn't appear to be in it. carole lombard and robert montgomery are the couple who discover they were never legally married and spend the movie bickering their way back to true love. it doesn't have much of a reputation and it is easy to see why. the jokes are familiar from better films but here they don't gel. and the leads are uncharismatic. lombard's performance is clipped and starchy and it's doubly sad to think she was dead only a year later. robert montgomery seems to know he's in a sow's ear and tries his damnest to make a silk purse out of it without much success. the best performance comes from gene raymond as 'the other man', (he has a lovely drunk scene). this is one of the few really bad hitchcock films.
