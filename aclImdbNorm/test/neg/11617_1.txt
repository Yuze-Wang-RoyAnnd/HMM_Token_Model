wow! i truly regret watching this picture... funny, i agreed to see it just for my wife, who endured the torture of seeing it about a half an hour before retiring, while i stayed in front of the tv, but only to feed the the masochistic in me and i because i wanted to know if this movie was so bad in its entirety or if there were some redeemable aspects which might alleviate the feeling i had of being a stupid for watching this **** called two girls and a guy...<br /><br />everything in this picture is wrong, totally wrong... since the initial, absurd, premise of two women stupid enough to stay with their common boyfriend, until the awful, but merciful, end, not forgetting the horrible acting of the three actors... don't believe the rumors, the junkie's acting is bad and i don't see how graham has made herself a known name within the movie industry...<br /><br />i wonder why, after the producers saved some bucks with just three actors and an only location, they didn't hire a person to write the script instead of putting a monkey to do it with his ***...<br /><br />at least, i felt a little fine when i destroyed the dvd and threw it to the trash... anyway, i liked somehow (and just a little) the brunette actress, natasha something, but that was not enough to beat the incredibly stupid and crazy premise of face-off (changing faces), so two girls and a guy to the bottom goes... <br /><br />stay away from this ****!
