seriously disappointing performance by brad pitt and q t, the plot is very superficial and lame, and, unless indirectly intended, this film actually glorify the nazis and portrays them as men of honor, and show that the jewish people are deceiving, cant keep promises and bloody vicious. ((the following contains spoiler)) hitler together with the most notorious nazis are attending a stupid plot less movie about the killing of 300 italian soldiers in a small cinema theater in paris is unbelievably ridiculous. the nazis laughing and hooraying each killing in the movie as if watching a basketball game stupid, the deal at the end is lame. whats really appalling is that the movie earned great reviews and is ranked here in the 40s amongst the greatest 250 films. will not be surprised if it harvested many awards, including oscars, as well. the movie is simply a kissing ass to the jewish people, but hey reconsider, its not even doing a great job doing that. it truly dwarfed the whole nazi - jews conflict and a pure insult to all who fought and suffered from the tyranny of the nazis.
