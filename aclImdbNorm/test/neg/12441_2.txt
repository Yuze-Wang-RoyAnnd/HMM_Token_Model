this has to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life. i can't believe people actually a) write scripts like this b) have a budget to make a film c) actually expect it to be successful. words can't even describe how horrible this film is. i enjoy my fair share of teen movies, but this didn't even come close to being funny. in fact, it was funny for the sole reason that it was so horrible. i can probably count one (maybe two) parts in the film where i even managed to squeeze out a chuckle (other than the laughs regarding how bad it was).<br /><br />renting this was one of the biggest mistakes i've ever made. its been a day since i've seen the film, and i'm still in shock regarding how horrible it was. avoid at all costs.<br /><br />2/10
