i'll start by admitting that i enjoy many movies that have low ratings on this site. i find that if i can see what the creators were trying to do i can find appreciation for their work. sound of thunder was a story that interested me. i wanted to see what angles the filmmakers would attack in telling the story. by and large they attempted to create an entertaining movie. the plot was contrived, but most action movie's plots are. ed burns doesn't know how to carry a rifle, but still holds his own well as an action lead considering he isn't asked for much. the main problem, !destroys the whole movie!, is the horrible cgi. it is totally unacceptable for the animals and backgrounds to look soooooo very fake. aside from that the animal conceptions could have been really good, as could the action scenes but failed because the production failed. this could have been a really memorable film if they had only finished it. it really looks like they meant to go back and fix all the horrible cgi but ran out of money and still released it. save your money because someone failed this movie. i give it three stars because it really could have been good but was totally failed somewhere i can't say it enough.
