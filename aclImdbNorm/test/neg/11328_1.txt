it's hard to believe that a movie this bad could actually be released. the dialog was unnatural. especially poor was the portrayal of the relationship between the boy and his future step-father. i guess you could say that they succeeded in producing awkward dialog, but what was said seemed false and artificial. the suspense just wasn't there. the music was about as bad as it gets. the only reason i watched this movie was because i live in the death valley area and was curious about what locations would show up on the screen. fortunately the movie was on tv and so i didn't waste any money renting this sorry excuse for a film! i honestly believe that most amateurs could put together a more captivating plot than was presented here. it's too bad that the time of an entire film crew was wasted on such trash! i guess the only positive thing i can say about the movie is that some of the scenery was good.
