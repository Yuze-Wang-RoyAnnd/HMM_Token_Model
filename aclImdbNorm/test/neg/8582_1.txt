i've always found the dilettante man ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious, and i've never understood why his work attracts so much attention. apart from his rayographs (which he invented by accident, and which are merely direct-contact photo prints), his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn. but surely this had to happen eventually, and there's no real reason why ray deserves the credit. the critical reaction to man ray reminds me of the story about the emperor's new clothes.<br /><br />"l''etoile de merde" ... whoops, "de mer" ... features a lot of blurry photography and a recurring visual theme of a starfish, which is never explained. starfishes have the fascinating ability to regenerate lost limbs -- and even to regenerate entire duplicate bodies -- but, if that has anything to do with this movie's theme, ray neglects to say so. i was much more impressed by this movie's title cards, which (in french) manage to include rhymes, a pun ('si belle, cybele') and some portmanteaux.<br /><br />as so often in ray's work, there is indeed a beautiful young woman seen in this movie. unfortunately, the photography is (largely) so blurred that we have little opportunity to appreciate her. i'll rate this mess one point out of 10.
