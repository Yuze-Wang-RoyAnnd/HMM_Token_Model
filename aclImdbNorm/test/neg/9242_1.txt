i watched this movie and all i can say is this...i am not a film student, nor am i some artsy intellect who tries to look for a deeper meaning into everything that i don't understand. however, if i were to do that with this film, my thoughts would be...<br /><br />yep! he's on drugs and i can picture it now...he was tripping one night and sat around with his buddies laughing and saying stuff like, hey...wouldn't it be funny if nuns really could fly? like what if one just fell out of a plane and free fell for a while, bounced to the ground and got up and walked away? *cackles* or if buckwheat gave the pope a bath? oh my god, i'm cracking up just thinking about it! dude! we gotta make a movie about it! and then he says to his friend as he's laughing...oh and wouldn't it be hilarious if people loved it and called me a genius for it? so to me, this is what happens when some guy does one too many drugs and writes a script and produces a movie. should i have been doing lsd to understand what this guy was thinking so i could have had a laugh too? because i have to tell you, i wasn't laughing. i was yawning and checking the time.<br /><br />i think everyone who is trying their hardest to find a deeper meaning is hysterical. i had never heard of this director until i came to read the reviews, which i did because i was mad that i lost that last 2 hrs, or how ever long it was, (it felt like 12 hrs of my life) and i can't ever get it back, anyway...i have read that this guy is a heroine addict and he wanted to die for art?? what the heck is that? so my point is sort of proved. this guy is not all there, he's a drug addict, and his movie is evidence of such...so please quit trying to find a deeper meaning to it. if one really wants to understand everything in this movie, go drop some lsd and sit back and relax, then it might actually make sense.<br /><br />it reminded me of the time i watched gus van sant's last days, another movie i was mad about watching. i cannot help but wonder what the ratings would be for that movie, if the same people reviewed it who reviewed this one. it seems like, if the movie's director is totally off his rocker, or if it's a french movie with sex and subtitles, or if it's a cartoon, it is going to get great reviews, hands down, anything else is boring and has already been done. blah, bring on the boring please!
