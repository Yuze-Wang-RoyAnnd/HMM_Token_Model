tim curry was the reason i wanted to see this film, and while of course his appearance is always entertaining, he's basically wasted in it. the rest of the cast doesn't fare too well either, in this remake of an early zombie movie that has extremely graphic effects that are totally unnecessary. to quote a popular axiom, sometimes less is more.
