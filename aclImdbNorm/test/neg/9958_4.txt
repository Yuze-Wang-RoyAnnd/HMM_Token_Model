thankfully you don't need a lot of "book learnin" to understand where this thing's going... obviously a poverty row cash-in on universal's big hit the wolf man (which was made just one year earlier), this finds the always-watchable george zucco in another of his patented "mad doctor" roles as brilliant, vengeance-minded scientist lorenzo cameron. cameron, who has set up shop deep in the swamp lands of what i'm presuming is the louisiana bayou, is plotting revenge against four of his former peers who both humiliated him and forced him to resign from his previous job. you see, they scoffed at his claims of being able to mix man with beast to create an unstoppable army of wolfman creatures that would come in handy during war-time. thankfully cameron has found the ideal test subject for his wolf blood injections - a hulking, child-like half-wit named petro (glenn strange). petro is pretty clueless as to what's going on, doesn't ask too many question and lets the doc strap him down to a table and shoot him up with whatever happens to be in his syringe. this results in a time-lapse change of man turning into a werewolf. cameron lets him out of the mansion using a secret passageway, so you basically get a big guy (strange was 6'5") dressed in overalls with a bushy beard, hairy paws and a set of over-sized plastic teeth, running around in the woods the majority of the time. after an eyewitness sees the beast and a little girl is killed, the locals grab their rifles and organize a posse to hunt it down. dr. cameron, who can control the beast with a whip and also has a handy antidote to reverse the effect, also drags petro along to the big city to try to track down the professors who had made a mockery of his original theories and destroyed his reputation in the process. also hanging around the house is cameron's daughter lenora (anne nagel), as well as lenora's nosy reporter boyfriend tom (johnny downs), whose first inclination is that they're dealing with an upright-walking prehistoric creature (!)<br /><br />though a typically chintzy prc flick in many ways, with unimpressive sets, cinematography and make-ups, as well as a fairly bland supporting cast, it remains watchable thanks to the histrionics of star george zucco. i have no clue why downs received top billing; he shows up half-an-hour in and really doesn't have a whole lot to do, nor is he all that impressive doing it. this is zucco's show all the way and he's great ranting and raving, talking to himself while fantasizing that he's talking to his peers ("i'm not interested in your imbecilic mouthings!") and temporarily sliding in and out of sanity. strange seems to have patterned his performance as the hilariously naive and slow-talking semi-retarded country bumpkin around the entire oeuvre of lon chaney jr., from his turn as lenny in of mice and men, to his performance as the aforementioned wolf man. in any case, strange and zucco do a fairly good job playing off one another. my favorite part is when zucco calls him his "guinea pig" in front of a colleague while petro just sits there grinning and staring at a doorknob. some of the foggy swamp scenes are pretty atmospheric, too.
