i found this to be a watchable all be it very predictable movie. there was some good stunt work that gave a fair degree of excitement and suspense to the story. one did however have to suspend ones credulity on a number of occasions for the plot to work. for example despite losing their transfer cable, couplings and harness when the pilot retracted the undercarriage manually, they fortunately found a spare on-board the aircraft complete with caribbeans. according to the plot drilling a hole in the ceiling of the vault would disable the alarm system in the vault when the system was reactivated (i can't think why), according to daltry there battery operated drill would be unable to drill through the vault ceiling however they just happened to have a hydraulic drill complete with hoses and fittings to fit the equally convenient take off points in the planes hydraulic system located above the vault. as the plane has a closed hydraulic system it is hard to see how this could be accomplished without affecting the control systems or at least setting hydraulic pressure alarms in the cockpit. accepting this for the sake of the plot it takes them several minutes to drill a small hole through the top of the vault (tension will they be able to drill through before fed's get there to check the false alarm), yet from the time the vault door closed and before the fed's had walked the few feet to the second security door they had cut a squire hole in the roof of the vault big enough for them to get through. one can accept all theses and other inconsistencies for the sake of a good yarn, however what spoiled the movie for me was when what appears to have been an effort by the script writers to discuses what up to that point was a fairly predictable ending, they killed off the two hero's (if one can refer to crocks as hero's) ketchum & brooks one was shot and thrown out of a 747 at 10,000 feet the other wiliest sliding down the cable between the two planes the villain daltry with one hand manages to unhook the cable carrying the weight of a full grown man with the air pressure of several hundred miles per hour pressing on him, and letting him fall to his death. and yet in the next sequence these two without any kind of explanation (however tenuous or implausible) have miraculously survived the full from 10.000 feet and had time to set up an elaborate scam to get the money. the only comment on there survival was to sophie that her brother is a bad shot. don't expect an oscar nomination for this one.
