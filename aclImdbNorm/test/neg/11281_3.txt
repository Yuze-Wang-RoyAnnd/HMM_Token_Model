this very loose retelling of carmen begins on a high note with a smoldering, sexually-frank dance between senaglese prisoner "karmen" and her female prison warden, but the vibrant opening minutes never ignite into any coherent film. one minute karmen is all sexual predator, the next she is dancing in protest to her unfair government, and then suddenly she is a smuggler on the high seas... although the film deserves kudos for postulating the first carnivorously bisexual "karmen," the broad strokes it paints are so vignette-like and unsupported by any narrative coherence that the film comes off as a schizophrenic, undisciplined melange of "basic-instinct" meets "bound" meets an african version of a bollywood musical.
