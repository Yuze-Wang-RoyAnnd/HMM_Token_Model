"d.o.a." is a non-thrilling thriller from directors rocky morton and annabel<br /><br />jankel. the acting is okay and the screenplay is pretty bad. this movie also has some moments which will make you laugh at how stupid the scenes of violence<br /><br />are. for example, someone is shot near a window. we then see from outside<br /><br />the building what looks like that person jumped. i laughed my head off when this happened. this movie tries hard, but ultimately fails. only watch this movie<br /><br />when you have no other choice.<br /><br />my critique: **<br /><br />rating: [r]<br /><br />rating reasons: violence and language.*<br /><br />*there was no rating reason available due to its age.
