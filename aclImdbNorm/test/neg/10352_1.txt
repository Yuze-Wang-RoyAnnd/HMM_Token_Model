the best thing i can say about the american version is that jane turner and gina reilly must be raking in the money for this crap. yes, the american rip-off was shown for about two episodes in australia but didn't rate; probably by curious viewers who were wondering how bad it would be. answer: deplorable, a complete waste of time. the actors are relatively unknown and they don't take readily to the nuances of the australian-written script. bad luck for them as they are doomed to plummet with this turkey. my advice to usa viewers is don't.<br /><br />americans should be best advised to find dvd's of the original version on ebay, but be aware that some dvds are in a different 'zone format' to those issued in the usa. otherwise, some dvd players will operate discs from both/all zones.
