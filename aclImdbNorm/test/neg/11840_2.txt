the storyline of this movie is clich'e and obviously has been ripped off from jurassic park. the filmmakers didn't even try to hide that. it seems as though there was not enough budget to make decent dinosaur-dolls, so instead the viewer sees some robot-like toy-dinos (from a cheap toystore) which move in a very unnatural way. it's funny though, because it's so bad. the acting is almost as unnatural as the dinos are. no one seems really excited to be in this movie (which i totally understand). especially the last half hour is extremely boring and it's almost impossible to watch it without falling asleep. the one positive comment note i'd like to make about "raptor" is that it doesn't take a full 90 minutes.
