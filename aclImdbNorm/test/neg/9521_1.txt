i was very interested in seeing this movie despite the article i read about the director in tattler magazine. i don't judge movies by what the director may or may not have done. this debut feature was very difficult to watch. i found the split screens to be a distraction to the drama in the film, some of the supporting characters gave bad performances, and the film to be a copy of several other films i have seen. there really wasn't anything fresh about this
