this movie is stupid, made by stupid people. the plot i suppose works well enough for a horror movie, but the actions these characters take is insanely stupid! like, incredibly non-sensical stupid to the nth degree! basically the whole movie consists of these 4 idiots being captured, repeatedly, despite having many, many easy ways and opportunities to overcome their captor. it does not make one lick of sense and is not entertaining whatsoever. stabbing yourself in the eye is more is more rational, and probably more fun than watching this.<br /><br />****spoilers**** the ending is hilarious!! the only good part of the movie! i nearly died laughing at the end! that whole stupid movie, and it ends with the dumb girl getting shipped off in a crate to white slavery in asia!! hilarious! i thought it was a totally awesome ending to a really sh!tty movie.
