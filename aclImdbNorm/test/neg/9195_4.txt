as much as i respect firefighters for what they do. i was unimpressed and bored with this film. the acting was ok but joaquin phoenix was a poor casting choice to say the least.<br /><br />what bothered me the most about this film was the celtic music whining on and on and on at the worst possible time in the film. the directing and continuity was pretty bad too!<br /><br />**spoiler** for example, after phoenix's character falls several stories and is badly injured, he can barely move to speak to his captain on the radio. then miraculously, he manages to crawl across a huge space covered in rubble and fire to punch a man-sized opening in a double thickness brick wall using only a foot-long piece of re-bar???? and to top it all off he then gets ultra weak and busted-up again.<br /><br />did anyone also notice that throughout the film, whenever you see shots of joaquin fighting fires and rescuing people, there is little or no smoke in the buildings. i would think the smoke should be pretty thick in a flame engulfed building.<br /><br />i also got tired of hearing the search and rescue team yelling "i need some equipment over here!!!".<br /><br />i really thought i would enjoy this film but i found it to be a weak attempt at representing the true life of a fireman. the intention was there but i honestly think that this film could have been so much better. i couldn't help but think that the producer was trying to meet a deadline with this film and had to rush to put it in theaters. more time should have been spent on editing and ensuring there was good flow to the film.<br /><br />the special effects were impressive in some scenes but disappointing and almost ridiculous in others. kind of like a jerry bruckheimer movie.<br /><br />call me critical but i just can't see what's so great about this movie. at least it wasn't as bad as "the whole ten yards" which is by far the worst film i've seen in recent months.<br /><br />i really hope there isn't a ladder 50 in the making!
