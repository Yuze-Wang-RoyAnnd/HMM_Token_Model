the only reason i didn't fall asleep during this movie is because the seats were not that comfortable. hannibal is boring>boring> boring and boring!!! this film is just dreadful, not because of any violence or graphic mutilations. it's actually quite tame in that regard. the story moves at the speed of a lazy snail. i have the feeling that director ridley scott just phoned this one in. the actors are all fine they just needed some direction. the music score is also very annoying. it's especially noticeable since so little is going on in the film. it does look good but that's not enough reason to see it. by the way did i mention that it's boring?<br /><br />
