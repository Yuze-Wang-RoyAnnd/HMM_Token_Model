-may contain spoilers-<br /><br />clearly, who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections. i just can't see it any other way. what really surprises me is no one used the name allen smithee, and more surprising, everyone involved didn't use this name.<br /><br />anyhow, where to begin. the bad dialogue, the crummy costumes, the sorry looking film stock, the unintentional comedy, the over-the-top characters, and more inconsistencies than george w. bush's college career. i don't know what was funnier, the guy losing his arm because of a snowball, or the slow motion scene where all the baby jack frosts' were getting killed. also, one of the great lines of all time was uttered in this film. "how do we know it's him?" like there's another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs! a great camp film, but a very bad film overall.
