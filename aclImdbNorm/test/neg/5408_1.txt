although casper van dien and michael rooker are generally relegated to b movies, even they are above this movie. it fails to convey even the slightest sense of excitement, fear, or dread -- unless you count the dread of sitting through the rest of this garbage. the direction is amateurish with annoying cuts and jerky movement that hides the fact that the killer is no where near the victims when he attacks. and what a killer he is: a cheap skull mask and a black hood. i liked him better when he was fighting he-man. this is one of the laziest jobs of character design i've ever seen. i mean, it's skeletor! and he's on a horse! this is supposed to be some scary, supernatural creature? how are we supposed to take this seriously? all we get is scenes of this dude riding around the woods on his horse -- which he can barely stay on -- interspersed with scenes of soldiers shooting randomly into the woods, thinking they can shoot a ghost. occasionally, skeletor will shoot someone with an arrow or ride by and stab someone, revealing how corny the effects really are. i generally enjoy sci fi channel fare on a basic cheese level, but this film is too inept for any level of enjoyment. where's dolph lundgren when you need him???
