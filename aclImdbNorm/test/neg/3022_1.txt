4 realz son my game iz mad tite yo i cant wait 2 get on dis show and roll up in da club n do it real 905 style wit mad models n bottles, son!<br /><br />no, i'm just kidding. this is a sad show, created by, and for the enjoyment of, sad men. men who are so neutered by modern existence that they channel their frustration into the clubs, where they eke out fleeting self-validation preying on chicks in hopes of getting their little wieners touched to try and dull the sting of loneliness and make them feel, even if just for one night, as though their seat on the board of the sausage party of toronto is a little less permanent. <br /><br />i read some comments on here saying that this show represents canadian tv's finally stepping up to stand on a par with american tv or somethingorother. well, that's not aiming short at all. it's like, yes! pat yourself on the back, canada -- you've finally cracked the elusive formula for such groundbreaking american content as "studs", "change of heart", "elimidate" and "the fifth wheel". see, the real brainchild here is tacking "...meets candid camera" onto the pitch. genius. and there's nothing that straddles that thin line between fratboy camaraderie and latent homosexuality like a group of grown men taping each other on hidden camera, admiring each other's "game" up in the club. the man-love on display here is so palpable they should really consider rechristening it "keys to the steam bath".<br /><br />on a side note, how interesting that the folks who gave this show such glowing reviews seem to have registered an imdb account for the express purpose of doing so (i guess i'm guilty of employing the same means to do the opposite here.) my personal favorite is the one enthusiastic reviewer that claims to hail from the "united states" who gushes that "now it's clear that the talent in canada has the ability to produce american quality television." <br /><br />smooth. <br /><br />but why even bother manufacturing online buzz? you can't really get cancelled, after all -- you're on the comedy network in canada, baby! the viewing public will go on ignoring your show for years to come. in all likelihood you'll be just fine, coasting comfortably along that proverbial plain of mediocrity with the majority of the comedy network's original programming.
