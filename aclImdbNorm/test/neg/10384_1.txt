while watching blackwater valley exorcism, i encountered scenarios and dialog so incredibly bad that i was convinced that this was supposed to be a comedy. a few choice bits of dialog worthy of a belly laugh: "i ate a rabbit." "i told you she was possessed!" "are you telling me the devil is in my daughter?!"<br /><br />there are many, many more, but you must discover these for yourself - if you dare.<br /><br />the story goes off into all sorts of directions and things happen that probably shouldn't and everyone seems to be a perv or psycho of some sort (even the priest). and i haven't even gotten to the bad acting. most notable in this area is the fellow playing isabelle's father. the director must have just told him to act like he's got a stick up his @$$ because that's the general impression one gets.<br /><br />i don't really want to steer anyone away from blackwater valley exorcism because there is entertainment value to be had...for all the wrong reasons, but if you're looking for a decent horror movie that makes sense and is actually scary...well, run don't walk.
