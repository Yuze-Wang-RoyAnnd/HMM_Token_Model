this is indeed a spectacularly bad film, but it is the rare kind of badness that is endlessly, jaw-droppingly entertaining! i want to add to the other comments on this film.<br /><br />the "rock band" on the plane look like three skinny drunks from casual labor wearing bad wigs.<br /><br />watch for the severe continuity problem with the kid's stuffed tiger: it turns into a lion, a leopard and back again; it's filthy or clean depending on the shot.<br /><br />*spoiler! the stuffed tiger turns into a real animal to save the kid (and the writers)!<br /><br />the sight of little jimmy floating down the amazon in a coffin, clutching his stuffed tiger and squalling away will stick permanently in your memory. <br /><br />listen for one of the most inept sound effects ever: late in the story when the priest is setting out to find jimmy, the guide demands his monk's robes as payment-the priest drops on one knee in a moment of resigned contemplation and there is the sound of a bell, not the deep "bonnnng" of a church bell, but the "ding" of a bell from a boxing match!<br /><br />this is an absolute hoot to watch.
