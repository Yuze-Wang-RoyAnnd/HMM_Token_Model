well, they sent it on tv between midnight and 2:00 am - it seems like the right time to watch it, and then go to bed afterwards ...<br /><br />no, it was not really living up to my expectations. i think the dogma concept is good, because the film then gets closer to what's really happening between the involved characters when you cut all the unnecessary effects and mood-making music out. but then again, this concept requires some interesting action between the characters.<br /><br />i cannot say, that i know king lear (the shakespeare version) very well, if i had known the play, i would probably have been able to predict much of the film.<br /><br />well, a crisis can bring the best and worst sides of a character on display - and we certainly see some bad sides. oh yes, the paint of civilisation and culture can be very thin, and behind this paint you may find an animal.<br /><br />if you then compare it with "italiensk for begyndere" (italian for beginners) or "mifunes sidste sang" (mifune's last song), you see the same but opposite thing: a crisis can certainly bring people to view their life in a more constructive way. and if you dare do, you may win.<br /><br />when the film had ended, i thought to myself: "oh that's why i haven't seen it before ..." the film has its own beauty. the quality of the work of the cameraman, actors, etc is good. but the script could need something more. a plot maybe wouldn't hurt.
