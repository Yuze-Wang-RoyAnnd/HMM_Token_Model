live action version of dragonball via taiwan.<br /><br />evil lord comes to earth to get the seven magic dragon balls...er pearls which when brought together will cause a dragon to appear and grant your wish. lots of action and bad comedy ensue.<br /><br />what can i say that "the best way to watch this film is with lots of drunk but witty friends" doesn't? i don't know. this is a really bad but funny in the way that really bad movies can be. come on this is one of the few martial arts films i've ever seen where you actually see the wires. its a live action cartoon and not so far removed from what i've seen of the show that it makes me fearful for the big budget american version now filming.<br /><br />if you have some drunk friends and feel like picking on a movie see this film. if you're going to see it sober (like me) avoid it.
