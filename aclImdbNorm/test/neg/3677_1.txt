wow.. where do i begin. i rented this movie because it sounded like something i would be interested in watching. with a name like val kilmer starring in this film, i thought how bad could it be? this has got to be the worst film i have ever seen with such a big name attached to it. i was wondering why it slipped through the cracks and i never remember hearing anything about it when it first came out. it starts out pretty good, and is somewhat reminiscent of the intro sequence in the bourne identity, but after the initial 30 minutes or so it goes from bad to worse and then it ventures into wtf land. if you haven't seen this, do yourself a favor and don't rent/buy it unless you are a masochist or on a quest to see every val kilmer film out there. there are many more titles out there that are more deserving your time. this film (if you can call it that) is a bona fide waste of time. i want my 82 minutes back.
