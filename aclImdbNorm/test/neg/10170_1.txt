this is without doubt the worst movie i have ever seen. and believe me, i have seen a lot of movies. the unbelievable twist the movie makes - going from an extremely bad "alien lifeforms inhabit earth" movie with sickening bad acting, to a film that tries to spread an archchristian "judgement day is at hand, seek jesus or though shall burn for all eternity in the fiery debts of hell" message - left me stunned after being tormented for 85 minutes. even religious christians must be ashamed or furious by watching their beliefs being posted like this. i didn't know what to do with myself when i watched the horrible acting that could have been performed by 7-year-olds. simply disgusting. i am not a christian nor very religious. but if i had been, i would no longer be afraid of hell. rich christiano has shown be something much, much worse.
