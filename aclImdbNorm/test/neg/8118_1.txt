unless there's some huge ironic conspiracy going on, my jaw dropped when i read the positive reviews of this film; i cannot believe that this film was even released, it's so bad.<br /><br />i admit it is not my kind of movie, but i tried to watch it objectively anyway, you know, so bad it's funny, and was still offended at its sheer awfulness.<br /><br />the acting is atrocious, they can't have watched the rushes and i'm guessing there was one take per scene, it really is that terrible. it is the worst film i have seen in many a year, in fact, i wouldn't even call it a film, it's a tragedy. the gay black friend, whom no-one actually calls "gay", it's just implied because he's so crazy? homophobic. this is not good, in fact, this is downright vomit inducing. the jokes die on their pathetic arses, the music is so bad it defies belief. the person who compiled the soundtrack essentially chose the most ear-mutilatingly bad songs they had ever heard and put them in this waste of film stock. oh my good christ i can't believe the 80's produced utter garbage like this, i grew up through them, and i cannot find one thing worth of note here, it must have been a dark time to be a cinema-goer.<br /><br />if you even contemplate watching this film go see a psychiatrist, he will then accordingly slap you, you sick, sick person.
