okay, i guess i'm pretty much a fan of spindled, mutilated, and destroyed stephen king stories (when they reach the 'screen') as any of us sad masochists out here. i know full well that most of them are done poorly. i expect it. i plan on it. i humbly allow for it...<br /><br />but, this time... geeeeeeeeeeeeez... okay, so i think i saw this thing a number of years ago..., fine. i thought i remembered that it was pretty good... wrong... like i'm saying (granted in a wordy, annoying, roundabout way : ) i really wasn't trying to be snobby or expect much, but what was this thing, a mini-series? i have only one thing to say: d......r.....a.....w......n o.....u.....t how can you possibly justify dragging the thing out minute by minute, scene by scene of friggin' endless, completely meaningless, and mind numbingly slow dialog? i mean every bl**dy scene is two people 'discussing' how they feel and back and forth and d...r...a...g i...t bl**dy well o...u...t after about an hour and a half, which i think is about 1/2 of the running time (i didn't check, sorry : ) i finally got totally fed up! after an hour and a half what had happened other than the original accident...? they were running away while the 'shop' guy was killing eye doctors, news photographers, and lots & lots & lots of meandering dialog.<br /><br />i'm sorry, i promise that it is not that i have to have non-stop mindless action; i love lots of films where not much happens, but in them at least when they do talk and such meaningful things are being said and characters are being deepened, thoughts are being conveyed... something!!!??? okay, i admit that the actors in and of themselves were not too bad (except stephen king, of course : ) i liked the shop guy, i thought both of the 'older' people were fine. i liked the general and the main woman. it's just if they could have cut out all of the hours of filler, that's all i'm saying. i mean, it's supposed to be a sci fi thriller, sort of..., right? you know what really took the prize when the shop guy was needlessly making one of his many time filling telephone calls, this time he is talking to god knows who getting all emotional (for him anyway) and acting like he can't handle it... wtf!!!??? the guy has clearly been shown to be a cold blooded, efficient killer. what the hell was that about??? so, just multiply that by about 500 and that is basically why i finally turned if off about half way through; it was either that or hang myself, i swear! i mean there are other king 'adaptations' out there that are lame, but at least they move along...! oh well, i guess perhaps if you maybe are into the 'story' itself and don't mind crawling along and have the supreme & divine patience to wait until the end, it might be worthwhile.<br /><br />but, i sincerely and humbly doubt it...<br /><br />i don't write these things very often, but this time i just had to or i wouldn't be able to sleep at night (like i did during the show! : )
