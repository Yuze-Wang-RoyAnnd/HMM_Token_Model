if it wasn't for colin firth, the movie would be ready for the dust bin! so foreseable, so silly and so badly acted!! only colin firth, as always, shines through this mess as single light on the end of the tunnel!!<br /><br />the worst was jennifer rubin's acting, for sure! maybe it was because of this script (did they actually have really written one or was it just made up "on the way"???).<br /><br />to cut a tooo long story short:<br /><br />it is a must see only for colin firth fanatics (like me) since he is incredibly sexy and good acting (struggling hard against this "mentally challenged" script). these minutes of colin-screen-time make up a lot of this movie. <br /><br />don't spend too much money on it, though. try to see or get it as cheap as possible (an auction or something like that) and then do stick to the colin firth scenes. <br /><br />the rest of the movie might be dangerous for anyones mental health.
