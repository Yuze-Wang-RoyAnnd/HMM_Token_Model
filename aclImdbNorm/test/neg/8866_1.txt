i've never understood this type of spoof movies. you get some serious/semi-serious movie that everyone knows about and takes the seriousness out of it through immature fart-jokes and such. we've seen it many, many times, and it's never really been funny. it's just an easy way to laugh at something you don't understand, in my opinion. this seems to be one of the more obscure and less liked of the genre, though i honestly don't see anything in this that is much worse than that of spy hard or hot shots. this movie, as is clearly understood simply from the title, concentrates on making childish fun of pulp fiction. that's the main reason i decided to watch it, as i found that film to be overly indulgent of tarantino's sick mind and powerfully overrated. i had hoped for one or two good jokes, making fun of the overly violent and pointless type of movie that pulp fiction was in every aspect, in my (anything but) humble opinion. i was sorely disappointed. the plot is pretty much a rip-off of tarantino's film, with a few scenes spoofing other, often better, films, in the same childish and humorless fashion. the pacing is poor, and often you'll sit there, being able to guess the outcome of every scene, predicting every joke, often thinking of a better one at the spot, bored out of your mind. the acting is bad. the characters are clich'es and stereotypes, and are intentionally paper-thin in order to make fun of the characters they're based on... problem is, it doesn't work. it just makes the movie that much harder to sit through. the humor is juvenile and lame. the only positive thing i can say about this film is that they managed to find some actors that looked like the people they were supposed to look like. the film is an awful waste of the actual real actors involved. possibly slightly entertaining to fans of the typical spoof movies of the same kind. i recommend this only to people who truly loathed pulp fiction, or fans of the zucker parody films. everyone else: avoid. 1/10
