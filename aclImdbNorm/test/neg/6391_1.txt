i never intended to write a review of this movie. actually i was just on the sight looking for the name of the star of the film and then i started reading reviews... i guess i'll never learn. this movie is horrible! i'm not going to justify my comments with specific reasons because i really find it hard to believe that anyone with any taste actually likes this. a guilty pleasure? okay, i guess. but a film this bad that wasted talent so good (caine, gelbart, and donen) is a reason for mourning not a pleasant diversion. a low point for all involved except perhaps bologna, who must sit up nights trying to figure out which bomb was the bomb that destroyed his career.
