when my six-year-old fell asleep at the theater during this movie, that was all the confirmation i needed that this film is a stinker. it was boring. the scary parts were boring. the maudlin parts were boring. even the funny parts -- with two minor exceptions -- were boring. and predictable. and did i mention predictable? examples: 1) the gruff but loving dad indulging his brat of a kid. 2) the gruff but loving dad buying the farm (while singing a song?!). 3) the brat of a kid deciding to cut and run, but, thanks to his friends, sticking things out because they need him. 4) the brat of a kid winning against incredible odds. 5) and a sassy character voiced by an african-american actress. gotta credit these filmmakers for that bit of originality and for perpetuating that stereotype. i did mention two funny bits. in both cases, contributed by minor characters. the mouse bouncing on the farmer's pulse was funny. the farm dog falling victim to his doggy weaknesses while vying for leadership was funny. but the rest? painful. someone tried to make a hipness-thru-committee movie and make it even hipper by making it a computer-animated film, and this was the result. and why make the coyotes batman-villain dumb by monologuing with their victims, rather than just eating them? oh yeah. no blood needed in this film for kids, already concentrating on mock alcohol consumption, destructive behavior and potty humor. and the fuzzy thing-in-a-box? just what exactly was it? a porcupine? tasmanian devil? what, besides a really stupid plot device to help otis the cow win the mother of all battles? barnyard is a bomb. and i didn't even need to mention the udders.
