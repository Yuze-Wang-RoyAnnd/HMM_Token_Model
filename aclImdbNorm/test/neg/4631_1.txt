a lot of people in the cinema enjoyed this film, but it only made me feel misanthropic. if smug "intellectuals" bantering about their irritating sex lives, sounds ok to you, watch it. i felt bored, but glad i did know people like that. the premise of the film was that, as with all societies or great civilizations, they are eventually doomed to fail. according to the female historian character, who bores us with this fact, america is showing signs of it's decline (admittedly she goes into greater detail than me). the next part of the film is concerned with the vacuous, fatuous and asinine behaviour of her friends and colleagues, and the various miseries caused by their libidinous behaviour, with a vague attempt at humor. a lot of people liked this movie where i watched it. i could not relate to it.
