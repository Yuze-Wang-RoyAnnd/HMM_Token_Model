irwin allen put all his talents behind this one: he's co-screenwriter, producer and director of this cartoonish "epic" about an atomic submarine and its efforts to reduce a ring of radiation circling the earth. potentially exciting story fails to take off, despite an eclectic cast. varied players from walter pigeon and joan fontaine to frankie avalon and barbara eden are interestingly intermingled and provide a dash of color, but this soggy sci-fi is pretty cheesy. good for a few stray laughs, but allen didn't seem to know the difference between strong, solid adventure and campy nonsense. later a popular tv series. ** from ****
