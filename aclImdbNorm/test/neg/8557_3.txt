edge of madness is a tale about a woman in the 1800's who gets hand-picked by dirty scotsman who can't keep his penis in his pants. he just so happens to have a younger brother who is against rape and kills him, but continuously says it was an accident. this makes his wife go crazy, she gets delusional and she takes the fall because she loves george too much.<br /><br />like i said, this type of thing has been done before. this is just more "artistic" because it's canadian and it's an indie production done on a low-budget with hardly known actors (except that one kid from lassie, yea, he's in it). i dunno' whether this was going for oscar bait, but it was sure as hell boring. and this is based on a 40 page short story. half of that short story is incorporated into this flick, and i'm glad. otherwise, i'd bore to death. unfortunately, i had to watch it in my media fundamentals class, and i had an assignment on it. read the short story and compare and contrast the flick to the story. boring.<br /><br />you know, it's harder to answer movie questions when you don't like the movie. ah well, i hope this is the last type of assignment me and my class get. for what it's worth, annie herron was totally hot, she had a nice, soft ass and i liked the nude parts of her in the movie.<br /><br />3/10 for boring, oscar bait performance and graphic sexuality..plus nudity.
