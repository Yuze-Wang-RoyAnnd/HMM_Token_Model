this was one of the biggest pieces of crap i have ever had to watch. i mean, seriously. how would anybody else feel if they were in woody harrelson's shoes and your wife was even considering it would be a good idea to sleep with the other guy even for a million bucks. after all, she was the one talking about it in bed and saying how it would be good for them since he can build his house or whatever with that money. woody never fully agreed to it until she talked him into it. how can you trust her? who the hell would actually even consider that if they were married? i don't care how desperate they were. that's the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard in my life. then, he flips out on her. apparently, he had no right to mistrust her, other than the fact that his wife just slept with another dude who is extremely rich and handsome. oh and wait, then he's supposed to apologize to her after she files for the divorce so she can be with the guy she slept with. of course woody has no right to say anything to her or mistrust her especially after she still has roy hobb's card in her wallet. then, at the end of the movie, she's apparently so in love with woody still and misses him so much, that she was not going to leave hobbs until he made some ridiculously stupid story up to try to hint to her to leave, and she bleeping thanks hobbs???? are you bleeping kidding me? was she under contract as his sex slave or something?? i mean what the bleep?? oh and wait it gets better. she bleeping kisses him passionately before she gets out of the car. yea, she's not a whore. oh, thank you for letting me go, let me go make out with you one last time for good ole' sake. smooch smooch, smooch even though i'm still married to a guy i left for a rich guy. i have never seen such a piece of crap in my life. how the hell are we supposed to feel good after that horrible ending? what was this movie supposed to represent? nothing came out of this! this was the most pointless movie i have ever seen in my life. two pathetic desperate people. if i were woody, i would tell her to go drown herself in that body of water they were near. apparently, he had no self respect. what the hell was roy hobbs thinking by taking this horrible role. i feel like puking after watching this. this movie was so bad, it was seriously laughable. i want those two hours of my life back that i wasted watching this piece of ****.
