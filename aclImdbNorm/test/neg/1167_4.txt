ever since he played a goon in lone wolf mcquade, actor/stuntman kane hodder has been busy. his film, hatchet, got all the publicity last year, but he still makes a couple of more films every year. he should have skipped this one.<br /><br />hodder seems to be the king of the slashers. he has played jason voorhees from 1988's friday the 13th part vii: the new blood (1988) to jason x (2001). he is working on a new film that appears to be a halloween remake. he is very much what i would call the serial killer type with his methodical, expressionless thirst for blood.<br /><br />however, there wasn't much blood in this movie and very little action occurred on camera. it felt as if i was watching an episode of real law enforcement on a&e.<br /><br />i won't put the blame entirely on hodder's shoulders, as the rest of the actors didn't contribute much either.<br /><br />michael berryman (the hills have eyes, the devil's rejects) just ran his mouth until gein shut him up. adrienne frantz ("the bold and the beautiful") was cute. veteran actress ("three's company") and penthouse pet, priscilla barnes did a credible job. i am sure there are other horror favorites, but they all just seemed to run through their roles.
