years ago, sara, a young girl witnessed her parents being murdered, now as an adult she suffers from various mental ailments (did i mention she has an imaginary friend?) this film lulls the viewer, not into a sense of tension, mind you, but rather a sense of sleepiness. deathly boring, i found it hard to sit through as i could feel my eyelids growing heavier and heavier with each endless minute of mindless prattle and supposed 'mystery'. is sara going crazy? or is it the paranormal? a better question would be, who cares? and the answer to that, no one. no one at all. skip this film, save yourself some time better suited to do other more worthwhile tasks.<br /><br />my grade: d-
