honestly, this may be the worst movie i've ever seen. and i've seen spider baby, and not of this earth. heck i've even seen 200 motels. having just discovered the freaks and geeks series and being surprised at the acting ability of linda cardellini i checked out the reviews here and decided this was worth a try. that is the last time i will ever rely on a review at imdb. i didn't realize that morons were writing imdb reviews while they were waiting for their calls to be answered on am radio. <br /><br />this movie is so far beyond bad that mere words cannot express the wretchedness of its vomitous state. seriously. <br /><br />watch this movie if you think will farrel is really really really funny, if you think adam sandler is a comedic genius. watch this movie but please don't breed!
