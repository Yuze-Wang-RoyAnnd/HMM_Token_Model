classic author c.s. lewis once wrote an essay stating that no children's story is worth the reading, viewing etcetera if it can only be enjoyed by children. i'd say this film is an easy one to hold up as a defence of his argument.<br /><br />around the age of five or six, i loved it, tracked it down only three or four years later and found it to be wet, poorly animated, dully and confusingly written, and with distressingly repetitive and awful songs (i'm looking t you, hi-cockalorum), showing a production aiming at joyful silliness and whimsy, but resulting with an ugly, twee, frustrating mess.<br /><br />by all means, show this to your infant, but i would heartily recommend that you don't buy a copy or attempt to sit in on the viewing. if you want something set in the same era but with genuine charm and wit, go after 'oliver twist' or the bbc's brilliant adaptation of 'the box of delights'.
