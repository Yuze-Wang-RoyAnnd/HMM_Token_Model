i do not understand why anyone would waste their time or money on utter trash like this... don't get me wrong -- i love a good western -- notice i said "good" -- this is just trash<br /><br />the acting is horrible -- val kilmer must know someone or owed a favor or something for them just to use his face and name in this ridiculous piece of crap...<br /><br />to those of you who enjoyed this movie, i am making a list of you're names to ensure i do not watch anything you suggest -- our tastes are definitely different, yet it is your right to voice your opinion, no matter how far off base it is.<br /><br />i gave this movie a 2 just in case they do throw out all of the one's and not count them.... just bad in all area's...
