against my own better judgment i went to see this film today, and god i wish i hadn't. awful. the first avp film looks like a classic compared to this, it's that bad. these guys actually make paul ws anderson look like a master storyteller. in fact, this is what i'd expect an alien and/or predator film to look like if it was made by uwe boll! this movie actually offended me, and lord only knows what would transpire if ridley scott or hr giger were ever forced to watch this piece of crap. i can't understand how any fan of either franchise could like this film.<br /><br />truly i don't know where to begin. i mean, the first avp was poop, but it at least a semi-interesting story and setting, and occasionally some genuine tension. it didn't take itself overly seriously and it could at least be semi enjoyed on a purely "leave your brain at home" basis. but this one, it felt to me as though the people behind it thought they were making the next horror masterpiece. one after the other was a contrived 'suspenseful' scene in a dark room or corridor with creepy music playing, essentially bashing you over the head saying "be scared now". as james cameron once said, you can't be told to be scared, you can only have your own senses heightened. the guys that made this film obviously weren't paying attention because they tried everything in the book to force you to be scared rather than letting you come to that level yourself. it's a clich'e for internet nerds to say "god, i was so bored from this movie and felt like leaving", well this is exactly how i felt, even in the middle of the action scenes. they took this film totally seriously, which removed any possibility of enjoyment. even the gag about how governments don't lie to their people was played without a hint of irony.<br /><br />as for the characters, i knew going in that the human characters were going to be completely pointless to this film but seriously if they're going to be on-screen at least have them doing something that is relevant to the story. i don't care about this guy being beaten up by his dreamgirl's boyfriend, i don't care about the mother who's "own daughter doesn't even know her, boo-hoo!" (a pair of night-vision goggles for a present? give me a break!) or the released criminal just trying to make a decent living and set an example for his brother, what a guy. hell, even the obligatory hot-chick-in-panties moment was more contrived than usual. i get the feeling they expected the audience to be so shocked at the ending, as well as seeing chestbursters come out of kids, expectant mothers being raped and the like, that that would make up for everything. i don't think so.<br /><br />then we move onto the stars of the film, and again very little to write home about. were the aliens well-designed? i wouldn't have a clue because you can never see the damn things. all you see is one of a mouth, a head, a tail or a really dodgy cg outline climbing a wall, and barely enough to actually process that it is in fact an alien before mr "i cut marilyn manson and nin music videos, think i'll do the same thing here" editor goes at it with the slice tool. also, notice how hack action directors always set their films at night and in the rain? hmmmm. the predator could've been fighting giant sea monkeys for all we knew! yes, the predator was more impressive this time around, and i did think some of the new weaponry was cool, but that was about it. also, since when does a predator sound like a dinosaur from the lost world? there were a couple of things that i kinda liked though. one was the use of sound effects and music from the original films (i also giggled a little bit at "get to the chopper!"), although other references were stupid (the main character's name being dallas, give me a break). i also liked the visual fx for the predator's vision, as well as how the hybrid alien looked (certainly beat the one from resurrection). but really, those are the only positive things.<br /><br />overall i found this movie inane, pointless, insulting and above all else offensive to the vision of the original creators of both creatures. that they've left the door open for another one leaves me almost depressed.<br /><br />if they had any decency they'd remove dan o'bannon, ron schusett and hr giger from the credits of this film. they've done nothing to deserve this.
