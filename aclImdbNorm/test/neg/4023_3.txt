the original story had all the ingredients to make a thoroughly gripping film. but failed miserably in this version as even cherie lunghi was a pale imitation of what she was to become - so much so that i suspected that she must turn out to be an accomplice right to the end. sherlock holmes was turned into a warrior quite unlike anything every suggested by sir arthur conn doyle ? in fact it was doctor watson who showed what little common sense that was going. the boot blacked midget from the andoman islands looked as though he could not fight his way out of a paper bag and what the villain was doing taking tea in baker street for a denouement was beyond anything that the old scotland yard could ever have dreamed up. so consign this tv film to their black museum please.
