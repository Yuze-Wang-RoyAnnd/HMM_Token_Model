what are forest whitaker and clifton collins jr. doing in this? light it up is a ridiculously melodramatic piece on problems in low income area schools. while the topic is one that needs to be addressed, the film uses every cliche in the genre and comes off as a textbook popcorn flick. the characters are cutouts from the inner city version of the breakfast club or even the faculty. watch this with your children when they turn 13 or 14. with them, it could be an outlet for a lesson on current social problems. for anyone older, it will be nothing more than something to watch and spit on at 4 in the morning, as i did recently on bravo. matter of fact, what was this doing on bravo?
