what a shocker. for starters, i couldn't stand the constant screaming and noisy panicking all the time. it didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying. the jerky camera movements were also annoying. the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror. there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot. and then there's the ending. i'm still not really sure what to make of it. i guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.<br /><br />the case had a couple of those little award winner/nominations symbols on it, so i figured it couldn't be too bad. i was wrong. if you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.
