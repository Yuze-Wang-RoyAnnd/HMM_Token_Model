as a native chinese, i can not accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a 'better world'. i said 'better world' because it is a lie that chinese people have been indoctrinated for thousand years! <br /><br />i guess most western audience may don't know qin shihuang(means the first emperor), the king in this film is the most notorious tyrant in ancient china. the tianxia(chinese word was spoken by the king, means 'the land and the people') spoken from his mouth is totally lie. from then on, one after another, all the king in ancient china spoke the same thing but very few of them did as what they said.<br /><br />another fact is, qin shihuang's empire only lasted about twenty years before it was destroyed by people.<br /><br />well, i do like the beautiful scenes of this movie, but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant.
