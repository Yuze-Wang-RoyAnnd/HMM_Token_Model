will spanner (david byrnes, the fifth actor to play the role in the series) stumbles onto another bizarre case, this time involving vampires rather than the usual witches, warlocks & demons (he's at the hospital to check on his friend's son who got hurt in a hit and run when they wheel a girl who's been attacked by a vamp in). he brings in detectve lutz to help out with the case which revolves around a clandestine vampire organization trying to get a business merger to go through to let them legally own all the blood banks in the world or some such nonsense.<br /><br />the plot of this movie pretty much takes a backseat to the nudity & simulated sex scenes. (as is to be expected from this series, i guess). so complaining about the lack of good acting, or compelling plot-line, or even convincing characters, i suspect, would fall on deaf ears. if you're watching this film, you don't care about such 'frivolities' and just want some 'action'. sadly on that front the film fails as well. all the woman are attractive enough but the way the scenes are filmed are just atrocious. making this more or less an exercise in futility in every conceivable way.<br /><br />eye candy: both kimberly blair & april breneman show everything; ashlie rhey shows full- frontal; aline kassman & mai-lis holmes only shows their breasts<br /><br />my grade: d
