all i can do is laugh. wow. i like jim wynorski's movies, i really do. i mean, chopping mall is a classic. but this, what happened to this guy? he used to make funny horror movies, that tried to be good. but this was hardly even funny...i mean, i guess it was, because i laughed. the villain is incredible. i mean, horrible cgi. it looks...terrible. and the movie has no gore, and no nudity as redeeming qualities. it is rated pg-13. a movie named "bone eater" you know won't be a blockbuster movie, you know it probably won't have a smart script. a movie like this may rely on gore...but no. it doesn't rely on anything really, it's just...crap. check it out if you want to laugh, though. but don't expect a good movie. i hope jim wynorski goes back to movies like chopping mall and ghoulies iv, because this and komodo vs. cobra ain't cutting it.
