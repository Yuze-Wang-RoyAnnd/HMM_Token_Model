from the point of budget 2.5m cad isn't very much when you look at the animatronics, puppetry in this film, that alone being the reason for the 9 week shoot. i was really keen to see this film and had hoped to catch it when it came out, instead got it on dvd recently. my main problem is it's just not funny at all, it's better than tenacious d which hasn't got a funny bone in it's body. but this was a truly disappointing film.<br /><br />trevor matthews is a very strong physically performer, but his acting sucks! rachel skarsten gives what is possibly one of the most irritating and none funny performances i have ever seen. the only really big star in this is david scott who's artwork for the monsters is fab! his special effects work is the main reason this film is worth watching, loved the cyclops and troll and and the prof monster was straight out of the henson library.<br /><br />if you watch this it won't be the biggest waste of time, but if you are looking to see this for a great horror comedy romp... don't bother.
