this one is one of those classic b movie following the exploits of 2 hobos. it's done really cheesily and big stupid running off one-liners like a cardboard cassanova. but jack elam steals every scene he's in as the creepazoid jesse (now jerome!). my favorite scene is the lynch mob and the dad's voice going up 10 octaves ("you loved her?"). danny, big stupid's protege, is surprisingly stupider, but not as loathsome as our lead star. there's also a quaint scene of a guy pimping at the diner. joyce meadows is the sweet, naive nice gal and probably the least annoying. and those yellow ruffles (rawr!). oh, and booze is evil according to mr. stupid.<br /><br />this movie's a hoot. watch the mst cover of this and crow's terrific elam homage!
