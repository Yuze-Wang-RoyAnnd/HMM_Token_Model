i was looking forward to dante's contribution to this excellent horror anthology series from showtime, but this was easily the worst of the bunch. it's really too bad. part of this may be due to the poor, if odd, choice of source materials. why joe didn't just write an original, i have no idea. instead, we get this soapbox episode where the "message" overwhelms the script, the characters, the staging, everything, and by the end i was just wondering whether it could get any worse, and i won't spoil it...but it ended up getting worse. what a stinker by such a talented creative team. skip this one and buy the john carpenter one instead. it manages to balance all of the elements: horror, humor, character, vision, and it's fun. homecoming is about as fun as having a bear take a dump on you while you sleep.
