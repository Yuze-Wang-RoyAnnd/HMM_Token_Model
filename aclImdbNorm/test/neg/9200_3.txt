i really enjoyed the film. it was really cheesy at times. (they destroy the villain with hair driers--but where are they plugged in?) it's a unique film though, and i enjoyed the acting of courtney draper and tamara hope. i also enjoyed fanuel (however you write it...) liking megan's charecter because she called him a dweeb. besides the acting, the "rewinding" and showing what happened on ariel's and then megan's point of view was quite interesting. i saw it twice and i'd see it again
