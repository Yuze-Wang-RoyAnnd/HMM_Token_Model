of all the kids movies i have seen over the years this was probably the worst. i took four kids aged from 7 to 11 and none of them liked it.<br /><br />the script seemed to be based on a willy wonka style story but it just didn't have anything to it.<br /><br />if you are considering seeing this movie dont waste your time, it is bad.<br /><br />they are making a sequel, so it may be worth watching to see if they can even make a worse movie, but i don't think it is possible.
