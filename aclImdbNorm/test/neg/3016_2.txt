it's too bad these guys, the so-called judges, are such jerks, even the nominally "sensitive" ones. it's the self-congratulatory tone that really makes me sick though; these guys don't have any perspective on their behaviour. i think the real problem, though, is the quality of the contestants. not a single smooth or truly charming one in the lot. they pick the most pathetic girls out of the crowd because they're the only ones these guys have a chance with. let's see some real players trying for a truly unattainable girl, and maybe you have a show. otherwise, you have a revolting half-hour of self-love. and real sexual tension takes two.
