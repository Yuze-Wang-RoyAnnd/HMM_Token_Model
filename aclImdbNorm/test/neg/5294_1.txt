i went to the cinema slightly apprehensive, i came out seething with anger at the garbage (passing for a film)i had witnessed. the actors, particularly travolta, should be ashamed of themselves for their participation in this. clearly the only thing in their minds was the pay cheque, never mind the debasement of their talents and us . travolta needs to go back to doing some more "look who's talking" movies as he has sunk back to the level of his pre-tarantino work. it comes to something when the l w talking sequels are better than this one. travolta is no longer the king of cool but the king of corn. michael caine himself admitted to doing bad movies for the pay cheque, trvolta should follow suit if he has any self respect !
