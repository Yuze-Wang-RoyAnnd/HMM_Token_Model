i like action movies. i have a softspot for "b" flicks with bad dialogue and wooden acting. so, i've been wracking my brain to come up with one of my guilty pleasures that was worse than this blockbuster. i can't. you'd be hard pressed to put together a bigger piece of cr*p than this bruce willis vehicle.<br /><br />armageddon is the story (and i use that term loosely) of a team of "super-drillers" flying off to destroy an asteroid before it destroys the earth. realistic? not really. but who cares? it's an action flick. i'm not blasting the premise.<br /><br />minor spoilers:<br /><br />the movie begins with a couple of scenes designed to introduce the threat and the characters. bruce willis is the tough-as-nails leader of the team, and spends his first bit of screen time chasing around ben affleck with a gun for the unforgiveable act of sleeping with his daughter. for some reason, that didn't make me laugh. it was forced, like everything in this movie.<br /><br />the team is called in because they're the only people in the whole wide world who can drill the asteroid. okay, i'm prepared to accept that premise if it gets us to the action - the supposed meat of the movie. more attempts at humor, with each character going out to do some crazy, nutty thing before blast off. again, lame. finally, they take off. here's where the movie really pi**ed me off. they arrive on the rock, and set to work. would you believe it, nothing works right and everything has a suspenseful countdown!!! whoah! ten, nine, eight... one - oh, surprise surprise we saved the day again!!<br /><br />and don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork. when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick. i can only assume they were trying to cover up the gargantuan holes left by the insipid performances by cutting away to a different shot every few seconds (and this from someone raised on mtv - mr short attention span himself).<br /><br />just when i thought it couldn't get any worse... wait - there's a manufactured tearjerker ending that was so tacked on it made the rest of the film a virtual citizen kane.<br /><br />summary: the witticisms weren't witty. the plot - well, i said i'd let that one go. the acting was bad. really bad. even billy bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse. camerawork - again, bad. (i didn't even mention the dumbest love scene in the history of motion pictures - think animal crackers).<br /><br />rating: 1 out of 10. (i'm giving a half point for steve buscemi, who makes me smile against my will and another half point for the times i was able to look at the lovely liv tyler and attempt to ignore her acting performance) this is far and away the worst movie i've gone to see in the theater... ever.
