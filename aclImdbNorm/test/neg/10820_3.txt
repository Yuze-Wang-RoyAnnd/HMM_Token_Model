the mission to see the movie "the cave" was a dream of a friend of mine after witnessing the highly dramatic trailer, full of flashes of a creature lurking in a cave, some young cave divers, and not much else. it's too bad that the movie didn't change much more than the trailer did.<br /><br />the immediate allure of a movie like this is the creature. what's he going to look like? why does he live in a cave? how is this one supposed to be different from the other creatures we've been shown in movies like alien and predator and the relic? the cave "demons" do not look far from the skeletal creature in alien: resurrection and even has the sight of predator. shame that's a total ripoff...<br /><br />well, let's look at the plot: very confusing and jumps to more and more totally improbable twists as a team of cave divers is sent to find a cave and its dwellers in the carpathian mountains. the casting was very much clear that we want young, hip, tough chicks, chiseled guys, and the girls who have brains also have to be hot. we also have to have one of every racial background in case the audience thinks that the film-makers are biased to a certain viewpoint. totally been done, and i'm totally tired of it.<br /><br />the other main problem was the ending, as if to say there might be a sequel. plase shoot me if there is one. the tagged on ending made me wretch.<br /><br />i gave this movie 3/10 stars. the points that it did get were more or less appreciation points towards the creature-builders for their high-quality job spent on the costuming and design for the monsters who dwell within, even when they looked totally ripped off. and there's an interesting (yet labored) documentary on the dvd on underwater cave diving. go check it out only if you love new creations of monsters and creatures, but be warned that you've probably seen this movie before, and it was better the first time.
