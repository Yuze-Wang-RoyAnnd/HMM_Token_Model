consider "i know all" action hero is lighting a cigarette in the darkness. while tries to hide/seek the bad guys. (probably to give a signal light to say here i am coming)<br /><br />that's one of the 100 scenes you can laugh at. (i think the movie should in the comedy category.)<br /><br />awful directing, awful script, bad acting, cheap special effects. (they used a tunnel so they can hide there acting in darkness)<br /><br />3 out of 10 (that also for making me laugh looking at those pathetic mistakes)
