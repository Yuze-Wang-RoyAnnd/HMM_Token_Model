unbelievable. "philosophy". "depth". "genius". "masterpiece". people must have seen another "oldboy" because the one i've seen was a badly written, poorly conceived, over-the-top-acted, sordid piece of "kraapola" which, even ignoring for a moment the ludicrously violent scenes which makes it unsuitable for the eyes of a child, could barely satisfy the imagination and the thirst for plot consistency of a seven years old.<br /><br />the "depth" of this sorry concoction was exhausted in one little piece of wisdom, "laugh and the whole world will laugh with you, weep and you'll find yourself alone", the type of boring fortune cookie saying which a great author, be him shakespeare or, more to the point of imdb, kurosawa, would have thrown in the garbage can with no second thoughts. where this movie should have landed too, if we wouldn't live in an era in which the cheaply shocking and the perversely disgusting are confused with what used to be named once "great art". in short, yuck.<br /><br />2 out of 100. it's not 1 out of 1000 only because of some occasionally expert camera-work. in no way enough to save this infantile failure from worthlessness, though.
