the review on the main page admits that the movie is horrible but that you should forgive it because it is nicely violent. no you shouldn't. there are spoilers at the end of this review but how i can "spoil" this rotten movie i have no idea. even if you are a die hard alien/pred fan like i am wait for the dvd. it isn't worth a 3.99 rental either but you'll be much less inclined to truly hate this film if you pay that than 12 bucks or better per person plus concession purchases at a theater.<br /><br />in the theater i watched avpr there were exactly two laughs, both by a girl sitting next to me. other than that there was total silence throughout. no ooohs, or "that was bad ass!", nothing. imagine being a patient on an operating table and just being given the anesthetic. now you know what you'll feel like in the theater after the opening scene of avpr.<br /><br />what was the budget on this movie? like war of the worlds, mi 3, and other f/x driven movies the director seems far more involved in what the cgi people can come up with than developing characters or a plot. spielberg has tried and failed at this several times, usually with tom cruise. sure the movies make money but should they? war of the worlds and minority report had the budget to pay for a decent script, tom cruise et al, and ss himself but were still awful. i'm sure avp wasted 90% of their budget on cg and had no choice but to hire any actor that would say yes even though the casting agent would have done better by going to the supermarket and picking actors at random.<br /><br />there is no tension developed in any scene so we are never close to being surprised. who cares who gets killed? we didn't know any of them, we all know what happens when the lil aliens make their corporeal exit, we all know the blood is acid. in alien, aliens, 3, resurrection, and even avp the directors make use of the fact that the aliens can think, can hide and can lay traps. this director decided that the ridley scott, james cameron, and others were idiots for developing characters you actually want to see either live or get killed. in this installment you will never care who lives or dies, not a kid, a parent, a pregnant woman. the characters serve only one purpose in this movie, to die. the opening scenes establish the fact that the movie is going to be a predictable joke. the character development scenes mix clich'es, bad humor, and bad acting and numb the viewer to the point where we really don't care if they get killed so long as they die in never before seen ways. but they don't. the director tried to make something different from those who preceded him in the alien franchise but only succeeded in discarding the good parts of the first films, the human protagonists, and stealing the rest from other recent sci-fi films.<br /><br />there is not one original use of the either the alien or pred characters. the pred actually has little trouble killing aliens by the dozen even though the last movie led us to believe that pred revered the aliens as such a deadly foe that they used the killing of one as rite of passage. the alienpred is never really developed as a fearsome creature. its ability to inject parasites into a host is ripped from several different movies most recently probably was hellboy where samiel's dismembered tongue injected eggs into hellboy or doom where the mutated creatures would leave their tongues behind after they speared a victim's throat.<br /><br />simply put we aren't given reason to care about anything in this movie. there is violence but it doesn't shock or surprise and is nothing that hasn't been seen in any of a hundred slasher flicks. the cg is ok and both species of alien are made to look and move as they have in movies past. but since the characters are never developed and the acting is so bad we kind of hope that they all die. the little girl was probably the best actor of the bunch but sadly we aren't made to care whether or not kids, women, or anyone else lives or dies. we just want the movie to end. eventually it does but not before another stolen plot line from resident evil 2 has a nuke aim gunnison's way to wipe out the "infection". and not before yet another stupid scene that is supposed to open the door for further sequels but does it? in a movie filled with bad scenes the worst may have been saved for last.<br /><br />sorry for the repetition but everything bears repeating: bad script, no plot, unoriginal action scenes, uninspired direction, abysmal acting, decent f/x that were wasted because of the many flaws.<br /><br />i don't mind going to an indie film and being disappointed. the actors and directors and crew are probably getting their careers going and working on a shoestring budget. for a movie with this type of budget and hype i feel cheated along with disappointed. this movie is a painfully boring waste of time from the opening scene to closing credits. sad to say that a preview of hellboy 2 was the best part of avpr and hb2 didn't even look that good.
