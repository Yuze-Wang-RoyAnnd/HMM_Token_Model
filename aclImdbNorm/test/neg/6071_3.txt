awful!<br /><br />despite the good performance of ed harris, diane kruger, and the strong budget (the reason for the 3 stars), the movie is by far the worst i saw about a composer, and the worst edition of a masterpiece of music. i agree with some fictional stuff to upgrade a biography, that otherwise couldn't be so "charming". this was done in amadeus with best results, but this b copy here is a flaw. beethoven had a strong personality, but was a sensible artist. here in this movie however, he looks much more as mike tyson! i wonder also, whether despite his deafness, he heard all the whisperings in the last scenes (may be a cochlear implant?). i prefer to listen to the ninth on a cd with some nice maestro. today most of them conduct modern wagnerian orchestras. by the way: i gave amadeus 10/10!
