in the 50's, a gay photographer called bob mizer (daniel macivor) founded an agency of male models, releasing a muscle magazine called "physique pictorial" and movie of men, and many of the models became prostitutes. "beefcake" shows the rise and fall of this pervert.<br /><br />alternating footages from the 50's, testimony of many models and bob mizer himself in the present days, the director thom fitzgerald used this subterfuge to show naked men and lots of penis along 93 minutes running time, in a complete bad taste and very silly crap. i have never heard anything about this morally corrupt bob mizer and i do not know what amg is. in my opinion, only gay and very specific audiences might like the theme of this boring and pretentious movie. my vote is two.<br /><br />title (brazil): "carne fresca" ("fresh meat")
