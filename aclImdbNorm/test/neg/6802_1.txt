i don't know how this movie has received so many positive comments. one can call it "artistic" and "beautifully filmed", but those things don't make up for the empty plot that was filled with sexual innuendos. i wish i had not wasted my time to watch this movie. rather than being biographical, it was a poor excuse for promoting strange and lewd behavior. it was just another hollywood attempt to convince us that that kind of life is normal and ok. from the very beginning i asked my self what was the point of this movie,and i continued watching, hoping that it would change and was quite disappointed that it continued in the same vein. i am so glad i did not spend the money to see this in a theater!
