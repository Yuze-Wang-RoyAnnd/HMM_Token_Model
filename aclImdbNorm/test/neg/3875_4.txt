"return of the seven" has a few good action scenes, and elmer bernstein's score is as rousing as ever. nevertheless, it's a boring film, because it simply fails to involve us emotionally. mcqueen's absence makes a really bad impression, and the fact that his character here is played by a different (little-known) actor is odd - in a bad way. the characters are not developed, so we don't connect with them - and we hardly care when some of them die. this sequel is a passable but poor imitation of the original.
