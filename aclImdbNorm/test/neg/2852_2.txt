this is probable one of the worst movies i have ever seen.<br /><br />the only reason i gave it 2 stars out of 10 is the appearance of the gorgeous lydie denier in some of the scenes.despite her 42 years she is an amazing woman in every aspect,her nude scene in the bathroom with armand assante is as hot as hell.<br /><br />anyway about the movie,well nothing really interesting to say,a neonazi and a turkish gang fight over berlin in scenes that include people open firing on the street in daylight and inside a club where 30-40 people fire at each other with machine guns in a place no bigger than my house and amazingly after some hours of firing just three die and ten are injured lol.<br /><br />while the gangs fight over berlin terittories a serial killer is killing young children and then dumps them painted white on various places around town.<br /><br />armand assante appears as the turkish detective who although now working for the police was an ex leader for the turkish gang and now is up to solve the serial killer crimes.<br /><br />the movie is obviously a very bad rip off of the classic m movie.the killing of the children,the involvement of the underworld,the character of the serial killer and the ending scene with the "trial" of the serial killer are more than influenced from this classic movie.<br /><br />the acting is terrible,the script just stupid,the production of the lowest standards possible and in general this was a great waste of time and money.<br /><br />don't even bother renting this one.
