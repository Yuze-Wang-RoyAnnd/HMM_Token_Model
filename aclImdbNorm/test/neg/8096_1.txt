i had expected a fairly straightforward r-rated graphic, sexual, crude teen-comedy when i sat down to see this... it turned out to be fairly accurate... only it was far more sick and disgusting than i would have thought. i don't know if the director/writer gregory poirier is sick or deeply messed up sexually, but i doubt that a normal person could have made a movie like this. i could probably have taken it if it was just that, if the only thing that was wrong was it was that it required a tough stomach... but it isn't. the film is also horribly mean-spirited and disturbing... every single character that has more than one full second of time on-screen is an extreme... sexually, mentally or physically. i don't know if this is just the director's sense of humor, but i just found it to be... wrong. just wrong. even in a comedy, there is supposed to be some seriousness. the plot is stupid. the acting is bad. the characters are inconsistent and poorly written... all of them. there isn't one single likable character in the film. the humor is disgusting and goes way too far. the film is just so incredibly poorly done that i really don't think it's worth anyone's time. if you like r-rated, crude comedies with plenty of sexual innuendo and graphic stuff, watch the groomsmen, or, better yet, american pie... or road trip, my personal favorite. but don't watch this. i can't possibly describe to you how bad it is... you would have to experience it for yourself. however, this is one of those times where i'll say that you're better off wondering. that way you can just imagine that this film goes very close to the bottom... without knowing that it goes through it, and far lower than that. this movie most of all looks like a group of horny teenage guys got together, put together a film crew, and every-time one of them got an idea, they filmed it, and later put the entire thing together. it lacks structure, consistency and taste. i recommend this only to horny teenage guys who have seen every single other r-rated crude teen comedy and who don't care about quality. everyone else... do the sensible thing; avoid this. it's not even worth it to see the booty. believe me. 1/10
