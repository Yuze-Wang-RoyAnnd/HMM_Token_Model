it's a shame that someone so idolised by many kids as well as parents should demean himself in appearing in this exploitative, bandwagon-jumping tripe. i often wonder if mr wisdom in his later years looked back at his excuse for a film with any pride. at least sally geeson had the decency to retire to doing something worthwhile after appearing in this low budget rubbish. a cameo by some long forgotten pop called the pretty things cannot rescue the film from it's awfulness. if you want 60's nostalgia invest in 'here we go round the mulberry bush' instead, starring barry evans and sally's sister judy instead.
