how much do i love this film?! now i'm not a fan of bad films, but i do love a film that is so bad it's good. this is one of those. juan pablo di pace has a great butt, looks fab on screen, and definitely doesn't make a bad turn at his acting debut (i believe). billy zane is suitably mean and moody, though i still constantly feel that there is something more in him. i felt it in titanic, the look on his face when la winslet spat on him for example, totally broken, shocked, and put-down ... fierce! kelly brook is a pretty face ... no seriously, i think that's it! it's worth catching this to see one really hot guy, some big bra fillers from brook, nasty growling from billy, laugh at the dialogue, revel in the scenery and madness of the whole affair ... i'm gona go watch it again now - yes, i bought it!!!
