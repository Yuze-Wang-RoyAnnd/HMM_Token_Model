i was actually planning to see this movie when i noticed it in my tv guide but after about 5 minutes decided time is definitely more precious than "who's that girl" could ever be worth. describing how bad madonna's acting looks like is impossible and the end result is one of the most annoying characters ever captured on film. this crap is an insult to movies and intellect. i almost never! rate a movie i don't see from start to finish, but in this case the former is impossible. 2/10
