i saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie.<br /><br />that is something that i have not done since - i have never fallen asleep at the movies.<br /><br />i love the original and have seen it several times and recommend it to everyone. this may have been the problem but i do not think so, because there were a couple of bright spots that showed if done right they could have made this movie work.<br /><br />bette was under used and anne was over used and miscast.<br /><br />i do not know why english or anyone for that matter let this go out in that condition.<br /><br />they billed this as a sex in the city but better? not a chance i liked sex in the city a lot and was disappointed by this movie.<br /><br />so do not waste your money on this movie - go see anything but this!
