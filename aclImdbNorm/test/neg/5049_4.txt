ridiculous thriller in which a group of students kidnapped their bad and neurotic teacher (mirren) just to prevent her action against them. interesting premise could render a good movie but this one is just lame and far fetched. boring with an ending embarassing, just to say the least. mrs. mirren tries to give some dignity to this misfire but even she - a good actress, no doubt about it - could save this garbage. i give this a 4 (four).
