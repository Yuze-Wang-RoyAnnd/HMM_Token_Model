savage steve holland wrote and directed his second film, one crazy summer, with john cusack and curtis armstrong again in a supporting role. cusack and bobcat goldthwait are recent graduates headed to cape cod in order to stay at goldthwait's grandmother's for the summer. along the way, they bump into demi moore being pursued by john matuszak and a motorcycle gang. soon the three are united in trying to save a house from being turned into another lobster restaurant by a conniving, spoiled family that considers "work" a dirty word. the film contains several funny vignettes like the millionaire dollar radio contest gags and the godzilla skit.<br /><br />like holland's first film, better off dead, john cusack adds immeasurably to the film. otherwise, this is a dud of a film filled with contrived situations and idiotic characters (as opposed to quirky). moore even sings a few bars in a nightclub with some horrible synthesizers. goldthwait's gags wear thin after awhile, and armstrong never was an actor of any caliber to appear in anything except grade z stuff. the tow truck twins are extremely annoying and obnoxious instead of the endearing underdogs they're obviously meant to be. this is more of a hit or miss, kitchen sink comedy which could have used a better script and direction. *1/2 of 4 stars.
