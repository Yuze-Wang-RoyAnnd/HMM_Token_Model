i've watched this film a few times and i never really liked it. i'm not a fan so termed "nu horror", so i can't be dismissed on that account. i found it a little sleazy, i think the thing that irks me about hammers is the sexploitation aspect, not sex mind you, but sexploitation. i'm surprised at how many people have rated this film so highly, so i'll have another look at it. but for me, it wasn't creepy, it had no atmosphere, just a bit of "omigod, look at those bad/stupid london prostitute women and that little innocent anna about to get raped by yet another nasty man, ooherh!" i suppose ultimately for me, the film had no depth whatsoever, just a bunch of nasty priggish men and women only there for the titillation value. this no doubt was to some degree what victorian england was like, but the sets are even too clunky and dull impart a sense of victorian menace. roger corman's horrors on the other hand, now that's style, atmosphere and elegant horror. for me, this was just exploitative, flat footed trash.
