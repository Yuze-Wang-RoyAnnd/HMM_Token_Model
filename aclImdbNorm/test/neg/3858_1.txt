there is a famous short story about a man who becomes the prey of a safari hunter who has lost interest in hunting anything except humans. its quite good, and its been done and redone in film and tv many many times. some are notable, but this urbanized version, that injects the tired old racism themes, just flat out stinks. leguizamo's slapstick is almost as weak as the unfunny script. chaplin, this guy isn't. there must be people who find a dwarf who cant stop dancing funny, i mean i suppose it is funny in a pathetic freakish way, but its just not enough to carry a movie. you have the usual nazi holdover or neo-nazi whatever the heck we are supposed to think, type villain, who's son of course is gay, german accents...get the picture?
