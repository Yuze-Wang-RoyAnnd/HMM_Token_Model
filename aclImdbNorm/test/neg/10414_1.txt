i was attracted to this film by its offbeat, low-key, 'real life' story line. that is, a twenty-something guy flops in the big apple and comes back home to live with his parents and even more floppy brother. it just might have worked but there's a problem. and that problem's name is casey affleck. <br /><br />casey affleck is nearly catatonic in this film. his acting mantra must be "exert as little effort as possible at all times". or "why speak when you can mutter?" or maybe "put yourself into a coma as soon as the camera rolls". lips moving when speaking? barely. facial expressions? none. muscles in face? atrophied. something? nothing. anything? zip.
