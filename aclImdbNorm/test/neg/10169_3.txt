a antique shop-owner in nyc, played by joanne whalley(valerie alston)gets put on a us district court jury, on a trial of a known mafioso armand asante(rusty pirone), and most of this very slow-paced film revolves around attempts of pirone attempting to get whalley to acquit him of murder, by threatening to kill her son, and herself. much action ensues, involving gruesome mob-rub outs, interspread with willam hurt as the go-between. much of this silly, disjointed mess surrounds hurt and asante's obsession with whalley, courtroom scenes that we've all seen time and again, and an ending that is unbelievable. 3/10 is probably going easy on this waste of time.
