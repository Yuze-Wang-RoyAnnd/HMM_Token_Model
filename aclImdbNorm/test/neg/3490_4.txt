i remember viewing this movie when i was a kid. i recall it terrified me immensely and it stayed with me all these years. i spent a couple of years trying to find it online...didn't remember the title, only the storyline. after searching and searching, i came across a vhs that was being sold on e-bay. i was excited and when it finally arrived, i jammed it into the vcr and couldn't help but feel a bit nostalgic. needless to say, i was slightly disappointed. this wasn't the movie i remember watching as a kid. it was boring at times and i found beryl reid's incessant whinning extremely annoying. both performances by reid and flora robson were good overall but the movie wasn't scary. i think any movie is worth viewing to form you're own opinion but sometimes, well......
