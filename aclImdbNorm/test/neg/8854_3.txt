this film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead. there's a lot of mumbo-jumbo about the internet (i.e., if you install a program on the computer, you see dead folks--much like if you play a videotape you'll die in ringu). frankly, most of this seemed rather silly and lost me. what i did find interesting is the idea that the dead live within their own separate existence--being totally alone for eternity. this was sobering and fascinating.<br /><br />i love japanese films and have seen a huge number compared to most americans. however, one genre that has become popular in recent years that i just can't relate to very well are these horror films. i know they are super popular--especially since they seem to be remade so often in the states. i've seen both ringu as well as the ring, ju-on and the grudge and was rather ambivalent despite their popularity. about the only recent horror film i really liked from japan was seance--a reworking of the great british film, seance on a wet afternoon. and what, do i think, made seance different? well, unlike the other films as well as kairo, gobs and gobs of money weren't spent on special effects or trying to scare the audience--instead, the emphasis was on the story. the bottom line is that these other films are a lot like american films like halloween or friday 13th--with scary things jumping out just to scare the audience and plot is purely secondary (at best). for me, i want story--not cheap thrills or ghosts as the primary focus of the film.<br /><br />with a relatively high rating, i know i am in the minority, but i just don't find this a very satisfying film. all too often, minor things occur that might startle someone slightly--but the characters begin screaming and crying and acting as if to say "this is the scariest film ever made so you'd better start shaking". well, i think it just tries too hard and i wish it had focused more on the afterlife seen at the end of the film and plot progression--not scare tactics.
