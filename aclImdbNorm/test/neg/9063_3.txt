as a serious marathoner, i was seriously disappointed in this film. its target audience is clearly those who have never run a marathon, or novice marathoners. following the stories of 2 first-time marathoners, one senior, one injured runner, and two elites as they prepare for the chicago marathon, the film dedicates the majority of its attention to one female beginner whose story is, for lack of a better word, boring. while i did enjoy the brief glimpses into the training sessions of deena kastor, the brief history of the boston marathon and marathoning in general, let me emphasize: these were brief!! watching some joe runners prepare for a saturday run with their water bottles and talking about how they view the marathon is not inspiring, and the nonstop clich'es about achievement and feel-good grinning runners will make you wish the film were about an hour shorter. if you are a first-time marathoner, this film may give you a feeling of "i can do it." for anyone else, run away.
