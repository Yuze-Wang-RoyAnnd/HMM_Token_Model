billed as a romantic comedy set against the early years of wwii it fails to deliver. the problem is that while beautifully photographed it has no consistent story line or narrative. starting as a murder mystery it offers no hope to its actors as it meanders through recent history. depardieu is wasted in a trivial role he obviously is not comfortable with playing. adjani cannot carry the picture. the hero is not; obviously an imitation of a hitchcock "wrongly accused" role it lacks balance. neither heroic, comic nor suspenseful.<br /><br />this could have been a good film. i am reminded of "the lady vanishes" which did combine suspense, romance and comedy in a serious film dealing with fascism.
