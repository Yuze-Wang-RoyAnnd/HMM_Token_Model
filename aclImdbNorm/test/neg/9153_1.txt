who is minding the store here? how could any producer/network executive/director let a crew stick the skeeziest fakest plastic palm trees in film history in the sands of a wintry canadian beach and try to fob it off on us as the tropics? those trees were to real palm trees what a pink tinsel k-mart christmas tree is to real fir. and who let dermot mulroney go in front of the camera with painted-on grey hair that wouldn't have passed muster in a high school play? and didn't any of the geniuses doing quality control on this thing think to correct the (excellent) canadian actor when he said gaz instead of gas? everybody involved with this plodding slug of a "movie"--writer, director, actors--has done not just good but brilliant work elsewhere. paced way too fast between events and deadly slow within them, devoid of any emotion except the obvious, expository and contrived--maybe this only seems like one of lifetime's worst movie because of all the red carpet hype with which it was presented. and i'm saying this as somebody who love lifetime. what gives, folks?<br /><br />all of that said, a certain actress's work at a certain critical turn in the movie (and if you've seen it you'll know exactly what i'm talking about) was so brilliant that the movie would have gotten a 10 from me if that was the whole movie. unfortunately it was only about five seconds of it.
