i was 12 when this film was released and adored it. the song's were inspiring and it made me feel good, watching it several time's at the cinema. i actually had the soundtrack album and played the song's over and over.<br /><br />26 years later...i'm ashamed. just sat and watched it with my 2 daughters who enjoyed it lot's but my cynical older grown up eyes hated it. it's very poorly directed in many places and considering it was lionel jeffries directing i really wanted to enjoy it. the character animation was so rough yet the backgrounds were quite good. i remember the critics at the time saying that it was a poor film and was horrified but now i agree.<br /><br />it is an old film yes, compared to what can be achieved now, maybe that's why i thought it was good then. but that does not excuse it for it's poor acting, directing and sloppiness. the main child actor's voice seem's dubbed which is very distracting too. can't quite see what they were trying achieve when it was being made, all that it become was a weak film.
