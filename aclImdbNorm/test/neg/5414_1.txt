where to start? some guy has some indian pot that he's cleaning, and suddenly skeletor attacks. he hits a woman in the neck with an axe, she falls down, but then gets up and is apparently uninjured. she runs into the woods, and it turns out there's the basement of a shopping center out there in the woods. she meets a utility worker and skeletor attacks again. luckily, like any good utility worker, he's got a gun and shoots at the guy. doesn't work, everything starts on fire.<br /><br />cut to some people walking through the woods. even though they've been hiking together for some time, they sit down and introduce themselves to each other. wouldn't they have probably done that when they first met? anyhow, they're "undercover" delta team members (undercover, i suppose, because that way they don't have to pay to dress them in uniforms). the cute girls are various things such as a sniper school instructor and, oh, i can't remember the rest. it doesn't matter. eventually they all take their guns out and immediately start aiming them at various things. ? anyhow, they meet an old indian who is sitting out in the woods. he wants beans. you know, like pork and beans? he mumbles some stuff, i can only assume that it's the premise of the movie. i relied on having heard the premise from the commercials, because you can't really understand anything he says.<br /><br />so, they walk around the woods some more. all the dialogue is a load of quasi-military, macho bs. i mean all of it, as in every single word. like "this reminds me of when we were in kabul" or "this reminds me of when we were in laos". skeletor attacks again. let me give you a rundown of a basic attack. one of the female characters is crouched behind a tree and she aims her gun at the approaching guy on the horse. for some reason, she doesn't fire but yells several times for someone else. then as skeletor approaches, she jumps out from behind the tree so that skeletor can stick her with his spear. then everybody starts shooting. the bullets cause sparks to fly from the trees. apparently the folks who made this movie never shot a tree with a bullet. they don't make sparks.<br /><br />then casper van diem is all of a sudden driving a semi-truck, trying to run over skeletor. he misses, and the truck slides to a stop. van diem is injured, apparently he slid across the seat and bumped his hip on the window crank or something, so he crawls out of the truck and it explodes. later he's in the woods dying and everybody says a bunch of quasi-military, macho bs. they meet a couple guys in the woods and blow their "undercover" status by immediately identifying themselves as being from the army. they beat on the guys for some reason, then they go away.<br /><br />some other stuff happens, people mumble, the camera shakes, etc.<br /><br />i think it comes to an end eventually.<br /><br />my theory is that the sci-fi channel is getting a little annoyed with everyone bashing their movies, so they put this out to remind us all how bad movies can really be. like, you think our movies are bad? well, you haven't seen bad. here's bad!!! okay, now that we've got that out of the way, the rest of our movies are pretty good in comparison, right?<br /><br />well, it's just a theory.
