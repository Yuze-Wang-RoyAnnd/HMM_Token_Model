i'm glad this was the last of the '40's universal mummy movies. the movies were all of variating qualities and this movie was definitely one of the lesser ones.<br /><br />problem is that it's a very slow moving movie, in which basically nothing interesting or exciting is ever happening. perhaps it would had all been better if the mummy had made his entrance earlier on in the movie. instead now the movie once again spends its first 20 minutes explaining what had all happened in the previous mummy movies, by also once again using archive footage from this time "the mummy" from 1932 again, to which this movie is the fourth mummy movie following the 1932 mummy story. the movie just never knows to find the right pace and even though the movie is barely over an hour long, it still feels a bit like a drag.<br /><br />it of course also doesn't help that the movie has a rather simplistic and actually very little interesting story. the movie also feels quite disjointed. the first and second half of the movie don't really connect to each other and they seemed like two separate movies on their own.<br /><br />at least lon chaney jr. is still in it. he once more reprises the role of the mummy kharis, for the third time. too bad that he has such limited screen time this time. he gets unfortunately very little interesting to do, which is also a big waste of the mummy character itself. the movie is further more filled with dozens of silly actors who are playing around with silly accents. it seemed so totally unnecessary to me that most of the characters had to speak with such an accent and it actually gets quite distracting and annoying at points.<br /><br />the mummy movies that's least worth seeing.<br /><br />4/10
