a cut above from the usual straight to video actioneer, airborne has enough in the tank to keep it going for the full 90 minutes, although you can't help but think of how low former '80's comedy golden boy steve guttenburg has stooped to be in such a cheap production (and playing a hard man too!). the plot is simple, the baddies have stolen a deadly virus and guttenburg and the rest of his goodie pals are sent to retrieve it, not bad of its kind but not in the same league (obviously) as the films it is compared too on the cover such as air force one and con air. the cast is good though, with sean bean reprising his brit.-bad guy character which we have had a glimpse of in such box office smashes as goldeneye and patriot games.
