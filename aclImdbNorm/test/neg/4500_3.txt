gamera vs viras was made lazily and much of it suffers as a result.<br /><br />space aliens try to take over earth and are stopped by gamera. so they send another ship that manages to kidnap two young boys. the aliens then take control of gamera and get him to attack mankind.<br /><br />first of all i must say that i really enjoyed the monster fight at the end between gamera and viras. viras looks like a big squid with a beak. he has no energy weopons and does not shoot any rays out but he can close the apendages on top of his head to make a sharp pointy weopon. so overall this is not a bad monster for gamera to fight and is decent. viras really injures gamera badly by stabbing his underside of his shell with his pointy head and i am surprised gamera was able to survive this.<br /><br />unfortunately gamera vs viras decided to use footage from previous gamera films to fill time for this film. they re show the battles between gamera and barugon and gamera and gaos when the aliens look at gameras past battles. however when they show gamera's battles with gaos they show the battle between gamera and gaos in the city first, then they show the final battle between the two. after they show re used footage of the final battle between gamera and gaos they show the first battle between gamera and gaos!!! talk about showing the battles in non chronological order. they did not even need to show the first battle they should have just stopped after they showed the final battle between the two.<br /><br />another issue is that they decide to re show footage of gamera attacking cities when the aliens order him to attack tokyo. so they show the scene from "gamera vs barugon" where he destroys the dam. after the show scenes from "gamera the invincible" which is a huge issue for me. mainly due to the fact that "gamera the invincible" was in black and white!!!! using stock footage from a black and white film in a color film is really lazy and that is not a good thing.<br /><br />also the dubbing is bad once again. the two little kids are not that annoying but it would be nice to see a gamera film that did not involve little kids.<br /><br />so the over use of footage from other gamera films is a deterrant to this film. the final fight is awesome so basically i recommend skipping to the final ten minutes and watching this film. the rest is something that has already been seen before.
