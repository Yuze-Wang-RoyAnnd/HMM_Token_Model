this one hardly compares to the space adventures of its time. those being star wars and star trek. and while i am no fan of star trek, i recognize that this film pales in comparison to the series trekkies ooze over. in fact, i would place back to the future in better light in terms of space and travel.<br /><br />the story is of a boy who is captured by space raiders (pirates). in a obviously fake and unentertaining battle, the captured boy befriends the pirates and even helps them. and slowly, one by one, those raiders die off. in the end, the boy gets to return home and the last remaining pirates escapes gravely wounded.<br /><br />the acting wasn't that great. but what really is obvious is the total lack of interesting dialogue, effects, and storyline. how they even got 80 minutes of this is beyond me.<br /><br />if you want to take a shot at it because it involves space, go ahead. but be warned.
