tom selleck plays an absentee son to senile "pop" don ameche and weary mom anne jackson, making up for his indiscretions (one presumes) and taking them in after ameche has burned down his mobile home; meanwhile, selleck's job is vanquished by the f.b.i., his assets are frozen, his wife and kids leave him and his obnoxious sister and her brats have come to stay. brightly-painted comedy-of-ills is as out of touch with reality as ameche's doddering old coot. perhaps a serious first draft (with scenes such as ameche walking out into traffic with two toddlers) was incorporated into a sillier second or third version (with selleck getting poked, bumped, prodded, and eventually losing a toe and a testicle!). either way, it's a painful experience, and selleck's sudden dedication to his father makes little sense; he hobbles around and howls in pain, but retains his heart of mush. this movie is mush. * from ****
