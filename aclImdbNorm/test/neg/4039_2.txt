as you can tell from the other comments, this movie is just about the worst film ever made. let me see how many different words i can use to describe it: boring, unbearable, laughable, lousy, stupid, horrible.....<br /><br />i could go on with such descriptions but you probably get the point.<br /><br />i would have given this a 0, if possible--bad acting, bad directing, bad production, bad plot.<br /><br />this was made in 2001 and it looks more like 1965. very low budget, boring plot, horrible acting, really bad special effects, etc...<br /><br />i rarely ever see a sci-fi film i absolutely think is this bad. i mean this is pure garbage. it has nothing going for it either. as far as a "b-movie" this is the very bottom of the lot.<br /><br />i think i would be more entertained by staring at a blank piece of paper for 90 minutes. junk like this gives good low-budget "b" movies a bad name. this makes ed wood movies look good.<br /><br />the thing about watching direct-to-video movies is, just when you think you've seen the worst, you see something even worse!<br /><br />dj perry is a horrible actor and has no individual characteristics that make him stand out.<br /><br />avoid this waste at all costs! oh the humanity!
