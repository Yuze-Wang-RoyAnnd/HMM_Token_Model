if it wasn't for the very attractive jennifer jostyn in the lead role, i would have turned "milo" off after the first 30 minutes. however, as easy on the eyes as she is, she's not enough to save this film, not by a long shot.<br /><br />milo starts off with a group of young girls accompanying an "assumed young boy" in a yellow slicker to a house in the woods where he shows them embryos in jars. apparently, the deal was that if he showed them the jars, ol' milo gets to conduct a gynecologist exam on each in return. one of the group volunteers to be milo's "first patient" and he leads her behind closed doors. moments later blood flows from under the door and we are whisked into present day. enter the lovely jostyn who plays one of the girls all grown up in present day. a substitute teacher with shallow confidence whose closest friend appears to be a goldfish, she receives an invitation to return home for a friend's wedding. yep! you guessed it. return to miloville. milo, who allegedly drowned years ago, seems to be having a dilemma staying dead and begins terrorizing and murdering the girls he failed to "examine" all those years ago.<br /><br />milo, the character, reminded me of one of the mutants from cronenberg's "the brood." he could have been scary, but just how scary can a villain be who wears a yellow raincoat? the plot confuses even itself and the conclusion left me wanting my 90 minutes back. i'm sending milo, an inept slasher film, to stand in the corner!
