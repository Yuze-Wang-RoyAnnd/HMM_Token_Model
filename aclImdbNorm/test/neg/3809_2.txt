this movie is one of the worse examples of hype. people who read imdb comments might be tempted to view this total waste of time, as i was, by false tag-lines like " a throwback to 80's horror" and what-not. this movie sucks, from the acting to the directing to the story. horrible, all across the board. and i really like good horror films, i am not at all a snob. this sucked. for reference, i loved the grudge 1 and 2, black sheep, planet terror, texas chaisaw massacre the beginning, the others, the ring, jason x, slither, planet terror, and really hated the ring 2, texas chainsaw massacre(re-make)wolf creek, the hills have eyes(re-make)hostel 1 and 2, and this movie. gore doesn't trump fun or originality.
