andy milligan, the independent movie maker from new york, directs this little "treat" as his version of the sweeney todd legend. sweeney slits the throats of customers in his barbershop and his cohort mrs. lovett turns them into meat pies. thankfuly i was well-informed of the plot prior to seeing this film travesty. milligan, for my money, has to indeed be running in the lead of worst directors of all-time race. ed wood looks like orson welles in comparison. this movie is so bad in oh so many ways. let's take milligan's direction for starters. the film quality is grainy. the sound quality is grainy. many scenes look as if milligan was using a camcorder to film. the credits say "photograped and directed by andy milligan." he wants to take credit for ceilings showing up after a death scene? how about the atrocious musical score selected for the film? the film cuts with one poor transition after another. little logic is used in the creation of the plot. the story has little to do with the actual legend of todd. the murder scenes are plentiful but not horrifying in any way. hands, legs, and other appendages are cut with the skill in which the editing was done: choppily! and let's take the breast in the pie scene. yes, it is in there. the pie maker didn't know that an entire breast with nipple filled an entire pie crust? later we hear from our characters that they "have been careful not to get caught" for the 200 plus murders they have done. obviously they are a couple of boobs not able to keep abreast of what is going on(sorry it was too tempting). the actors are not too terribly bad to be honest. some even have glimmers of talent, and all seem to be genuine english articles. many non-erotic nude scenes are forced throughout. milligan seemingly has some issues regarding sex. plot strands are left untied. the ending is almost unwatchable due to poor camera work. i could go on and on. did i like anything about the film? not much to be truthful. i have a high level of acceptance for films of this ilk in terms of low budgets and marginal talent, but this film lacks any real purpose other than to be crude and sick.
