by all appearances this serial could have been made any time since the mid forties. the cardboard sets, the moon kings with lightning bolts sewn onto their aprons, you know the drill. this one is a rocky jones adventure, featuring the space cop's dealings with the insufferable bitch queen of planet offeecious, a commie planet that won't join the united planets. when the noble messengers of intergalactic reason announce that offeecious is on a collision course with this other, vaguely slavic planet, bitch queen decides to blow the other guys up rather than evacuate her land. this introduces a moral to the effect of "the greatness of a nation is not in its land, but its people," which is hammered home five or six times in the climactic talkfest. the bq's constant nasal ranting about "offeeeecious" provides relief from some seriously wanting space effects, is this a tv show?
