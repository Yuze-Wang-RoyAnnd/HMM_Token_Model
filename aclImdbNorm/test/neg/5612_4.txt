rutger hauer helps along a film that basically can be summed up in the young person finding themselves category, and rather obviously so, so it needs a lot of help.<br /><br />the beginning holds a lot more promise, of a film that could turn into michael clayton or stranger than fiction. it's too bad because i really got hooked into the beginning. then, like the opening soundtrack, it went from great and intriguing to basically nowhere.<br /><br />it's fun enough with plenty of curiosities and interesting characters acted well. i'm sure that will be enough for many people. the problem is it all feels contrived and empty which, ironically, is supposed to be the main discovery for the character's self realization. not the film itself (it's not a self aware film), but that the character is supposed to recognize his own life is contrived and empty.
