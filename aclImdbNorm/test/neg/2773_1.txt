i gotta go with my boy allen (who also reviewed this film)...zombie gangbangers (as my copy is entitled - guess they left out the "ninja" part after realizing there isn't a single "ninja" nor reference to ninjas anywhere in the whole f!cking film...) is a total wasted of time. honestly one of the most boring, retarded "films" i've ever had the displeasure of viewing.<br /><br />a hooker is repeatedly (un-graphically) raped by two zombies, and then by a cop (again, un-graphically) when the cop doesn't believe her story. she meets a guy who was beaten up by said zombies and the two try to find a way to seek vengeance on the undead culprits...<br /><br />first off - there is no "gangbanging" (or really other "banging" at all) to be had in zombie ninja gangbangers. i was hoping to at least get some sort of horror/porn hybrid a la porn of the dead, or re-penetrator, or perhaps perverted stories - but no - there was absolutely no sex in this film. at least a bit o' the ol' in-out might have redeemed this boring garbage to some degree, but without it, we get a bunch of poorly shot scenes of complete boredom with zero payoff. i'm all for "trash" films and most other schlock, gore, porn, and exploit material, but this one honestly sucks in every conceivable way. save your time, pass this one up...1/10 (and the one is only for a few brief shots of some sub-par titties...)
