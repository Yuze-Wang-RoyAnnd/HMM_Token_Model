oh, the horror! i've seen a lot of gore movies in my day, but this one just makes me gag with with laughter rather than repulsiveness. this is definitely a crazy movie and is very low-budget, i might add, but if you're able to look past the cheap audio, horrible dialogue, ugly girls, the obviously fake gore scenes, and overall cheeziness of the film, then you might find some of this film to be somewhat entertaining. the story is about a copy cat killer who goes on a killing spree every "5th day, of the 5th month, of the 5th year" (wow, how original), and it's up to two detectives (one of whom gave a valiant effort at trying to make the crapy dialogue good) to stop the killer's bloody rampage. the killing scenes (which are done with a plastic toy knife) are pretty brutal (which is a good thing), but very annoying due to the constant repetition of an obviously recorded scream (which is very ear piercing). as for the gore, there's plenty of it but it looks very fake; especially the blood - dude, c'mon, purple blood? but, if you're a fan of gore videos, like myself, then you'll find something in this video to cherish like i did (the crap-talking detective...he's the best thing going for this film). other than that, all you're going to find is a bunch of senseless nudity (which is also a good thing, but too bad the girls are ooogly) and a very idiotic hippy necrophiliac serial killer. sorry, but this one sucks.
