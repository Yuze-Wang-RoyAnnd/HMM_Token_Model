i went into this movie with an open mind. i had been too lazy to go to the video store to pick out a movie, and my friend returned with this. i promised him i wouldn't laugh at his choice, but within the first five minutes i told him i would have to take back my promise. we kept watching, just hoping it would get better, but no; a continual mind-rape followed.<br /><br />this "movie" was probably one of the worse ever committed to film, and surely deserves a place on the imdb bottom 100. i really don't know how this got distributed. the lighting was poor. i have seen better acting in elementary school plays. there is really nothing positive to say about it.
