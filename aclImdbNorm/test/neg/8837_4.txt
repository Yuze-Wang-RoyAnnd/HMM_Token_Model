sad to say this is one of the sillier of john wayne's series of poverty row westerns for lone star productions. here he is a united states marshal on the trail of a bandit known only, i kid you not, as the shadow.<br /><br />no it's not lamont cranston, it's some dude who gives his orders through an open wall safe so his men don't see who he is. but the voice is unmistakable, you'll know within 10 minutes of the film. <br /><br />and another reviewer here is quite wrong, no squeals or groans from the audience would have occurred because gabby hayes was still playing a variety of roles and he's clean shaven here. he had not yet found his niche as the lovable oldtimer sidekick of various movie cowboy heroes like the duke.<br /><br />later on he does lead his men quite openly in the climax so i'm not sure what the point of the original gimmick with the wall safe was. i don't think those that wrote this one knew either.<br /><br />wayne gets yakima canutt as an indian sidekick here and the relationship is just about the same as an unmasked lone ranger and tonto.<br /><br />it's all pretty silly if you ask me.
