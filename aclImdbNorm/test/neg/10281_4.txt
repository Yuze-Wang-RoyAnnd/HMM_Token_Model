first off, i am a huge fan of robert blake, always have been.<br /><br />this movie came on movieplex last night 10/13, and the title interested me & of course the star. but after watching it i was left more confused than i was before it started.... there are some good scenes, and i thought they would lead somewhere, but they didn't, it turned out to be an "anti-cop" "anti-buddy" "anti-hippie", pretty much "anti-everything movie", with an extremely confusing plot that also went nowhere.<br /><br />robert blake is great as the lead, well as great as someone could be with this bad movie, i am still a huge fan of mr. blake and love his acting even in crap like this...but this drug induced 70's tripe, well... better stay away from this one...and, that ending, what a pisser.
