a movie that tries hard to say something and generally fails. like the fatuous academics that populate the movie, it meanders aimlessly, substituting endless (it seems like forever listening to it) conversation for some action or plot direction.<br /><br />sadly, it's one of the best examples of canadian cinema i've seen.
