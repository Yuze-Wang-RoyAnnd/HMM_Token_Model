i really like ryan reynolds and hope davis and i actually had high hopes watching this last night on dvd. mainly as i try to avoid reviews until i watch something myself and form my own opinion big mistake! my 2 /10 is for the first segment which in fairness is actually quite decent and if they had made the movie about the characters in section 1 alone it may have risen above the 5/10 mark.once it moved into tv 'reality show' territory it stank to high heaven. ryan reynolds captured the essence of an actor on the edge wonderfully but as a gay tv writer and famous games creator / devoted family man he was definitely less effective. from the blurb on the box i expected a flashback thriller along the lines of 'memento' - unfortunately this is nowhere near that standard of movie.
