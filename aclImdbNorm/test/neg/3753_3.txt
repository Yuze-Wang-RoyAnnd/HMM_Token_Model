let's face it, this is a pretty bad film.however if you go in ready to make fun of it you can survive the experience.okay, you'll scream in agony a lot.african jungle fun in a dopey kind of way.<br /><br />tom conway (who spends most of the film wearing a funky chapeau) is using the local witch doctor and mad science to create a "perfect" being.it looks like a varmint that has been on a six week drunk and is in a sack dress.ugly is being kind.but it won't kill for him because he's using a good girl as his subject.he needs a bad bad girl.<br /><br />marla english and lance fuller are two petty crooks in search of african gold.acting lessons for ms english should have been at the top of the search list.she's a bad girl and lets everybody know it in a performance worthy of a junior high school play.mike "touch" connors is the white guide english & fuller con into leading the expedition.<br /><br />english & conway finally meet and it is a match made in hell.she is the perfect subject to become his voodoo creature because she'll do anything (stress anything) to get what she wants.you will do anything to stop the agony of this movie at this point.<br /><br />what made this movie interesting for me was conway wearing that funky tribal hat/headdress/floral piece!still trying to figure out what kind of dead animal it was.guess he thought if he pulled it down low enough over his eyes nobody would recognize him.<br /><br />truly bad cinema.
