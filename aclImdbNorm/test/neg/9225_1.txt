if there's anything worse than this movie i don't want to see it. i remember so many amazing things--a nun dropped out of a coffin to make a raft for a little blond boy; the little blond boy himself adored as a god; lots of stock footage of peru as an ideal vacation spot. shining path and alberto fujimori should blast away any notion that peru is a vacation paradise. the whole thing is so awful that plan 9 or even robot monster is an aesthetic treat by comparison. this film should be bombed and strafed and bombed again.
