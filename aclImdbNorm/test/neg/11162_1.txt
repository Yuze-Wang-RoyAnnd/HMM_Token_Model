love the tpb's but this was a lame episode. didn't have the same feel that the series or the movie has. looked like it was put together in a hurry. i didn't enjoy it at all. the so-called acting was awful. the cast appeared like they knew this was a money-grab of an episode to get to market quickly. i hope we don't have an easter special next because that will be it for me. the writing of this episode was definitely mike clattenburg's worst in the history of this show. the direction left a lot to be desired and i almost felt bad for the cast and crew of this weak attempt at a christmas special. like i said, i love the tpb's but this one goes to the trash bin.
