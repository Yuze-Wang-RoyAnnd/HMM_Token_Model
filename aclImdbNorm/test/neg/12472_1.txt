though i have watched sal`o, i do not know if excrement tastes tart. if it does, this "film" is accurately titled. so much of roughage, so little substance, this is the celluloid equivalent of celery - only it does not cleanse the palate. it leaves the taste of wasted time in the mind's mouth, and if i could vomit this film and get back that expanse/expense i would. detention was more exciting. the director should be forced to wear a dunce cap, and the spirit of ed wood jr. couldn't save this semi-professional projection from certain failure. a waste of time, a waste of mind. **don't be fooled by the toothsome dominique swain: competent eye-candy she was in the lolita remake, less tragic and savvier than sue lyon, though by no means better. however, a previously competent turn of the screw does not make her a skilled crafts-person. you need craft for that, not crap, which is what this film is. the reels belong in the girls' bathroom, flushed till the pipes burst, while director/direct-less christina wayne should do 5-10 in study hall. watch anything else and pass this class, by (bye), forever!
