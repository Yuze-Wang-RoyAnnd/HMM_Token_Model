i rented this one by accident. i lifted the video up and looked at the back and thought "shameless blair witch rip-off". then, in a moment of carelessness, i grabbed 'the francisville experiment' thinking it was something else. my horror upon arriving home and realizing my mistake was far more terrifying than anything this film had to offer. boring characters, bad acting, and a feeling of 'we saw the blair witch project and could do the same' permeate the action to the point where watching on fast forward will lead you straight to the credits. i'm not one to fault film makers for being lazy or desperate, but after this yawn-fest i felt the need to warn everyone: don't waste your time, you have a life.
