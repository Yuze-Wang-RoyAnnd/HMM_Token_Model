an "independant" film that, from the back of the box, promises twists, adventure and an emotional adventure we will never forget. this film also fools us into watching it by flaunting rachel lee cook with a starring role. after the first twenty minutes, you realize that this movie is going to give you nothing. the story goes on aimlessly, revealing nothing new or important to keep us interested. all three "disturbed" characters have only small grains of back story to force us to care. just as you reach the end, everything about the story is altered and instead of helping the audience catch up, you are left with no idea, and more importantly, no interest in "why". the director, who also thought it would be a good idea to co-star, seems to come into the film with no prior experience or knowledge of useful filmmaking. the entire piece looks like a college "art" film crafted by a freshman film student trying to hide a lack of true talent.
