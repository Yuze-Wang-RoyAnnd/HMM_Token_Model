the blame of this terrible flick lies with the director, martin campbell. after viewing a few of his credits in later years, this must have been one of his first directorial gigs. he had a more than decent cast to work with but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing. there were scenes that made absolutely no sense at all. where was his head...............was he on drugs? i was looking forward to this movie just because of oldman & bacon. maybe it was a short shooting schedule and campbell just had to "bang it out". i can't imagine that the story that campbell directed even came close to the story that the writer wrote. oldman & bacon, along with the rest of the cast, must have slid under their chairs if they went to the screening. as one poster pointed out, karen young did do a pretty good fight scene with bacon. she really did 'let loose'. it's unfortunate that i have to fill in more space just to stay within the guide lines of what the imdb requires because i really don't have anything more to say about this uninspiring film. one does not have to be forced to be a 'windbag' when criticizing a terrible flick and wish that the imdb would change the amount of words to fill up a critique.
