catherine zeta-jones and aaron eckhart star in a "romantic" drama about an uptight chef played by zeta-jones, who ends up carrying for her niece when her sister is killed in a car crash. while she's out taking care of family matters she's replaced by eckhart.<br /><br />unfunny maudlin tale with no chemistry between the leads (she's a dead fish and he's okay, but not much of anything). watching this i was wondering why anyone would want to see this since zeta-jones' character is so unlikable. come on she's so obsessed with cooking and being the best all she does is cook for her therapist or talk about food. ugh. i won't use any of the numerous puns that come to mind. i couldn't finish it.
