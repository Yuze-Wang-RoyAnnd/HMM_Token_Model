frederick forsyth's books are always so intricately plotted, with twists and turns, and usually a great surprise ending. this adaptation had none of that.<br /><br />so much of what was great in the book (the history of monk and the betrayed agents; the plot to influence the outcome of the russian election) were completely missing in this adaptation. instead, there's this completely new plot about bio-weapons that was a yawner.<br /><br />forsyth's protagonists always operated in the shadows, forever just slightly beyond the reach of the antagonists. the joys of his books have always been the machinations of carrying out their mission. this film resigned itself to gunfights and car chases early on.<br /><br />swayze's monk might as well have hung a sign around his neck saying "i am a secret agent" for all the attention that he called to himself during the film. and with all of that attention, the amount of time that it took the bad guys to catch up to him was surprising.<br /><br />granted there was some energy to this film, which is why i'm giving it a "3" instead of a "1". it was also great to see some underutilized pros like patrick bergin, ben cross, michael york, and barry morse.<br /><br />i hope that someday, someone will once again do justice to a forsyth film adaptation like "day of the jackal" did.
