this contains some spoiler information, but the movie is not worth watching anyway...<br /><br />why ellen barkin and peta wilson agreed to be a part of this debacle by writer-director damian harris is beyond me. the story is full of unrealistic police investigating techniques, which includes going to a party with a suspect and inviting that suspect over to your house and getting intimate with them. the tale also features a male psychiatrist who seems to have nothing but female clients - and he sleeps with them all.<br /><br />even more over-the-top is the notion that the female victims to a horrendous s/m crime belong to a large, yet secret, group of s/m lesbian executives.<br /><br />full of bad editing and continuity errors, the film is sterile in all of its ritzy locations - including barkin's detective salary apartment. and the lame dialogue is fit to put one to sleep. <br /><br />damian is a bad writer and a bad director. he tried and failed miserably to create a noiresque atmosphere at times. furthermore, he couldn't get ellen barkin to give 110%. i firmly believe she realized the film was pathetic and gave up trying. <br /><br />standouts were peta wilson, who wasted time studying with a dominatrix for the part. the highly under-rated character actor, marshall bell gave his absolute best as always.<br /><br />and since damian couldn't deliver on any level, it was hard to feel emotion for any of the characters. <br /><br />most importantly, he doesn't know much about the real world of bdsm and chose to create the typical "hollywood reality" of gorgeous men and women who are perverted and dangerous.<br /><br />save your time, money and braincells and pass this one by.
