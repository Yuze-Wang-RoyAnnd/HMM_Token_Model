code 46 is one of those scifi movies where the government controls who you are allowed to love, and in fact will punish you if you try to procreate with the wrong person. the haves and the have-nots live in completely separate territories, the powers that be can remove your memories, etc. we've seen this stuff before, but that's ok- no movie is 100% original. this kind of premise is always fun to contemplate. unfortunately, just imagining such a future is more interesting than actually watching code 46. the characters are boring and rarely say anything interesting. maybe that's commentary on a dehumanized future, but it's still dull to watch. it's sloooow.<br /><br />at times the imagery is nice, but usually (coupled with its "evocative" soundtrack) just looks like a glorified perfume commercial. code 46 also sometimes uses the kind of television camera-work that i find annoying. you know, two characters talk as the camera artlessly "floats" on one side. two seconds later it's floating on the other side of them in a vain attempt to keep your attention.<br /><br />my friends liked this movie. if they tried to get me to watch it again, i probably would not do so unless they agreed to pay me $50.
