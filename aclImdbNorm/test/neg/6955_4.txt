a vehicle for michael caine. its fairly well written and there's some ok acting in it but, really, it's a mess - not funny enough, not frightening enough. it's a flaccid modern cockney thriller.<br /><br />i like the premise - that even in the refracted moral hinterland of east london people do do things for the right reasons. a surprise result to the first proper fight caine's old-school billy shiner has promoted inflames his paranoia. the second half of the film has him chasing shadows to deal with the disappointment of the outcome of the first.<br /><br />my greatest disappointment was in director john irvin's failure to make more of the relationship between shiner and his lieutenant/filial substitute frank harper. harper's, a british tom sizemore, understands his role well whilst those around him seem to have ignored it. pity. 4/10
