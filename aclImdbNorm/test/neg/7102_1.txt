why lori petty was cast as tank girl, i'll never know. her acting performance is lack-luster. her voice is grating. it's almost impossible for me to put into words how bad this movie is.<br /><br />there are several "modern-pop" references in the film, which i found to be very strange, given that the movie was supposed to take place far in the future. it wouldn't have been hard to make this premise interesting either. some better writing would have helped loads.<br /><br />naomi watts makes an appearance in it as a mild mannered techno-geek. i think they should have probably switched roles.<br /><br />i'll never know why anyone would like this movie, unless they were a petty fan.<br /><br />try not to see this movie. total waste of time.
