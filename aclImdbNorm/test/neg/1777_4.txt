stinger starts '3 months ago' on the submarine the ss newark where genetic experiments have gone awry & the crew member are brutally slaughtered by large killer scorpions... jump to 'camp pendleton' a couple of months later where general ashford (james cagnard) brief's lieutenant williams (john miranda) on his mission to board the newark & assist genetic scientist dr. carly ryan (michelle meadows), before anyone knows it a group of corporate scientists & marines are on-board the newark & are shocked to discover he mutilated corpses of the crew apart from dr. mike thompson (casey clark) who doesn't make much sense. it's not long before the scorpions attack, first to fall is lt. williams so sergeant sam harmon (christopher persson) is promoted & takes the responsibility to get everyone to safety & end the menace of the giant scorpions forever...<br /><br />this sweedish america co-production was directed by martin munthe & he also handled the cinematography & i thought this was a strictly by-the-numbers uninspiring creature feature. it's early into the new year & stinger is the first giant genetically mutated monster/creature/insect type film i've seen in 2007, hopefully things can only get better... the script by mat nastos is incredibly clich'ed & gets all of it's ideas from other films most notably aliens (1986), lets see there's the isolated location in this case being a submarine, there's the hastily assembled team of marines including one who chews on a cigar throughout the entire film, there's the scientists including a blonde sweedish one to try & explain it all & the evil money grabbing corporate villain who puts the mighty dollar above human life & the final ingredient being the monster/alien/insect or whatever, in this case there's loads of large scorpions running around but they're not utilised in any sort of unique or imaginative way so they might as well have been killer grasshoppers. yeah, it's all here, unfortunately stinger isn't an aliens if you get what i mean. it's a touch long at over 100 minutes & it's throughly predictable although it moves along at a reasonable pace & as a dumb creature feature you could do worse despite what many say on the imdb...<br /><br />director munthe doesn't distinguish himself, it's not scary, there's a lack of atmosphere & the action scenes are dull & unexciting. there's not many scorpion attacks & it's almost an hour before any significant action occurs, the special effects are at the bottom end of the scale but i have seen worse that's for sure. i mean that's not to say the effects in stinger are good but i've seen worse. there isn't much blood or gore, there's some mutilated bodies, some decapitated heads & someone is ripped in half. the only clever & amusing moment in the entire film is when the naked sweedish female scientist ask's her lover to turn her on by talking about all the money their going to make from the scorpions... however there was a moment which had me groaning & tearing my hair out in it's stupidity as a bloke tries to repair the submarine's circuitry & get the lights working by hitting the power supply/computer boards with a hammer & it works as well...<br /><br />technically stinger is average at best & there's the usual endless amount of dark corridors which gets monotonous. stinger was shot in stockholm in sweeden if your interested. the acting was poor & there's nothing else to say.<br /><br />stinger isn't a great film & it isn't a great horror film either, i can't recommend it at all but i've seen worse. if you liked stinger (unlikely) you might like the similarly themed 'giant scorpions on the loose' films tail sting (2001) or scorpius gigantus (2006) (just as unlikely).
