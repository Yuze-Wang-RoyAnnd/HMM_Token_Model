virginal innocent indri finds herself at a house of prostitution run by ruthless pimp mg. indri winds up incarcerated in mg's private prison after she refuses to make love to him. of course, indri and worldly top con helga join forces and plan to escape. maman firmansyah's blah, uninspired direction and piet burnama's dull, talky script thoroughly undermine any trashy vitality this flick needs in order to qualify as a pleasing piece of babes-behind-bars exploitation junk: the sluggish pace painfully drags throughout, there's no gratuitous female nudity whatsoever (the girls don't even show any skin during the obligatory group shower scene!), the expected torture and degradation are both extremely tame and tepid, the moderate crummy gore likewise fails to impress, and even a ridiculous catfight sequence ain't nothing to get excited about. thomas susanto's pedestrian cinematography, the laughably lousy dubbing, the excruciatingly overlong 102 minute running time, the sappy theme song, and gatot sudarto's cornball score add further abject insult to already appalling injury. only some decent last reel break-out action offers a little relief from the otherwise overly abundant stultifying tedium. a complete yawn-inducing dud.
