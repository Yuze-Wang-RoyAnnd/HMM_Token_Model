this movie had very little good points, the special effects and acting was horrible for sure. but it was a movie made on a low budget so you dont expect much from it, it does have some laughs (i doubt they are intended though :) ). the scene where the old woman bends down and touches dung that was on the floor, then puts it to her nose and goes chupacabra! in a really stupid raspy voice was priceless. all in all if you have nothing else to watch and just want to laugh at a really crappy flick trying to cash in on the blair witch project's success, then grab it other then that dont bother.
