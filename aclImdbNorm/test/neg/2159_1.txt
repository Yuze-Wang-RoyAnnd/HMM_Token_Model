yes, my summary just about tells it all.<br /><br />if you haven't watched this, try it. but not for pleasure. for studies of one of the worst examples of trying to be politically correct, family-oriented and "cool" at the same time.<br /><br />the men always think they know everything, are stupid, and finally loose to the magnificent women. etc.. this is especially offensive, when all the characters are just as terrible and stereotypic. i mean, ok, "cody" was funny one time or another, but unlike other "stupid characters(tm)" like woody in cheers or joey in friends, he doesn't get good lines. his stupidity is cast in a "duude" way, which gets quite annoying after a while.<br /><br />the family morale is awful. everything for the family. mother and father are supreme dictators, who inbetween severe punishing and old-fashioned parenting, constantly say they "love" their kids, and then of course, in the end, the kids love them back *barf*.<br /><br />and: there's always a "tender spot" like that squeezed into the "action", where american(c)(tm) morale lessons are forced upon the viewers, about sex (in a mature, you can't have sex before you're 18 (!!), kind of way), or drugs. even church-habits are thoroughly described here. the whole concept is directly sickening, all made in a half-hearted way to make money. if there are people like karen and frank out there, please lock them up and desintegrate the key.<br /><br />so, with themes ranging as far as revolting religious propaganda, i think it's fair to conclude as i did in my subject...
