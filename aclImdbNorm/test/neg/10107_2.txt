ok, it was a "risky" move to rent this flick, but i thought i had nothing to lose.well, i was wrong. this is, next to "bloodsurf", the worst "horrormovie" i have ever seen. crappy actors, crappy technical output, crappy story and so on. the soundtrack though, isn't to bad. that is why i give it a 2 on the vote and not just a 1. and of course the cats are a positive surprise. by far the superior actors in this movie..... do not rent or buy it. stay away from it and hope that this horrible, horrible film will vanish to some obscure existence and not become a "cult classic". it most definitely do not deserve any recognition.
