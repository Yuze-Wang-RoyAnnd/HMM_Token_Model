matthew aldrich. this is a name worthy of remembrance. this is the individual that took fingers to keyboard and came up with one of the worst scripts of all time. clich'e. predictable. an insult to the public's intelligence.<br /><br />is he the sole beneficiary of blame? of course not. renny harlin took this abysmal excuse for a script and made it into a movie. sam jackson and ed harris actually read it (or not) and chose to star in it. culpability abounds.<br /><br />this is the denise richards of film scripts. there aren't enough razzies in the universe to give proper recognition to how truly horrible this writing really is.<br /><br />in all fairness, samuel jackson's profession is incredibly novel and the manner in which it's presented is highly creative, but, at the end of the day, it's all just trimmings. pretty trimmings.<br /><br />package it any way you want- garbage writing is still garbage writing.
