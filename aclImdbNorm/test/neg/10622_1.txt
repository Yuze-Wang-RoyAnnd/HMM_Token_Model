this movie made me want to bang my head against the wall. it is hard to compare such badness as this to anything, but some say that watching this movie is similar to bleeding from under your fingernails. and that comment comes from the writer's cousin. this movie was so flipping bad, it made "hulk" (the second worst movie ever) look like "the departed" (one of the greatest movies in cinematic history). if you like boring family movies with predictable plot lines, then you will absolutely love this movie. if you have a brain, then you definitely will not. when i rented this movie, i actually fell asleep while watching it. the next day, i finished it from where i left off, and it was the worst decision of my life.
