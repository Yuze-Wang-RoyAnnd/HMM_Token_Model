i am a huge horror fan, particularly spanish horror. this film had so many possibilities to be good. it's a marvelous idea, a vigilante ghost nun, as most of what has come out of jaume balanguer'o's mind. both visual and sound effects were also pretty good. but everything was shamefully spoiled by bad direction, awful casting and a painfully bad (exposition, exposition!) script. too bad. maybe balanguer'o should write and direct himself a remake...<br /><br />moreover, i don't really understand why this had to be spoken in english by actors who can't really speak english (and when they do, they do it so bad it just makes their performances even more fake). if you look at contemporary spanish horror films like el orfanato or rec, the performances are totally in tune with this type of stylish ghost story - and that is being realistic, being believable as someone like ourselves, like real people, because that is the only way horror achieves it's goal. unfortunately, everything failed in la monja.
