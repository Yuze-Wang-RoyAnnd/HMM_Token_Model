the beginning of this movie had me doubting that it would be little more than a typical b sci-fi flick. but, as it progressed i began to get interested and i saw the whole thing through. the premise is interesting, original, and has the makings of making a classic. alas, it instead ended up a mediocre movie, done in by the usual factors which turn a potentially good movie into a bad movie (bad acting, low budget etc.). i'm interested to see how this would turn out if it were remade with good actors and a big hollywood budget.
