this film fails on many many levels. the script is the first failing, and as i understand it, if the script stinks, there's nothing that can fix that. the plot is boring, after the first 45 minutes, i'm looking at the counter on the dvd saying to myself, "how much longer?" the cinematography is pretty awful. i'm not sure how bad the transfer was to dvd, but it looked like a vhs copy. also, the sound was bad. i realize this isn't going to get remixed for 5.1, but yikes, it didn't even sound like it was in dolby stereo which had been around for almost a decade when they cut this film.<br /><br />slipstream was far too similar to both mad max and blade runner for comfort. because of the lack of decent special effects and high quality dialog, it is extremely disappointing. if i recall, the pointer scene took place during the last 20 minutes, usually it should take place in the first 20. most people will be totally confused as to what the heck is going on until the final 20 minutes.<br /><br />the film's music was excellent in parts, and then completely inappropriate in others. elmer bernstien did the scoring, but it sounds like someone else had a hand in sticking in 'other' stuff elsewhere as it doesn't match the overall good orchestral score (with some synthesizer music.)<br /><br />there were great actors cast, bob peck, mark hamill, ben kingsley, bill paxton. and they did a great job breathing the little available life into their characters. (well, paxton's character was pretty stupid, and the whole movie was centered on him. i'm not sure a heroic stooge is a good choice for the main character who carries the film.) again, a major flaw with the script.<br /><br />thank goodness i watched this from a mail order dvd service, and not the theater. overall a major disappointment for sci-fi fans, or fans of paxton, or hamill. 90 minutes of your life, you'll never get back.
