seeing that this got a theatrical release nowhere around the globe, it only serves as a reminder of were the careers of those talent-free ladies denise richards and milla jovovich went. it also is a particular grating kind of movie, the kind that think they are smart, funny and original while being poor in every aspect. full blame can go to brian burns, who wrote and directed this potboiler. his script takes a quite unoriginal situation and goes exactly nowhere with it. the situations develop completely without any inner logic, besides that of a desperate scriptwriter. characters are thinner than cardboard cutouts, behave stupid and without any real motivation. nowhere is this more obvious than in the inclusion of mrs. richards. we don't believe her relationship with david krumholtz's character for one minute and the way she is brought back into play after the one-hour mark is particularly pitiful. why would anyone fall for a egocentric, self-obsessed, arrogant b**ch like this in the first place, much less a second time? especially after having supposedly found his..erm...true love? and if any of these things aren't enough to completely sink this movie, than the central couple is. the coupling of krumholtz and jovovich is only slightly more believable or developed than the richards-one, but it is to no avail. there is no chemistry, no spark, nothing that we might loosely accept as a credible couple. worse, these two central characters are particularly annoying and irritating, doing annoying and irritating things the viewer finally has no interest in, whatsoever.<br /><br />overall, a very poor showing. even die-hard rom-com fans might want to pass on this one, as there are dozens of movie made with more skill or more charm.
