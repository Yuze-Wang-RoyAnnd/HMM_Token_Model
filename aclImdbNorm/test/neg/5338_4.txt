oh gosh,i'm really fed up with all these generic japanese horror films about long-haired female ghosts and ghostly kids."ghost train" is no exception.it is clearly influenced by "ringu","ju-on","shutter" and "pulse".two years ago i was into such modern ghost stories,because they usually managed to give me some goosebumps,unfortunately there is nothing fresh or interesting in "ghost train".in fact the film is really boring.noriko goes missing in a subway tunnel-like an elementary-school classmate-nana must investigate a mystery of multiple disappearances,with the help of a youthful train conductor and another "disappeared" child's mother.the film offers some mildly creepy moments,however the cgi effects are laughable and the climax is illogical.skip it.
