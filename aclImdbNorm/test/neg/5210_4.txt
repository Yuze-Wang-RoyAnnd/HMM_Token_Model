director nico mastorakis has made a cynical cash-grabber (by his own admission) that is too cynical to impress anybody but a sophomore genre fan.<br /><br />the most extreme, confronting genre pics, to paraphrase a character in videodrome, "have a philosophy"; that is what makes them dangerous.<br /><br />island of death's philosophy is to throw many "shocking" elements into a cinematic mix and stir slowly. the result is a dish with no taste but an ugly appearance.<br /><br />not to be confused with serrador's brilliant who could kill a child? (sometimes called island of death), mastorakis's effort is set on a greek island which is a stage for various forms of slaughter, a little bestiality and some wholesale perversion.<br /><br />everything moves at a snailish pace and the violent set pieces are poorly directed.<br /><br />touted as "the movie that the censors didn't want you to see", i'd hazard a guess that the censors never saw it, they simply read the presskit until their knees jerked upwards.
