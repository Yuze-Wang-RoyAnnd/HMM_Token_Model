i started off being interested somewhat in the movie. it appeared it might be serious drama, dealing with death, grief, and healing, with some realistic human conflict thrown in. alas, it didn't hold up.<br /><br />i need a movie with somewhat consistent and believable characters. too many characters in this movie were portrayed as extremely gullible and inconsistent. look, i know this was not supposed to be shakespeare, but come on, i need some quality in script and characterization.<br /><br />the acting was alright, the writing not so much. at one point, james brolin's character is berated for showing up at a picnic under-dressed. he states that ordering him around will not work. his new wife says that if he goes home and changes she will rip his clothes off later. that is a howler. this movie had a few unintentionally funny lines.<br /><br />it was hard to care about jame's brolin's character. when he so readily gave his first wife's things to his new wife, even allowing his daughter to be snubbed, i lost most of my sympathy. who really cares what happens to him. i must confess that i did not finish the movie. if it did a 180 in quality in the last 45 minutes, let me know. it was just unpleasant to watch and so predictable i felt there was no need to finish it.
