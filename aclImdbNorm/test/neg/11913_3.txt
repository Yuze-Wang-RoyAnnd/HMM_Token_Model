admittedly, i am not a fan of the monogram chan films. . the plot, involving radium theft from a bank vault, is a bit far fetched and a long way from the atmospheric mysteries that fox produced. mantan moreland and benson fong (as no. 3 son tommy) provide some laughs as usual. but otherwise there isn't much here. great title that is wasted.
