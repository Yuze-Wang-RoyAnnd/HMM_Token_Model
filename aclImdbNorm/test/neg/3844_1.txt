obviously, the comments above that fawn over the movie were made by someone who's on the crew. i don't recall ever seeing a movie that's more insulting to the talented actors or the audience watching. in my 30 years of watching movies, this is the only one i have ever walked out of. bad humor, bad jokes, bad gags, bad editing, bad plot, etc. <br /><br />note to producer: it's never funny to hunt humans based on race. great that you tried to be politically correct by incorporating all races, but you're still hunting humans based on race, and that's sickening.
