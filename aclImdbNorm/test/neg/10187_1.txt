this is the worst movie i have seen to date. 85 minutes of utterly bad acting,(half the cast seem to be suffering from asperger's syndrome) ghastly wigs, strange make-up (including tide lines around wig areas) and holier than thou characters with holier than thou dialogue that makes you want to puke. one comical aspect of this film, if you have the patience to watch it, is the sheer overwhelming number of costume changes the unfortunate cast appear in from scene to scene - was this film backed by a catalogue manufacturer of desperately dodgy pastel casual wear? were the cast paid in clothes for their efforts? they certainly did not deserve paying with anything else! this appalling effort of a film delivers a rambling plot in the first half, blending into an equally confused arch christian biblefest in the latter. the entire cast and production team should be burnt at the stake, or at the very least crucified!
