this film would like to be the kind of shocking, cerebral, and intense movie that many others in its genre have successfully been, but it's not. it is at best confusing and absurd. when the twists and turns finally revealed themselves, rather than saying "ahh, i get it!" i muttered something along the lines of "okay...whatever." in my opinion, when a movie reveals a major plot twist it shouldn't have to employ a flashback sequence to prove that it did give some hints that would enable the viewer to discern the truth himself. but this movie does have a flashback; and here's the kicker: it flashes back on scenes that weren't even in the movie!<br /><br />the characters were stereotypical, unsympathetic, and wholly ridiculous. i feel that the "steamy" love scenes between the romantic leads were the most untitillating and unsexy that i've ever scene in a movie that wasn't porn. it seems that the director was going for shocking and kinky with the love scenes, but they were really just plain silly.<br /><br />and don't even get me started on the crappy accents and second-rate sets. i guess the movie was set in new orleans, but aside from the afore mentioned accents and a couple bland city shots the movie could have been in anytown, usa.<br /><br />my recommendation: don't bother!
