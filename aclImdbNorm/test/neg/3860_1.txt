only watched this to see joe morton in an early role and honestly wished i hadn't bothered, he can and has since, done much better than this crap. cannot understand why anyone finds this kind of stupidity funny but each to his own; it is an absolute mess and not funny in the least. no wait, one line only was funny, where mr kent (joe) and his family are having dinner with this nut job as he's been invited for dinner (lord alone knows why). pest to mr kent: you know what it's like dog, you've been there mrs kent: not lately, joe's expression was funny but that's it one line does not make a great comedy and this tat is so far away from being funny it should be consigned to the nearest trash cart, it's only good enough for that. joe morton - glad to see you don't appear in rubbish like this anymore; you are far superior and a great great actor.
