why would anyone make a film like this? why would anybody invest in a film like this? why would anybody in the film business work on a film like this? why would any theatre show a film like this? why would any tv channel program a film like this? why would any critic bother to review a film like this? why would anybody watch a film like this? why would mental examinations not be made of the writers/producers/directors of a film like this? sometimes there are movies that are so bad they're good. this is a movie that is so ghastly that it's horrible. imdb really must institute a "0" or even a minus scale to embrace works of this appallingly pretentious awfulness.
