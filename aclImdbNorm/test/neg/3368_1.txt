please, if you're thinking about renting this movie, don't. if you're thinking of watching a couple of downloaded clips, don't. if i had my way, nobody would even have to read this summary.<br /><br />the acting, despite being one fo the high points of the movie was still pathetic. the director was probaly a sadist. the witty one liners were something you'd expect from a room of highly paid anti-social 7 year olds that eat paint-chips for breakfast.<br /><br />the problem with this movie, is that it tries to be a movie like "evil dead 2"(do not under any circumstances associate these 2 movies) in that it's so bad it's funny. but it also tries to be funny at the same time, and fails so overwhelmingly to do so, that your sense of humor is left too crippled to do anything but set off your gag reflex in an attmept to save itself.<br /><br />i could go on for much much more, detailing just how awful it really was, but i think it would strip me of my will to live just to continue to think about it. if you need me, i'll be off trying to boil myself so that i might feel clean again...
