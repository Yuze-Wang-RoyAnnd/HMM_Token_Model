i saw roger moore huffing it on the scenes that required running or exercise. he was a james bond who would be most comfortable sitting at a bar telling stories with his fellow british knights. nothing against the elderly in age-appropriate roles, but how realistic is it for a frail-looking 58 year old man to be fighting on the wings of planes, hanging off the side of a train, swimming in a swamp with crocodiles, etc.? aside from the fact that octopussy was incredibly silly, vapid, and moronic, the fact that a frail oldster engaged in many death-defying stunts just made it so much easier to laugh at james bond. by 1983 roger moore was clearly looking his age, and he was long past the time when he looked like he could fight with younger men. i saw this movie in the theater, and the howls of laughter were many and very often. any credibility that james bond had built up was gone after octopussy.<br /><br />the only thing missing from octopussy was benny hill and his supporting cast. another low point was that the incredibly lame louis jordan was one half of the axis of evil. jordan helped to make the whole concept even more laughable. and the russian general was a total goof. octopussy works better as a comedy spoof similar to spies like us.<br /><br />even the fight scene on the train was just a bad copy of the same train scenes done in many other films by better actors. take emperor of the north (1972) where lee marvin & ernest borgnine fought all over the top & bottom of the train and made it look exciting and real.<br /><br />roger moore had a thin, frail body in 1983 and yet his stunt double was clearly a younger, taller, athletic & muscular man. even the hair color did not match. this only made his fight scenes more comedic. the moore stunts looked like those old low-budget chop-socky kung-fu movies, especially with the bad editing. the director seemed to try to make the bad acting and bad stunts better by providing several views of the same stunt. this only accentuated the differences between moore and his stunt double. the fact that the train scenes with moore were shot inside a studio could be noticed from the lighting when moore was in the shot versus the exterior shots of the stunt double on a real train. though many of the bond movies have to be the worst ever when it comes to editing their stunt-fights. you can usually clearly see that the bond actor is not actually fighting. overall octopussy has to rank as one of the worst movies ever made, and easily the worst of the worst bond movies.
