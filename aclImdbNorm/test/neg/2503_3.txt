wow. i felt like i needed to shower off after watching this one, but maybe there were other reasons that i will leave to your imagination. i felt used and abused after wacking, i mean watching this film. hairy chests, thick mustaches, and well, hairy everything describes this porn/horror movie, but hey, it was 1981, you can't call it "porn" in the 70s and 80s without the hair.<br /><br />as a horror flick, this bites. but as a piece of exploitation/porn from italy's rich cinematic history- it definitely has a place in my library. the copy i have is in italian with english subtitles. i wish it had the really poorly dubbed english, i think it would have added to the sleaziness factor that already existed. the only white guy who gets laid in the movie is "mark shannon"- he is the moustache wearing, hairy chested piece of machismo who really does try and give a performance every time he "steps up to bat". this was at the end of an era where porn producers were actually trying to make something artistic. nothing like panning the camera from a tropical backdrop to a hairy man having "doggie-style" sex with a woman. i can't help but laugh.<br /><br />this is one of those movies that i pray my future wife and kids never find.
