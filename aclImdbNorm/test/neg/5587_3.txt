i'm sorry, elo fans, but i was disappointed with this concert at the cbs television city in los angeles. it's decent music-wise, but the presentation is simply boring - big-time. most of the songs sound the same and lead singer-writer jeff lynne is about as animated as a store mannequin. he has a pleasant voice, but he isn't much to watch. he just stands in one spot and sings for an hour and 40 minutes. the songs all sound like 1970s-1980s bubblegum stuff: pleasant but not exciting.<br /><br />lynn is accompanied by a very pretty woman, rosie vela, but she isn't too animated, either. the only song - out of 23 - that creates any excitement is the last one: "roll over beethoven." now if only some of the other 22 songs had that excitement to them, this could have been a much better concert dvd.
