the quick and the undead is, finally, the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void. it is, essentially, one gigantic plot hole.<br /><br />aside from that, the acting was quite bad, character motivations nonexistent or unbelievable and there wasn't a single character worth hanging our hat on. the most interesting cast member (who had great potential to be a dark horse protagonist) got snuffed halfway through the proceedings.<br /><br />what the quick and the undead does serve as is an excellent example of how to do good color-timing. it looked excellent, when you take into account budget considerations.<br /><br />unfortunately, it plays out like a guy got his hands on a hundred grand and watched a few westerns (most notably the good, the bad and the ugly) and then just threw a bunch of elements haphazardly into a movie... "you know, they have movies where characters do this! does it fit here? no, but who cares! they do it in other movies so i should do it here!" <br /><br />maybe a good view for burgeoning cinematographers and colorists (first-year film-schoolers). otherwise, a must-miss.
