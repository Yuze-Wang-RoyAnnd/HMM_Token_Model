so i was sick with the flu one saturday and the silver lining was that scifi channel was having a marathon of dinosaur movies that day - the "carnosaur" trilogy, "pterodactyl," "raptor island." then i flicked ahead on my cable remote to see which movie scifi placed in its glamorous, saturday prime-time slot. some movie i had never heard of before called "raptor." i was pretty excited. the movie begins with some teens driving around in a jeep, when they get stalked and killed by a velociraptor. i was like, "hmmm, that's odd, that looks almost exactly like a scene in "carnosaur," except it was in the middle of that movie." then i sat through some really bad acting and then some guy was suckered into walking into an underground research laboratory where he got eaten by a ferocious t-rex. now i'm like, "wait a second, that was also a scene in "carnosaur." then, after i saw some scenes blatantly ripped off from "carnosaur 2", i figured out just what the hell was going on. so basically, roger corman & co. ripped off scenes from the "carnosaur" trilogy to use as the action scenes, weaved in a basic "dinosaur-runs-amok" plot, and tried to pass it off as an original movie. shameful. i don't know who i'm more angry at, roger corman or scifi channel for trying to pass this off as worthy of the prime-time slot. the only reason why this was worth watching to its conclusion was to pick out the actors/actresses who looked like their counterparts in the "carnosaur" trilogy and guess which scenes would be lifted next. as much as it pains me, being a dinosaur lover, i have no choice but to give this the lowest possible rating because i feel completely ripped off.
