game.... huh... game. i'm not even sure the bloody hosts of that particular reality-game know what the term 'game' means, let alone the bloody players in the game! <br /><br />an aspiring pua would look at that and think... hmmmmm... what the flying fork was that useless excuse for a demonstration of seducing women? i've seen my neighbours dog seduce women with more panache than that! and it is one ugly bloody dog! and its main approach tactic is to frenetically hump legs! <br /><br />i challenge the frustrated chump hosts of that show to a show-down; a demonstration of their so-called pickup ability... can they deliver? if one is to view that piece of un-reality-drivel, then you would realise, no, these grandstanding, mentally-masturbating, suck-me-darling-boyfriend, wanna be hosts of queer eye or something similar (not that there's anything wrong with that...), are unable to un-shrinkwrap their penises long enough to provide a demo of a real pickup. <br /><br />as you lovely north-americans say: "...'nuff said!..." <br /><br />a message from down under... with love....
