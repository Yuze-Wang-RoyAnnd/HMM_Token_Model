i am not even willing to vote a single star for this crap but imdb does't have zero as rating option... worst movie i have ever watched.. story of the movie 1. predator ship crashes on earth 2. one alien and some face huggers are released and they start killing humans. 3. one predator arrives on earth and he starts killing aliens and humans. 4. then one human jet drops a bomb and kills human, aliens and predator. 5. some humans find the shoulder canon of the predator. 6. the end directors should consider refunding money back to the viewers. if still you want to watch this movie, download from some torrent site and say thanks to me for saving you money.. all the movie has been filmed in some dark corner of the earth, you see just dark shadows even in action scenes.. too much violence.. i didn't expect it from a fox movie
