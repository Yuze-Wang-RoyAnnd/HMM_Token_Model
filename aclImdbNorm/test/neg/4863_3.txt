would you be surprised if i told you this movie deals with a conspiracy? no? how about if i told you the ringleader was a shadow puppet. what? you don't believe me? ... ok. yes, i made that up. it's too bad, this movie could have used a sense of humor. i understand charlie sheen doing this at the time - another movie equaled more money - as for donald sutherland and linda hamilton ... why? don't even get me started on stephen lang. he was so much fun as the party crasher in 'the hard way' and now this junk.<br /><br />ah no matter. everyone involved should feel ashamed. if you aim to make a bad movie and succeed - it's twisted - but i seriously doubt that was what they were aiming for here. flat out, the story stinks and we're actually supposed to take this yak seriously. makes you wonder if this movie even had a glimmer of hope. seriously, i doubt it and in an industry so tight with the purse strings how this got green lit in the first place is beyond me. maybe even more scary is how this dog pile made it's way to theaters!?<br /><br />oh ... sam waterson, how great you are in law & order. why are you here? demoting yourself to the role of the president of the united states who might i add gets to be shot at by a remote control biplane controlled by the gonzo assassin. then again this is a masterpiece of work from george p. cosmatos who's "directing" credits include rambo: first blood part ii amongst other gems. hmm.... case in point?
