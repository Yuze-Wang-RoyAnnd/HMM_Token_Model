oh man! this series has to be the worst possible anime i've ever seen in a while.<br /><br />it started out new, exciting and fresh. and i really liked it then. kagome was a good female role model for the show. and inu-yasha was funny and hot-headed.<br /><br />then, it just kept falling more and more downhill as the series progressed... and i'll tell y'all the reasons why. (warning: spoiler alert!!)<br /><br />okay, they basically destroy inu-yasha's relationship with kagome early on, by reviving his 50 year old dead girlfriend, who's drippy, sappy, and a total waste of time.<br /><br />they introduce a pervert named miroku, who's supposed to be a sort of religious figure for the show. (which really bugged me,'cause it was out of place and stupid.) then, they introduce a demon slayer named sango, whose only purpose in life is to try (and fail) to save her brainwashed brother.<br /><br />the big bad of the show, naraku, while starting out as a really good bad guy, lost his touch after a while. (he got pretty old pretty fast. and it bothered me that he was the only baddie in the show who did anything.)<br /><br />the characters all became wooden, and unemotional. and then, the ending of this terrible series was a disappointment to any anime fan out there. nothing happened. naraku never got killed or defeated. kagome and inu-yasha never fully fell in love ('cause he was still all in love with his 50 year old dead chick.) plot holes were left open. the animation got worse and worse as the series progressed. and nothing changed in the plot. (i mean,they dragged it out to over 150 episodes, and nothing changed in the plot... at all.) and they expected me (as well as other fans of the show) to be satisfied?? i was disenchanted, disgusted, and annoyed as crap. i at least had high hopes that there'd be a good ending to the series. instead, all i got was a dragged out commercial for the manga.<br /><br />seriously, if you wanna see a good anime about swords and stuff like that, i strongly recommend "rurouni kenshin". that show progresses and goes somewhere, plus it has really good animation too.<br /><br />but stay far away from this bland excuse for anime, as best as you can.
