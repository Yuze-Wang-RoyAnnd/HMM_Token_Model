i just caught "farewell to the king" on cable, and maybe it's just because i'm a girl, but i thought this was on the craptastic side. the script and direction are pretentious (once i found out john milius was responsible, it all became clear). the supporting actors actually weren't bad - james fox was outstanding. the biggest disappointment was nick nolte, who i usually enjoy. once he goes native, he starts speaking a very stiff, stilted english, and half the time, he seems kind of distracted, as if he'd just smoked some of the bounty of borneo's rain forest. and then the end -- what the ??? learoyd just happens to be on the same boat as the botanist (by the way, had the botanist dumped the girlfriend, or what?)??? the boat just happens to run aground conveniently close to an island ripe takeover by a crazy anglo ex-headhunting army deserter??
