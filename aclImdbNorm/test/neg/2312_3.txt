as one who loves films that appeal to intellectual sorties as well as those that simply tell stories, this film should have been appealing. but as written and directed by catherine breillat who seems to be playing out her own conundrums in film-making experiences, this tedious and talky film fails to arouse interest.<br /><br />the main character jeanne (anne parillaud) is the screen form of breillat, a director frustrated in her attempts to film a convincing sex scene with two difficult actors (gr'egoire colin is the actor and roxane mesquida is the actress). the one 'comic' bit is jeanne's imposing the use of a dildo strapped onto the actor in order for her to drive the sex scene to fruition, but even this sight gag wears thin quickly and we are left with a film within a film that feels more like a 'deleted scenes' featurette on a dvd than a solid french comedy with class. grady harp, august 05
