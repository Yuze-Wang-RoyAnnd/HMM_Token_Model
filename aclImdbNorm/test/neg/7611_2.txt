i haven't reviewed on imdb before but this documentary is so overrated that i felt compelled to vent. i wouldn't have even finished watching if i hadn't been a guest at someone's house. the film was poor on many levels: first - treadwell's video footage was contrived. the more i watched, the more he seemed to be acting as a person desperate to be famous instead of one acting out of conviction.<br /><br />second - the others in the film, with the exception of treadwell's parents and the airline pilot, were just as contrived and corny as he was. god, they seemed artificial.<br /><br />third - treadwell's mission to protect the bears doesn't even make sense as he did more harm than good by making the bears grow accustomed to human presence. i believe that treadwell really did love the bears but there is much research which indicates his efforts were misguided. sometimes we have to sacrifice our enjoyment of wildlife to really help.<br /><br />fourth - the film's entertainment value wasn't half that of other wildlife films such as "march of the penguins" and "winged migration". the filmmakers, in my opinion, did a poor job of sequencing scenes and gave little incentive to keep watching.<br /><br />as a person who loves alaska, bears, and other wildlife, i would love to see more people dedicated to the preservation of our wildlands. hopefully their efforts will be less people-centered.
