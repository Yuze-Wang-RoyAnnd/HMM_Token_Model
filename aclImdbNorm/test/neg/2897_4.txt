i never saw the other two "ninja" movies and for all i know there are known, but for some reason i watched this one. this one starts out rather fast as this one ninja goes on a super killing spree. he is almost unstoppable as it takes quite a number of bullets to take him down. he is not out for the count though as he ends up possessing a woman and he then continues his killing ways by using her as his tool. another ninja enters the fray and apparently the only way you kill a ninja is with another ninja so he volunteers. this leads up to a big battle at the end as the dead ninja goes back into his body and they have it out in an all out war. sounds better than it actually turned out being, but at least it was not boring.
