i always hated this retarded show .i liked the shows of cartoon network like "dexter's laboratory " or "megas xlr .but i never liked this piece of turd . basically because it have stupid characters (the good or the villains all seems to be mentally retarded ) they have stupid voices (specially bubbles .she is supposed to be the "cute " character of the show ,but she is incredibly annoying ) the story lines are very ,very stupid . some episodes could have been interesting but almost always the show turns childish and corny . there wasn't any likable character ,the music was horrible ,and the animation is the worst that i've seen . evena five year old boy could draw better ! i don't see why all the world seems to love this piece of garbage . "the powerpuff girls " seems to be one of the worst cartoons ever made . fortunately "foster home for the imaginary friends " from the same creator was far away better .
