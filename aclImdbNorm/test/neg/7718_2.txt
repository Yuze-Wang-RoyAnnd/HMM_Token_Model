terrible, boring zombie sequel is only marginally better than uwe's horrible first film. it consists of a group of soldiers going into a zombie plagued college campus to find a certain type of blood which could assist in finding a cure for the infection. these soldiers are your typical lambs to the slaughter and none of them are that drawn out(or at least aren't very interesting)so you don't feel a sadness at the pit of your stomach when they are disposed of. the film has the typical zombies biting humans and blood splatter. it even has the same munching on guts. it just doesn't do anything for the zombie genre to give it memory. and, the story's climax is rather anti-climactic and ridiculous. one wonders how two people can submerged in an army of zombies and not get bit(for they are the main stars who seem to always manage escapability)while others seem to get bit rather easily. the film sole motivation is to show people getting bit..nothing else. just go watch a romero film for lasting effect.
