well, dude where's my car might be at least a novelty as one of few hollywood films that seems to have been written, cast, filmed & edited in less than a day. i honestly can't believe this got made (or that i allowed my friends to make me sit through the entire thing). the jokes are too stupid and predictable to be "dumb-funny", and the actors involved don't seem like they would be capable of pulling off any kind of funny had the script actually provided it. oddly enough, unlike most mindless slapstick comedies, this movie actually has too much plot - every scene seems to introduce a new moronic and uninteresting subplot. of course, they were obviously going for moronic, but it doesn't work on any level whatsoever...there is only one aspect of this film i enjoyed: donkeylips from the old nickalodean show "salute your shorts" has a very small role. this is the role that will turn him into the next richard gere though, you just watch...
