i remember seeing the very first trailer for underdog back last march, i also remember at the time smiling to myself ever so slightly. sure it was a cheesy idea, but i genuinely thought at the time the concept might work, hell it couldn't be any worse than the disappointing cats and dogs could it? then by december and i suddenly remembered the film i realised how likely the film was to suck, the fact it had been delayed in the uk made it seem inevitable it would be terrible, but the horrendous reviews just made me realise it was nigh on impossible for the movie to be any good. still i swallowed my feelings and went to see the film with a friend today, as i entered my screen i was mortified, it was the very first time i'd be seeing a movie with a friend and being the only two in the screen! little did i know for what i was about to endure. underdog to put it blunt is horrendous, it really is. imagine how bad you could think this movie is and then prepare yourself for a movie even worse, that is just how pathetic the movie is. while it aims to entertain kids it just seems an embarrassing mess that seems to insult kids rather than allow them to enjoy the movie. matters cannot be helped by the fact that the story is beyond lacklustre, the acting is generally poor, and the movie just feels like an over-long, tired and downright boring saturday cartoon! after a brief five minutes where i thought the movie might be passable the movie just suddenly seems to die and then limp on towards the already sign posted finale. i'm just amazed the movie was actually ever released, it's an embarrassment to disney, hell half their straight to video sequels are better than this! what's even more terrifying is the fact the ending leaves room for a sequel!<br /><br />so lets get onto the acting (cracks knuckles). okay let me be honest jason lee is decent, his voice suits the canine, and had he have been given a decent script he might have made the performance work. however, with such a dodgy script he just seems to flounder. in many ways it reminded me of bill murray in garfield, murray did what he could with what he had, but what he had wasn't enough to make it passable. then we get onto the human actors, and well the majority of atrocious. alex neuberger plays the friend of underdog, jack. my biggest concern is that anybody would even take him seriously in an audition. the scene where he gets to fly with underdog is perhaps the most cringe worthy scene in the past few years just because his acting is so poor. not once did i believe he was a real person, in fact part of me is still convinced he was a robot made specially for the movie! james belushi seems half dead in the film, he has nothing to work with, no decent lines, he just seems to wander around the set waiting to become relevant to the plot, which the writers try to do towards the end but do it in such a poor way its laughable. thankfully peter dinklage is the one redeeming factor of the movie, he is great as dr barsinister and seems to be having a laugh in the role. he steals every scene he is in, although that's hardly difficult when he shares screen time with the extremely annoying patrick warburton. the rest of the cast are even worse, especially taylor momsen, she just needs to end her acting career right now!<br /><br />underdog also fails dramatically in terms of delivering anything like a funny scene. when the funniest scene involves underdog biting a can and causing dog food to explode everywhere you know there is something drastically wrong. this could be easily ignored if the movie had decent action or a good story, alas the movie is even worse in both of these terms. the effects are so ropey that any scene where underdog flies just seems absurd, and the dog uses his powers to such little effect that you frequently forget he has superpowers. what's the point in making a film about a super dog if the damned dog never appears super? the final fight also verges on embarrassing purely because its ten minutes of nothingness, the dog flies, other stuff happens, some stuff gets chucked about, all of this is irrelevant as this stuff is happening for the sake of stuff happening. the script as well is dodgy at best and downright pain inducingly awful at worst. when someone says "look its a plane, no its a bird, no its a frog...", yes you read that right, i just wanted to burst into tears there and then. actually i wanted to walk out by remained compelled to see whether it could get any lower than that point, this happens near the end so it doesn't thankfully.<br /><br />overall underdog becomes the worst movie of 2008 at this early period, and is actually just as bad as last years epic movie. luckily for underdog, meet the spartans arrives over here soon and i expect that to be even worse. so in case you didn't get the point of my review, avoid the film at all costs, if you want to see a movie with a dog then watch cats and dogs, buy a real dog if necessary, just do not see this!
