**warning** miserable movie **warning** the day before christmas eve, some nut case decided he'd entertain us by sending this movie as "entertainement" on tv. what in gods name was he thinking?<br /><br />this movie is filled with awful humor, despicable acting, lousy jokes and a disaster of a plot line. randy quaid plays the idiotic role as cousin eddie johnson. eddie is a brain dead person, who's incapable of even the simplest tasks. he was fired because he was dumb as a brick, but the company he worked for was sorry for it so they sent him and his family on a vacation. but being as stupid as he is, he managed to make the vacation into a disaster.<br /><br />all-in-all it's the worst movie i've seen, and i have nightmares still over the miserable acting and the even more miserable jokes in this movie. it's so sad you almost have to see it... but don't. the nightmares i have are far worse than any other nightmares you will ever have. trust me... i hate this movie so bad because of it's acting, the humor, the "jokes" and the story. the only good thing was the nice scenery. <br /><br />well it's my opinion, and i surely hope everyone agrees with me...
