i should explain that as far as this trend goes for ripping off asian horror movies, this shutter is a head above the grudge, and dark water, while still not achieving the same amount of atmospheric creepiness that the ring establishes.<br /><br />still though movies, like life, don't exist in a vacuum and are therefore up for comparison to other suspense/thriller/horror movies. honestly, i'm not writing a lengthy synopsis here and will say that this movie attempts to rely on music induced "startle" scares rather than atmosphere and the "ghost" itself really isn't that remarkable. the plot is pretty basic and predictable and isn't anything to write home about either. while there are a few suspenseful scenes that border on creatively scary, most of the movie is pretty vanilla. if you enjoyed the grudge and it's ilk then you might enjoy this.<br /><br />grade: c-
