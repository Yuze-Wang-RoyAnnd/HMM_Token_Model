my main criticism with the movie is the animation. i totally agree with everyone else it was very poor. some of the characters seemed to have darker skin tones than they did in the first film, which is much better. also the background colours looked rushed and somewhat static. it is also a shame that michael j.fox didn't voice milo, he did such a good job, and james arnold taylor wasn't sure whether he was supposed to sound like milo or aladdin. i have also taken into consideration the lack of a good storyline. the third story was confusing and clumsily told, and the second story suffered from poor scripting. to make things worse, the first one i can't even remember, other than a fishing village being haunted or something like that. however, there was some nice music, and good voice talents from john mahoney, cree summer, clancy brown and tom wilson, that saved the film from total disaster. all in all, a disappointing sequel to a surprisingly good film. 4/10 bethany cox.
