a young doctor and his wife are suddenly expecting a child. both are disturbed about a two hour memory lapse on the night of conception. interesting twist on an hackneyed story. very good f/x and interesting editing. jillian mcwhirter is outstanding in a cast that features arnold vosloo, wilford brimley and brad dourif. brimley brings normalcy to the outlandish. kudos to director brian yuzna.
