komodo vs. cobra is not going to set the world on fire. it's not a hallmark of cinema history. what it is is a group of underfunded filmmakers trying to make another movie, make another paycheck, and continue to support themselves and their families. as such i give these efforts a lot of slack. i mean, come on, it has to be hard to be a russian special effects technician. not a lot of big budget films getting made there. but-- they are a dedicated bunch and more than willing to throw their all into whatever lame american monster flick needs affordable sfx. and i get a kick out of looking for the same locations appear time and again in these flicks. if for some reason you find yourself watching this again, look at the sequence where pare and company are walking through a "jungle." look at their feet and you'll see paved walkways. and if you happen to still have a copy of "ai assault" (shown a week or two earlier also on scifi), you'll see the folks in there tramping through the same ersatz jungle. come to think of it, i think the helicopters land in the same clearing in both flicks. i can admire the thriftiness of these films. every dollar really does show up on the screen! too bad there just aren't enough dollars......
