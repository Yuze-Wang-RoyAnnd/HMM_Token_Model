cheerleader massacre was supposed to be the fourth installment of the slumber party massacre series; if that's what they were doing (which it is considering one actress from the original returns in a small cameo role), they have failed miserably and made, by far, the worst installment of the 'quadrilogy'. cheerleader massacre seamlessly combines bad acting, a horrible plot, a dumb killer, dull and boring deaths, boring scenery, and hideous camera work to make it one of the worst films ever made. did i already mention how bad it was? don't get me wrong: this cheesy and retarded excuse for a horror film is nowhere near as bad as napoleon dynamite, but it is undeniably a horrible movie.<br /><br />cheerleader massacre is an exact polar opposite of the original slumber party massacre. stay away by all means! this movie is utter garbage!
