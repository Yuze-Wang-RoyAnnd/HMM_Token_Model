this could have been a breakout role for valeria golino but the film instead decided to shift its attention to another area. the film is about a woman named grazia (golino) who is married to a fisherman and the mother of three. she is a free spirit and prone to outbursts so the rest of the village and her family decide she should be sent to milan and see a doctor. the story takes place on the island of lampedusa off of sicily and it shows the everyday life there with the teenage boys in rivaling gangs and just trying to find something to do on the sun baked rock. grazia's oldest son pasquale (francesco casisa) adores her and is always trying to protect her during her bouts of depression. the daughter marinella (veronica d'agostino) is a blossoming young girl who becomes infatuated with a local policeman and the youngest son filippo (filippo pucillo) is very sassy and mocks the policeman's accent. upon learning that she is to be sent to milan, grazia runs away and pasquale helps her by hiding her in a cave while everyone searches for her. this film could have really made more of an impact if it could have concentrated its focus to grazia. we do see some outbursts and irrational behavior on her part but their is no follow up to these scenes. nothing comes of it. the film looks great and is beautifully photographed so give director emanuele crialese credit for that but the story needed to focus on something more substantial. the film does a good job of showing us what life is like on this island and what is going on in the lives of the three children as they grow up. their is some speculation that golino's character gives a hint of being a mermaid like creature and that is why she is having difficulty existing on land. i also sense that the island itself expects its inhabitants to behave in a certain manner and if you don't then you can be subjected to the harsh realities of its rules. all speculations but i do think the films attention could have stayed with the character of grazia. after she hides in the cave she really has nothing to do. in a sense, the character becomes stagnant. i wish golino had more to do because i've always liked her and whenever she is onscreen you just can't take your eyes off her. she's a bundle of fury, passion and raw energy! what a shame crialese didn't write a more complete role for her to act in. when the film ends your left feeling empty from an incomplete story.
