it's valentines day and we decided to stay in, have a nice dinner, and watch this movie on tcm instead of going out. we're in our 40's - 50's, love romance, and are both "softies" but this movie just bombed for us (it's hard to imagine that it was nominated for oscars, etc. but i guess that was then). the cinematography was beautiful but for the most part the movie as a whole is terribly dated. jennifer jones' character made so many references to her being eurasion that we started counting and after a while we were giggling every time she said it. add to that the "theme song" played incessantly throughout the film and we couldn't wait for it to be over so we could watch the evening news.
