cybrog 2:glass shadow stars elias koteas as colton hicks (rhymes with kicks!) a karate instructor who helps a cash (jolie) escape from pinwheel, her creators who look to detonate her and destroy a rival company. along the way billy drago and karen shepherd show up to displace the duo, while jack palance is there to deliver guidance to the duo on the run. one of the things that is quite shocking about the cyborg franchise, is how the series has managed to have quite prolific and off beat actors in the cast. the original had jean-claude van damme and dayle haddon (don't know her? well she was in a bunch of 70's pornos) this one has jack palance, elias koteas,billy drago and angelina jolie. the third one has william katt, zach galligan and malcom mcdowell. (okay so, cyborg 3's cast isn't that impressive.) i've never seen cyborg 3, but i did see this on sci-fi channel and must admit i wasn't impressed. actually strike that, cyborg 2 is an often lovely looking movie, it's shot with excellent style and the visual detail make this easy on the eye. however cyborg 1 was the same way, indeed the movie was directed with a certain amount of style, slow motion and music that made it all easy on the eye. unfortunately like the first, this one doesn't have any new ideas or anything resembling a plot or texture. most of the ideas are taken from blade runner and max headroom, so for various reasons the movie doesn't have much to offer beyond it's look. another aspect is the terrible acting. karen shepherd and billy drago are absolutely terrible and angelina jolie isn't much better. elias koteas and jack palance come off fine but seriously palance is playing a cyborg warrior and koteas is a karate instructor. i guess on the positive side you can't accuse michael schroeder of not being ambitious with casting. still the movie is dull and i for one lost interest in the story fifteen minutes in. also why did they tie it in with cyborg anyway? it has nothing to do with it's predecessor, which this manages to be worse than.<br /><br />* out of 4-(bad)
