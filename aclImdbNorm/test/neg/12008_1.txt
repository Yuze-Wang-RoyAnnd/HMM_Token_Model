what an awful movie. full of cliches, perplexing scenes, very bad acting, and an atrotious script. it is hard to believe the same guys that wrote the people vs. larry flint and man on the moon wrote this garbage. man, this makes my list of top 10 worst movies of all-time. didn't this guy, this director, if you can call him that, realize that the first problem child was bad enough? let alone make a sequel for it!!?? amazing that piece of trash films like this can be shown to children let alone be released! 1 out of 10 *'s
