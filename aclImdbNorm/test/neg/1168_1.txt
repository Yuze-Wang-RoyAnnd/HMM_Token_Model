my reasoning behind viewing this film (despite the fact that it was free), was more or less out of curiosity... slight, slight curiosity... i wasn't all that familiar with this straight-to-video "biographical" account of mr. gein and discovered during the opening credits that it featured horror icon kane hodder in the starring role. my emotions turned from not just curiosity, but now a glimmer of mild anticipation as to how his portrayal of gein would turn out. also in the credits (among some grim photos of ed's crimes) was michael berryman and priscilla barns. "okay", i thought to myself... "this may be mildly amusing". as the movie started and progressed (slowly), my microscopic confidence (or as i call it, "micro-hope") for this movie faded entirely and i was stuck with an overwhelming feeling of humiliation as i died a little inside from watching this dung heap. hodder, who is widely known and respected for his past work as an unstoppable serial killer, inaccurately puts that into play here - turning eddie gein from a mild-mannered recluse, to a hulking, full-blown killing machine. he lurks by night, killing cemetery caretakers, his grave robbing buddy and teenage girls, leaving plainfield in a panic as the local sheriff's department seems to do nothing to adjust the dangerous situation in the least. the deputy and his mom have a warm little relationship that gave me a fuzzy feeling inside (or that could have just been the cyanide pill i ingested halfway through this turkey). i'm not sure what the point of this movie was and obviously the director knew nothing about the subject he was working with. there is already such an abundance of films pertaining to gein's story that, unless the "ed gein snuff footage" is discovered, i don't want to see anymore of these on the shelves. if you want a more authentic film of this nature than check out 2001's "ed gein (aka in the light of the moon)".
