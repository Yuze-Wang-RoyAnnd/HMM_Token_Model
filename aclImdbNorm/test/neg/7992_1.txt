this movie is recommended only for insomniacs: it will relieve them by putting them to sleep. five-year-olds might also enjoy it. but for anyone else (including fans of the genre), what a bore! the "ancient" plot is reminiscent of "return of the dragon", and this film is just as inept, but nero is no bruce lee, so "enter the ninja" is an even worse film. until now, this is the second (the offensive "comedy" "bachelor party" was the first) film i gave 1/10 to.
