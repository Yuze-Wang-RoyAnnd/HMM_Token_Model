i was duped into watching this by the many friendly reviews here. boy, are they way off mark! to give this 9 to 10 points and call it "one of the best movies of the 1990ies" is just unjustifiable. the big problem here is lack of pace and a paper-thin plot. it's like slapstick on prozac. everything trundles along predictably and listlessly. the plot is weak to begin with -- two garbage men peep on their foxy neighbour, witness a murder and unravel a waste disposal conspiracy -- and the movie never manages to go much further. there are some amusing situations and decent acting, but that's not anywhere near enough to save this jalopy of a movie.<br /><br />it's simply a comedy that doesn't get its fat ass off the ground, so why waste your time?
