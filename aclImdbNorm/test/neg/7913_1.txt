this movie is very scary with scenes where the devil uses gabriels horn to open heaven and pull the good angel-dogs out and imprision them on alkatraz. the devil sings and dances to a few songs about the joys of being bad, and at one point, eats a live rat.<br /><br />we got this movie free with a pizza. you get what you pay for.
