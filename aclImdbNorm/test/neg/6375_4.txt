don't get me wrong, the guy's a success dynamo, but he got to the top by selling overpriced plastic toys to impulsive brats. so i get a little peeved when he looks at comic book fans as an extension of that same market.<br /><br />see, "the invincible iron man" wouldn't be bad if it were slotted on a saturday morning and geared exclusively toward undiscerning children. but it's not directed exclusively at children. periphery characters are killed every five minutes and there's enough bloodshed and semi-nude bodies to make network censors squirm, so it isn't quite cut out for children's television.<br /><br />so what audience is this video aiming for then? it's the audience that enjoys nigh intelligible story lines about reviving a tyrannical chinese emperor with 5 arcane rings, that's who. and i think that audience is restrictively small.<br /><br />a lot of great writers have passed through marvel's leathery yoni over the decades. so it's a shame that marvel would risk their pricey animation investments on so many questionable storytellers and scribes who, like mr. arad, are better accustomed to peddling action figures during saturday morning cartoons. how many lukewarm receptions do marvel have to endure before they come up with a better strategy? <br /><br />***<br /><br />animation: just passable cels, some segments are better than others, a low budget look all throughout -- this ain't no bakshi (ralph) and it ain't no bluth (don)! cg animation's okay, but far from impressive.<br /><br />story: a litany of clich'es, all over the place, convoluted, contrived, and uninspired.<br /><br />characters: so why is rhodes even here if all he does is add to stark's sexual ambiguity? hmmm... her dad's in a wheelchair... tony misses his mom... asian chicks are hot and, apparently, little else; the female lead is thoroughly objectified by the feature's end.<br /><br />performances: can't blame competent voice actors for a bad script.<br /><br />art: very western musculature, very clean lines, faces are very derivative of eastern art, very boring mattes, very bland cg.<br /><br />conclusion: not great, but worth a watch for the fans and those who enjoy superhero myths. a 'must-buy' for collectors. a valuable "what not to do" course for junior animators.
