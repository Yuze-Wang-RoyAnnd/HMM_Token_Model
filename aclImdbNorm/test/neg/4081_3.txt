evan almighty continues the mainstream bruce almighty franchise, this time with newsman turned freshman congressman from buffalo, evan baxter (steve carell), at it's center. a wholly innocuous (and not even really self-doubting) man, god (morgan freeman) decides to enforce some sort of quest upon baxter, in order to illustrate the importance of... reciprocal kindness, so that baxter can "change the world" (aka, pay it forward).<br /><br />think of evan almighty as a wholesome derivative of 'distinguished gentlemen.' baxter is not a con, but his colleague, congressman long (john goodman) wants his unquestioned support on a bill that essentially, is harmful to the environment. and well-meaning baxter, knowing the importance of networking and visibility, is willing to support him. <br /><br />in addition, with the new job comes more responsibility, and baxter is in a sense, vilified, for not spending enough time with his family. <br /><br />so god, decides to give evan baxter some guidance by forcing him to become the modern day noah. his orders: build an ark. except, while it may be mildly humorous to see baxter's transformation to the "weirdo with a beard-o," there doesn't seem to be much point to this whole thing which becomes abundantly clearer when the climax of the film fizzles. (spoilers: if none of the population is killed by the "flood", then what was the point of summoning the animals... or at least the ones that obviously weren't from suburban virginia? or, more importantly, if all baxter had to realize was that long's projects faltered in their quality, then why did he have to build an ark?).<br /><br />so, although a comedy like this needn't be a hysterical laugh-riot, it was certainly one made far less enjoyable as it was crammed with far too many homilies (and not all from morgan freeman) and action that seemed intended for a film of more epic events.
