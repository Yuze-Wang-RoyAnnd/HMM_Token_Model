the 33 percent of the nations nitwits that still support w. bush would do well to see this movie, which shows the aftermath of the french revolution and the terror of 1794 as strikingly similar to the post 9/11 socio-political landscape. maybe then they could stop worrying about saving face and take the a**-whupping they deserve. it's really a shame that when a politician ruins the country, those who voted for him can't be denied the right to ever vote again. they've clearly shown they have no sense of character.<br /><br />what really stands out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character as hopelessly doctrinaire as robespierre; a haunted empty man who simplistic reductive ideology can't help him elucidate the boundaries between safety and totalitarianism. execution and murder. self-defense and patriotism. his legalistic litmus tests aggravate the hopeless situation he's helped create. sound like any belligerent, overprivileged, retarded yale cheerleaders you know of? <br /><br />wojciech pszoniak blows the slovenly deparidieu off the screen. as sympathetic as robespierres plight is, it's comforting to know that shortly after the film ends he'll have his jaw shot off and be sent to the guillotine.
