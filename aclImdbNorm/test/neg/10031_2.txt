all the criticisms of this movie are quite valid! it is pretty boring, and filled with all kinds of pointless ridiculous stuff. a couple exchanging nods over their "good grub." a medium shot of a desk as a phone rings until someone finally comes, sits down, and answers it at a pretty leisurely pace. quadruple-takes or more when people look at things. solitary banjo-tuning and playing, taking a break for a beer. telling a joke to a fawn, about a big-mouthed frog trying to learn what to feed its babies, complete with many big-mouthed expressions (which are needed for the weak punchline). the sharing of cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread, which to the squeamish become unpalatable when there's talk of people burned in a fire. lots of seemingly stock-footage close-up shots of animals, birds, insects, and spiders in the woods.<br /><br />the movie starts with a forest fire, then at least a couple decades later some people in those same woods get killed by an axe. the killer evidently wasn't too satisfied by the axe he stole, and kills other people with other weapons of opportunity or his bare hands.<br /><br />if it's true that the movie in the version available on the out-of-print videotape is cut, perhaps if there's a lot of footage that was cut, it deserves another look on dvd. otherwise, it's simply not very interesting, and would probably try the patience of even the most hardcore outdoors-slasher fan.
