this film had all the ingredients of a good adventure movie, but it revealed incompetence at almost every level.<br /><br />the presence of roger moore in the cast list is usually a sign that the movie is not going to be anything more than mediocre, because moore always has lead roles and he can't act. but this movie also had ian holm and lee marvin in it, and was based on a wilbur smith book, so i thought i'd give it a chance when i saw the dvd for sale in the bargain bin...<br /><br />it was a mistake. the opening scene appeared to start in the middle of a reel, with sound suddenly appearing as if the first second of the soundtrack had been truncated. the scene showed a dreadnought at sea with a german crew. this bad editing was a sign of things to come, but the scene with the dreadnought was interesting enough to keep me watching. the special effects were good, and the crew wore the proper uniforms and spoke in german, indicating that the director at least paid attention to historical detail. i was surprised. <br /><br />so i kept watching, and then moore appeared and my supicions were confirmed. bad acting, clich'ed lines, clich'ed cinematography and cheap humour...but worst of all, there is a disastrous attempt to blend the light-hearted feel of the film with serious drama and tragedy. it just does not work.<br /><br />the film ends as suddenly and as badly as it started
