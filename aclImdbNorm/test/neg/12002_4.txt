i couldn't help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because i found this movie a total drag. childish humor, cheap looking sets, cheap looking effects, a plot that makes "legally blonde" look like "the usual suspects" and so many coincidences that i can now officially say that robert rodriguez had brain surgery somewhere after 1996. the only thing he left as his trade mark are some cool camera moves, but there's where it ends. ok, so the guy decided to do something new for a change, a children's spy movie. well if i were 12, i'd feel insulted. the best thing in this movie is the absolutely amazing carla gugino that just stole every scene she was in. sadly, there weren't many. 4/10
