my take: yet another lame pg-13 horror movie with predictable scare tactics and a derivative plot.<br /><br />the spirits move. the walls creak. there's something wrong in the basement. these, along with several other horror movie clich'es haunt the walls of yet another house in the country in the sam raimi-produced the messengers, a lame pastiche of the most predictable scare tactics thrown in on a plot savagely recycled from better (and sometimes, even worse) horror movies of the past.<br /><br />when the solomon family moves into an old south dakota farmhouse, in yet another attempt by dad (dylan mcdermott) to reconnect with the family, especially with their formerly drunk-driving daughter jessica (the underrated kristen stewart), in the more subtle countryside than their home in chicago. the horror ensues when jessica begins to get little surprise visits from the house's poltergeists. thinking she's some teenage girl who cried wolf, her parents don't believe her. how could they? the real horror in the messengers is waiting for which horror movie it will savage next. will it be an angry flock of crows wanting more than the family's crops (a direct rip-off of alfred hitchcock's masterpiece the birds)? will it be the haunted house with a history dating back from the amityville horror or poltergeist? or will it be the grotesque phantoms taken from your familiar recent horrors like the ring and the grudge? heck, the movie even manages to rip-off a scene or two from some truly bad horror movies like amityville 3-d and the mediocre cold creek manor. perhaps all the pang brothers really wanted to do was a b-level horror movie, but did it have to be this bad? couldn't they rip-off from the best? avoid it.<br /><br />rating: * out of 5.
