how bad idea was to remake an almost oscar -worthy film?! mosthly martha is much more better, has deepness, finesse and so on and mainly: a wonderful and talented actress in the leading role (martina gedeck). it's a joke and ugliness with the handsome aaron and the whole atmosphere... again a ridiculous effort from hollywood. there are more and more remake and the films are full with schemes.. isn't anybody there who can create a good and newly script? or this is a safety solution to make remake or movies from the well-tried cartoon figures? the films are getting much less interesting nowadays. oh yes: if you want to see a really good movie watch the original one. it's definitely worth.
