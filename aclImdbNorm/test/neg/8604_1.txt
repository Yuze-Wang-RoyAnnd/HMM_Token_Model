i found myself watching sex lives of the potato men with a furrowed brow, puzzled why so many talented and witty comedians decided to be involved in a film so totally devoid of humour.<br /><br />poo and wanking jokes are funny when you're eleven. eighteen plus and you begin to lose friends around the water cooler.<br /><br />maybe some enjoyment could be had from this movie if you're the kind of person who frequently plays practical jokes involving dog mess, brown bags and matches, or maybe partake in 'man' competitions on nights-out by imbibing companions' vomit/urine etc when you're not back at your parent's basement punching your teenage wife.<br /><br />even then "sex lives..." it's hard to recommend. perhaps if you're really weirdly into masochistic cranial surgery and spend your evenings happy slapping the elderly or watching toilets flush, you might think a close-up of a bogie is worthy of cinematic distribution.<br /><br />i'd discuss characterisation, narrative or performances had i not zoned completely out following the lengthy tuna-paste/vagina comparison.
