this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i could hardly stay awake. the acting and the plot were horrible. i like b-movies, but this movie has nothing that could make me laugh or think about. ok, there were two or three funny moments at the beginning, so i have to give this movie 2 out of 10. if you really want to watch it, watch the first 10 minutes. after that you will get more and more disappointed while the movie runs.
