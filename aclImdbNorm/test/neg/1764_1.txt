***mild spoilers*** dear inman, kind words are hard to find for me to describe the movie i have just been subjected to that stars you. the problems are far and wide and painful for me to recount. . . yet i feel i must, if only to prevent others from suffering the same anguish as i did. this is not a film for anyone under 50, it's sloooowwwww, soooooo slowwww, and when the big reunion of ada and inman happens. . .the biggest and most important scene in the film, nothing happens, it is a epic letdown. now, like the director should have done, i will keep my words short and end with this warning, your film is disjointed, boring, has no flow and jude law is tragically mis-cast, he showed more emotion as a robot in a.i. - be warned, the film should be retitled . . . bored mountain. love, ada
