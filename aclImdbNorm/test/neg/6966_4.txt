like other movies from the worst director ever, ed wood, this movie is very bad but because of that it is also very funny. may be not for everyone, but i laughed a lot. it is a strange thing when you enjoy a bad movie. how do you rate it? as a movie very low, as entertainment at least a little higher.<br /><br />the movie tries to explain what a transvestite is and it does this through a scientist (bela lugosi) and an inspector (lyle talbot) who talks to a doctor (timothy farrell) who knows about these things. the doctor tells the detective two stories and that is what we, and apparently the scientist, see. the doctor tels these stories because a dead transvestite is found, suicide, and because of a headline in the news paper about a sex-change. the first and longest story is about glen (ed wood himself) who is in love and about to marry barbara (dolores fuller) but he has never told her he like to dress as a woman, when he is named glenda. the movie tells the same thing over and over again, especially the fact that a transvestite is not necessarily a homosexual. the movie almost says that being a transvestite is not a bad thing, but being homosexual is, since it keeps telling us the fact that a transvestite is not a homosexual. the second story is about a transvestite who really wants a sex-change and not just wants to dress up as a woman, but it is much shorter and less interesting.<br /><br />a couple of things make this movie very bad, and therefore laughable. how the story is presented is the first thing, the way the same things are told over and over again and the conclusion of it all are others. this is not where it ends. the acting is very bad, especially dolores fuller seems to be reading her lines directly from a little screen somewhere. every thing she says is funny. the whole dialogue actually gave me quite some laughs.<br /><br />there is also a sequence where someone walks into a room. the door stays half open and we see something hanging on the wall, not completely straight. then the door, in what seems to be the same shot although we know it is not, is a little less open and suddenly the thing on the wall hangs straight. ed wood didn't mind to leave this kind of continuity errors in his movie. may be a good thing, because basically it is just another laugh for the modern audience. i think you understand that it is a bad movie and i think there is a good chance you will laugh at the ridiculous mistakes as well.
