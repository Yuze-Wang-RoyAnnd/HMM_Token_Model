i first watched this show hoping for a few laughs, good acting, and good plot. sadly, i got none of those things.<br /><br />first off, this show is completely unrealistic. how can someone go to a boarding school that's super hip, awesome location, and barely any rules? plus a sushi bar. a sushi bar. no school has a sushi bar. and what's up with the huge, ultra cool, ultra hip dorm rooms? this doesn't happen in boarding schools! everyone in this show seems to be perfect. zoey, looks perfect, has the perfect friends, never has to do homework, and is super popular. sounds more like a villain to me! i hate how they use so many cliques in this show, example: dana the skater chick. she is completely ignorant and wears "edgy" clothes. the jokes are old sooooo old too! i wouldn't watch this show if i were you, it's one of the most horrible shows i have ever watched and i hope it gets canceled soon! rating: 1/10
