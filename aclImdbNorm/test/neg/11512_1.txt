for those of us who are part of the real world of ballet - this film is completely ridiculous. ivan kirov was basically a gymnast, not a ballet dancer. viola essen at the time was with ballet theater, now american ballet theater, and a reasonably good dancer, but except for dame judith anderson, the acting is amateurish and checkov is completely over the top .... embarrassingly so! i saw this film at age 14 and at that time, never having seen a ballet, i was very impressed. however, later in life, long after i had completed my own career as a dancer - i purchased the video tape of it, curious as to what it was like after so many years. i couldn't believe how naive hollywood could be about the world of ballet. but it was made in the mid 40s, before the red shoes or the turning point, the latter giving a true picture of the ballet world. the entire cast of spectre have now passed away ... ivan kirov (not his real name)dying at age 79. it was his one and only film, thereafter being kept by a chicago business man .. so the rumor goes.
