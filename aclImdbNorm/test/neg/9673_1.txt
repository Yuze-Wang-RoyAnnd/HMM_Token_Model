i have wanted to say this since i first saw the movie, i still will not allow any of my children or grandchildren to watch this. at least not until i tell them and they understand that it is completely fiction. the only thing that i saw that was correct was that animals went onto the ark, everything else was false. lot and noah fighting on the ocean like a pirate movie. make sure you tell your kids the real story before you allow them to watch it, but really, until they are old enough to understand that it is not real they may have a messed up vision of the bible. this was the worst bible movie i have ever seen. bruce and evan almighty were much better and had more to teach. let your children watch those
