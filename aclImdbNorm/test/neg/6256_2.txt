originally harped as a sequel to "the slumber party massacre" series, this film falls flat on it's face with a new title. first off, if you are going to include the word "massacre" in your film's title, you better deliver. this one certainly does not. there is no gore, no on screen murders and no chainsaw, as the box art would lead you to believe. instead, we get a paper thin, overdone plot about a group of cheerleaders who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game, only to be offed one by one. again, this film could have been ok if the gore quotient was upped a bit. why directors, especially those doing direct-to-video flicks, are afraid to show any gore is beyond me. now, i am not a huge fan of excessive gore, but come on...why else would anyone rent a movie called "cheerleader massacre??" besides that problem, the film suffers from a shot-on-a-home-video-camera cheapness. it looks cheap, sounds cheap, and the actors aren't all that good. it tries to throw us off track to who the killer may be, but even that fails. the ending ends up being a ridiculous mess. folks, if you run across this film, walk away and go find the original "slumber party massacre." 2 out of 10.
