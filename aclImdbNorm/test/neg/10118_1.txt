hm. where do i start? i usually ignore whatever rating imdb has when looking up a movie because i think i might like it anyway or whatever and i should at least give it a chance, but this time i wish i'd paid attention.<br /><br />i know some people liked it, and i'm not trying to say that they shouldn't. it was semi-amusing at some parts. but if you're like me and you don't like watching cats prancing around in the undergrowth for 20 minutes, random fast motion cloud scenes, dogs barking in cages for another 20 minutes set to 'thrilling' music, and close-ups of faces while people are speaking, then you might want to avoid this movie. the actors were either positively wooden or way over the top, and the film quality was awful, fuzzy and grainy and bland and not in an artistic way at all. and i know that we were supposed to think that carol was not just a crazy maniac with a gun shooting innocent people with this weird religious psychosis going on, but... well, she doesn't really convince me otherwise. in fact, i ended up really disliking her crazy character. and what was up with the souls in space? i understand this is a fantasy movie, but come on.<br /><br />i will say, the angel at the end was freaking creepy. it was the creepiest thing in the whole movie, way more creepy than the darth maul lava-face demon. i give them props for that scene, it was good. but not good enough to actually see the movie. and the opening credits were great, but don't be fooled! i would've rather they used whatever money went into those credits to make the movie better.<br /><br />bah. i wish i hadn't bought this for even the $2 that i paid for it, i could have bought a candy bar instead. :/
