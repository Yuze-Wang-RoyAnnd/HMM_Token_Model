with the plethora of repetitive and derivative sitcoms jamming fall, summer, winter and spring line-ups, it's nice to see a show that sets itself from the lot in more than one area. <br /><br />'earl' takes an unusual approach. it's not about the "daily musings of an eccentric family" (zzzz..) nor about the other boring stuff you see everywhere in sitcoms. the show is about this small-time white trash thief (earl) who scratches off a lottery card and scores big time. right at that moment, 'karma' took it away from him. overtime, he learns that that unusual incident was probably because of all the bad things he's been doing, so he sets off on a mission to right every wrong he ever did and he's got all his deeds on a paper.<br /><br />this is a brilliant premise for a sitcom. thankfully, it landed in the right hands. the execution of the show produces extremely satisfactory results: you get an innovative comedy that is genuinely funny and really touching at many times. you can't help but fall in love with earl's sincerity and steadfastness, randy's simple mind, good heart and observations on life, joy's wild, flamboyant personality and darnell's mellow, chillin' demeanor that really endears him to you very easily.<br /><br />when you combine the show's innovation with its genuine humor, good heart, interesting characters and well-written dialogue, you really have a keeper. with shows like this (and the incomparable "the office"), nbc is obviously on to something. did they finally free a cubicle or two for quality assurance? let's hope so. and let's hope for more quality shows like these will occupy the line-ups; shows that'll make both us tv viewers and nbc executives stop crying over the long gone days of nbc's golden days (frasier, seinfeld, friends)
