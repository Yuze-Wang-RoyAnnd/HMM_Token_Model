what bird is that ? a maltese falcon. the only thing remotely funny about this movie is michael caines hair. which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.<br /><br />the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue. salutes to raymond chandler and humphrey bogart and crime fiction etc... seem obtuse and just plain silly without the salvation of any humour or pertinency. the reason this film has no 'longevity' and near forgotten is it's so vacuous, an hour and half of pointless time spent in the company of second rate actors and film makers - this film is what the title suggests...
