i have little to no interest in seeing another awful movie, that totally lacks anything new creative or funny, abusing the national lampoon tag. how ever something caught my eye in the cast of this movie. i see danielle fishel's name i'm a big fan of boy meets world! but the movies shes in are awful. more so as a fan i'm not rewarded by seeing her terrible movies with the treasure of bare breast. so this is where my question comes in.<br /><br />has anyone seen this movie? and if so does danielle fishel get naked in it? would save me the 2 hours of my life i would never get back watching this terrible movie. thanks a lot
