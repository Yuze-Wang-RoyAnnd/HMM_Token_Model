this is truly one of the most awful movies of all time. it's dull, ponderous, badly acted, and teeth crawlingly pretentious.<br /><br />i watched for about an hour waiting for some kind of drama to unfold, before realising there wasn't any. the shot on a shoe string budget was particularly painful. these have to be the worst day for night shots since plan nine from outer space.<br /><br />the only barely redeeming feature is the ludicrous 'demons' wandering around the countryside with a plastic cat basket. how scary is that? and i did like the moggys used as extras, i suppose they are least cheap. though it did seem a bit obvious that they had been enticed into camera by the careful placement of some tuna.<br /><br />this film is so dreadful, it should have a public health warning. there was a queue at my local video store when i took it back, of people demanding their money back. i kid you not!
