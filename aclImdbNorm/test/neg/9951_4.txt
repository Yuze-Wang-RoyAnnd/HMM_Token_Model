not to be confused with the 1943 george zucco movie "the mad ghoul," "the mad monster" is a film that zucco appeared in the year before. in this fairly paint-by-numbers affair, zucco perfects a way to turn his dim-witted handyman, petro, into a wolf/man hybrid by means of wolf's blood injections, and then wastes little time in sending the transformed doofus to slay the former colleagues who had scoffed at his experiments. it is a very simple plot, really, and an extremely low-budget production. glenn strange, who plays the man/wolf here, would soon achieve greater fame playing the franky monster in films such as "house of frankenstein" (1944) and "abbott and costello meet frankenstein" (1948). the makeup job on him here is pretty lame, and only succeeds in making him look like a hippy with bad teeth (like the one in 1957's "teenage monster"). the sets in this film, in addition, are fairly nonexistent, and the denouement is abrupt and unconvincing. i have given the movie a very generous 4 stars, in part because i have an abiding love for 1940s horror films, but truth to tell, most objective viewers would probably deem it laughable crap, and i suppose it is. it's certainly no well-crafted universal affair or val lewton masterpiece, that's for sure! still, zucco is always fun to watch, even in undemanding piffle such as this. if you can spare 72 minutes of your life, i suppose you could do worse than "the mad monster" (not too much worse, of course!). oh...one other thing. this dvd is from alpha video, and you know what that means: fuzzy images, lousy sound (indeed, the worst sound of any alpha video dvd i've encountered so far) and no extras. you've been warned!
