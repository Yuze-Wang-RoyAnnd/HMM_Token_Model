talk about over acting...!!!! not just by govinda, but also by salman and lara....the direction was awful. the first half hour you would pretty much want to switch the movie off..because this movie is a real stinker (mark my words. <br /><br />i liked govinda in some o his comedy roles like haseena maan jaayegi, jodi no. 1, akhiyon se goli maare and jis desh mein ganga rehta hai and this does not compare to any of them. and salman khan should not do comedy roles at all!! he sucks. he does not know how to do comedy. the only good comedy role he did was in andaz apna apna, which was brilliant next to amir khan. <br /><br />there were so many 'overly done stupidly unfunny' scenes in this movie that make you want to take out the dvd and burn it so no one else in your house watches it ever again.
