this is like a zoology textbook, given that its depiction of animals is so accurate. however, here are a few details that appear to have been slightly modified during the transition to film:<br /><br />- handgun bullets never hit giant komodo dragons. it doesn't matter how many times you shoot at the komodo, bullets just won't go near it.<br /><br />- the best way to avoid being eaten by a giant cobra, or a giant komodo dragon, is just to stand there. the exception to this rule is if you've been told to stay very still, in which case you should run off, until the komodo is right next to you, and then you should stand there, expecting defeat.<br /><br />- minutes of choppy slow motion footage behind the credits really makes for enjoyable watching.<br /><br />- $5,000 is a memory enhancement tool, and an ample substitute for losing your boating license/getting arrested.<br /><br />- members of elite army units don't see giant komodo dragons coming until they are within one metre of the over-sized beings. maybe the computer-generated nature of these dragons has something to do with it.<br /><br />- when filming a news story aiming on exposing illegal animal testing, a reporter and a cameraman with one camera is all the gear and personnel you will need; sound gear, a second camera, microphones etc are all superfluous.<br /><br />- when you hear a loud animal scream, and one person has a gun, he should take it out and point it at the nearest person.<br /><br />- when you take a gun out, the sound of the safety being taken off will be made, even if your finger is nowhere near the safety<br /><br />- reporters agree to go half-way around the world in order to expose something - without having the faintest idea what they're exposing. background research and vague knowledge are out of fashion in modern journalism.<br /><br />- handguns hold at least 52 bullets in one clip, and then more than that in the next clip. despite that, those with guns claim that they will need more ammo.<br /><br />- expensive cameras (also, remember that the reporter only has one camera) are regularly left behind without even a moment's hesitation or regret. these cameras amazingly manage to make their way back to the reporter all by themselves.<br /><br />- the blonde girl really is the stupid one.<br /><br />- the same girl that says not to go into a house because a komodo dragon can easily run right through it, thus making it unsafe, takes a team into a building made of the same material for protection - and nobody says a word about it.<br /><br />- high-tech facilities look like simple offices with high school chemistry sets.<br /><br />- genetically-modified snakes grow from normal size to 100 feet long in a matter of a day, but don't grow at all in the weeks either side.<br /><br />- the military routinely destroys entire islands when people don't meet contact deadlines.<br /><br />- men with guns don't necessarily change the direction they're shooting when their target is no longer right in front of them. instead, they just keep shooting into the air.<br /><br />- the better looking you are, the greater your chance of surviving giant creatures.<br /><br />- women's intuition is reliable enough to change even the most stubborn of minds.<br /><br />- any time you're being hunted by giant creatures is a great time to hit on girls half your age.<br /><br />- animal noises are an appropriate masking noise for 'swearing' at the same volume.<br /><br />- old israeli and russian planes are regularly used by the us military.
