the commercials for rat race made it look too juvenile for me to enjoy, but since my boyfriend adores this movie (and the soundtrack), i finally relented and watched it with him tonight. i make him watch david lynch films and all sorts of obscure indie stuff (i recently forced urbania on him), so i felt i owed him an innocuous hollywood product.<br /><br />i didn't want to hurt his feelings, so i saved my bitching for y'alls. yeah, rat race has its moments, but a great deal of it irritated me. let's start at the beginning. rat race was marketed as a "family film," so i was a little surprised to discover that the first scene centered around a porno movie. (i can hear it now: "mommy, what does afro whores mean?") this scene has no purpose in this movie other than to cram some naughtiness into a pg-13 movie.<br /><br />and while we're still on the segments in the casino, it's pretty convenient that all the characters happened to play, within the same time frame, the slots that held the gold coins. what would have happened if they didn't? would those millionaire gamblers just sit around and wait? and how did they get those gold coins in the slots in the first place?<br /><br />but i'm belaboring a plot point that's necessary for the movie to exist, so i'll press on. about whoopi and her long-lost daughter: they're meeting for the very first time, yet throughout their whole ordeal they don't discuss with each other anything about themselves. why make their relationship such a presumably complicated one? couldn't they have just been, say, a mother and daughter on vacation together? why the business concerning a long-ago adoption? and why portray the daughter as a hard driving career woman chained to her cell phone who never again needs contact with her business? did the screenplay just forget about this subplot and character trait?<br /><br />this illustrates the main weakness of this movie - the characters are inconsistent and interchangeable; it's exhausting when everyone is equally zany and with no identifying traits. and another thing - the events aren't plausible. oh, sure, the characters can do some quirky things, but the characters themselves have to be believable. take the naked gun (another jerry zucker movie) for example. frank drebin has some pretty exaggerated moments, but everything he does is, in theory, possible in his world. (jane is also funny, but it's a different kind of funny, which makes all the difference.) a character in rat race defying natural laws by leaping onto a speeding train destroys any plausibility the movie may have; these clearly aren't real people, so why should i care about them?<br /><br />another problem i have with rat race is a moral one. the characters obtain their modes of transport almost totally by theft. i know, i know, this is just a silly comedy, and the same actions didn't bother me fifteen years ago when i saw million dollar mystery, but there's a lot of lawbreaking in rat race, and it bothers me now. and i won't delve into the whole airport-sabotage sequence other than to wonder if the screenwriters didn't consider the real-life implications of such an action; was that scene funny before 9/11?<br /><br />i'll skip over the distasteful bits concerning the heart, the drugging of one's family and the nazis (whose buildup and payoff worked better in an episode of "seinfeld"), and move on to complain about the acting. rowan atkinson started out annoying and ended insufferable; i don't know when i liked a comical character less. and the three oscar winners need new agents. whoopi came off best, but she didn't have much to work with (loved the copper perm and purple lipstick though); kathy bates' part was shrill but mercifully brief; cuba, was...oh, man. cuba, babe, please fire your agent! following instinct and chill factor, this is your third strike (be glad i haven't seen pearl harbor or snow dogs) - it's time to give your '97 best supporting actor oscar back to its rightful owner (edward norton, for primal fear). an actor of your stature has no business running half-naked through the desert and being checked out by a transvestite lucille ball impersonator. do you even read the scripts to your movies anymore, or are you reaching into a bag and pulling your next project out at random?<br /><br />there's other small points that bother me (how did grisham and the hooker get to the loot so fast?), but, basically, rat race amounts to little more than your basic batch of character types being hindered by arbitrary obstacles on their way to a rather underwhelming and inexplicable ending. they give the money to charity? what kind of ending is that?!? yeah, it's the "noble" thing to do. never mind the probability of cross-promotion/licensing whores smash mouth (do they ever say no to selling out?) putting on a benefit concert in the middle of the new mexico desert, but who would honestly do such a thing? yes, they say it's the journey, not the destination, that makes a trip worthwhile, but there's no journey without a destination. if there was ever an example of a "wrong happy ending," this would be it. what a bummer end to a movie that, despite my nitpicking here, i did enjoy parts of (i confess to enjoying the bit with the cow and some of the lucy stuff along with the character with the tongue piercing - at first i thought his indecipherable speech would run me up a wall, but he grew to be my favorite).<br /><br />but as far as my boyfriend knows, i found rat race quite funny and charming.<br /><br />
