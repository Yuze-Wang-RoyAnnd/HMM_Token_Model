in one sense, i kind of liked this movie because of a 'mindless', positive atmosphere it sort of conveys. i had a problem with an aspect of the plot, but more about that later. first, the characters were a little goofy and one dimensional. the 'good people' had similar physical and character traits and the 'bad people' had similar physical and character traits ... hmmm. the basic storyline was ok (pretty simple and standard) - nothing too exciting or objectionable. the main attraction was, of course, the miniature dinosaurs - kind of a nice fantasy element to have. however, they had a very minimal presence in the movie.<br /><br />outside of that, the movie kept a brisk pace and didn't get too bogged down in any one place. i liked this about the movie.<br /><br />the problem i had with the plot had to do with the the idea of "stealing". i think this movie may not have been thought out enough - something's wrong especially if this is a kid's movie. i'll keep the next sentence abstract to not be a spoiler (skip it if you're worried). the 'good guys' do some stealing and they don't have the same info the audience has - so it's just stealing and that's kind of a bad thing for a kid's movie.<br /><br />overall, if you have kids, because of a questionable plot aspect i'd consider passing. however, this whole movie is pretty low key anyway so it may not matter. pass this one if you have any other interesting choices.
