well, the hero and the terror is slightly below average in my opinion. yes, chuck is a real martial artist and kicks some butt in this film but it is rather slow and the acting in my opinion is for the most part subpar although i think steve james does a decent job. like my friend ryan, i was confused as to why the psychopath chose to go to the theatre at the end of the film rather than to go after norris's girlfriend. until than, the killer had only killed women. oh, well, i guess it wasn't as predictable as i thought. definitly a film you can pass on.
