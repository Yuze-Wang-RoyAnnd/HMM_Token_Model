ever notice how so many really bad films attract so many 10/10 votes? not much of a riddle how that happens, but this is not much of a film. there are two ways of looking at it being given away in the mail on sunday.<br /><br />1. it's free, so you can't complain about it to much. 2. it's free, so it can't be much good.<br /><br />my vote is number 2. the free dvd in the sunday papers things is a recent trend and some great old movies have been given away. they're ones that have been out for ages and have made most of the money they'll ever make, so it's a case of anything else is a bonus. it's the last stop for old films, not the first for new ones, so you can guess how bad this must be to skip tv and dvd rental.<br /><br />the plus points are that vinnie jones does try hard and derek jacobi is good as dickens. the minus points are a longer list. trying isn't the same as succeeding for poor vinnie and jacobi's other tramp character is talkative ham that's gone off. the story is very weak. the dickens story does not have anything to do with the film's murders and feels like another movie slapped onto the script to make people think it's a british dan brown without the religion. the supporting cast are either there for the money (vanessa redgrave must be really hard up) or because they are friends or girlfriends of the filmmakers. it is also very, very long for what it is.<br /><br />vinnie taking his priceless dickens story with him in his jacket pocket everywhere is good for a couple of laughs, but that's it. not funny and very not good even for free.
