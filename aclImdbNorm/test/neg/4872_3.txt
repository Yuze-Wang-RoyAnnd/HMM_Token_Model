they make everything too easy in this film. it sort of reminded me of indiana jones where he hides on the outside of a submarine during an ocean crossing. everybody knows everything that's going on, it's just real easy to get anyplace you want in the white house. i don't even know why i watched half of it. because i like charlie sheen and donald sutherland. i expect the usual ability to dodge bullets from every angle, and be able to run faster than a motorcycle (usually it's faster than a car in a garage or a allyway). it was silly, mostly, and i didn't even know then had a ten-story elevator in the white house. anyway, anything conspiratorial is always interesting.
