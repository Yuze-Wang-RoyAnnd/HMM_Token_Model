a modern scare film? yep it is..<br /><br />the hippies, peaceniks and environmentalists got together to deliver us a fear film.. i didn't recognize it when watching it only 2 years ago that it was a fear film but that's exactly what it is..<br /><br />there's no difference between this film and films the nazi made about us in ww2 and the same films we made about them.. this is pure propaganda and speaks only to those.. that believe in aliens, 9/11 conspiracy plots, faked moon landings, peak oil and major environmentalism what i can say is this film does push buttons, make you ask questions and ultimately just forget about it.. it's a scare film.. so if your scarred get in your houses, lock your doors and stock up for that nuclear winter we all know is coming when bush provokes the chinese into nuclear war..
