first, i am a big fan of alien and alien ii - in my opinion both of these movies created and defined the si-fi horror genre as we know it today. i noticed lifeforce was often compared to the aliens saga - after viewing this movie i would highly disagree. there are some okay special effects with the alien vampires, and the story line might have been acceptable. i just can't get past a naked woman space vampire throughout the whole movie, this is absolutely absurd (although she does look good). add in a bunch of bad british acting and it's pretty much over. most of the movie ends up taking place in london or somewhere in england, so after the first 20 minutes you lose the outerspace setting and any hope of some real si-fi horror action and suspense.<br /><br />
