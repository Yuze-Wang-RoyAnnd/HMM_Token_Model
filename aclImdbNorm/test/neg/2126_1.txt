what could possibly go wrong with a movie that includes a bunch of italians pretending to be flordians, and some vague-lava-octopus-crustacean-thingy as the hell-induced hellspawn-devil-fish?!?!<br /><br />everything is what goes wrong i tell you!<br /><br />this is a very good mst3k episode because the heckling in right on the ball, which without fault, is easy to do considering this movie is a piece of junk with a lousy and boring plot.<br /><br />9/10 for mstied version. 1/10 for un-mstied version.<br /><br />
