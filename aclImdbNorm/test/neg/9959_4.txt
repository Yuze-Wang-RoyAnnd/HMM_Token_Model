ok, i've now seen george zucco in at least four separate horror/suspense films recently as i worked my way through various 50 pack collections, and i have to say, the guy had a limited range, but he was good at what he did. he wasn't karloff, but prc was lucky to have him. <br /><br />but the poor guy was stuck in a kind of back-water ghetto of horror films, and he wasn't good enough to take them to the next level of interest....not with the thread-bare screenplays and direction and budgets he worked under. that's the case here. <br /><br />this movie is, well, slow, stodgy and unexciting for the most part. the "heroine" seems to be doomed to be a rent-a-center version of judy garland, the "hero" is bland as white rice, and the poor guy playing the monster doesn't even get a good transformation scene out of the deal. his make up effects aren't scary at all - he looks like a slightly more shaggy version of a farm hand, is all. <br /><br />it's not a total waste. zucco looks good on camera, he chews the scenery while managing to deliver some terribly affected and contrived set speeches without flinching or losing the flow. there are some moody b&w shots here and there that don't completely suck. <br /><br />so all in all...this movie helped some "c" through "z" level actors pay their rent for another month, and it never sinks below a certain hacked out level of quality. watch it once if you like george zucco, or just feel the need to see every wolfman-themed movie ever made.
