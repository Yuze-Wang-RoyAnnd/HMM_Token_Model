this is a piece of celluloid crap. you can tell when you are watching a "wanna be" mafia film....and this is it. this made no sense at all, didnt start at the beginning of his life, charactors were all over the place...and the term "godfather" didnt even exist until puzo wrote the book!.....then, the real mafia, borrowed the phrase and made it their own after the movie.....this piece of claptrap would have one thinking that the phrase (representing the mafia don) was used back in the 20's...when these people were only called "don"....outside of the original godfather movie, if you want to see another decent mob flick, check out puzo's the last don (part 1) part 2 sucked.
