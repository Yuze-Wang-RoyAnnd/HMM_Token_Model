the fifth collaboration between marlene dietrich and director josef von sternberg, blonde venus is a film that looks great while it's playing but fails to engages the viewer. the plodding storyline of dietrich being torn between two men, becoming a mammoth cabaret star, and fighting for the custody of her child is jumbled and often feels like bits of three separate films half-baked together. dietrich is unwisely cast in a rather passive, reactive role for much of the film and her character remains aloof from viewers, while herbert marshal is unconvincing as her ill-tempered husband, and cary grant is largely wasted as a suave suitor who dashes in and out of the picture. the film does contain some intriguing set pieces (the "hot voodoo" number is the high point) that are impressively surrealistic for this era in hollywood, although it proves to no avail in such a dull, incoherent film.
