what to say about this movie? a married couple has more then just each other. after playing around for some time things gets more serious. a difficult choice has to be made: continue the old situation or start all over by following the heart. guess what happens at the end. <br /><br />this movie seems to be very low budget. but a good story don't have to be expensive. it looks like a play that has been converted to a movie only by using several cheap locations (at least very little other people visible) more than just the stage, in this one the house. from the first minute future developments are clear as water. nothing unexpected happens. sometimes you may think watching a soft porn movie, in which case you know in advance that there's no story. <br /><br />i find this movie disappointing so that's explains the vote (4).
