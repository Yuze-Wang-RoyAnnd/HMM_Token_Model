okay, anyone looking to see a great work of art should not watch this film. a sophisticated film connoisseur will no doubt be nauseated by the horrid production values and the sight of watching an excellent actor (joseph cotten) whoring himself out for a buck. mr. cotten must have either really needed the money or he was too senile to realize that the film was crap. the same phenomenon occurred with dana andrews, who late in his career appeared in the campy and awful frozen dead. i know mr. andrews was in the throes of alcoholism, but why did cotten do this mess?!<br /><br />as for the plot, it's a reworking of the frankenstein plot. the first half of the movie really looked as if they were doing a serious but seriously flawed version of the original frankenstein story. then, inexplicably, they introduced a daughter. this wasn't a bad thing,...until then, out of the blue, they decided to stop making a horror film but make a soft-core pornographic flick!! the change was dramatic and bizarre. it was almost as if they said "okay, mr. cotten is done with his scenes and has gone home,....now ladies,...strip!".<br /><br />the problem is that on every level, the film is just awful except for the monster's makeup. while not great, it is still pretty cool to see. but bad writing, acting and a budget of $17.46 conspired to make this a drab and awful flick--one so bad that tossing in some nudity for the pervs out there shouldn't be enough to entice anyone to see it.
