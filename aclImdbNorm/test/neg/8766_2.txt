the back of the dvd for this movie raves, "chey is the quentin tarantino of christian films." this isn't so much an insult to quentin as it is to christian films. this film is poorly written, stiffly acted and edited with a purposeless intensity. the scenes play out in a confusing and unrealistic way and are interspersed with some nice time-lapse photography. flashbacks, fades to grey, freeze frames to tell the time (unimportant in the story) are all done with out any apparent reason other than to give the movie more cinematic credibility. the camera is haphazard, some nice crane shots are cut with ridiculous montages that have no significance. poor blocking and lighting leave the viewer wondering who is talking to who in many scenes. oh and the audio is terrible. the special effects were decent and thankfully limited. but this is all just technical. the movie fails to engage on an emotional level. the dialogue is so fake sounding and the actors seem to have only read it a moment before the camera was rolling. the story... the things that happen in sequence have no motivation behind them. the characters are struggling to take hold of one dimensionality. and the characters have to make a stance on christianity and faith in every single scene. take a queue from m. night, engaging christian films don't have to have the characters saying the name of jesus christ in every scene for the movie to be christian. goodness! please don't try to show this to your unsaved friends with any expectations other than laughter.
