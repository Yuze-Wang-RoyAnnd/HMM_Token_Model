if you`re not old enough to remember yoram globus and menahem golan here`s the rundown : they`re a couple of film producers and finaciers from israel who set up the cannon film company in the early 1980s . the only israeli to get a worse press than these two was menachim begin . begin probably deserved the bad press but globus and golan were a god send to film makers because no matter how bad your script was they`d happily fund your movie and would normally employ directors who couldn`t direct and actors who couldn`t act . in fact you often got the impression that people would just walk up to yoram and menahem ask them for some money and they`d oblige without seeing the film maker`s resume . if only producers nowadays were so trusting.<br /><br />the young warriors isn`t a cannon film but globus and golan did finance it and it has their signature all over it . it`s badly directed , badly acted , badly edited but it`s the script that jumps out and attacks you with its awfulness . it starts with a bunch of high school jocks getting involved in all sorts of zany pranks , in fact the first 20 minutes of the movie plays out like a sex comedy and it`s something of a shock when the young warriors turns into a vigilante movie . but it`s not just any type of vigilante movie like exterminator 2 or death wish 3 ( notice a connection ? they`re both sequels and they`re both vigilante movies made by cannon films ) , no siree this is a laughably bad vigilante movie about pretty boy high school jocks and their poodle going on a mission to wipe out scumbags . this film is proof that globus and golan were giving money to people regardless of their film making abilities and you have to worry about people who seem to spend their entire reserves on making movies set entirely around vigilantes
