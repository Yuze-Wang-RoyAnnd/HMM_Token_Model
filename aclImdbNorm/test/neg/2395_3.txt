love and human remains directed by denys arcand is an abysmally pathetic film as it is completely different from the kind of films he has been making all through his career.making a different film is not an objectionable matter,what is troublesome is the fact that if a film from a master is complete out of tune then it is a really bad event. the film begins on a good note as there is some suspense created. however as the film progresses what is shown is just a futile attempt at creating something meaningful as arcand shows us half a dozen oddball,whimsical characters whose lives are intertwined with each other.homosexuality and lesbianism are not of any consequences here. what is even more bothersome is the feeling of guilt related to the characters who are rather in a fix regarding their feelings towards each other and sexuality.such a film would be of interest to some who wants to see a different denys arcand film.all in all,there would surely not be many takers for this film.
