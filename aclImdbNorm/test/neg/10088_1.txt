it was awful plain and simple. what was their message? where was the movie going with this? it has all the ingredients of a sub-b grade movie. from plotless storyline the bad acting to the cheesey slow-mo cinematography. i'd sooner watch a movie i've already seen like goodfellas, a bronx tale, even grease. there are no likeable characters. in the end you just want everyone to die already. save 2 hours of your life and skip this one.
