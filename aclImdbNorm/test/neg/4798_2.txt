just saw coronado... around here the only line they came up with to sell it is "from the fx team behind independence day". i think that says a great deal. no talk about writers, directors, actors...<br /><br />it's a cute little adventure story set in a banana republic in mid america, but the storyline is thin.<br /><br />all the way through the movie i kept thinking about how much this movie looks like the cut-scenes from some action computer war game. although the fxs are nice, they all too often are visible. much like the cut scenes in cgs style like command'n'conquer.<br /><br />you almost instantly know that that particular truck, backdrop, bridge, castle, or jet fighter never existed. the look is smooth and nice, but not up to the standard we have come to expect of action adventures today. the movie is lacking a lot of obvious on-location filming.<br /><br />the acting, storyline is below average and the fxs are nice but not up to feature film standard. i am not surprised this thing went straight to video/dvd.<br /><br />
