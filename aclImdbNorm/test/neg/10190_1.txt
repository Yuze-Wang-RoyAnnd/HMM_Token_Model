i thought i was going to see a ufo movie. instead, i saw a movie that was trying to make the audience (me) make the decision to accept christ in my life, or risk going to hell. the whole ufo thing was one big red herring!!! the acting in it was pretty pathetic. in fact, it looked as though some people from an evangelic church just got got together and decided they wanted to make a movie. all the characters talked as though they were in church conversing with other church members. it wasn't real-life dialog at all. i wish i had read some reviews before seeing this movie so i wouldn't have wasted my money on it. if, on the other hand, you are into the whole church scene in a big way, and want to see a demonstration of how to push your views (no matter how limiting) onto other people, then by all means, go see it.
