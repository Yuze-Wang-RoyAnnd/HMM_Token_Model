when a group of businessmen start dying in the presence of the mysterious mr. coulomb, fbi agent dick martin is assigned to the case. as the deaths continue to mount, mr. martin obviously isn't having much success. by the end of the movie, the strange truth is revealed, which i won't reveal here.<br /><br />one of the other users commenting on this states "this is a classic film and should be enjoyed and not picked apart". i'm sorry but i have to respectfully disagree with this opinion. it is "classic" only in that it is old, not in any sense pertaining to its quality. i've enjoyed a lot of low budget "b" movies from around this time period, but this isn't one of them.<br /><br />the pacing is unbearably slow, the camera work is pretty bland, most of the acting is fairly wooden (even lugosi isn't great in this one in my opinion) and the plot, while it has an interesting premise, seems to be thrown together in a very difficult to follow manner.
