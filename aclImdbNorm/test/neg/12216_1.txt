i ordered this movie on the internet as it is very difficult to get turkish movies where we live. i've heard so much about the tv series from my friends and practically everyone in turkey, i was expecting to see a breakthrough in turkish cinema. what a disappointment.<br /><br />me and my husband (who is an admirer of any movie with a bit of turkish landscape and turkish dialogues in it) only watched it all the way through because we had paid $20 for the dvd. well, that was a boring way of wasting it.<br /><br />it was confusing, at times overacted, whereas other times underacted. the storyline was not only confusing, but adding a gay man walking with his dog on the beach and using some toilet humor in the script to make it 'hollywood' didn't also work for me.<br /><br />the american characters were almost too stereotypical that it was neither funny nor realistic and like another user mentioned, the turkish customs and lifestyle was irrelevant. <br /><br />the camera movements had no significance. adding a few dervishes (never seen in them in kapadokya by the way) and broken plates -greek style- only made the movie even more confusing. <br /><br />i am ashamed of this movie and all the noise the press has made about it. there are surely worthy movies made by turkish directors which deserve more attention and respect.<br /><br />i give this movie 1 out of 10.
