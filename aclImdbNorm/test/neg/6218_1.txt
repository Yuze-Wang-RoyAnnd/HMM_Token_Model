having avoided seeing the movie in the cinema, but buying the dvd for my wife for xmas, i had to watch it. i did not expect much, which usually means i get more than i bargained for. but 'mamma mia' - utter, utter cr**. i like abba, i like the songs, i have the old lps. but this film is just terrible. the stage show looks like a bit of a musical, but this races along with songs hurriedly following one another, no characterisation, the dance numbers (which were heavily choreographed according to the extras on the dvd) are just thrown away with only half the bodies ever on screen, the dance chorus of north europeans appear on a small greek island at will, while the set and set up of numbers would have disgraced cliff richard's musicals in the sixties!meryl (see me i'm acting)streep can't even make her usual mugging effective in an over-the-top musical! her grand piece - 'the winner takes it all' - is meryl at the met! note to director - it should have been shot in stillness with the camera gradually showing distance growing between streep and brosnan! some of the singing is awful karaoke on amateur night. the camera cannot stop moving like bad mtv. one can never settle down and just enjoy the music, enthusiasm and characters. but what is even worse is how this botched piece of excre**** has become the highest grossing film in the uk and the best selling dvd to boot? blair, campbell and new labour really have reduced the uk to zombies - critical faculties anyone???
