when i saw the poster at the theater, i thought that it is a "new line" of a horror story without a famous cast worth giving a try. but, after i went in, i wanted to leave after 20 minutes. there was a lot of non-sense and logical flaws. to me, it is a movie that is not worth putting in theaters. it is not even worth seeing.
