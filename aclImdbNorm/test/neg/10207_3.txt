i remember when they made a big deal about this when it was coming out. they showed clips every week on wwf tv and everyone was excited. it debuted opening weekend at number two behind indiana jones and the last crusade. then it did a nosedive. critics hated this film. i don't remember seeing one good review. everyone agreed it was bad and sometimes grotesque. i didn't know they meant back then but now i do since the movie makes references to gay bars, women getting slapped hard and nearly raped and a disgusting looking bar restroom with overflowing urinals lol. when i was younger, i didnt care for that. it was hulkamania, brother!!!<br /><br />now i find this pretty bad, but still fun to watch once in a while when its paired with bodyslam (which has a better storyline). first off, hulk hogan's acting skills just aren't great. he is one dimensional like the character he plays in the wrestling ring. and actually, rip and hulk are not to far off from each other. kurt fuller is a good actor, but he is not good at playing the bad guy. he is better at comedy and nervous drama characters. he is just not believable as brell. there isn't much character development in this film and the ones that suffer are the characters of randy, rip's brother and charlie the trainer (in wrestling its unheard of a trainer escourting a wrestler to the ring lol). tiny lister plays zeus the way its supposed to be played, so there isnt any problem there. joan severence is passable and for all you softcore hounds, she does have a lingerie scene lol. by the end, you figure, what's the point?<br /><br />for this one (as with other wrestling films or films that feature wrestlers as the main star), turn your brain off. you'll enjoy it more if you do.
