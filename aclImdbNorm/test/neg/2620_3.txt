now this is a movie i really dislike. it's one of the most boring horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere. the settings are not even attractive for the eye and do not serve for the movie's purpose. <br /><br />the puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the puppet master 80's flicks. what did they do to our favorite toys?!<br /><br />the story is lame, not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets. there aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible. <br /><br />i felt asleep the first time i watched it, so i can recommend it for insomniacs.
