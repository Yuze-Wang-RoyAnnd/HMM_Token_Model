altman is very proud of the fact that people in his movies talk over each other, because, he says, people do that in life. well, people also cough, burp, go off on tangents, etc. the point is that just because people actually do something doesn't make it compelling cinema. that's one issue.<br /><br />the bigger issue is that this just isn't a very clever or direct or hitting or relevant satire, in 1988 or 2004. garry trudeau is still living in the 1960s and thinks everyone except a small core of republican elected officials is a 60s-style hippie liberal. i mean the guy still trots out zonker in his strip - a character that is a complete anachronism, yet trudeau still employs him as if he is representative of a large stripe of american youth.<br /><br />don't get me wrong. i am a conservative, but i'm not saying that this is bad because it's got a liberal bent. it could take a liberal tack and be funny and relevant, but it's not. it is mainly a vanity piece with a bunch of prominent celebrity liberals (including the odious, repellent ron reagan, jr.). at times it feels unscripted, and the rest of the time it has a snarky air of self-importance and "aren't we oh-so-clever?"-ness.<br /><br />someone said that this show insists it has a cult following. i think its cult status is more wished-for than actual. i'm certain there are two or three people out there who taped all the original episodes in 1988 and still have them, but if that is the standard, then every show ever aired is a cult classic to some degree. if tanner didn't have the names altman and trudeau attached, it would be another forgotten hbo production from the 1980s. instead, it's presented as hard-hitting, incisive political commentary from guys who are at the top of their game. the reality, however, is about as far from that as possible. pat paulsen's presidential satire is more relevant than tanner ever was, and he's been dead for a decade.
