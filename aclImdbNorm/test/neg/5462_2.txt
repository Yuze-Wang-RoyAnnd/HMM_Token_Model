i have to agree with what many of the other reviewers concluded. a subject which could have been thought-provoking and shed light on a reversed double-standard, failed miserably.<br /><br />rape being a crime of violence and forced abusive control, the scenes here were for the most part pathetic. it would have been a better idea to cover short glimpses of what was happening and let the audience imagine the deed. and the victim's laugh with the cops, when he aborted his police complaint, seemed as genuine as that of the cops. no awkwardness, no hesitance to merely join in. i don't know if this was bad acting and or bad directing but someone missed the point entirely. as for his half-a**ed supposed search for his attackers, pathetic. they should have skipped most of the sex scenes - another monumental failure in themselves, and had him meet colin friels when he first went to the police. the story could have then been drawn forth with good dialog and the occasional flashback - and saved by the superior acting and presence colin friels - the only reason i watched this movie - brings to any project he does.<br /><br />the only concrete revelation of this movie, is, it was crap.
