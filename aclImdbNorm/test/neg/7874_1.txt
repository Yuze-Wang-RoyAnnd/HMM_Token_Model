ugh. stephen baldwin. i never noticed until i got the dvd home and saw his name in the credits. double ugh. what's worse, he's the name in this low budget, mindless, wandering, wannabe shoot'em up. i mean, where did they find the guy to write this refuse? driving a caterpillar in the la city dump, while hoping to break into the movie game? the whole plot is ridiculous situation piled on ridiculous premise. baldwin is as convincing as a poster boy for american gothic, sans pitchfork. his whole acting repertoire is looking like he needs the potty and then looking like he found it. <br /><br />so, there you have it folks: bad script, bad acting by no-name actors, low-budget setting and a hero that's about as convincing as a girl scout looking for a cookie customer as an action hero. it's too late for me to get my money back on the dvd, but you can spare yourself-- unless you're one of those who likes to look at the dogs for a laugh...frankly, this one is too boring to be funny.
