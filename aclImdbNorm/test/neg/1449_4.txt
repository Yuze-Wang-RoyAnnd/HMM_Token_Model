i wasn't expecting much from this film, but was eager to try something which i initially thought would primarily be an early 80s teen horror. although three teens are somewhat critical plot, it is by no means a teen horror film.<br /><br />'the power' is about a little aztec idol that exchanges many hands as its possessor (who must be adult and thus, 'corrupted') becomes the vessel for unleashing all of the idol's evil, and often with deadly implications for not only the victims of the possessor, but of the possessor himself. after making several exchanges in vying over control of this thing, three teenagers wind up finding it and can't figure out what it is, except that since they found it, strange and dangerous things are afoot. they offer to explain the situation to a news reporter who doesn't buy into the spiritual bologna. although, it is her producer who wants to investigate further, especially if it means he can get control of the idol (i presume the teens are even not yet corrupted enough to feel the dangerous desires encouraged by the idol). it is a story told a thousand times, particularly in 1950s and 60s horror and science fiction fare.<br /><br />this one was at least, for me, able to sustain some interest. though low budget, it was not done so obviously cheaply or loaded with bad acting as many of the low-budget, come-and-go horror fare of the earlier decades had (nowadays, they have the same cheesy qualities, but bigger budgets). we are spare enough of it to at least allow ourselves an opportunity to become at least a little bit absorbed with the eerie atmosphere and so forth, despite a story of clich'es. and, though not terribly gory, the special effects were done nicely.<br /><br />again, it is routine horror tale, especially with the ending (which by modern standards has become a device that is annoyingly overused), but one that is not so embarrassingly bad. it might be worth checking out, even if just for laughs.
