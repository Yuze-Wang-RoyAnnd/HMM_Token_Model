being a long-time fan of japanese film, i expected more than this. i can't really be bothered to write to much, as this movie is just so poor. the story might be the cutest romantic little something ever, pity i couldn't stand the awful acting, the mess they called pacing, and the standard "quirky" japanese story. if you've noticed how many japanese movies use characters, plots and twists that seem too "different", forcedly so, then steer clear of this movie. seriously, a 12-year old could have told you how this movie was going to move along, and that's not a good thing in my book.<br /><br />fans of "beat" takeshi: his part in this movie is not really more than a cameo, and unless you're a rabid fan, you don't need to suffer through this waste of film.<br /><br />2/10
