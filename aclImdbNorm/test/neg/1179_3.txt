this movie was really bad. first they didn't even follow the facts for it. half of the movie was made up and it was more about the deputy whose mother was one of ed gein's victims. the acting was horrible, except for the guy playing ed gein, but its not hard to mess up playing a weird guy. though i think it was horrible i gave it a three because they started it off with actual crime photos. that was the best part of the movie. as soon as the introduction of the movie was finished the movie went downhill. the writer of this movie tried to spice it up, but it didn't need to be. the story of ed gein is interesting enough without falsifying information.
