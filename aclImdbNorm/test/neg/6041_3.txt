webs starts in 'chicago: present day' as four electricians, dean (richard grieco), ray (richard yearwood), sheldon (jeffrey douglas) & junior (jason jones) are about to disconnect the electric to an unused building scheduled for demolition. as they search for the relevant cables & stuff they come across a set of doors that according to the buildings blue-prints shouldn't be there, being nosey & all that they force the doors open to have a look & find a room full of computers & scientific machinery. as they mess around with some buttons a portal to a parallel universe opens, dean & junior accidentally 'fall' in with ray & sheldon following soon after in search of their friends. unfortunately they've all ended up in an exact parallel earth that has been taken over by a mutant spider thing that either eats people or turns them into mutant soldiers with which she uses to protect herself & do whatever she wants them to really. in a desperate bid for survival they team up with a few of the last remaining humans including the original inventor of the portal dr. richard morelli (colin fox) who says that with the help of our electrician boys he might (yeah might) be able to build another portal to take them back home...<br /><br />edited & directed by david wu i thought webs was pretty crap, it's as simple & straight forward as that really. the script by grenville case & robinson young is preposterous to say the least & has plot holes in it you could drive a tank through, for instance is this film really trying to suggest that a few mutant spider things no bigger than a couple of people in size took over an entire world? how did they do this? if this parallel earth was the same as ours where the hell was the army? the police? all of our weapons? a few fragile looking spider things against literally billions of humans?! the whole flawed, stupid & downright naff concept constantly bugged me throughout the entire film. lets not forget that there is a inter-dimensional portal to a parallel earth in the basement of most buildings that have sat there undisturbed for decades & remain in perfect working order, right? then there's the nuclear reactor the size of a briefcase, the fact one electrician can make it work perfectly purely by accident as he randomly presses a few buttons in a room that probably had 100's spread over dozens of pieces of equipment & what about the wonderfully thoughtful guy who sets an explosive bobby trap in his base without telling anyone, what if one of his mates had set it off & found themselves blown to pieces by their mates homemade bomb? you wouldn't be best pleased would you? what about food? do they grow their own in little vegetable patches? i could go on & on all day long about how flawed, ill conceived & poorly written webs is but i can't be bothered. the character's are clich'ed & annoying as is the film as a whole which obviously doesn't help. the only half decent thing i can say about webs is that it's short & it moves along at a fair pace but when all said & done it's still crap.<br /><br />director wu has to take a large chunck of the blame here, for a start the film looks cheap & the editing that he is credited with is terrible. there's lots of annoying inappropriate slow motion shots that come from nowhere, the action scenes are almost identical & become incredibly boring very quickly. he uses that highly annoying quick cut technique along with a bit of the old jerky camera movement, now i don't know about anyone else but i hate this editing style as it just looks a complete incoherent mess. in fact i don't know a single person who does like this sort of thing & i'm puzzled as to why filmmakers think people do. forget about any gore, just a few shotgun wounds to the spider zombie soldier guys & they don't have red blood anyway so it doesn't relate to reality in my mind.<br /><br />webs was made-for-tv, the american sci-fi channel i think & it looks every bit as cheap, low budget & rushed as you would expect. it's all so bland, forgettable, flat & dull. the special effects are far from special & the spider thing lacks imagination when finally revealed. the acting was ok considering everything else was so poor & i still can't believe the sweater grieco was wearing in this.<br /><br />webs is crap, i can't really say anything good about it other than i've sat through worse films & that's the sole reason i'm not giving it 1 star & a quick glance at the imdb user ratings for webs confirms what i already knew in that it has more '1' votes than any other & there is very good reason why...
