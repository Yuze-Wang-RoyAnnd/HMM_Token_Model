this movie is so bad that it actually gets funny. one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my entire life. the funny thing was that the trailer had scenes in it that wasn't in the movie. just by watching the trailer i would have saved a lot of my time. it actually showed everything that happened in the movie except for the conclusion and that was also so obvious.<br /><br />it's honestly hard to think of a reason why this movie was made. this is just so bad. horrible. <br /><br />i would give it 0 out of 10 if that would be possible. there is nothing else to say about this movie.
