the comparisons between the 1995 version and this are inevitable. sadly, this version falls far short.<br /><br />the casting is uninspired and the acting wooden. one gets the impression the director did not read the book,so did not understand the characters.<br /><br />sir walter elliot is portrayed as pompous but his inadvertent silliness which redgrave brilliantly captured (in the 1995 version) is nowhere to be found.<br /><br />the musgrove sisters are so unlikable, one doesn't understand why wentworth or anybody else would give them a second glance.<br /><br />the relationship between wentworth and anne is devoid of feeling.<br /><br />in the 1995 version, hinds and root managed to convey the depth of emotion the two of them felt towards each other with their body language and facial expressions. in this one, it is hard to understand anne spent years mired in regret unless one has read the book.<br /><br />this production does not capture the emotional complexity of the main characters' relationship.<br /><br />in the scene where wentworth walks in on anne and mary having breakfast, it seems to the viewer, as mary thinks, they are only slight acquaintances.<br /><br />in the 1995 version, when wentworth walks in (the first time he sees her in years), the tension is thick. resentment is coming off wentworth in waves, while anne is almost overcome.<br /><br />in this version, while wentworth is courting lousia, it is as if he is truly invested, the undercurrents are missing. in the 1995 version, the viewer sees wentworth's anger at anne. he is flaunting his courtship in front of anne, as if to say, "see what you gave up, i don't need or want you anymore".<br /><br />yet he still cares if she suffers, as the scene where he asks his sister and the admiral to take anne back to house illustrates. in the 1995 version the viewer feels anne's shock that he would care if she was tired, we also feel wentworth's discomfort that he does still care. in this version he just walks on with lousia as if nothing happened.<br /><br />the pivotal scene where anne is conversing with harville about who loves longest, man or woman, is totally botched. the actors are just reciting lines with no emotional investment.<br /><br />when anne reads the letter from wentworth, it is as if she is reading a grocery list.<br /><br />contrast this to the 1995 version, where the viewer feels anne's joy at her second chance. we are there with her as she reads the letter. the director had both actors reading the letter and you hear both their voices. wentworth is full of frustration, passion and hope, while anne's is at first incredulous then evolves in to joy.<br /><br />this production has more scenes after the revelation, probably because it was needed to explain to the viewer what just happened. the 1995 version didn't need to explain, we knew and rejoiced for the characters the only thing this production has in it's favor is it kept the mrs. smith sub plot intact, while the 1995 version did not.<br /><br />the 1995 version however did include part of austen's original ending. the scene where wentworth is commissioned by the admiral to find out if anne and mr. elliot will want to move back to her house (which he & mrs. croft are renting) after they marry. <br /><br />this is a production to avoid at all costs.
