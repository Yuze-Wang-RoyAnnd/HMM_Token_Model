the vhs cover for the evil below makes it look like a cool underwater horror flick. sadly it's closer to a boring adventure flick and has no real horror elements. it starts off with some divers who get attacked and we see a bit of blood, but that's the only blood in the entire film.<br /><br />the evil below isn't the worst around, but for a horror film it is tediously boring. the acting is decent and to be honest the only thing that keeps you watching is the developing romance between the two leads. there's a few nightmare sequences where it just seems like the director didn't know what to do. i manged to sit through it all (just about) but i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. horror fans might want a copy for the cool vhs cover, but it's best left at that.
