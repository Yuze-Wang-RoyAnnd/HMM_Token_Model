the first season of bones is playing in finland and i can't believe the amount of bullshit that this show puts on - the characters are shallow, poorly directed and clumsy.<br /><br />it's a poor mans' csi. or actually, csi without coherent plot. although bones has potential, it fails due to the lacking of the director who hasn't been able to extract the essence of the show from the actors. it's actually sad to see a show throw it all away when it could had been a descent show with just a pinch more thought. from the start you get the feeling how awkward the acting is.<br /><br />long story short - don't waste your time on bones.
