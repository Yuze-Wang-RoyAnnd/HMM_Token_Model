mgm hodgepodge of jimmy durante throwing a big party for everybody in hollywood. no major stars show up--we get the three stooges, laurel & hardy, durante and lupe velez. i didn't recognize anyone else--they were probably unknowns (for good reason). the movie contains annoyingly unfunny jokes and some truly dreadful songs and choreography. the only things that save this from being a total disaster are laurel & hardy's "battle" with lupe velez and a wonderful color disney cartoon called "the hot chocolate soldier". it's a beautiful, very colorful cartoon that gives the movie a huge boost. otherwise, the movie is a colossal bore. there's no director credited--what does that tell you?
