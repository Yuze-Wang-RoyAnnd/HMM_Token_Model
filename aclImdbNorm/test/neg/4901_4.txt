inspired by a true story tale is full of 1970's feeling but is disjointed in the telling. this is the tale of a black college swimmer who ends up in phillie at a closing rec center in a bad neighborhood and somehow puts together a swim team. the film staggers around blindly for the first half hour until terrence howard, as our hero, gets the kids into the pool.it picks up at that point by becoming somewhat engaging, though it still staggers about. there is a good story in this and its clear why howard and bernie mac took part in it, but the script is poor and most of the direction seems intent on making it feel like 197something instead of making us feel anything for the story.<br /><br />not the disaster that some reviews made it out to be, it instead suffers by all of the recent sport true stories-coach carter, invincible, glory road, etc, which at least knew that you have to at least work with the story to make a movie as opposed to just letting the audience suffer because "its true".
