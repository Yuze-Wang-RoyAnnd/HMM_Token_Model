i loved this movie when i was a teenager. loved it. it hasn't grown up with me, though. maybe that's because it's a melodramatic load of old rubbish, full of macho posturing, cheesy dialogue, overwrought slo-mo and characters saying 'goddammit' a lot. the lumpy narrative blobs gracelessly from one character to another, one plot strand to another, without ever bringing it all together, and it doesn't help that william baldwin's mono-expression of a performance is wet enough to put out every fire in the movie's overlong runtime. robert deniro and donald sutherland are worth watching, but no one's really at the top of their game here, and the women folk get particularly short thrift. the only real impact comes from the impressive firefighting sequences, and hans zimmer's majestic score, which remains one of my all-time favourites.
