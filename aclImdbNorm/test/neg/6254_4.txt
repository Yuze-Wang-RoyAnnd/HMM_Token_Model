cheerleader massacre (2003)<br /><br />starring: tamie sheffield, charity rahmer, erin byron, leonard johnson, e. eddie edwards, samantha phillips, gigi erneta, april flowers, nikki fritz, tylo tyler, brad beck, summer williams, brinke stevens, melissa brasselle.<br /><br />plot: a group of cheerleaders, along with their coach and three guys, are on their way to a game when suddenly their van breaks down and they take refuge in a nearby cabin. soon, they drink, have sex, and are brutally murdered one by one by an unseen killer.<br /><br />the good: a few laughs, surprising identity of the killer, a brinke stevens cameo, my favorite scene from the slumber party massacre used as a flashback. <br /><br />the bad: i was excited about this film, i loved all three slumber party massacre's because they were just so fun, and i was expecting a lot from this "slumber party/sorority house massacre with scream tones), but it just sucked! they overdid it on the "we're cheesy but proud" thing and basically made soft-core porn but with a good who-dun-it.<br /><br />**
