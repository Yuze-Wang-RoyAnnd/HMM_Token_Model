lots of flames, thousands of extras in battle scenes, lots of beautiful sets. i don't think the plot supported such a vast expenditure. the story could have been told far more effectively and have been more valid, psychologically if there weren't so much macho bombast in the production. chinese movies tend to be this way, in my experience. and i think this detracts from the film.
