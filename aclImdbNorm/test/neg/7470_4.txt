this film was nothing more than exploitative gay cheesecake. it was not an "art" movie; just an excuse to show several gratuitous, exploitative, over-the-top scenes with extensive male genital nudity. there was a locker room scene involving over a dozen naked men. the camera zooms in on the men's asses and penises as they are portrayed for several minutes with their dicks in full screen view. there are several scenes in this film showing penis after penis. it gets redundant real fast and makes it impossible to take this film seriously. i was wondering if i was watching a playgirl video by mistake. if these same scenes were filmed using women (ex: totally naked and showing their vaginas repeatedly) it would be quickly dismissed as just softcore porn and an excuse to show a lot of eye candy...which is all that this film is. any artistic merit got flushed down the drain of the gay ghetto mentality. the themes of class distinction, homosexuality, longing-desire, etc. were simple and superficial; no more developed than what one would expect from a first year philosophy student. just cut to the chase and rent a gay porn instead.
