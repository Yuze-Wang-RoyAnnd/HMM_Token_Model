i saw hurlyburly on broadway and liked it a great deal. i don't know what happened with the film version, because it was dreadful. perhaps some dialogue that works on stage just sounds incoherent on screen. anyway, i couldn't wait for this film to be over. the acting is universally over the top. only kevin spacey has it together, and he seems like he knows he's in a bad movie and can't wait to get out.
