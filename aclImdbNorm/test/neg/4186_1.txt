my friends and i have often joked about movies being in real-time. but this movie really is... they will literally show 4 minutes strait of nothing but a guy digging in the dirt with his hands. it has no-plot, and an incredible amount of gratuitous screaming. i honestly don't believe that it won an award for it's alleged suspense. if you are like me and saw the first film and loved it for it's horrible acting, accidentally hilarious one liners, and all-around low budget"ness", it won't matter; this is so bad it's bad memories might even rub off and taint any good memories you have of the original. you would be more entertained if you were staring at a blank screen.
