writer-director emilio estevez shows a definite lack of talent here with this un-redeemable, supposed comedy. the script is completely hopeless, let alone the fact that it is unoriginal and badly worked. the comedy just does not work. when estevez isn't using poor taste sex jokes, he is borrowing used gags and re-doing them very poorly. you would think the teaming of estevez and brother charlie sheen would be cool...but...it isn't.<br /><br />the entire cast is uninspired and unfunny, never managing to raise a laugh, and barely coaxing a smile from their audience. do yourself a favour and leave this one on the video shelf.<br /><br />thursday, june 25, 1992 - video
