for me it's a case you'll never understand if you didn't live it.. so read this to know why would i have such unlimited anger..<br /><br />i heard a lot about (bruce lee).. my father loved him.. my mother who hates any minor shot of violence loved him ! and how she talks till now about his " the big boss" aka "fists of fury" , and the experience of watching it at the egyptian movies 1973 with all the gigantic success.. further to that i watched a real good movie about him (dragon: the bruce lee story - 1993).. so i found myself crying : where are your movies bruce ?!! <br /><br />i went to the video store.. and it was dumb move.. (you'll know why !).. and waw.. i found a lot of bruce lee movies.. i selected one named (bruce lee in new guinea) <br /><br />i did it to myself and watched that one.. oh god please forgive your servant.. i harmed myself but with no intended decision.. i wouldn't do it if i knew its evil damaging !! its mythical level of hideousness !! <br /><br />after that i didn't understand at all what's the big fuss about bruce lee as a great immortal star ???.. why anybody would care whether he is here or there.. this hero (whom i've watched !) is not that gifted and not that genius and of course is not that sexy ??? <br /><br />until my father saw this star and he asked me to pause at any of his close ups and after he examined his face a little.. he told me in a very definitive way "this is not bruce lee" ! so i became too confused to ask : who's this silly guy anyway ??!! <br /><br />it was 2001.. 2 years after my first entry to the imdb database.. therefore i tended to it immediately to know who the hell is that man.. and i discovered the truth.. he isn't bruce lee.. no my dear friends.. he is bruce li !!! <br /><br />and what a huge.. so huge difference !! i just want to know who can love that bad clone ?? or god forbid .. love his repulsive movies.. i watched 2 of them and couldn't bear finishing the third ! <br /><br />after that i ignored all our video stores because its cheap cunning (writing on the posters that this is bruce lee !??).. and i've got the original.. the one and only bruce lee who is such a great star indeed and oh boy he certainly had the right to immortality.. and no less.
