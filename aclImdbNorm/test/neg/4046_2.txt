this movie was just so utterly horrible that i couldn't get through the entire thing without turning it off, it was just that bad! when i was watching it i kept thinking it looked like some really cheap film made back in the 60's or something with those terrible looking special effects, but then i realized that this was just made in 2001. <br /><br />the dialog and the acting were really very horrible and the plot was almost non-existent. i didn't think anyone would go back to making films that look so cheap and old, i'm not sure if they did that on purpose or if they really didn't have any budget for this movie at all. it really looks like it was shot on someone's camcorder at a local person's house or something. maybe they thought they were being retro or something but it just comes off looking really cheesy.<br /><br />i really don't know how anyone could ever actually enjoy watching this.<br /><br />0 out of 5 *'s.
