impressive vision indeed, and some hot chicks with swords flying around, oh and those hypnotic chinese violins too... let me think, "crouching tiger, hidden dragon"?<br /><br />i kinda liked cthd, with its down-to-earth simplicity and well developed characters, that still left enough room for you to enjoy the vision without having to think about the deeepaa meaning of it.<br /><br />"hero" on the other hand is painfully pretentious and demanding both visually and conceptually. the larger-than-life moral was horrible. i mean, sacrifice your life, sacrifice your beliefs, sacrifice your love so that your mighty nation can succeed???? wtf??<br /><br />no, thanks.<br /><br />but, hay, mao and g.w.b. would be proud!<br /><br />viva
