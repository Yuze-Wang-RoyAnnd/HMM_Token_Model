like the other guy said it sux , you can count the words that have been said in that entire movie on one of your hands, too nudity , she got naked like 7 or 8 times in a 1 and a half , well past the nudity you'll find a porno behind that film , he f**ked her all movie long, bad acting, bad story,bad language, carmen was swearing all movie long , so you get out of that movie, pornografic scenes and dirty language, a lot of gaps in the movie, a big silence every now and then the only good thing in that movie is the beautiful places were it has been shot, otherwise it's an hour and a half of your life that you'll gonna waste so if u gonna watch that movie good luck it really sux
