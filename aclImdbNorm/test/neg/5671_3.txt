i won't say the show is all bad, because there are some funny parts, like spencer, and a few random incidents. but other than that, let's face it, it's just another dry sitcom that kids are buying into.<br /><br />miranda cosgrove was cute and funny as megan on drake and josh. honestly, she is mediocre in icarly and is just not as funny as she tries to be. the actress who plays sam seems to be half-asleep most of the time, and her antics are so clich'ed that i would think of them. they're not funny, just annoying. and freddie is okay, but not that interesting.<br /><br />of course, the situations are unrealistic, but it's not all bad. some are bothersome, though. here are a few: <br /><br />1. the girls are 14, and have a web show that gives away too much personal information, with a weekly audience of 27,000(wtf), with little to no advertising, and they can still go on about their lives not being attacked by crazy people <br /><br />2.their web show gets too much praise ($100,000 yearly to advertise sneakers, a free trip to japan, plain white ts performance, and so on). honestly, anyone over the age of 6 would not find their "comedy" entertaining.<br /><br />3. how is it that they are so "average", yet they own a three story loft, spencer does hardly anything and can still afford many basic luxuries, and they have all the equipment for a web show? 4. all of the adults are idiots. all of them.<br /><br />5. no 5 foot high girl, no matter how obnoxious and tenacious, can take down trained cops, unless she's muscular. sam is skinny and petite.<br /><br />6. no one can fall down 9 stories in an elevator and live.<br /><br />7. kids can handle finding out about criminals better than cops.<br /><br />the show is stupid. really, it seems harmless, but making kids think that they can be obnoxious to their elders, live alone in seattle when they're only 14 with an irresponsible moron, and give out personal information is just wrong.<br /><br />i'm disappointed to say that my cousin, who is 3, enjoys the show. what happened to the cartoons when i was her age?
