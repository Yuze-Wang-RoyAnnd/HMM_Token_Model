a sadly predictable, clich'ed story about a woman who was no better than she should have been. sadly, too, the screenplay is by the once-great experimental novelist john dos passos, from an original by french exotic potboiler pierre louys. this time marlene dietrich is concha, a manipulative, cold-hearted spanish beauty. don pasqual (lionel atwill) raises her from the cigarette factory, but she ditches him. he warns his tall young friend antonio (cesar romero) against her, but to no avail. a duel ensues, concha reproaches pasqualito for trying to kill the only man she ever cared for, so he doesn't: he points his pistol at the sky, but antonio shoots him. but instead of going off to paris with the young victor, she goes back to the man who would have died for her. with an unexpected bit by edward everett horton as a spanish governor. dietrich plays the part of a spanish woman by moving constantly, twisting at the waist and posturing and then twisting back, flouncing, tossing her head, and so forth. and she makes faces, and has a curl in the middle of her forehead. the photography is strangely crowded: no outdoor scene can be shot except through a tangle of bare trees, no interior scene can be shot without so much busy detail that it's almost impossible to follow people moving across a room, no consecutive scene of dietrich can be shot without a major wardrobe change. the carnival scenes are so full of confetti and streamers it's almost like an underwater scene in the sargasso sea.
