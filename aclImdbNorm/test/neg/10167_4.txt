it's long time that i and my wife didn't see such a boring thriller. it's definitively not a gripping story and it is paced so slowly that we nearly fell asleep. this could be instead a very low budget tv crime series. there are some ridiculous scenes like the one where mafia boss pirano wants to see the jury lady in a red clothes or another mafioso cannot stop to think about her and so on. okay perhaps this should have been a romantic thriller but believe me you really don't miss anything. we gave 4/10.
