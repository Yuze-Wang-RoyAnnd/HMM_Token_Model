'illuminata' has expanded the limits of john turturro's mediocrity from second rate actor to third rate director, writer and producer. this film was dreadful. it is disjointed and flits from scene to scene with little flow or meaning relevant to the main story line.<br /><br />we are served with a smorgasbord of fragmented scenes, each a non sequitur to all the others. the only thread that seems to run through them is that they occur in the lives of the members of the same theatre repertory company. the few scenes that do matter to the plot are so convoluted that you frequently can't tell if the dialogue is from the story or the actors running their lines for the play within the story. <br /><br />if this story were a person it would be a schizophrenic with mulitple personality disorder. it couldn't decide if it was a drama, a romance, a comedy, a tragedy, a sex farce, or a parody of theatre. it came closest to being bearable as a sex farce.<br /><br /> turturro was lifeless and impassive as tuccio, supposedly a complex and passionate writer whose play gets its big chance when the currently running show needs to be cancelled due to the illness of the lead actor. susan sarandon gave a good performance as the aging actress trying to seduce tuccio for a role. unfortunately, she found it necessary to go topless which only goes to illustrate that the hardware of aging sex symbols is much better left to the imagination. christoher walkin gave a delightful performance as the uppity theatre critic who makes impassioned overtures to a member of the cast. beverly d'angelo and ben gazzara also had minor roles.<br /><br />i gave this film a 2. other than walken's vignette, there is really not much to recommend it except that the puppets used in the opening and closing credits were phenomenally lifelike and beautiful. avoid this movie like the plague that it is.<br /><br />
