who the heck is responsible for this terrible mangling of one of my favorite books? this is just terrible. terrible acting, terrible script. the story isn't even close to its old self - and what were they thinking? robin williams, for gosh's sake! this really defies description. don't see this. seriously, don't. not even for laughs. especially not if you're a fan of the book. this might just be the worst movie adaptation ever - everything is disjointed and scrambled - the characters which are important in order to understand the sequence of events are seriously marginalized, and every potentially interesting location from the book has been changed (example: vienna - new york) into something profoundly uninteresting.<br /><br />for those who haven't read the book - it's basically a fictional biography about a writer growing up, exploring his writing and so on. his mother writes an autobiography which is hailed (despite her protests) as a sort of feminist manifesto. the book is well-written, engaging, and long. its prose is simply beautiful.<br /><br />this movie, on the other hand, is about robin williams once again telling us to seize the day.
