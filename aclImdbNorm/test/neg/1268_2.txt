there are many so-called anti-war/anti-govt. policy films around now which start off as a mea culpa and end with 'our poor boys are getting hell out there so let the world sympathise with them, it's not their fault' - kind of stuff. i was half afraid that this would be another in that style even if it treated another subject/aspect of the same subject. i nearly didn't go and see it; for that matter, i almost did not write this review. what did we get here? an egyptian gets taken off to a secret off-shore torture centre, on u.s. orders, but it is another egyptian who has to do the torturing, not an american: 'see, we americans have clean hands,' and the egyptians are a bad lot anyway so let them harm their own. oh, and the goody had to be an american with a conscience: indeed many americans have them, but here the concept was misplaced. yes, we all know it is called extraordinary rendition and it began in clinton's time and it is now used for reasons well beyond control. otherwise it was very hackneyed and nervous about really condemning the u.s. for being party to torture; as if the makers were afraid to go the whole way for fear of being slanged as unpatriotic or whatever (take a look at the message board! anyone apologising gets a faceful of heavy verbal artillery). torture is a terrible thing, whether one is guilty or not; in the 18th century, frederickii, king of prussia, abolished it for convicted murderers - though i must say, a life sentence for a child molester is far less than what i want to see. all right, what about torture? this film did not really bring out its horror and hopelessness enough. when you are under torture,(now come the capitals for emphasis, i am not shouting) you will say anything, even if it is not true, even if you have not done the thing you are accused of, in the vain hope that if you say amen to whatever they are peddling, it will stop. it does not, but you never learn and you keep on saying that you did whatever it is they say you did, tho' you did'nt. another thing the film did not bring out enough was that torture is exceedingly, indescribably humiliating, and that feeling stays with you your whole life. it somehow changes people inside. how do i know all that? don't ask.<br /><br />re-edit: two things: the arabic that was used in the film was not the egyptian dialect. it's sort of worse than setting a film in new zealand with locals as the characters and everyone has american accents. also, the dreadful little preacher who was inciting his ignorant audience to violence was telling them things unknown to that religion, which should have been brought out. nor was it anywhere explained that any nincompoop can become a mullah/imam; he doesn't need any special qualifications, and that is a hiatus which needs to be put right: many are acceptable because of their fundamentalist views and tne u.s.a.'s great ally, saudi arabia, finances so many of them. many thanks for this space.
