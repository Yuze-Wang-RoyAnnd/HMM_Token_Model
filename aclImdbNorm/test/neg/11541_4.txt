i appeared as an extra and was on location as a journalist covering "the dain curse". my involvement was during the segments of this film shot in jim thorpe, pa. (jim thorpe was also one of the locations of the 1969 film "the molly maguires"). i reported the 'action' in the emmaus free press newspaper where i was editor 1978-80 (the paper ceased publication int he 1990s). i recall the excellent attention to detail of the period costumes, automobiles, etc. the modern asphalted streets of jim thorpe were covered with gravel to mimic a 1920s rural town of the south. at the time, i interviewed the producer and spoke briefly with the director during a set change break; i did not get to interview james coburn which was always a great disappointment to me. as an aside, i appear briefly in one of the street scenes wearing a snap- brim hat and a tweed jacket. the producer asked me to "jump in" and it was a real thrill. i still have a collection of black and white stills i took of the production work for the newspaper. someday, they may be of interest to film/television historians.--lou varricchio
