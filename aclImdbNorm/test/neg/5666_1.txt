this show is just plain awful. i liked to watch drake and josh, which was great, and before that the amanda show, also funny, but this is just awful. in my opinion watching this felt like watching those --- movies from seltzberg, painful and uncleaver. this is about 3 dumb@$$ kids who make a crappy web-show (while stealing the hole ithing) while their retarded brother is making sculptures (he has no life). the cast is crap, megan from drake and josh is carly (ahhhhhh!)a ugly b!tch is sam and some kid they pulled off the street plays fred. all i saw from this (ugg) are random "jokes" that include the brother making a clay-mation film, he also played an arcade game called pac-rat (genious), sam and carly being retards on their web show, and fred being a dork. the only episode a saw (cant remember the title) where fred gets bad luck by not forewarding an email.i find videos on youtube funnier than this junk. and why the hell do they get youtube jack@$$ fred, get avgn to cancel the show with his potty mouth. just skip this show.
