this movie is just crap, i cant put it differently. since the very beginning one knows is going to be crap. <br /><br />the story, dialogue, acting, special effects, make-up, pretty much everything sucks. i like vampire movies and i know they will never be oscar winning movies but this one is not even worth seeing, i can't believe how somebody produced this thing.<br /><br />it's not even about vampires, it's more about a dream/reality experience. the development of the movie is incoherent, the motivation of the characters is... doesn't exist, everything seems like a big joke. maybe that's what they tried to do, but i sincerely doubt it. i wish i knew what they tried to pull but it just backfired, it's definitely one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life (and i've seen many bad movies, but nothing compared to this) please, make yourselves a favor and do not watch this. <br /><br />p.s. it's also full of clich'es! p.s. 2 bad script, bad directing, bad cinematography. p.s. 3 i bothered commenting on this as a favor to everyone.
