this film has been lauded to the point of the ridiculous. "american movie" is a boring documentary about a boring person so ordinary you'll find equivalents on just about every corner in america. it takes a long, hard look at a guy who's failed at just about everything in the interest of making an independent movie..or two. were his failures for other than his own selfish pursuits or were they in the name of real art, the movie might have had a chance. america has an abundance of better stories to be told. this one should be flushed and many critics have good reason to be ashamed. two thumbs up indeed!
