i made the mistake of watching "dark star" (1974) late one night many years ago. it was one of the stupidest movies that i have ever watched:<br /><br />1. bad acting.<br /><br />2. bad writing.<br /><br />3. scientifically stupid plot. (destroying an entire planet because its orbit is unstable or in the way will only make matters worse: instead of having one large, easily avoidable object, you'll have thousands of smaller, but equally lethal and more difficult objects to track.)<br /><br />4. completely unrealistic characters. a painted beach ball as a space alien? the writers must have been doing too many drugs.<br /><br />not surprisingly, the majority of actors that starred in "dark star" never did anything else. of those that did do anything else, the majority never acted again after dark star. therefore, having dark star on one's acting resume was a death star to one's acting career!
