after a very scary, crude opening which gives you that creepy "chainsaw massacre"-feeling, everything falls apart.<br /><br />spoiler alert: as soon as the two fbi-officers start jabbing, you know they are the real killers. anyone who have seen enough of these "fooled-ya"-movies can figure this out.<br /><br />this movie is mader with one thing in mind: to depict brutal murders. why, then, is not the little girl tortured and murdered as well? will this be next for us movie-goers? the torture and abuse of children? whats wrong with you people? lynch is truly has a disgusting, ugly mind.
