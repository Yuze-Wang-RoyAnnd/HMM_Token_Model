i bought this video on a throw-out table at the video store expecting a good cast in what was touted as an award-winning brit sex comedy. i guess i should have read the finer print. i rarely write a panning review, but here goes.<br /><br />these actors in gay roles really play games with your memories of a lot of far more worthy films. this comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors, the theatre-going public and of all the nice films that have contributed to their reputations.<br /><br />i repeat: is the joke about trashing the actors' other highly respectable on-screen personae with this scurrilously trashy flick? can the reference to the austen classics 'pride and prejudice' and 'sense and sensibility' be anything else? how much of a political statement was it to produce this melodrama using these stars? are we meant to simply take it as a lay-down misere that all actors are gay and thus letting their on-screen roleplay affect our lifestyles is accepting their private homosexual dealings in our faces, too? i'm sorry, but i don't think so. i say no to this one.
