what exactly is the point of pretending to "con" people out of things like ski passes and pizza? i fail to see a point. i'd not clever or original and it strikes me as being extremely pointless. <br /><br />skyler stone doesn't seem to be a very down-to-earth or even a nice guy. he has very little charisma and just about anyone could do what he does in this show. <br /><br />the worse thing about this piece of crap, is the fact that a lot of the phone calls are reenacted, so not only are they apparently conning the poor people on the other end of the phone, but they are also conning the audience who don't have enough time to read the "disclaimed" that flickers across the screen for about half a second at the beginning at the end of the show!<br /><br />not only that but he also claims this is how he lives his whole life. what an lie. no one could live their lives like this and the fact he says this is not only yet another con to get his show watched, but it's also one of the most fabricated, blatant pieces of bull$hit i've ever heard. this guy is an @$$!<br /><br />what makes them think that going to all the trouble of, for example, write and record a song, get someone to pain a huge picture of you and two mates, get dance lessons and actually travel to a ski resort is actually worth only getting free ski passes and some food for free? what is the point of that? it's an awful lot of trouble to go to just for a few ski passes and a bit of snow. <br /><br />as far as "comedy" goes, this is bottom of the barrel stuff.
