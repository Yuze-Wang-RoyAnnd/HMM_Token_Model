this movie is awful. it creates characters not in the book, and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes. including an obnoxious little jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl. not to mention the yiddish speaking elves. the book was a simple story about belief, and this movie is a dark, ugly, and needlessly scary movie about nothing.<br /><br />the animation is superb, but the story has been ruined by hollywood.<br /><br />the good thing is that this movie will take a bath in the box office and maybe producers will learn to keep from tampering with a story that needs no improvement. hanks was overdone and i don't see why there couldn't have been other actors' voices be used.
