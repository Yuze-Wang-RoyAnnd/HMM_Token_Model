i'm a pretty tolerable guy, when it comes to movies, even b movies. i routinely watch some b movies for fun, and they can range from surprisingly good, to just downright awful. i usually set my expectations really low before watching these types of movies, and even after doing that, descent was just downright awful. i really didn't mind that they were ripping off the core to some extent, but they did absolutely nothing interesting with the material. some scientists are worried about the earth's seismic activity, and must travel into the depths of the earth in order to stabilize the mantel. so what we get is a monotonously long set-up in which two dueling scientists played by luke perry and rick roberts have to work together on a top secret mission, named project deep. the man in charge, general fielding played by michael dorn, is secretly withholding vital information from assistant marsha crawford, played by mimi kuzyk. rounding out the cast is natalie brown who plays jen, a mission specialist who created the "mole" a drill which is used plunge into the depths of the earth.<br /><br />other than some pretty good special effects, and set designs, nothing about descent is worthwhile. the movie starts out fairly entertaining, but it gets bogged down quickly in a tiresome story about uncontrollable seismic activity, which has been done to death in other movies such as the core. descent also has a poor script, with useless, forgettable dialog between the characters. to make matters worse, there is literally no action, no real threat or danger. the attempts at comic relief are painfully unfunny. the plot has gaping holes and some of the subplots are left untied at the end leaving a bad taste in your mouth. <br /><br />in closing this movie was just a cheap way for everyone involved to get a paycheck. there was no thought behind this movie, no innovation, it's just there. other than some nice looking special effects, and set designs, this movie fails on every other level. the story is from the garbage can of hollywood, and the characters are uninteresting to boot. descent will simply descend you into boredom, and frustration. avoid at all costs.
