i saw grande ecole at its world premiere on the rotterdam film festival. i had no idea what i was entering and if i'd had any idea i wouldn't have entered. this is the most pretentious film i've seen for a long time. it tries to be provocative, yet deep, with its full frontal homosexual sex scenes - it doesn't succeed! it's nothing but another bad excuse of showing naked persons on the big screen. 4/10
