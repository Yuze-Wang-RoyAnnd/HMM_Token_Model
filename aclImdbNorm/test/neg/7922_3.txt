how could they take such a beautifully animated gem like don bluth's all dogs go to heaven and bastardize it with a charmless, cheesy, uninspired sequel. the haunting music and delightful characters are gone, now replaced with tacky animation and an unimaginative plot.<br /><br />the pros: charlie sheen is sometimes fun as charlie, but he lacks the charming tough guy attitude that brought him to life by burt reynolds. i did particularly enjoy the songs "i will always be with you" and "it's too heavenly here".<br /><br />the cons: there seems to be no connection between this and the original. in the beginning charlie is chums with carface, but wait a minute. isn't this the same character who was responsible for charlie's murder and kidnapped the sweet little orphan he loved? i guess that all changes in heaven but why isn't anne-marie even mentioned? if itchy makes it to heaven, wouldn't flo and killer make it too? what is with annabelle the whippet's voice? in the original it sounded feminine and charming and in the sequel it sounds like a whiny, bitchy, parrot. the new characters aren't all that great (except sasha). and the animation is better compared to a generic saturday morning cartoon. the constant cartoony "humor" is flat and unfunny and the "heart" just doesn't work when compare to the original, which had such a moving unsubtle touch that makes me cry every time.<br /><br />all dogs go to heaven is one of my all-time favorite films. how don bluth allowed this sequel to be made is beyond me.<br /><br />bottom line: not all sequels go to heaven.
