intended as light entertainment, this film is indeed successful as such during its first half, but then succumbs to a rapidly foundering script that drops it down. harry (judd nelson), a "reformed" burglar, and daphne (gina gershon), an aspiring actress, are employed as live window mannequins at a department store where one evening they are late in leaving and are locked within, whereupon they witness, from their less than protective glass observation point, an apparent homicide occurring on the street. the ostensible murderer, miles raymond (nick mancuso), a local sculptor, returns the following day to observe the mannequins since he realizes that they are the only possible witnesses to the prior night's violent event and, when one of the posing pair "flinches", the fun begins. daphne and harry report their observations at a local police station, but when the detective taking a crime report remembers harry's criminal background, he becomes cynical. there are a great many ways in which a film can become hackneyed, and this one manages to utilize most of them, including an obligatory slow motion bedroom scene of passion. a low budget affair shot in vancouver, even police procedural aspects are displayed by rote. the always capable gershon tries to make something of her role, but mancuso is incredibly histrionic, bizarrely so, as he attacks his lines with an obvious loose rein. although the film sags into nonsense, cinematographer glen macpherson prefers to not follow suit, as he sets up with camera and lighting some splendidly realised compositions that a viewer may focus upon while ignoring plot holes and witless dialogue. a well-crafted score, appropriately based upon the action, is contributed by hal beckett. the mentioned dialogue is initially somewhat fresh and delivered well in a bantering manner by nelson and gershon, but in a subsequent context of flawed continuity and logic, predictability takes over. the direction reflects a lack of original ideas or point of view, and post-production flaws set the work back farther than should be expected for a basic thriller.
