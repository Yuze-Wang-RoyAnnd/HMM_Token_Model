the main premise for this movie is every woman's fantasy: a vagina that kills and eats men. well at least it is a fantasy for every woman who has ever had a fight against a man. what's that, 99.9999% of women? but don't worry it's not a gory kind of eating of men. it's more like a comical slurping them in, like a drain plug. there's no blood or parts left behind. so for blood, guts & gore fans, forget about this film, not much gore here.<br /><br />the two main characters of the film are somewhat unrealistic. helen is a good girl who becomes a prostitute. meanwhile, dennis is a nice guy who stalks helen.<br /><br />the story is already a little silly at this point, but then they throw in two more equally silly sub-stories that just send this movie into the bad b-movie territory. the first new sub-story is about dennis finding new love with a pair of conjoined twins; and then eventually murdering one of them, and becoming a fugitive bank-robber. the second new sub-story is about helen finding new love with a nice policeman who rescued her from a prostitution-related bad date, and decided he wanted to marry her. dennis and helen eventually meet up again at the end of movie in totally unbelievable circumstances, and magically helen's murderous vagina is cured!
