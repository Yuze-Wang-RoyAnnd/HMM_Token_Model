the plot for black mama white mama, revolves around two female inmates, at a women's prison in the phillipines. one black, and one white. these two women, are thrown together in the prison. pam grier is lee daniels lee is incarcerated in the hellish women's prison, for dancing as a harem girl. <br /><br />lee's boyfriend owes her part of his profits, from his drug-dealing activities. lee is mainly interested in breaking out of the prison to get hold of her beau's drug money, so that she can leave the phillipines and assume a better life. margaret markov plays karen brent, a white women from a privileged background, who is also a revolutionary. karen has joined a group of revolutionaries, determined to change the corrupt phillipino political system. she's captured by phillipino authorities, and held as a political prisoner.<br /><br />the story-line takes-off, when karen and lee break out of the prison they were in together. the two of them also happened to be chained together at the wrist. as they flee, they also fight with each other, because they have different goals to pursue. naturally, they hate being chained together. but they also realize that they must put aside their differences, to help each other survive while they evade capture.<br /><br />if this film seems very similar to the big bird cage, it's because much of the cast in the two films is the same, as well as their location in the phillipines. roger corman, has always had a consistent stable of actors, that he used in all of his 70s b movies. besides pam grier, sid haig, roberta collins, claudia jennings, betty anne rees, and william smith, were also among the many actors that were frequently cast, in corman's aip films.<br /><br />like the big bird cage, black mama white mama, relies on too much gory violence to be palatable. pam grier conveys her usual tough chick persona in this film, and shows her competence as a female action heroine. margaret markov is less effect, in her portrayal of the revolutionary karen. she just seems to fragile and well-coiffed, to be a dedicated political guerrilla. except for sid haig, as the colorful ruben, the rest of the cast is forgettable.<br /><br />this film has little entertainment value, unless excessive, heinous acts of violence are your thing. only the performances by pam grier and sig haig, make this film worth watching.
