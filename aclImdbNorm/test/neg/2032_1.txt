this was the most uninteresting horror flick i have seen to date. the premise is glaringly forgotten after about 1 minute. the acting is terrible. the scariest thing about this movie is when the two guys kiss, yuck! what were the film festival judges thinking when they gave this garbage a 'best film' notation? the only reasons i didn't turn this movie off were to see what not to do as a filmmaker, and if the paper-thin plot line could really keep going on as is was. i was not disappointed by this latter notion. there wasn't even a single bit of nudity or gore to keep the kiddies interested! also, i thought it was tacky to use about 3 minutes of "resident evil 2" in the movie... was that supposed to be filler? 'cause it was the goriest and most interesting part of the movie.
