i had to watch this one for my canadian cinema course and i was told that it was considered to be the "best canadian film." when i watched this i really did not agree, considering i've seen a lot better ones. i understand that there were canadian themes and messages, but the fact that the characters and the plot were so disconnected with me (as a spectator) it made me not really care what the film was trying to tell me. the plot was too dry. the characters did not have many positive personality traits, but this is to emphasize the messages, not to tick off spectators. this film shows a little about the history of quebec. not a very interesting film; it definitely does not deserve to be put on such a high pedestal.
