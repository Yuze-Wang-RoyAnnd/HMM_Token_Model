i would ward off any temptation to view this movie, it is quite simply dull. the characters are predictable and mindless. the assassin is quite unenigmatic. there is no tension, fun, no style or even a glimmer of originality to be found in this train wreck. and the morass of hollywood clich'e's are stifling. oh, and you have a movie that makes a hero of an ira terrorist. cute. and now i need to speak some more to fill up the ten lines. and a little bit more is that enough? not quite, how about now? no, well further confabulation should do the trick, but the jackal is really not worth ten lines of exposition. the original was great though.
