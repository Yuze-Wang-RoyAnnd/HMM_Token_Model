at beaverview cheerleading camp, the goody-goody two shows lucky ducks cheerleading team must get in cahoots with the 'tough' bad girl cheerleading team of the demons to beat the dastardly falcon team who always seems to win at this camp i guess. this being a typical clich'ed '80's teen (lame) sex comedy who do you think will win? but what the film lacks in originality it more than makes up for it sheer bloody awfulness. oh and insanely bad dance numbers and the obligatory japenese businessmen who want to buy the camp (on the condition that male cheerleader, tommy hamilton, stays with the camp of course). simply awful, forgettable, and sadly has a surprising lack of nudity.<br /><br />where i saw it: hbo comedy <br /><br />my grade: f (yup i did indeed give it to them)
