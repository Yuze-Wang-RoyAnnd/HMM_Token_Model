while this isn't one of miss davies' very worst films, it is pretty bad. and it's sad that in a revisionist fashion, recent imdb raters have deliberately over-inflated the scores on some of her films to make up for her being slighted in the past--or so it seems. for years, conventional wisdom has been that davies was a terrible actress and only got the roles she got because her beau, william randolph hearst, bought her way into hollywood. this certainly is the image created in orson welles' citizen kane. it is true that hearst did use his considerable wealth and clout to build davies' career. with all this money, it's not surprising that she made some excellent films and it isn't surprising that people got snippy due to all the extra attention she got. sleeping with the man who finances your films is bound to get noticed. however, despite this edge, she also made a decent number of bad films and i think we really need balance when it comes to the scores of her movies. after all, no rational person could believe that as of today (1/5/08), peg o' my heart and two other davies films recently shown on turner classic movies (the florodora girl and marianne) deserved the exceptionally high scores--ranking them higher than such films as high noon, ben hur, the best years of our lives and all quiet on the western front!! in fact, marianne would now rank as the fifth best movie ever according to imdb with a score of 8.8!!! considering most people out there don't even know who marion davies was and most of her movies were financial disasters, this is a serious problem!! however, she was a much better actress than citizen kane implied and initially broke into films before she began sleeping with hearst.<br /><br />what sets peg o' my heart apart from these two other movies, is that marianne and the florodora girl were pleasant little films--while peg o' my heart is in some ways just terrible. much of the reason was the terrible miscasting of marion. while her french accent in marianne was cute, in peg her irish accent just sounded bizarre--not particularly irish. plus, and perhaps i'm mistaken, but her continual use of the word 'ye' makes her sound like she should be doing shakespeare, not a film set in 1933 ireland! also, there was a bizarre insistence that marion should be the consummate multi-talented star--so they had her not just act but dance and sing. the singing actually fit the scripts in some of her films, but here it seemed out of place and seriously detracted from the film. it just seemed like you could almost hear hearst shouting out "see--she is a great actress---look at her sing and dance". sadly, marion just looked uncomfortable and out of place in many of these scenes. but for me, the biggest problem was the idea of having 36 year-old marion playing such a youthful role. it was obvious that the character she played at the beginning of the film was supposed to be like the ones mary pickford played in the teens and twenties--complete with the pig tails and plucky attitude. miss pickford could carry off these roles even though she, too, wasn't a girl any more. but here, marion had put on a bit of weight and looked at least 30. no offense--she looked fine for her age--but she did not look like a teen! <br /><br />oddly, with the millions that hearts spent on marion's career, he never realized that the most important thing he needed to spend his money on was a good script and one that fit marion's talents. believe me, i have rated several of her films very high (i especially adore show people), but here she just couldn't help but flop--this film was a turkey.
