this movie is trash from the word go. first, it gives an account of a season that took place 16 years ago! who cares? this movie had about as much depth as a bottle cap. it makes a complex person like bob knight into a cartoon character.<br /><br />swearing doesn't bother me, but i'm still amazed that espn showed a movie with more cursing than a kevin smith movie on a basic cable channel. the f-word was dropped at least 20 times before the first commercial break.<br /><br />this movie was terrible and anyone associated with it should be embarrassed. i rate this on the same level as jaws iv - the revenge and everybody wins...2 movies that are in the crapfest hall of fame.
