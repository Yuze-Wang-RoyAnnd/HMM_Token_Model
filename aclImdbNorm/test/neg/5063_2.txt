clossius says that "baltic storm" is banned in sweden. that is not correct! instead you can buy the film almost everywhere, like in gas stations, shopping malls, internet (of course) and so on. often to a very low price because this movie is so bad and nobody wants to see it, despite all the tricks to keep up the interest. the movie only appeals to conspiracy theorists, psychos and other persons living in la-la-land and those who "knows the truth". <br /><br />working on a museum with the estonia disaster as a theme i have meet them all! i have heard about every theory that exists like cocaine-smuggling, weapon-smuggling, biological warfare, nuclear smuggling, red mercury, aliens, the russian- the american- the estonian- the swedish- and the finnish intelligence, often in different combinations.<br /><br />some normal persons have asked why we don't show the film? a question only asked by them who haven't seen this terrible nonsense movie. <br /><br />once again, "baltic storm" is not banned in sweden. it has some entertaining qualities but what a hell is donald sutherland doing in this movie?
