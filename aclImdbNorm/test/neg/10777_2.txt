the title, although singular, will undoubtedly remind real horror fans of tod browning's immortal classic about a troop of circus freaks and how they were misunderstood by the outside world. i can assure you, however, that this "thing" has absolutely nothing to do with "freaks" or even with the art of professional film-making in general. this movie was recommended to me, supposedly because it's raw, disturbing and thought provoking despite the low budget production values. yeah right
