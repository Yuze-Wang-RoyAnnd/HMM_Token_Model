a formulaic story with all the tired cliches. i was shocked that the horrible script became a movie! what a waste! how many original scripts are scattered around without being produced? <br /><br /> at the climax i could predict what will happen in every single shot.<br /><br /> oh, and don't even get me started about the idiotic sexual tension between the gorgeous female cop and the paralyzed cop who can barely move a finger. yeah right. i can buy that. what next? fingers porn?
