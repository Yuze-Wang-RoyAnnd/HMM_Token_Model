i'm not going to lie and say i don't watch the show--i do. but it has a lot, and a lot of flaws. 1) the boarding school is perfect. the drama is at a minimum. everyone is so nice to each other, you know. lets give that a reality check. its impossible that any school is perfect like pca. free laptops for everyone. big dorm rooms. mini fridges. if there was a school like that in real life, almost nobody there would be a virgin for one. two, everyone there is so rich, and its weird how nobody has anything stolen yet. 2) characters really unrealistic. first things first, who in they're right minds talk like they do. they talk like a perfect teenager would. secondly, logan reese(matthew underwood) is an extremely rich boy "hot" teenage boy. my question is, why isn't almost ever girl in that school all over him? he's rich and "hot" now a days all those girls would be after him, even if he was a jerk. also, chase is the most stupidest person ever. he is this shy teenager who claims to not be in love with zoey, and over-reacts to everything that involves zoey. she must be blind not to see him in love with her.<br /><br />come on nick. i know you can do better than that. please..
