after seeing this film, i did not want my money back. i wanted my time back. i wanted that hour and a half back in my life - it was the most amazing, hideous torture to know that i had squandered precious minutes of my life on this dreck. i am scarred for life, and ever since this "film" entered my life i have had trouble sleeping. i am trying to suppress the memories, really i am. . . but they make me want to burn things.<br /><br />
