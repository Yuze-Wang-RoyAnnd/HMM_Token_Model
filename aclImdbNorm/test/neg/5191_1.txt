ewe, the opening screams zero budget. the titles whooshing in look like my grandson was let loose with imovie. the dvd box gives the impression that you'll be treated to the old days of '80s boobie movies. nope! hardly any nudity from a flick that stars traci lords! this movie really did need the nudity too. instead you get a lot of lords perkies pointing through a shirt, however they seem to be activated by hot steam. that's odd, in my world the headlights go on in the cold.<br /><br />the plot is pathetic, the blind guy is just is a joke, and not a funny one. his antics are so forced and predictable. he trips over stuff and you see him bracing for the fall. he needs to work on his physical comedy.<br /><br />most of frostbite's nudity comes from a hot tub scene that looks like it was shot months later and inserted in to get a distributor. and the nudity is not worth it.<br /><br />namoibucks; it's just a matter of time before starbucks sues over that. not even funny. as billy arrives in town for the first time they come across namoi bucks, he comments "wow they have these everywhere." this leads you to believe it's a parody on starbucks, but surprise, behind the counter of this location is namoi herself. apparently she loves coffee so much that the owner of this huge chain decided to work in a tiny cold town.<br /><br />the only thing this movie has going for it is the warren miller snowboarding footage. yep this is all warren's stuff, so if you want to see great action, get a warren miller flick. leave frostbite alone.<br /><br />there is nothing good about this movie. there is no reason to rent it or buy it, and if a friend offers to loan you a copy for free. hit him and end the friendship.
