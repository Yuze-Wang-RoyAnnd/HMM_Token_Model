a moderately interesting start, some pretty scenes in sixteenth-century japan, and a promising idea. but the execution? the comparison that springs to mind after about fifteen minutes is "cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death." really. a specialist in "oriental history" who doesn't speak any japanese, walks on tatami without removing her shoes, and is generally dumb as celery? please. this looks like a student film: the sets are risible, the acting (except, perhaps, for the title character) close to wooden, the plot utterly arbitrary. at least "cannibal women" was funny! this is best watched with someone who knows something about japan, just to watch disbelief repeatedly crawl across their face.
