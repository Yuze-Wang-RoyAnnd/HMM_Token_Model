i have read all of the reviews for this direct to video movie. i can agree that the movie is not "armageddon" or "deep impact" quality. nevertheless, if you are looking for a way to pass ninety minutes or so, then this is a movie that is bearable.<br /><br />i started looking at the film early in the am hours as i was doing some geek stuff. it was very nice, because i was able to switch back and forth between what i was doing and watching the movie, with out missing a beat. it is a predictable movie, and the acting is not up to par for some of the veteran actors (for instance, dennis hopper).<br /><br />but i should point out that i paid only $2 (us) and as the old adage goes: you get what you pay for! if you are looking for some deep meaning movie that will have you have to watching it over and over again, then this is definitely the long video. on the other hand, if you looking for something to pass the time, then there is nothing wrong with tycus (which incidentally was called "comet: final impact" in mexico where i found this video).
