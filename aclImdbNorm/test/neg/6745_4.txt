i speak badly of g.i.j.:t.m. mostly because i think it lacked something that g.i. joe had. yes it had something that g.i. joe didn't have like celebrity cameos by don johnson, and burgess meredith but i think g.i. joe: the movie lacked the passion for the characters that the g.i. joe tv series had. most of the voice over artists really sounded like they were dead pan and they were going to die at anytime now. it's a good movie but i wouldn't say that it was the greatest movie in the world i.m.h.o. :)<br /><br />although violence is what g.i. joe was built on i'd say that serpentor striking duke in his chest wasn't the very best way for charlie adler's character to go out. neither was seeing golobulus remind cobra commander why he was chosen to lead the cobra forces and then being horribly mutated after he failed to deliver what cobra-la felt was rightfully theirs.<br /><br />it wasn't the best way for the g.i. joe series to go out but it's better than nothing. :)
