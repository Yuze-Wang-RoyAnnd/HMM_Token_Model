sorry about that. but if you have seen this "epic", you will obviously know of the utter disregard for the actual text of the bible. now, i'm not exactly the next in line for sainthood, but i do know the basics. and the basics were this. god wanted to wipe everyone of the face of the earth because he believed they have been corrupted to the point of no return. he chose noah, the diamond in the rough, and his family to be spared due to their uncorrupted ways. noah builds an ark as instructed by god to house he, his family, and two of every creature while he floods the rest of the planet. those are the basics. in this movie, you have other people roaming around the seas such as peddlers and pirates. but i thought that everyone was wiped out. i guess the executives at nbc have never been to church. there are other inaccuracies, i'm told, but being the average joe, i have no idea what they are. sorry. back to the movie, it was inaccurate, as stated before, the acting stunk, but some of the effects were good, i'll give it that. but as a whole, i've seen a better and more tasteful rendition of the story done as a little scene on the simpsons. god help the nbc executives come judgement day. 3/10
