my expectations were high after seeing the trailer. they were even higher when i saw the movie had the same director as independance day and godzilla. the special effects in independence day were much better then in this movie. the whole movie i was waiting for the spiders to show up. the rest of the storyline was really boring. and when the spiders came, they had a very amateuristic look, like the special effects were from a movie made in the 60's. i didn't watch the whole movie. when it was played for about one hour i switched off my dvd-player. i watch 3 movies almost every night, and i have never walked away from a movie, even if it was that boring. the only thing good in this movie was the pretty sheriff :) that's why i voted 2 instead of 1 :) so don't go see this one, instead you should go out and rent starship troopers, it's like the same only 10.000 times better.
