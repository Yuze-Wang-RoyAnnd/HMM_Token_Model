a group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original -- and while there is a bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on "dante's inferno," there is nothing especially clever. dante's "divine comedy" was a brilliant piece of social commentary. this film is a vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to high art.<br /><br />i suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of the political and/or religious right, and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icons poked. be that as it may, few of those pokes actually rose to the level of satire.<br /><br />the high point of the movie is a sudden outbreak of "schoolhouse rock" on the subject of lobbying and the "revolving door." it's really a shame that the entire film couldn't have been a musical. that would have stripped away a great deal of the annoying film school pretentiousness and added a far stronger element of fun.
