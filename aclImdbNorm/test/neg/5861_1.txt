*spoilers ahead, but that shouldn't matter since i hope you wont see this one anyway*<br /><br />if you planned to see this one i have to strongly advice you not to. because this was one of the most wasted 1 1/2  hours i've experienced.<br /><br />first of all, this is an complete rip-off of the great movie "battle royale". it is as stupid as watching any lame american tv-show like "cops" or "candid camera".<br /><br />the plot are totally predictable. one challenger pregnant and another is a nurse, anyone doing some logic thinking understands in the beginning what should happen between those.<br /><br />the concept is ripped as mentioned before and the movie lacks the violence necessary of making this movie enjoyable. i mean, the preggo shoots a guy in the back and no blood or not even any trace of the hit in the back.<br /><br />i could go on forever without finding anything good about it, so take your money and get a copy of battle royale instead of watching this piece of crap.<br /><br />1 out of 10, too bad i couldn't rate it lower. almost makes scream 3 a masterpiece..
