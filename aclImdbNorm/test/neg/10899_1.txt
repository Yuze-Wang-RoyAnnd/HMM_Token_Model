if you just want gore, and nothing but gore and torture, you've come to the right movie. if you want a at least a sliver of good acting, logic, story, consistencies, or even a good guy ending, go elsewhere.<br /><br />i couldn't help but to think to myself, "jeeeez, are those people mentally challenged?" example, after being chased around and seeing other people mutilated, the main actress meets a police officer and spills out her story to the cop with tears and everything and told him about the psychopath that drives in a yellow truck. the yellow truck pulls up and the officer just walks to it, talks to the guy and the truck drives off without any trouble. the actress comes out and says why didn't you arrest him? and then the truck runs over the police officer... after being rammed the truck stops on the road about 20 feet way just standing there while the actress tries to drag the cop away but he's too heavy. (at the time) at that time the truck backs up and runs over the cops leg twice. the truck then drives off. why didn't the actress get the gun is beyond me. (which later she shoots the cop in the head twice because the psychopath was about to burn him alive) once through the mouth, which didn't kill him (duuuumb) and twice to finish the job. *roll eyes* right after that, she turns away to escape the bathroom which was going to explode and when she climbs near the roof, she turns around and the cop isn't there anymore... ok...<br /><br />another example, the main actress meets a trapped woman in the bathroom, she spits out like a gallon of blood on the floor, covering about 1/3s of the room. (probably more) after the main actress goes outside to grab a towel, she comes back in and everything is gone. :/ they don't explain why everyone keeps disappearing either. dumb dumb dumb.<br /><br />i like horror/thriller/gore movies, but this one was just way too dumb. i lost brain cells watching this dribble and you shouldn't too.
