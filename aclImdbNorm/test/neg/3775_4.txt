veber is not renown for his outstanding directorial skills. in fact nobody cares as long as they got the laughs, quite a few here to be honest, scattered in the whole process, thanks to depardieu's half-wit characterization and the dialogue veber puts in his mouth.<br /><br />but this is not enough to make a great comedy since there's no movie outside of the usual veber premise: a tough guy is doomed to team up with a very naive character. in l'emmerdeur, la ch`evre or les comp`eres there was a real story going on over the fire vs. water proceedings. le diner de cons, although it was a play, managed to create a real suspense about the next catastrophe pinon would cause. in tais-toi the backstory about the vengeance is both redundant and too weak to arouse our interest. plus the heavies are lame both on screen and in the script.<br /><br />now what's wrong? veber wraps this up creating no action, no rhythm. instead he uses systematically and overuses ellipses (maybe he met william goldman in hollywood) and the 'music' really stresses that lack of nerve and a backbone in the story.<br /><br />so you'll have to be content with depardieu's performance.
