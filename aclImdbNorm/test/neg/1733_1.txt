honestly, the only reason i picked up this movie from blockbuster was because aaron carter was in it. okay first thing's first. do you notice how ugly aaron carter has become?? i mean, he used to be so cute but now..with that lanky body and blotchy skin - ew. i think he should stick with singing and the directors of the movie could've found a much better-looking guy who could lip-sync. no offense though. i thought this teen movie was majorly lame - and this is coming from me, being a teen myself. the 'mean girls' in there are oh-so predictable, the acting is so amateurish it makes you cringe at times (especially from aaron) and overall i just didn't enjoy it. although, i give out points for the storyline - that was alright, but not at all realistic. anyway, stay away from this movie by all means you can unless you happen to have wads of cash on hand and have absolutely nothing better to do with 94 minutes of your time. it's not worth the $6.50!!<br /><br />(p.s; this review of mine may not be applicable to younger kids under the age of 13!)
