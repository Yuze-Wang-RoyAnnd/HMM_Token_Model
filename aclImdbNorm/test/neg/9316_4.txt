as long as you go into this movie with the understanding that it's not going to contain any historical fact whatsoever, it's not bad.<br /><br />it's on par with sam raimi's "hercules: the legendary journeys", as far as plot, acting, humour, and production values are concerned. you'll see the similarities at several points. most of the fight scenes are not as good however and the film suffers from that.<br /><br />jack palance commands the screen as well as ever, and at no time do you have the impression he's giving anything less than his level best. same for oliver reed. the problem is that their strong performances make square-jawed don diamont's less-than-stellar acting skills seem even more awkward. perennial bit player cas anvar was very good as well, playing a character much like salmonius in the aforementioned hercules.<br /><br />if you enjoyed the low budget swords-and-sorcery movies of the early 80s, you're probably going to enjoy this show as well. it's actually a shame they attached the marco polo name to it. it really has nothing to do with marco's life, contrary to the expectations of most of the people who will want to watch this movie.
