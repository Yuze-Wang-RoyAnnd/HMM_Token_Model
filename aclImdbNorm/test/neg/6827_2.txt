i could not believe how terrible and boring this hollywood remake was.it's so dreadful. it easily lands a place in my top 10 worst films of 1998.about the only thing it had going for it was bruce willis,who should stick to action films,as a completely emotionless killer who'd kill his own mother for the right price.but i'd rather listen to robbie coltraine talk american for a week than listen to richard gere's nauseating irish accent again.but this film is also implausible,unconvincing,uneven,unexciting,unimpressive and lands sidney poiter in a rubbish role to make a possible career comeback.one for filmroll-footie purposes entirely.
