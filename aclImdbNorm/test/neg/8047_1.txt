...a film comes along that manages to be absolutely terrible from the opening titles on through to the studio logo tagged at the end of the closing credits. this was such a film - the very type you can not stop watching for fear of missing a moment of its ever-descending quality.<br /><br />forget the low budget that's indicated by a slow, monotonous opening sequence that shows secret service agents running alongside a presidential motorcade with no crowds, no traffic or location discernible. forget the jumbled logic needed to even remotely make the actual plot seem plausible. forget that roy scheider delivers some of the hammiest dialogue whilst completely failing to hide his shame.<br /><br />this clunker is terribly paced, bombarded by a score that's simply laughable, and seems edited by a third grader. all the while twisting scenarios to cover up the hardest thing about filming a presidential storyline on the cheap: making him seem presidential.<br /><br />i honestly feel asleep briefly in the last reel, and when i awoke, i ran it back so as not to miss a single excruciating frame. try this drinking game: take a shot every time you see it blatantly aping another much better film. you'll doze off, too.<br /><br />not since 'the man' w/ samuel l. jackson and eugene levy have i seen such a delightfully unredeemable project. i may give out copies as christmas gifts. zero stars. a thousand laughs.
