the movie was pretty bad. it's not so much a script problem. it's just that the movie is really boring in terms of pacing. the movie just seems to plod along at a slow, agonizing rate. the story in san franpsycho is that there's a serial killer on the loose who is killing morally corrupt individuals (maybe i read too much into it, but hey, it's my nature apparently) after the san franpsycho kills a pair of people under the golden gate bridge we're introduced to one of the main characters of the film: joe estevez (brother of martin sheen) as a curmudgeony cop named bill culp. bill is currently trying to hunt down the killer (seriously he doesn't have a name, he's just the killer), and he is trying to coerce a local news reporter named rita to help him with his investigation, bill is the stereotypical hard-edged cop and he threatens rita to throw her in jail for obstruction of justice. anyway a few scenes pass by and suddenly rita finds a letter left by the psychopath (he's a cold blooded psychopath!) and she has a change of heart and tells bill and his partner joe about it and help them with the investigation.<br /><br />the movie tries to be a taut murder-thriller, but sort of just fails at that. it's much like the movie the black dahlia it tries to be tense but it just is unbelievable in terms of that. the movie tries to be serious throughout, but it has scenes like where the killer masturbates (obviously a fan of gore porn what with lines like: "ooh blood on her" or something to that effect) and joe estevez hitting the table going: "he's a cold blooded murderer!" i admit to chuckling more than once at the movie, even though i'm sure it was intended to be a deadly serious movie.<br /><br />one of the only positive points the movie has going for it is the fact that i didn't pay money to see it (huzzah netflix). and it's sad because i could see some good in their movies after watching the damned. sure the movie had its fair share of flaws, but it was enjoyable. sadly though san franpsycho has nothing going for it. granted it has an okay script it's nothing too grand, but it could've been interesting. instead what you get is a murder thriller that fails to thrill or have even vaguely enjoyable deaths. also the other reviews claim that the movie has "a great twist ending that's shocking" apparently i was watching a different movie because by about the one hour mark i sort of figured out what was going to happen. the ending didn't shock me in the least bit. i would go on insulting this wreck of a movie but i don't think i will. long story short this movie is a boring uninspired thriller (i use that term loosely) that fails to have the "hitchcockian thrills" that another reviewer claims to have a predictable ending, bland deaths, acting with all of the emotion of a plank of wood, and a decent soundtrack.<br /><br />i'm sure others will try to defend this with the usual: it was a low budget movie, they did the best they could with such a low budget, and all that other nonsense. but when you get right down to it there was very little that they could've really spent that budget on, there was very little special effects work, the soundtrack sounds like it might've been recycled from hood of the living dead or the damned, and it's the same damn crew from those two films. this movie really reminds me a lot of another low budget flick that was no good, and it was called mr. jingles, the two are about the same quality, they fail to deliver anything close to enjoyment and should fade quickly into obscurity.
