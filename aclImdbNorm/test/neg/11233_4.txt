this film is replete with sentimentality, unprofessional flying that makes a pilot like me cringe, and irrelevant material. why introduce rachel, for instance? she has absolutely nothing to do with the film except to permit her "follow me" truck to run wild and crash into dorinda's fence. that has got to be one of the stupider sequences among many in the film. another is at the end when the aircraft (was it a b-26 or an a-26? --both designations are used in the film) is left with props whirling and no chocks in place. that serves the plot, of course, but to reveal it would be to commit a dreaded spoiler. as it is, the aircraft would have begun to taxi sans control. the ending (again, avoiding spoilers) involves much too much talk -- as at the beginning of sound films in the 30s with all those final speeches. here, dreyfuss just babbles on and on. the ending also incorporates other radical violations of aircraft protocol and a couple of improbabilities/impossibilities that i won't describe. what a dull and disjointed effort!
