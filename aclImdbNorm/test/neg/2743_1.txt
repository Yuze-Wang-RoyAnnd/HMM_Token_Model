on the heels of the well received and beloved coming of age film classic ,concerning the lives of teenagers as they headed into adulthood, george lucas' american graffiti, we have cooley high. an adaptation of sorts by one eric monte, co creator of the popular 1970's cbs sitcom good times.<br /><br />cooley high was, and is, viewed as a black version of american graffiti.instead of central california ,as in american graffiti, we have the black slum of chicago's cabrini green as the backdrop for the story here. instead of america in 1962 cooley high is situated in 1964.the movie stars welcome back kotter's ,lawrence hilton jacobs and glynn turman as the movie main protagonists and its' main characters. it has garrett morris playing the principal who tries to keep jacobs' and turman's characters,named coceise and preach, out of trouble a great deal of the time.<br /><br />you know, i would like to say that cooley high is a worthy comparison piece to american graffiti or that it is a great film on its' own but i can't. the problem lies with the fact that the producers of the film couldn't or wouldn't hide the sad underside of black life in america.having the film in the cabrini green part of chicago doesn't help things.<br /><br />neither does the crass gross attempts at humor here. when coceise is looking for a letter of intent from a college he finds his little brother has thrown down a toilet. when the gang visits the chicago zoo, one of the gang named pooter, has manure thrown on him by an ape. when the turman's character,preach, is being chased by two hoodlums in the school hangout(a dirty and depressing place to eat food in much less meet people at), he opens the door of the girls' bathroom while a girl is relieving herself as he escapes through the window of the same bathroom! the high school, the homes of the characters, the bathrooms, just about everywhere in the film displays the unfortunate look of urban decay and poverty.<br /><br />if that wasn't enough there was the rough display of humor in the film. the use of violence and profanity in the film. cooley high may be an coming of age film ,but it is a hard and rough coming of age film with little or none of the wit and liking of the use of nostalgia that made people like and appreciate american graffiti so much.<br /><br />motown records had a hand in making the film. the company's music was part of the film's soundtrack. but even here you get a sense of same old same old as one has heard these songs before a million times over. not that they weren't great songs within themselves but black music,of that time period was more than just motown.especially in chicago. the song nearing the end of the movie, by the spinners' g.c. cameron, was not all that impressive. there have been better motown ballads that have been done, by better motown artists than cameron without question.<br /><br />the last part of the film showing where the characters went to pay homage to the film cooley high aimed to be ,american graffiti. it shows that preach,an intelligent but underachieving student went to hollywood and became a successful television writer. eric monte may have patterned himself as turman's character. the last shot of film show's preach running away from coceise's funeral ,held on a dark rainy afternoon, and all the bleakness that cooley high came to represent. eric monte ,through preach and that final scene, had one little lesson for all of us when watching cooley high and for the love of the past. don't look back.
