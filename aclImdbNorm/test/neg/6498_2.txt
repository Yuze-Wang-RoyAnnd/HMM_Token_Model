this movie had the biggest advertising campaign any movie ever had in russia. "epic movie about russian culture", "great saga of russian spirit", endless articles and interviews. for me this movie was the biggest disappointment. the main character played by oleg menshikov is a stupid immature boy ready to set up his comrades because of a woman who doesn't even look like a lady. what is there to admire? in the first part of the movie the story doesn't develop at all. people's festival scenes look like boasting about russian audacity.<br /><br />i respect mr. mikhalkov for his previous works both as actor and director, but this movie just demonstrates his ambitions to be considered the "tzar" of russian cinema.
