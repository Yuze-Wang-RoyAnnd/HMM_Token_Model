********spoiler alert************** wasted 85 minutes of my life watching this "film". first of all, we think it is hilarious that the producer cameoed in the film as the autopsy doctor with a horrible unbelieveably unbelievable accent -- what the hell was that anyway, romanian? and how is it that in denmark no one speaks danish except the bog creatures? (note, the scottish camp director...). ? and who does the shopping for the bog creatures? their pants looked like they were purchased at banana republic. very nicely dressed for being 1200 years old. this one was worse than scarecrow slayer (we didn't think that was even possible). we basically fast forwarded through 75% of the movie looking for any gore/death/scary moments. none found. do rent the dvd just to watch the 2 hour "behind the scenes of bog creatures" featurette. who are these people? are they serious? and the filmmakers are like 60 years old. i think this is their holy grail and that's pathetic enough in and of itself.<br /><br />best line from the movie, hands down: "not bad for a girl who never even went to graduate school...." my blind grandma who has alzheimers could make a better movie.
