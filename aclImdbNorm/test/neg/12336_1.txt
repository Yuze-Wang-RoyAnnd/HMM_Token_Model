we get to see who the good guys are. the union. and who the bad guys are, a rich man who steals elections and his spoiled son. the filmmaker forces us to see good from evil. all the characters hate the bad guys so that when watching the film, this can help us along on hating the bad guys. this is the worst kind of film-making - manipulative and childish. the plot centers on a cop who is in-between the good and the bad, and he's stuck in this ugly film. it's boring and pointless. the narration by star keach is really bad. and a good actor, don stroud, overacted to the hilt, playing the guy no one likes, and who we aren't supposed to like. it takes a long time for this bore to take off, and for the title to assert itself; then when it does take off, it crashes a minute later. boring. one of the worst films ever made.
