ok i went to this website before i watched this movie, read the comments, got pumped, - cause they where all pretty good for a b-flick - watched it and was completely disappointed. the main characters wannabe lone rebel straight out of the mid-west act was sickening to the stomach, and don't even get me started on the two cops, i mean there's a bloody door right there in plain view, check it out! the plot was completely predictable, the editing was rather limited, i swear the editor was even dozing off near the end when he was cutting this movie, and the direction was clouded by bad cinematography. now please don't get me wrong, i love b-flicks, some are really good.<br /><br />want to watch a good b rated flick???<br /><br />dave recommends<br /><br />" high tension "<br /><br />http://imdb.com/title/tt0338095/
