why can't a movie be rated a zero? or even a negative number? some movies such as "plan nine from outer space" are so bad they're fun to watch. this is not one. "the dungeon of horror" might be the worst movie i've ever seen (some of anyway. i had to fast forward through a lot of it!). fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age, there may be worse movies i've seen, but thankfully, i can't remember them. the sets appeared to be made with cardboard and finished with cans of spray paint. the special effects looked like a fifth grader's c+ diorama set in a shoebox. the movie contained unforgivable gaffs such as when the marquis shoots and kills his servant. he then immediately gets into a scuffle with his escaping victim, who takes his flintlock and shoots him with it, without the gun having been reloaded! this movie was so bad my dvd copy only had name credits. i guess no company or studio wanted to be incriminated. though i guess when you film in your garage and make sets out of cardboard boxes a studio isn't needed. this movie definitely ranks in my cellar of all time worst movies with such horrible sacrileges as "the manipulator", the worst movie i have ever seen with an actual (one time) hollywood leading man-mickey rooney. the only time i would recommend watching "the dungeon of harrow" (or "the manipulator" for that matter) would be if someone were to pay you. (i'm kind of cheap) i'd have to have $7 or $8 bucks for "dungeon" and at least ten for "manipulator". phil-the never out of the can cinematographer
