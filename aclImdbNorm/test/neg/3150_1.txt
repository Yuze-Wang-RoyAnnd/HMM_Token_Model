i am not lynne bates my names is ritichie but lynne is my mum i'm just using her account! barney and friends, (or barney, as it is called here in england) is the corniest show ever. i never really liked it, it had been about for 3 or 4 years when i was born, so it was nothing new. my friend, however, loved this dildo of a show. i was about 6, and i was at his house once, and he had a barney vhs tape playing on the tv. i turned the power off, and he burst into tears. grow up its a talking dinosaur for christs sake! anyway, i happened to catch the barney movie on tv later that year, and i loved it. i got the vhs of it a few months later, and i wore the tape out i loved it so much! i gave that tape away a few years ago now, but i loved it at the time. but the show! my god the show was bad! several kids fell victims to paedophiles because of this butt plug of so called entertainment! never again, never again! its not just me who hates barney, either! 85% of all the comments on this show are bad, and and just look at the amount of you tube poops and videos that take the mess out of barney are on you tube! and don't get me started on blow job bj! why the hell would the producers dare give a character such a sexual name! yet another subliminal message in a kid's show! and that baby bop is the worst thing since osama bin laden! all in all, i give barney and friends minus 1000 out of 10!
