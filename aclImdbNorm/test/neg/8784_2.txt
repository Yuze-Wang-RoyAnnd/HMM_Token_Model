would it surprise you that my ears and eyes almost bled from watching and listening to this awful movie? my eyes almost bled from watching the awful animation and insipid, plotless, empty story. my ears almost bled from listening to the songs that sounded like they were sung by a chorus of howler monkeys. then my brain almost melted because of this film's complete lack of intelligence. it's formulaic every step of the way. talking animals are one thing, but a penguin who can fly just to keep with the "dreams can come true" schtick? show some more faith in the children's intelligence please. next to rock-a-doodle, this is one of bluth's worst.
