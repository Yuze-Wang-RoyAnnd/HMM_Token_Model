as a parent of two girls(14 and 11) i have grave doubts about this show and all the shows aimed at tweens. first, i am always amazed that the living conditions of drake/josh, zac/cody, hanna, carly, derek, sunny etc. always make most houses look tiny and cramped. most people work hard all day to pay for living quarters less than half the size yet on these shows nobody is going or coming from work, paying utility,rent, mortgage or insurance bills, mopping, sweeping, changing lightbulbs, fixing toilets,etc. just walking in and out(and down the ubiquitous wide stairs that only exist on tv sets) cracking jokes(most of which involve lying and the hilarious results) and shirking work. i think kids watching these will have unrealistic expectations on how hard they will work and how luxurious their lives will be. second, there is never an intact family, always a mom or dad but never both, who are always going on sexless dates but never seem to have any of the downside of divorce(alimony, support, arguments). again, kids may get the impression that if mom/dad get divorced there will be fun fun fun(actually mom or dad are often not around if that helps the plot). needless to say there is no mention of spirituality(forget specific religion). finally there is a theme that troubles me. there are "nerds" that are good in school, "jocks" good in sports, "goody two shoes" as well. the protagonists are not good at school, sports, or charitable but make wisecracks about those who are. the message is don't be good at anything, just be one of the "nothings" who blend in cracking jokes. needless to say i give all these shows a zero and turn them off all the time and am just short of forbidding them in my house.
