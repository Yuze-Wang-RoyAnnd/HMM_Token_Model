this is the worst movie i have ever seen. the story line is a joke, the effects are terrible, the cinematography doesn't fit the tone of the movie, the dialogue is cheesy, and the actors do a good job at screwing up the rest. people just don't act that way in real life situations. my question is: who would fund such crap?<br /><br />the movie starts where some miners fall down a mine shaft after a fireman fails to save them. next we join some bikers in a forest who ride around doing stunts on their bikes. one guy falls and breaks his leg or something. the fireman arrives to help them. meanwhile, somebody starts a fire. some more bike stunts. bla bla bla.<br /><br />i wasted my time.<br /><br />do not watch this movie.
