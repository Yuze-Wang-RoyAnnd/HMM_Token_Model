george sluizer of the vanishing fame ( he made both the haunting european original and the hollywood remake ) directed crimetime . he shouldn't really be blamed for this confused , poor movie because all the problems lie in brendan somers script . it's ill focused and lazily written . for instance the killer hangs around a nightclub waiting to pick up a victim , any victim and starts talking to a teenage girl . cut to the next scene where she tells the villain " i've told you everything about myself , tell me about your life ? " unfortunately the girl has told the baddie her life story off screen and is a terrible example of the screenwriter not being able to bring a character to life through dialogue . i know for a fact how bloody difficult this is but for a screenplay that is produced the writer should have tried harder <br /><br />it's difficult to explain the message of the film . at some points it feels like it's trying to be a british natural born killers satarising the media's voyeurism with crime ( perhaps it even influenced the infamous video game manhunt ) but the script isn't witty enough to carry this off . when you've got a sex scene that doesn't progress the plot or characters or hint of subtext you know you've got a badly written screenplay and crimetime is a badly written screenplay
