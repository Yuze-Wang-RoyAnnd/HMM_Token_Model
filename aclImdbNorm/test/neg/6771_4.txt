i know we shouldn't expect much from a low-budget indie film. but the idea behind it is sound: an attempt to open america's eyes to the cozy relationship between the government, and the journalists that are supposed to be keeping an eye out against it. but somehow the documentary aspect of it, takes away from its drama. the protests during the 2004 republican convention in new york were not that compelling to make a documentary about it. those kinds of compelling protests belong to the era of the 1960's.<br /><br />it would have been better to stick to a drama format. perhaps a slow build-up where the young journalist's eyes are gradually opened up to the conspiracy.
