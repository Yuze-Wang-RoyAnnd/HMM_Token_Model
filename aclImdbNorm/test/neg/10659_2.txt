the pace of this movie is quite slow. it takes about 70 minutes to get katie to china (which we know that she will) and leaves 30 minutes to wrap things up. the storyline is so predictable that you know everything after about 5 minutes. nothing surprises you. i guess that the movie is a coming of age movie but the movie is full of stereotypes that are quite over the top:<br /><br />katie - a beauty that realizes that looks, boys and shopping isn't everything. she realizes that she can "feel" and "see the real world". touching.<br /><br />the mother - high strung, nervous, screaming mother (wow very innovative) that need taking care of by a strong man.<br /><br />the father - patient and always understanding and takes care of the incapable woman.<br /><br />the boyfriend that only wants to get into her pants.<br /><br />the comedian clown chinese guy that doesn't know how to speak english properly and made a laughing stock. thought hollywood dropped those characters in the mid fifties.<br /><br />the nurse that at times knows everything how to get around in china that in the next moment is a carbon copy of the mother i.e. a woman who cant handle the situation or knows anything.<br /><br />the deformed chinese girl that with the help of us westerns get help and become a beautiful girl. because in china (a third world country according to the film) don't have anything and hence needs our charity. gah, wake up and smell what you are shoveling.<br /><br />sure that there are some poverty in china but the portrayal of the aid from western countries (read usa) is so shallow and happy ending-ish that it is sad and revolting. shanghai (where the movie is set) is the most expanding and evolving city in the world at the moment.<br /><br />the chinese father that is so nice and goodhearted that in the end has one wish ... to be a cowboy with a white hat ...<br /><br />the teacher (sean astin) that has this really heart ripping story (not) that he tells without feel. why sean? why!?<br /><br />etc etc. it is difficult to actually finding a "real" person in the entire movie.<br /><br />this is nothing but a feel good movie for americans below age 15. if you want to learn anything about the world watch e.g. hotel rwanda instead. for a better life story or coming of age movie i suggest you watch the italian "cinema paradiso" that won the best foreign film academy reward some years back.<br /><br />the only nice thing in the movie were the small town sceneries that truly capture some (not all) of the beautiful chinese country side. i have been there and seen some of it.
