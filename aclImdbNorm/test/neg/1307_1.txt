i usually like these dumb/no brain activity movies, but this was just too stupid. there were way too many clich'es and the plot didn't really make much sense. there were a lot of loose ends and the ending was extremely poor and abrupt. we didn't even get too see if the big master plan worked. we only got too see the main character sob over his dead farther, the professor (that died because of stupidity (see below)).<br /><br />one scene annoyed me particularly. why did the professor only have about 5 minutes of oxygen in his container when he went to manually override the dam? and if they only had oxygen containers containing 5 minutes worth of oxygen, why didn't he bring two or three of them? then he would have survived
