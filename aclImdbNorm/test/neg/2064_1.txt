saw this on french tv today and was most disappointed ! the film starts off reasonably well but nothing is elucidated and at the end we are no farther forward than in the beginning. as to seeing the husband for the murder of his wife, this is just not plausible. you need tangible proof to convict someone and a minimum of evidence. in this case there is none at all so it just is not plausible. remember the old adage "innocent until proved guilty". the fact that a woman has disappeared without trace is no proof that her husband killed her. so i really don't know what kind of point this film was trying to make. the outcome is totally illogical and incomprehensible, no incriminating evidence is revealed to the spectator. so quite frankly, viewing it is a complete waste of time. after all, a film must be entertaining .... this is completely untrue in the case of this one and i suggest it be irrevocably consigned to the dustbin where it belongs !
