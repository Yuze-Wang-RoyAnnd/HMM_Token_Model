a good example of reversed, politically correct racism where white men are presented as senseless brutes who're only there to be massacred and their aboriginal adversaries as noble heroes, superior both in their appearance and abilities. apart from making the story overally dull, this also prevents the neutral viewer to identify himself with one or the other side - it's just too simplifying. the repetitive score is incredibly annoying (as is the voice-over), the characters lack any depth and the viewer is soon lost between questions like "who is this character" and "what the hell is that supposed to mean". photography is wonderful, though, and on the whole there's a lot of atmosphere to it but nice shots of misty landscapes alone don't save this movie. the dvd box uses kiefer sutherland as an eye-catcher. in fact, his character could have been played by anyone else because it's basically just an empty shell (like most non-maori characters), and disappears anyway around halfway the film. but if you are eager to see jack bauer in a kilt, that's your kind of movie...
