i actually saw the evil on the big screen. i saw it as part of a double feature during the early 1980s (don't remember the other film) when i was in my mid-teens. the film is bad, cringe-worthy bad. embarrassingly bad. the effects are atrocious (you can clearly see the cable pulling the black girl across the floor). there's absolutely nothing scary about it. in fact i laughed throughout the film.<br /><br />the story tried to create this big built up for the climax, when we're suppose to finally see who's responsible for all the evil goings on and we see greasy victor buono, who's as scary as an overstuffed twinkie. seriously, what where they thinking? buono, who was a villain on the batman tv series, is one of the hammiest actors ever to grace the big screen and i just cannot imagine anyone being remotely terrified of him.<br /><br />the evil is all but forgotten now (for good reasons)but it's actually a very funny film and i wish i could see this turkey again, just to see that black girl being pulled across the room by an unseen force with that very visible cable.
