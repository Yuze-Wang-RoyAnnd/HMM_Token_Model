i was disappointed with the third film in the "death wish" series and wouldn't recommend this unless you are really into bronson. he is his usual self in this one, maybe a bit lighter hearted than in the others; the rest of the cast is good if your watching a movie of the week on t.v. - the whole film has the production value of a bad episode of the a-team and i like the escapism fun of a show like the a-team but not on the big screen, even if it is an action movie that doesn't claim to be anything to sophisticated. the film takes a while to get going and then when it finally does, it gets out of control to the point of ridiculousness. the plot is something out of an episode of "highway to heaven" and bronson seems like a fish out of water with the majority senior citizen cast and the gun play is so out of control you don't even get any satisfaction from bronson's revenge against the bad guys. skip this and go on to the 4th installment which i highly recommend.
