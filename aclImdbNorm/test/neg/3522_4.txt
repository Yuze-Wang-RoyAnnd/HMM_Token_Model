this movie is so mild! i tried not to expect anything greater from this film, but still it was a big disappointment. the basic idea of the story is interesting and potential. this could have been so much better. the characters are really simple, no depth at all. it's a shame that previously talented performers tiina lymi and petteri summanen didn't make the already poor characters any better. the director just don't get the watcher emotionally involved at all with this piece of cr*p.<br /><br />and the the chase sequence at the end of the movie. that's hideous!!!<br /><br />why there had to be so stupid and old solution for that situation?<br /><br />it's too much used element with even more terrible way of filming it. oh no!
