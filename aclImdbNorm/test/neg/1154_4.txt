most likely "cleopatra 2525" will be of little interest if you did not watch the series when it was broadcast; and i don't think that many people did. but if you are still somewhat intrigued it is a "buck rogers in the 25th century" premise without space ships and with no budget for wardrobe or production design. <br /><br />in this case the buck rogers part (cleopatra) is played by jennifer sky. which one might expect to be a good thing as jennifer is very beautiful and quite talented; and has a nice comedic touch. but a quick glance at the promotional material will show that she is somewhat the worse for having a bad haircut and a salvation army thrift store wardrobe. if you remember how fetching jennifer was during her time on "xena" her dowdy cleopatra look will be a huge disappointment. with a target audience of "teenage boys looking to burn their eyeballs looking at "hot fetish-attired girls" it is not a good idea to skimp on the exploitation value of your heroine or her costume. and they wonder why some series don't attract much of an audience. love it or hate it, "buck rogers" had hotter costumes and much better looking guest stars. <br /><br />the other two exploitation elements are cleopatra's two female associates; hel (gina torres basically playing her stock "firefly" character) and sarge (victoria pratt-another "xena" connection-an extremely wooden version of natasha henstridge). torres does a good job playing off the cleopatra character, providing most of the show's comic relief. <br /><br />torres sings the theme song, a somewhat lame parody of rick evans' "in the year 2525 (exordium and terminus)" (1969). you remember the one that opens with the words "in the year 2525, if man is still alive, if woman can survive, they may find..."i suspect that they gave the series its title so that they could butcher this catchy little song although who knows, perhaps the title is a homage to "buck rogers" and they thought of using the song later. <br /><br />so, the premise of the show is that the earth's surface has been taken over by aliens called bailies (not the wkrp one) and the humans have been driven underground. our three heroines fight against the bailies under the direction of a disembodied (presumably) female voice (appropriately referred to as "voice"). unlike buck rogers, cleopatra is kind of a wimpy third stooge, still dazed and confused from her cryogenic sleep or maybe just disoriented from the creepy haircut. there are a lot of nice close-ups of sky wide-eyed and bewildered. like "buck rogers" the running gag is cleopatra using a common 21st century expression and everyone finding it either totally profound or completely baffling. <br /><br />unlike "firefly" the action is more of that hyper edited "xena" garbage which is neither realistic nor particularly entertaining. one good gimmick is that the girls travel around "spiderman" fashion, a sort of web slinging through tunnels and shafts in the labyrinth of their underground world. <br /><br />strangely (or maybe not considering the budget) these are only half hour episodes and except for one two-part show there is not enough time for any subtlety and nuance. <br /><br />then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.
