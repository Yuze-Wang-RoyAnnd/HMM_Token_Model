too bad, i really like kristen cloke and gary busey. but the director failed to put this together. there's a lot of action, a lot of promise, but it all comes off hokey. the director didn't do his job. promising action comes off lame. so much seems contrived in a desperate attempt to save the film. this version of "the rage" (directv credits it as 1996) simply isn't worth the time to watch it. another director would have done a better job.
