i finally managed to sit through a whole episode of this show. i was very, very tired. clearly. previously i would always have to turn it off because i thought it was that bad. watching a full episode convinces me that it really is that bad. i couldn't even tell you what happened but i distinctively remember not laughing. for people who think this is the new all in the family or married with children...have you ever actually watched those shows? they are well written and well acted and most importantly, funny! this show is not funny. you might think so if this is the first sitcom you have ever watched. i cannot see who else would. i echo all previous sentiments about arrested development, etc... it's probably my own fault for getting frustrated with television and not watching it, thereby allowing the stupid people to dictate what actually stays on the air.
