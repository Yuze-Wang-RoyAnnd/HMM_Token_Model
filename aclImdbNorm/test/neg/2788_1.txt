let's begin by acknowledging that there are arguably three types of horror films: good, bad, and utterly embarrassing reels that make the entire genre suffer in every way. dark harvest promises big with its artisan dvd cover, but rest assured that is where the show stops. following a grueling opening montage, we soon discover that the film consists of a very poorly written script, extremely under qualified (even for a beginners film) acting, disastrous lighting and even worse special effects. seriously, could no one afford anything more than a mask for the villain, or did they just think it was good enough for jason voorhees and michael myers , so it's good enough for us? well, it did not work at all to create a scary villain. at any rate, this is one of the movies that make you check your watch, sigh and curse your own gullibility. the timing in every scene is painful, and the entire production has a middle school feeling to it (come to think of it, i have seen better middle school stage productions, right down to the special effects). i'm trying to think of some way to end this review on a positive note, so let me suggest that all copies of this train wreck be donated as drink coasters, frisbees, wind chimes.......i'd say "go see your yourself", but that would just be cruel.<br /><br />check out the rest of this production company's reviews and you'll find the same for every one of their movies. they claim to honor the contract between film and audience (i.e. please the fans) but all they have done is chuckle and dumped a load on our heads for the cash (of which i am sure they saw very little for this). <br /><br />sorry people, the high ratings and favorable reviews are obviously posted by those either directly or indirectly connected to this travesty. <br /><br />1 star out of 10 because it is the lowest possible rating. giving it even one makes me angry.
