i really like kinski he is a great actor. i've seen this movie because i've heard that there are autobiographic aspects in this movie.<br /><br />the film is full of symbols like a piano sinking in a river or strange shadow-pictures at the walls. then the narrator always says abstract sentences like: "a kid sells fortune, but her box is empty now." this is really disturbing and wasn't really necessary, because everyone understands what this movie is all about. the movie shows how kinski's character treated woman, and how he kept them under control. if there are really some aspects of kinski's life in this story - then he really was an swine. so there is no need to watch this movie, unless if you want to see kinski naked or if you like sick trash movies to laugh about.
