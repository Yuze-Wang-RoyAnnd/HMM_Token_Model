this film is really really bad, it is not very well done and is a lack lustre attempt at something but i am not sure what. i watched it and was very disappointed. it promised a lot, but delivered nothing at all. the characters are shallow and wooden, and the music, if you can call it that, is dreadful. there are of course all the creatures and animated beings, but they are so poorly done that it does not come across as anything other than a third rate movie. it is a real shame that more attention could not have been spent to the special effects, not the be all and end all of a movie i agree, but in a movie that is based around them, it's a very important factor. for me, a very sad attempt, and should be avoided.
