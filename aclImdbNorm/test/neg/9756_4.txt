going into the movie with the right expectations, i somewhat liked this movie. like most reviewers who have seen this movie, i fully agree that the plot was razor thin, clich'ed, and i could predict every plot twist from the very beginning of the movie. but, the dancing sequences were very well done, and i really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance (both which i enjoy watching). the music/soundtrack of the movie was also very good, which made the "drama" scenes more bearable. the leads (jenna dewan and channing tatum) were ok as actors, but their dancing throughout the movie was impressive and mesmerizing.<br /><br />all in all, a movie worth watching if you like to watch good dance sequences, and this movie is much much much better than "you got served" in terms of the plot and drama. then again, that doesn't say much, does it? =p
