i cant believe it! i thought this is a good sequel when jim carry in the film has a baby but instead its a film with crappy actors, stupid plot and stupid scenes. this should be in 'crappest films of sh*t in earth'. thank god the same director did not make this because this is so stupid with some cartoonish parts like the fart was not funny, not the pee and not the dancing! i laughed at this because of how stupid the person made this like homer simpson making a movie about a doughnut! i wish someone makes a remake of son of the mask with a plot like this! the mask guy (jim carry) and his wife have a son which is a normal baby. when the baby finds another mask he became the mask, too and the mask guy tries to get his mask back! this is very crap so i'll give it a 1 out of 10. fu*king sh*t!
