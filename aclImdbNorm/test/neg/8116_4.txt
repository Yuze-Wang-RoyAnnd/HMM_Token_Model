i must admit, ashamed though i am, that as an impressionable young teenager this below par horror-chiller was one of my favourite all time films. nine years after first viewing stephen king's frightening story however i have now come to my senses, and am able to assess fritz kiersch's work more reasonably.<br /><br />indeed king's tale of a small nebraskan farming community that is turned upside down by a young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic sidekick is truly disturbing on paper, but it makes for a cheap, average horror show on celluloid. a lot of this outcome can be attributed to the fact that kiersch almost allows the beginning of the film to become a hacker-slasher show, and then turns the finale into a hocus-pocus special effects nightmare.<br /><br />the cast are reasonable, but they can only portray as much credibility as this rather incredible, over the top movie will allow them, and the soundtrack by jonathan elias is spookier than the pictures.<br /><br />a real shame that george goldsmith's screenplay turned stephen king's haunting short story into a shocking horror. isaac, malachai and all the other "children of the corn" aren't really all that scary.<br /><br />sunday, august 7, 1994 - video
