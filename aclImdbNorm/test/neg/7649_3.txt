i don't really consider myself a conservative, so i wasn't personally offended by this film, but it was pretty clear that the plot and the characterization in this film were secondary to the message. and the message is that all conservatives are either evil or stupid (or both). the characters are one-dimensional -- either good, freedom-loving americans, or brainless, greedy, evil conservatives. there's nothing clever or creative, just anti-conservative. i don't really mind the political bias itself, but it shouldn't be the only purpose behind the movie. and clearly it is.<br /><br />on the positive side, the cast is wonderful and chris cooper's impression of w is funny the first two or three times, but after that it's just the same old joke being told over and over again.<br /><br />so if you really hate the conservatives, you'll probably enjoy this film, but if you're looking for something with realistic characters and a story that's less black-and-white, then you'd be better off watching something else.
