crazy six is torture, it must be albert pyun's worst film. even blast and ticker are better! i can't believe how boring this film is! how this even got greenlighted? i saw this movie about 3 years ago and the only thing i remember is how bad it was. this isn't good bad movie, it is simply bad, bad, bad, bad, bad movie.<br /><br />1 out of 10 ( 1/2  out of *****)
