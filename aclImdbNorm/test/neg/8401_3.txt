it's difficult to decide who or what is the target audience for this film. jean-pierre limousin presumably had the chance to explore the problems of amnesia on a serious level and opted instead to use it as an excuse to make a soft-porn movie. having seen, loved, admired and respected se souvenir des belles choses which explores memory loss - albeit as the result of alzheimer's - in a profound and heartbreaking way, not least in the luminous performance of isabelle carre i find that novo is an insult to se souvenirs. i have no problem with soft porn per se - and even if i had i'd virtually have to give up going to movies so prevalent is it today - but i do have a problem with writers/directors who attempt to respectablise it by cloaking it as here in the guise of medical research. the sad thing is that fine actresses like julie gayet - so wonderful in clara et moi - and anna mouglalis - who seems to have hit into a double play after last week's le deluge and now this - are wasting their time on dross like this.
