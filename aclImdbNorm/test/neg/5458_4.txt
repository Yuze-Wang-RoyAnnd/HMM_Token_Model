i'm shocked that all the "hated it" ratings are sixes and sevens, still above average. to me, this seems a case of "the emperor has no clothes". i understand this film was produced on a very low budget in the early 70's...regardless, it became a struggle to sit through and watch. the dvd i saw did have some subtitles, but about 75% of the speech is not subtitled. some of it is hard to understand. the jamaican patois was cool to hear, but you struggle not to 'tune out' after awhile. some of the shots were nice, and the realism was there, even if some of the performances were not great.(jimmy cliff did a good job) the plot is not bad, but quite predictable. in the 1:43 film, the highlights are jimmy cliff(ivan) singing for a scene, and a couple of shoot-outs and a fight. probably 15 minutes or so. the rest is pretty boring. btw, near the beginning of the film, there are some weird cuts with the ivan character that seem like a editing mistake, which made me laugh for a bit. one reviewer said this film has been cut so many times, that there are few copies of the original 1972 theatrical version out there. the ending was kind of interesting, showing how the media from a young age influences people, it could also be a general comment on the white man's/colonialism's influence on jamaica. other main themes are poverty, corruption, church, ambition... in closing, the soundtrack is definitely worthwhile, the film much less.
