one night on an independent channel famous for showing off-the-wall films was aired this monstrosity. though tempted to turn it off, we watched it to the bitter end, hoping to see some semblance of redeeming value. alas, there was none. absolutely nothing. the film quality was cheap; the soundtrack was muddy; the editing was ridiculous. then again, there was precious little to salvage. after a few minutes of cameron mitchell's doctor character narrating about some patient of his, the viewer is tortured by no plot, pathetic writing, abysmally terrible acting, and an utter lack of cohesion and continuity. the rotting cherry on top of this fetid mess was the most horrendous "special effects" and "makeup" to ever disgrace the screen, even for television. the main character stumbles through his role in a dimestore rubber mask and a pair of dishwashing gloves which appear to have been dipped in glue and rolled in beads. perhaps the poor lighting and gag-worthy film quality were attempting to cover up how bad-to-the-tenth-power the makeup was. one can only hope that at least one deliberate decision was made in the course of this hopelessly amateurish video. seriously, a handful of three-year-old kids could've produced a better project. at the end, poor mr. mitchell returns (how desperate he must've been for money!) and drones out some nonsense that's supposed to connect this pile of crap with the aids epidemic. please spare you and your loved ones the inhuman cruelty of sitting through this. it was so bad, even mystery science theater 3000 couldn't have salvaged it.
