i saw this film shortly after watching moonlight & valentino with elizabeth perkins, gwyneth platrow, whoopi goldberg and kathleen turner. there are a lot of similarities between the two films. they both have great casts and good acting. they both have stock characters of sisters who are very different, an offensive stepmother, a woman friend/confidant, an emotionally unavailable father, a dead mother and a surprise lover. both films have the characters experience life-changing realizations and both films suffer from a kind of 'love conquers all' sentimentality. they both add a little titillation with cameron diaz in black underwear and a partial back shot of gwyneth paltrow naked.<br /><br />both films seem contrived, as if the writers of the works the films are based on did market research and said, "ok, there's a market for stories about relationships between women, so i'm going to write about two sisters with an offensive stepmother
