even though this was a well-told story, i found it too unpleasant. the main subject is child abuse, which is never fun to see - a sordid topic. add to that a lot of profanity by the drunker-abuser husband and a gd by a little kid, no less - and this movie turned me off as far as ever seeing it again. <br /><br />also portrayed in here were punks picking on the two little boys, another unpleasant viewing experience. the realism of the story takes a swan dive when one of the boys flies away on a home-made airplane! give me a break!<br /><br />the only positive, enjoyable part of this movie is seeing the nice, loving and touching relationship between the two young brothers, played by elijah wood and joseph mazello. the latter became a familiar face in the next couple of years with big roles in jurassic park, shadlowlands and the river wild. wood, of course, didn't hit it big until a decade later but, he made it very big in the lord of the rings trilogy. those two kids, and narration by an unbilled tom hanks, are the only facets of this film i liked.
