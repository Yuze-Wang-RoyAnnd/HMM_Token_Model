well to start with i'm straight up as black as black gets, and i can tell you it's very sad when black people think a "black movie" sucks. i can't say i've ever seen a movie this badly directed or a worse story line.<br /><br />snoop is my dawg and all but he wasn't feeling this movie at all, i don't know how much they paid him to be in this bucket of crap called a movie, but i hope it's enough to wash the smell out.<br /><br />i'm all about supporting a bothers movie, but this one was bad, really really bad. it blew chucks in every aspect, no real plot, story sucked, cast couldn't act and the best one there was the white guy!<br /><br />i almost demanded a refund on my way out the door of the theatre, half the crowd up and left before it was over, i'm still wishing i had too. save yourself some pain and go see something else, anything else...
