this movie was like a gathering of people that had been in other movies and they decided to make a really bad movie. it had a dude from "detroit rock city", a girl from "the cosby show", that dork that kissed the chick and bought that sausage was in "sorority boys" and there was more. ok that doesn't make a bad movie in itself, that was just something i noticed. the whole thing with the hooker and the french girl having the same name was dumb and the thing with 37 people writing these notes and if you think they are going to get mixed up.....shocking enough.......you called it. and the purse thing, that was just plain stupid. it was so bad that i watched the movie in two parts and still only made it to the 50 minute mark. if you are watching this and expect "van wilder" or a movie like that......don't.
