okay, i haven't read the book yet but i have to say that the lead character was miscast. how can i say such a thing haven't read the book you ask? it's simple. as a viewer of this miniseries, i grew irritated by the mannerisms, gestures and look of the lead character, fannie price. it's one thing to be a good person but it's quite another to be a stick in the mud creature who disdains from looking anyone in the face or otherwise meeting their gaze. apart from the overdone "susan b. anthony" profile, she seemed resolute in refusing to look at another person. the scene where edmond is pouring his heart out to her, she is looking straight ahead the whole time, forcing him to do the same. as a result, it was just awkward and i just couldn't fathom anyone being in love with her let alone both henry and edmond. many have said it was true to the book, if that is the case i find it hard to believe that jane austen would create such a character as her lead heroine. it's possible to create a character who has been put upon by others and succeeds in earning their trust and endearment but the portrayal of this character in this miniseries just didn't do it for me.
