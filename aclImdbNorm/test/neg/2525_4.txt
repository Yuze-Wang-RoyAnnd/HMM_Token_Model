i used to work at the company that originally put out this film, vestron pictures. vestron had the same problem that a lot of small independent film companies had, they didn't have a lot of money to put into the production values of their films. not that money alone will buy you a good film. look at kevin costner's waterworld, for instance.<br /><br />sometimes, if you have a talented person in-house doing the acquisitions or development, you can create your own new talent. but at vestron, there wasn't such a person and they always skimped in some crucial area. in this case, it was on the director and the writer. which makes it pretty hard to have a decent movie, even with the great ensemble cast this film has.<br /><br />i think the basic premise of this movie was "let's put a bunch of quirky characters in a room and see if anything interesting happens." it's an intriguing idea, but not worth your time watching.<br /><br />most vestron films ended up having a very distinctive look and feel to them. my wife and i developed the ability to spot this quality even in non-vestron films. many times, we were even able to spot that quality from watching only the trailer or tv ad. we'd sit there, watching the trailer or ad, and afterwards, we'd turn to each, and almost in sync, we'd say, "now that's a vestron movie!" this is a vestron movie.
