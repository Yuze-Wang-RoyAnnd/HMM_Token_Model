this stupid, anti-environment wannabe "jaws" is sad, pathetic, boring, poorly dubbed, and stupid. there is nothing redeeming about it.<br /><br />plot follows some shark/octopus creature-thingy that appears off the coast of florida and kills some people (including a boring, stupid couple with a whiny wife and a silent husband who stabs himself with a fork for some reason). his ascent to the surface is always represented by a vague sideshot of something bumpy over and over. it makes no sense, it's horribly boring, and it's conspiracy plot sucks.<br /><br />there are moments of camp that cannot be ignored: the same shot of the boat of the couple of the opening sequence three times; the doctor slamming a dying patient's chest twenty times with a difibulator without stopping, even though he's clearly dead; the porno-esque soundtrack; the shot of the couple making love on the beach, with three different thems ("that us is getting ahead of us!") doing this; the ancient computer that sounds like kermit the frog; a beer-guzzling scientist screaming "i know!" a la dr. smith; the list goes on and on.<br /><br />oh, and everyone drinks at least thirty bears in the course of the movie (much noticed by mike and the 'bots) . . .<br /><br />the mst3k version is their best episode, but it's certainly better than the movie itself. "this is how i like to go fishing, guys . . . with a flashlight and a flamethrower . . ." - crow<br /><br />one star for "devil fish"; seven for the mst3k version<br /><br />
