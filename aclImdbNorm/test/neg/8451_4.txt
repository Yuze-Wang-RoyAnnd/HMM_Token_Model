**spoilers** with the title of the film having the name of the killer fish twice not once you would expect to see them in action attack biting ripping and eating up almost everyone in the cast of characters. instead you have to wait until the movie is almost over for you to get as much as a glimpse of the piranahs. even then all you see is the water bubbling and stirring around as a poor individual disappears under it assuming that he's being eaten, whole and alive, by the fish.<br /><br />the movie "piranha piranha" starts with this scary looking piranha on the screen as the credits start rolling down but****spoiler****that's the only time in the movie that you ever get to see the killer fish or fishes you never get to see a piranha is the movie again. what you do see is a travelogue of venezuela and it's people and the venezuelan jungle along the amazon river basin. together with a lot of nice and breathtaking photography of the landscape as well as the people and wildlife but that's about all.<br /><br />there is some kind of a story that has to do with this great white hunter caribe, william smith, which ironically means piranha in the native language spoken there, is this what the title of the film "piranha piranha" really meant? "caribe caribe"! the person caribe is played by legendary hollywood hell's angles biker and all around tough guy william smith.<br /><br />at the beginning of the movie this trio of american tourists jim pendrake and his sister terry, peter bown & ahna capri, and their american guide art green, tom simcox, are on their way into the venezuelan jungles to go sight-seeing with terry taking photos to send back home. terry is terrified of guns as we learn that as a young girl saw her father get his head blown off by a gun. even when art saves her life using one when see's attack by a six foot long diamondback rattlesnake terry almost belts him for having a gun; which he promised her he wouldn't take along with him on the trip.<br /><br />at a jungle rest stop, or bar, the three run into caribe who we first saw catching monkey's in the jungle at the start of the movie. caribe makes himself more then welcomed by the three with his knowledge of the jungle and his half-baked philosophy about life and death as well as his ability to get them where their going to the local diamond mines deep in the amazon basin.<br /><br />even though a bit strange at first, the guy is so in to himself that he doesn't seem to notice that there are any people around him, caribe turns out to be a swell and likable guy engaging in a long and friendly motorcycle race through the swamps and jungle with art. caribe even shows terry, who at one time in the movie almost knocked his teeth out, the fine points of hunting and shooting wild game that he believes don't really die but become a part of him after he kills them! a bit crazy but you have to admit this guy's got imagination. <br /><br />it's much later in the movie that for some strange reason, maybe it was the cheap booze that he was drinking, caribe suddenly goes insane and become homicidal attacking and raping terry and then murdering her enraged brother and feeding him to the deadly piranha's. trying to escape from the rampaging lunatic and then being forced to have to fight it out with him art gets beaten up so savagely by the dirty-fighting caribe that he's almost left unconscious. just when caribe's about to finally kill art he's shot to death by terry who after experiencing what this insane nut-job is all about finally decided that guns are indeed very necessary and should be used to kill on very rare but life-saving occasions.<br /><br />worth watching, if worth watching at all, only for the scenery and nothing else. it's just a shame that the movie has to advertise as a killer fish, or piranha, horror movie when if it was honest about itself it could have been a more or less average jungle adventure flick with smith, he does have the build for it, playing tarzan of the venezuelan, not african, jungle
