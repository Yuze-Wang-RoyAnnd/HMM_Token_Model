yet again not quite bad enough to make it enjoyable. in fact this one is just boring. it's reasonably well made, even though the script is bad, the effects are ok and the acting average. (apart from james mason who is always great, but in this one underused)<br /><br />i suppose it is hard to write anything about this film because it didn't evoke any reaction in me what so ever.<br /><br />dull, dull, dull, dull, dull.
