like a lot of people, i loved the original; "american graffiti" was one of the great movies of the 70s. the sequel, "more american graffiti" is a horrible, depressing mess of a movie. it wasn't funny, the wide-eyed, likable characters had become cynical and jaded, and the stories were contrived (such as "laurie's" character having another brother because richard dreyfuss didn't do the sequel and "terry the toad" and "pharaoh joe" somehow managing to serve together in vietnam). they even have a police officer by the name of "falfa" (harrison ford's character in the original) who makes a "cameo". he doesn't even look like harrison ford, who was way too big a star by 1979 to even bother with this garbage.<br /><br />the operative word here is "funny". this movie isn't even amusing. debbie (candy clark) is a stripper mixed in with a bunch of dope spoking hippies and trying to bail her dealer boyfriend out of jail; steve and laurie (ron howard and cindy williams), the lovebirds in the original, have two kids and have become an annoying, bickering couple; adorable little tomboy carol (mackenzie phillips) has become "rainbow", yet another hippie child. john milner (paul lemat) is a loser race car driver whose fortune was foretold at the end of the original. even wolfman jack, whose voice was such an integral part of the original, and gave it such a great flow, only is heard sporadically.<br /><br />perhaps it was different writers, a different director and the complete lack of a cohesive story line that makes this movie such a dismal failure.<br /><br />the episodic charm and authentic nostalgia of the original is nowhere to be found in the sequel. it was a movie that didn't need to be made and its best just to remember what a great movie "american graffiti" was and avoid the movie with "more" in the title.
