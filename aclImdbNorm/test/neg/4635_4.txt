not bad performances. whoopi plays the wise/warm role quite well. still, the storyline and situations can not be believed (forced pc stereotypes). at times it is good jews and blacks vs. the evil white christians (ho-hum). a typical hollywood fantasy. the film does have its moments, but it is not one that i would recommend to go out of your way to view.
