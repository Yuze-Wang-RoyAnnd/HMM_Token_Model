okay -- the title "house of frankenstein", was a reference to a line from the original frankenstein movie. when they follow it up with a movie entitled "house of dracula", which makes no real sense, you know that it's just beginning to turn into a franchise.<br /><br />without explanation, dracula is back, and he's calling himself baron latos. he infiltrates the home of a doctor edelmann, with the claim that he is seeking a cure for his vampirism. edelmann has a hunchback nurse who assists him (what is it with hunchback assistants in these movies?), but what dracula is really interested in is his other, more beautiful assistant. at this point, larry "wolf man" talbot returns (again, no explanation given) and just happens to be seeking the same doctor for a cure to his lycanthropy. and then he just happens to fall into a cave in which plants can be grown to help him, which also just so happens to contain the frankenstein monster. dear god, when will it end ... sure, the other universal monster sequels were silly, but this is just ridiculous.<br /><br />first the good stuff. there are some great settings, and the vampire bat effects are slightly better than usual. some of the other effects are pretty neat too. john carradine isn't bad as dracula once you get used to him, but still nothing like as brilliant as lugosi was. in my opinion, onslow stevens plays a much better vampire in this movie, although he has exactly the opposite problem to carradine -- all of the creepiness and none of the class. none of the performances are that great, but it's more due to the atrocious script than anything else -- the female parts are particularly badly written. but stupid as it is, it remains reasonably entertaining for the most part. the best thing about it is it's short length.<br /><br />now the bad stuff ... it's not creepy, it's poorly written and it doesn't work. i was hoping the three monsters would begin some kind of a supernatural struggle for power, but it doesn't happen. the focus is almost entirely on dracula, who isn't particularly well portrayed. on the other hand, this is the only movie in which dracula infects another man, but it is done via a blood transfusion rather than a bite as universal were always uncomfortable with the possible homosexual subtext. larry talbot is decent as always as the wolf man, but he plays a comparatively small part. once again the part of frankenstein's monster is reduced to the anti-climatic closing moments. for god's sake, glenn strange was fantastic as the creature! why not give him more screen time? it's unfortunate that the series had to end on this note (not counting the classic comedy "abbott & costello meet frankenstein"). in the end it just fizzled in the sunlight and died, much like dracula himself.
