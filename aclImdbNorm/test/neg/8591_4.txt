beautiful images, propaganda and history as toy. the ingredients of this film, good, interesting but with many shadows. politicall shadows. jefferson is more than the hero of a mythical america. he is silhouette of a vision about life and society, an extraordinary thinker, teacher of large part of north america. in film is only superman. the delicate contour of ideas are crushed. the subtle birth of essential truth is forgotten. and jefferson is basic instrument for create a good image of american realities. the end,triumphal and fake, romance and heroic, is gun suicide of a story who may be tall with more wisdom. and the war against "avatar" is another gray stain. for one who heard nothing about jefferson, movie is a good beginning. for the others - disillusion. it is like the precious silk of a tailor. but the tailor is fascinating about silk and the clothes are only ordinary cloth. so, a sad experience. slices of beauty and boring lakes, patriotic lesson and the crush of expectation. a film who must impressive. and the ash of a story who could be magnificent.
