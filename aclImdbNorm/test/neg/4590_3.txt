give me a break. how can anyone say that this is a "good hockey movie"? i know that movies tend to do a pretty p***-poor job of portraying hockey to the general public. and yes, this was made back when the u.s. hadn't embraced our sport to the extent is has today, but really. i have played hockey all my life and have watched even more, and this my friends is sheer lunacy. the scenes on the ice were stupefyingly bizzare... the particular instance to which i am referring is the "sword fight", er i mean the "stick fight" at the end of the film... during which everyone is just standing around and watching, not with fascination that this is actually happening, but in wonder as to who will win the duel between youngblood and his nemesis rakkie. yes the story off the ice is a little better, i do stress little.<br /><br />i don't know, maybe there is no point in going on... i mean let's face it: the film is right. hockey is just one big battle on ice... oh yeah with a little piece of vulcanized rubber bouncing around- occasionally into what is loosely termed a "goal". youngblood is either appalling or hysterical, i can't figure out which... maybe someone else will have more luck.
