sammi cheng & andy lau are coupled yet again in their 3rd film -- yesterday once more -- directed by hk's actioneer johnnie to...fans of to's action films will be disappointed to find not a single gun was used in the filming...furthermore, fans of cheng & lau's previous films, needing you & love on a diet, will also be disappointed to find that yesterday is no where near as funny or endearing...<br /><br />mr. & mrs. to (lau & cheng) are a divorced couple...both affluent hk citizens...both incredibly mischievous...both just happened to be professional thieves -- 'two birds of the same feather'....a couple years earlier, they divorced over an inability to find middle ground on splitting the loot...now she's remarrying...to the son of a rich heiress -- a total momma's boy (carl ng) through & through...the soon-to-be mother-in-law (jenny woo) is suspicious of mrs. to's past & thinks she's only marrying her son for the family jewels -- the heiress' priceless ruby necklace...<br /><br />the necklace is stolen...is it mrs. to's materialistic eye that gets the best of her?... or is it her ex-husband, mr. to's way of sabotaging the marriage to steal the jewels for himself?...<br /><br />this is not a movie about two pple falling in love or rekindling a love...its about two pple who have always been in love but have somehow been to foolish to realize it...they let pride & greed overwhelm them...<br /><br />overall: yesterday is one part caper/heist film & one part homage to classic hollywood glamour from its golden years -- i.e. cary grant & grace kelly's to catch a thief...johnnie to is riding too heavily on cheng/lau's chemistry from their previous films...hoping cheng/lau's immense popularity & fan base will be enough justification for this third film....i think sammi cheng is one of the most likable/charming entertainers working t'day...& lau is definitely the tom cruise of asian cinema...<br /><br />i really enjoyed their first two films & consider the cheng/lau pairing comparable to those classic hollywood couples of the 40's & 50's...but yesterday falls very short of expectations...terrible writing, ridiculous situations, product placements galore, & all the subplots & supporting characters were unnecessary...come to think of it...this film was unnecessary...unless you just love celebrity watching...
