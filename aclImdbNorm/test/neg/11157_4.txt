throughout watching "end of days", i got the sense that the film makers were perhaps trying to make this unique to the average hollywood action film. they failed, of course, but you have to give them credit for trying. peter hyams actually tried directing this time, instead of just churning out another flat action film. he attempted to inject atmosphere into the movie by darkening the lights and adding tons of blood. this method can work if used correctly (see "se7en") but here it just feels like a cheap trick to try and scare us. hyams is a decent action director, and offers nothing more here than basic shoot outs and fight scenes, except for the lackluster, sub par f/x end "battle". as a photographer, hyams demonstrates actual ability, displaying some good frame work and movement, but it is nothing above solid work.<br /><br />screenwriter andrew marlowe is the film's greatest enemy. at parts, the script actually shows the makings of good religious thriller, and at times it even shows some quasi-intellectual thought (the temptation scene between arnold and gabriel byrne), but these small pluses are choked out by a river of negatives. generic dialogue/characters, gapping plot holes, and convenient plot points that just happen to point all the characters in the right direction are just a few of the standard hollywood black holes marlowe's screenplay falls into. the shadow of the good movie it could have been faded very quickly.<br /><br />the film surprisingly has a good cast. arnold, still possessing that larger than life attitude, tries to play a depressed, on the edge cop with no more than average results. stick to be the invincible hero arnie, it's what your good at. gabriel byrne is the strong point of the ensemble, bringing a nice air of cynicism to the role of satan. in a villainous role ripe for overacting, byrne restrains himself and it adds a bit more menace to the character. kevin pollak, as normal, is able to bring at least a few chuckles to the movie, but he's done better. also look for a stellar small role from rod steiger.<br /><br />hyams looked like he was trying to separate this from the faceless mass of hollywood action films. he was heading in the right direction, but had neither the script or originality to take it there.<br /><br />4/10
