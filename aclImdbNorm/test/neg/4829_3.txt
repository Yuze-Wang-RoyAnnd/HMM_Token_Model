speed which i believe is direct copy of the hollywood movie cellular (i haven't watched this one) gives an impression of a test match which is very exciting in first four days, but then gets in a very boring draw at the end. i have watched this movie today on 12th january 2008 on rented vcd. it's release date is 19th oct 2007. but still fortunately for me i didn't know or heard much of this movie before except that it is a flop at box office. so in this situation when i watch the movie, i feel that this movie could have been a very good movie, but then the director again falls in the trap for bollywood traditions and has wasted a very good chance.<br /><br />off course as a bhatt movie it must be copied from somewhere else. but now days it doesn't matter for me, if i haven't seen the original movie. i just found the main theme much similar to 'nick of time' and 'badshah'. in the movie sanjay suri is shown an intelligence agent, but his wife thinks that he is a chef. this brings back the memory of 'true-lies'. the only new part was the use if the phone. but that too i found out now is taken from movie cellular. so when a movie is made with the mixture of so many other movies it's future is quite clear.<br /><br />the things i like about the movie is its pace. as the name suggest the things really happens fast, and there is not much time to think about in between the scenes. but this breaks in the last 20 minutes of so where the movie goes in traditional bollywood style of dhishum dhishum.<br /><br />the plot of the movie is also quite interesting. three stories going parallel, one after the other. one of the kidnapping of urmila, the other of the zayed trying to help urmila, and then the plan of murder of prime minister. these three stories gets mixed up naturally with each other as the movie continues.<br /><br />but then the very ordinary acting and unnecessary extra style has killed the spirit of the movie. except sanjay suri, none other makes any impression. this goes even for urmila, who is always promising in rgvs movies. due to this ordinary acting some scenes doesn't really convey the feelings that director wanted. e.g. the scene at the end where urmila leaves all hope and cut the phone, should have made a good impact. but instead we just wait for the end of that scene.<br /><br />other than acting, some unnecessary love for style demoralizes the movie. showing so cool villains is good for hollywood movies not for bollywood the background of london is also only for making style and not much intelligent advantage of this background can be seen. especially at the end, all those dhishhum- dhishhum were utterly unnecessary. may be director has an impression that the climax in hindi movies must have such fights. they look unrealistic, increase the length of the movie and make sure that the people are leaving theater before the movie ends.<br /><br />over and all, i find the movie once watchable. if it is coming on tv or you can get it on rent its ok. but then again make sure that you have the remote and forward button handy. next time, when the movie is on tv, you can safely watch other channels.
