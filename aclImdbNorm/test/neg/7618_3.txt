i once saw a bit of this film, and was interested to see the full thing just to see why the critics give it two stars, the result being that i agree. basically the film begins with kermit the frog (steve whitmire) telling all his muppet chums that they have lost everything, and he ends sitting depressed (and possibly thinking about suicide) on the bench. meanwhile, in another world (heaven) angel daniel (david arquette, who had already been in muppets from space) visits the 'boss' (whoopi goldberg, another reason i wanted to see the film) to show that kermit really needs help. in the flashbacks, it shows kermit, miss piggy (eric jacobson, not the original and better frank oz), gonzo (dave goelz), fozzie bear (also jacobson), pepe the prawn (bill barretta) and all the other muppets have prepared a stage show for many people to see in the christmas holiday, and it all seems to be going well. but the really mean rachel bitterman (joan cusack) is determined to either shut the show or the theatre down, and kermit is doing everything possible to make sure that doesn't happen. of course, kermit fails the last time, and bitterman tells him that they are finished, and she can officially take the theatre. this is where daniel is sent as kermit's guardian angel to try and help him, but kermit is not in the mood, and eventually ends up saying "i wish i was never born". obviously, you can recognise the spoof of it's a wonderful life, with kermit as the george bailey, and cusack as the mr. potter, and in the end, obviously kermit realises how much he means to everyone, and goes back to find the theatre saved as historical landmark. also starring whitmire as rizzo the rat and beaker; goelz as dr. bunsen honeydew and waldorf; barretta as dr. teeth, rowlf the dog and swedish chef; jacobson as animal and yoda (the only character who sounds similar to oz's version), william h. macy as glenn, matthew lillard as luc fromage, carson daly, molly shannon; scrubs' zach braff, sarah chalke, neil flynn, john c. mcginley and judy reyes, mel brooks as joe snow; brian henson as scooter and janice; jerry nelson as robin the frog, statler, pops and floyd pepper, and kevin clash as sam the eagle. the most memorable moment for me is the stage spoof of moulin rouge, besides that and the well known faces in it, not fantastic. it was nominated the emmy for outstanding music and lyrics for the song "everyone matters". the muppets were number 47 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons. adequate!
