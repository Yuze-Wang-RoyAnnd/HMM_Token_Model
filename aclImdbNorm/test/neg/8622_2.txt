most american remakes of european films are pretty poor, but this is in a league of its own. in fact this might even be the worst (sandra bullock) movie ever made. i daresay i might have passed it off as just another innocuously bad hollywood thriller had i not seen the dutch original, spoorloos. the altered ending here is stupid enough (and executed with particular ineptitude), but a far worse crime than that is removing all the intelligence and depth of character that marked out the original as a classic. the real horror to be found here is in the fact that the same man who directed spoorloos is responsible for this atrocity. will the real george sluizer please stand up?
