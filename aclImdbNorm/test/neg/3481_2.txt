this movie is highly improbable. read the other reviews to see why.<br /><br />i would say that most of the characters were plastic, but they didn't even afford themselves that little luxury; they just act like cardboard cutouts. of course, they had to get real surfers for the surfing contest roles, so that's a crap shoot whether they can act. at least occy didn't give a crap and just went with it. but "lance"??? fuhgeddaboutit.<br /><br />the one character who rang true was portrayed by gerry lopez who didn't really act, he was himself pretty much. he's quite accustomed to stomping people. :-) the only reason i gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 was because i was laying out a newsletter on my laptop when it came on some cable channel late one night. that saved me from having to pay full attention to this silly little time waster. no way i would go out of my way to watch it.
