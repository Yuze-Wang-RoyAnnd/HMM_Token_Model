with a cast of mostly lesser-tiered stars (alain delon, robert wagner, eddie albert), lousy special effects (sure, it was the 70's but "alien" and "star wars" came from the same decade), and a storyline that is so laughable that one might want to cry, this is a "flight" that should have been grounded.<br /><br />even academy award winners cicely tyson and george kennedy can't keep this "bird" airborne.<br /><br />the implausibility of the third film - airplane is submerged in the bermuda triangle - is much more believable than this turkey.<br /><br />avoid "the concorde" at all costs!
