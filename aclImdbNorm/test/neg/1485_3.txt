yes, the movie was that boring and insipid. after a certain point, i was wanting the croc to eat these people just so we could get the movie over with.<br /><br />the plot is that three aussies take a fishing tour up a river in a little boat, where the fishing guide straps on a gun. he says he just does it for insurance purposes, all the crocs have been hunted out of this river. he is immediately eaten by a croc. the trio then get chased up a tree, getting picked off by the reptile in their attempts to escape. they spend most of the movie arguing over the best way to escape.<br /><br />predictably, the one survivor finds the tour guide's gun and shoots the crocodile. aww, they killed the movie's only likable character! <br /><br />where's paul hogan or steve irwin when you really need them?
