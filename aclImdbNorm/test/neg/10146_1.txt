in my opinion of this movie the entire video portion of this movie was absolute trash!!!! however the soundtrack that was used contained the music of a great heavy metal rock band, i recognized the music as being a band called firstryke and the album was "just a nightmare" and it was very well written!! and i am curious to see what the rest of you movie buffs out there think of it, if can remember back that far i would appreciate the feed back, i collect old movie, and obscure movie sound tracks. it is a very time consuming hobby but is very rewarding. i have seen this bands music being sold in germany on the net for around fifty dollars per album. not to bad hugh?
