well well, i had seen a lot of reviews on this one, and a lot of promo always showing the decapitation scene. but this flick is a tough one. and i mean it by all ways. it's hard to find a copy, because it was a low budget independent release and because mpaa was on the hunt for every copy on vhs, it came out unrated but it had to be rated for the mpaa. so copies disappeared into the underground scene. all people involved in this flick never did anything else in the biz. so it made this flick unique. vhs copies almost never pop up on ebay or other sites and if they do you will pay over a 100$ to get one. but due us connections i was able to catch a release on dvd sold worldwide. limited but it was to be a sort of official one. now and then there are still some screenings of this splatterfest. but is it worth all the hype surrounding it? as said earlier, it is a tough one to catch but also to sit through. there are gory killings, there is necrophilia, there is nudity but there is also a lot of talking between the coppers. and to be honest, if you would like to see the movie in 5 minutes watch the ending, it's a flashback in the killer's mind. the blood flows and indeed it's a splatterfest but not the full 80 minutes, splatter galore for 10 minutes. the quality of the movie is okay, sound okay, no hiss, colors okay, black is black and not blue as in many low budgets. it's okay to watch it but you never will be frightened but it's one to watch with your friends having a beer and a pizza i guess. 555, naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah 333.
