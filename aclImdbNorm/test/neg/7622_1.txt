interesting topic. pathetic delivery - script and direction. <br /><br />our hero, miles, thaws out and has his emergency world-first life restoration surgery. this is where the fun begins. the underlying issue is that miles has no soul!!! this is used to explain his quasi-erratic behaviour of being indirectly responsible for two deaths (i believe this to be the total number of deaths in 104 minutes). <br /><br />on the livlier side, miles prefers the odd glass of brandy, blazing fireplaces and his young, maturing female cousin. the finale does indeed do justice to this film.<br /><br />some thoughts: 1. producer $$$ were parted with to create this tripe. j.d. feigelson was the script writer and a (or sole) producer. looks like he did not learn a lesson on "how not to bring an interesting idea to life" when one views his other writing credits. this will support the credibility of this script.<br /><br />2. now available on dvd!!! this is truly scary. should be forever "bottom of the shelf" in vhs format.<br /><br />3. a re-incarnated human without a soul will default to an evil entity. <br /><br />4. the score offers minimal support. not even an in-form jerry goldsmith could save it.<br /><br />5. deserved the 0230 time slot on tv and a touch more entertaining than the infomercials + test patterns it was competing against at the time of my viewing.<br /><br />6. thankfully did not spawn any sequels ala wes craven's "nightmare" franchise. chiller too: the return return of miles, or something like that.<br /><br />despite my rating of 1, i still recommend this movie as a great example of how to kill an acting or script-writing career. this should apply to directing, however wes craven will eternally be exempt due to his sole good piece of "a nightmare on elm street" 1984.
