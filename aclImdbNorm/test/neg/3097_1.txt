do yourself a favor and stay away from this film. minus 50 billion out of 10. if you want hard boiled action don`t rent it! if you want a good independent film look elsewhere!<br /><br />i never thought i`d see burt reynolds in such a crappy movie. it has the thinnest plot-line ever. van damm flicks should win an academy compared to this one.<br /><br />rob lowe once again prove why he is not the hottest actor in the world. even hasselhoff would have made a better drug addict than him. i do not want to bore you with more facts about this crappy movie, except to say that you are better off renting anything by hulk hogan or dolph lundgreen. this should prove my point, if you get my drift.<br /><br />
