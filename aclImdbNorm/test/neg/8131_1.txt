i unwittingly walked into this "trap" of a movie.<br /><br />if i could turn back time or simply get a refund i would be happy.<br /><br />it was 7:30pm and cinderella man didn't start until 10pm so i rushed into the theater to catch the movie that started at 7:20pm...and i dare say god reached out his hand (or retracted it) and allowed me to punish myself for my film gluttony by sitting in for this film.<br /><br />it may be unfair to criticize a movie that was not targeted at my heterosexual male cohort, however, there is no excuse for lousy sound and video editing. this movie was at most worthy of a highschool project budget...and i think i've seen better in those play acting french shorts that we used to do about louis laloupe.<br /><br />maybe it's because i'm canadian and this film was for the la fudge-packing crew and their sympathizing dames. woe was me when i realized that then entire audience save me cracked up at all the jokes and entendres...i fully understood the hinted humor...but i just could not relate.<br /><br />this show did show me, supposedly, how gay men date and build relationships. however, even if it was their purpose of the movie, i feel that the "gayness" was focused on too heavily....the humanity seemed lacking....but again, maybe that was the point...simply to be avant-gard...and to make a splash.<br /><br />i guess with a low budget and poor equipment, you have to make your movie as "loud" as possible in order to get crowds and cash return. i really wish i had simply read my sheldon van auken instead. hehe...i was totally the wrong audience.
