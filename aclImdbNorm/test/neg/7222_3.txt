riggs and murtough are back but the magic of the first film has disintegrated. the story line is just awful! i mean really, south african diplomats smuggling the mythical krugerrands into the u.s. it's just painful! and the accents are absolutely abysmal! can no one get an afrikaans south african accent right? or will we forever hear the british or americans making them sound like drunken hollanders? the only guy who got the afrikaans accent right was tim robbins in catch a fire. another thing about this movie that i disliked was when danny glover so artlessly describes an afrikaans accent as being shitty! i mean what a slap in the face to the afrikaans. there's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit. i mean mel gibson's character is like so against the diplomats but then sleeps with their p.a. type! don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film. if you want to see a film that doesn't completely insult a cultural group then rent die hard 2.
