make no mistake about, high school bigshot is a bad movie.<br /><br />high school bigshot is about a geek who makes a plan to become rich and get the girl. however, he goes about it all wrong, and of course by the end of the movie ends up dead along with a few other people, thankfully including the girl.<br /><br />the moral of the story is all women care about is wealth. also for us men, i guess we're just supposed to accept we either "have it" or "we don't have it"! <br /><br />i could easily see how this movie could be rated a 1, however it is above that of the very worst of movies. the acting's not totally horrible, and production values aren't ultra-terrible. over all it's a bad movie and not worth viewing for many reasons. if you insist of course at torturing yourself, watch the mst version. <br /><br />2/10 (maybe a 1.5/10)
