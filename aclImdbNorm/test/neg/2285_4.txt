thunderball and never are two of the biggest box office misses and never is a surprise farce from empire strikes back hero irvin kershner. klaus maria brandauer seems to steal the show, when, in the midst of the unfolding plot, bond's mission turns more to hollywood romp (sometime around when basinger comes in). how about klaus kinski? i still think that the casting of largo makes or, as is evident in both films, breaks the story. worst of all is the attempt to pass off the aging and very hairy connery off as the sex symbol he indeed was in the '60s. the '80s was a barren time for bond flicks mostly, though for your eyes only is a great title. at times, when i happen to need to waste some time over the holidays by watching this film in the often string of bond re-run festivals, i think the best attribute of the film is its score, and i'm not into soft '80s 'jazz'.
