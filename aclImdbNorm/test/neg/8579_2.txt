i attended a screening of 'the cooler' at the toronto film festival this year. while the other reviews i've read seem to be generally (and mystifyingly) positive, i must tell you without any kind of axe to grind that this film is unimaginably, unspeakably bad. the very brave and candid performances by william h. macy and maria bello have been horribly misspent on what is probably the least polished, most clich'ed script to have received the green light in years. i don't know how bad the brown bunny was, but i'm certain it couldn't have attained the dante-style depths that this one did. as courageous as their performances were, perhaps the bravest thing these otherwise brilliant actors did was to entrust themselves to such a dreadful director and abysmal screenplay.<br /><br />he must pitch pretty well in the boardroom, because he should never been permitted to be within a hundred yards of a camera. the dialogue is so embarrassingly contrived and clumsy that i actually found myself blushing during the screening. i am mortified that the talents of macy have been totally squandered in the hands of someone whose direction is as incompetent as his writing.<br /><br />watching gifted actors like alec baldwin labor through kramer's appalling script and ham-fisted direction was akin to watching a baby seal get clubbed to death - i felt angered, helpless, and sickened all at the same time. although i am always glad that there are investors and industry-people willing to take risks on quirky scripts with interesting premises, this picture was a total, utter fiasco. kramer couldn't have been crueler to these actors if he had himself taken a steel pipe to their knees. i hope for their sakes they can all avoid similar humiliations in the future. macy wisely ducked out the side door and didn't even stick around for the screening. regrettably, it seems that the bad luck of main character has rubbed off on the picture in the worst possible way. anyone accustomed to quality independents will likely find it completely unbearable.
