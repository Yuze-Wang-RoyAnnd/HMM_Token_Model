this film has been compared to the hilarious british comedy "a fish called wanda", although i can't see why. the only connection i can find is the monty python one (eric idle in "nuns", john cleese and michael palin in "wanda"). otherwise the two are incomparable.<br /><br />idle and robbie coltrane are two gangsters who want to get out of the business before they end up dead, so they decide to rip off their boss and make for rio. when the getaway goes wrong, the two are forced to take refuge in a convent, as nuns.<br /><br />what at first promises to be a riot soon becomes a predictable, average movie with the usual tasteless sex jokes and bland humour. once again there are the occasional high spots, but neither cast nor crew manage to inspire proceedings. an attempt at a "wanda" type manic finish fails too, along with the effort at "men in drag" humour, which is hardly surprising. when you think about it, men trying to be women is funny, men trying to be nuns is ridiculous.<br /><br />friday, april 22, 1994 - video
