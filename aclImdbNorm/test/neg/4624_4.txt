this movie started with some promise: big name cast, good looking sets, but then it fell apart.<br /><br />most of the time it can't tell whether it's a serious movie or a comedy. one minute they're talking about how there's no joy in killing and the next there is a fight scene set to funny music and funny banter.<br /><br />some of the acting is pretty bad, mainly from patrick swayze and piper perabo. she also gets some groaner lines like, "when i marry, it will be about love." ugh.<br /><br />but the worst thing about this movie is that it's just boring. not enough action, not enough humor, not enough plot, not much of anything really. just a lot of clich'es and cheesy moments.<br /><br />also, a movie with "dragon" in the title should contain a lot more dragons than the few (and pathetic cgi dragons) that appeared in this movie.<br /><br />can't the scifi channel show *any* good movies?
