this person is a so-called entertainer who has to resort to profanity, vulgarity, and slander to try and make others believe he has talent. i have often seen comics use a little of each with effect but when all you can say is laced with it, it is a sign of a drug affected warped mind. makes me wonder where his twisted and fried brain will be in a few more years of abuse. poor man!!! i admit i could not watch all of it - too stupid for words. the amazing part of this is that somebody actually believes he is a philosopher!!! no wonder self respect and decency are dwindling and perversity is rising. could it be that the ufc might have been a factor in his deadened brain?
