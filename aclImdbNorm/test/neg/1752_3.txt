some movies are not for everyone. this accurately describes igmar bergaman's movie, skammen (shame). at only 18, i still have what i guess you could call a minor form of add and well, i watch movies to be entertained. shame was a movie with a very interesting premise, of trying to convey the effect of war on the common people, it however fell short of accomplishing this for me. i don't know if it was the subtitles, black and white filming, length of the movie, or the fact that it took two hours out of my studying for a huge chemistry test, but i did not enjoy it. i understand it is considered a great movie and very important in the history of cinema, however, i think as my teacher pointed out, not everyone has liked or likes it. i guess i just wish it finished all of its many side plots. maybe the translation lost something, but i felt there were infinite little off shoots that never met a conclusion. you would meet characters and never see them again, or really understand why they were included in the movie. my overall recommendation for this movie is that it's worth seeing, but only to form your own opinion on it. whether or not you like or dislike it, it is necessary to respect the point that it is trying to convey.
