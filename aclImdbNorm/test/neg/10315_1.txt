this film stinks more than limburger cheese! if you find this at a garage sale, leave it there! i love sandra bullock and yet hate this movie... although ashamed, i do own a copy, and the studio has changed the cover to play on the fact that sandra bullock is in this at all. they play it up to be "a sandra bullock movie". she only has a small part in the whole movie and she does her best with that, but she is young and had not learned her talent yet. well everyone has to start somewhere...
