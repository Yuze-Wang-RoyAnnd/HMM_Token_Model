i was browsing through the movies on demand and saw underdog for free and it was only 82 minutes long so i decided to watch it. i wasn't expecting much but it exceeded my expectations of being awful. everything about the movie was cringe worthy. the dialogue was atrocious including many terrible puns. the jokes were also terrible. i found myself yelling and flipping off my television screen while i was suffering through this trash. it hit its target audience very well but i don't see how anyone else could enjoy this film. it made me very angry and nearly cry because of everything terrible this film had going for it.<br /><br />the only enjoyable thing about this movie was being able to give it a 1/10 after viewing it. i beg you to avoid it at all costs. i understand the fact that its made for kids but there is nothing likable about it at all.
