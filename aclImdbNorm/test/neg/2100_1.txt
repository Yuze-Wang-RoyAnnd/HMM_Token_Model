snakes on a train is a movie i rented due to the pure amusement of the thoughts i had, about the movie. snakes on a plane was an enjoyable action film, so obviously the film makers wanted to cash in on the success, with this low budget effort. at 85 minutes, snakes on a train is almost unbearable to witness. i had to keep pausing the film to do something to entertain myself, due to the lack of happenings in the film. throughout the duration of the film, it's never fully explained why this girl has this curse, or why she keeps coughing up this green/purplish goo constantly. not only that, there is endless boring dialog of the two main characters, brujo and alma discussing how to get rid of the curse. i can appreciate low budget film-making. i'm truly not picky on movies, i'm open to any genre or budget, but snakes on a train is truly one of the worst horror films i have ever seen. were the writers on acid or something at the end of this film?. why did the woman suddenly turn into a giant snake? and most importantly how on earth was it able to devour the train?.<br /><br />bottom line. snakes on a train is a movie that needs to be avoided at all costs. don't be intrigued like i was by the title, this is a movie that's seriously bad. let's put these snakes to rest<br /><br />0/10
