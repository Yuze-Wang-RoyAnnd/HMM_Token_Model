i for one was actually expecting this movie to be pretty good, maybe my expectations were a bit to high, but the fact is i love judd nelson. in fact he is the only reason this movie is worth watching and really his role isn't all that great. the main highlights of this film are raunchy sex scenes and boring dialog. if those are the highlights i'm sure your getting a pretty good idea of what kind of film this is. there is definitely a reason this was a made for television film. only see this one if you have nothing better to do on a friday night or just like to waste money on video rentals. save your time and rent the breakfast club!
