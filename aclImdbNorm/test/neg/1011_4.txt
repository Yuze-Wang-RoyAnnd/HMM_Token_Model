"death wish 3" is the movie equivalent of a shooting gallery. all the characters (apart from bronson's paul kersey, of course) exist merely to be killed, either as "provocation" (the good guys) or as "retribution" (the villains). the director simply pours on the mindless violence (people even get burned alive and blown up), turning this into an urban version of "commando" (and charlie, like arnold, rarely bothers to protect himself from the enemy gunfire). fans of this short of thing (and, apparently, there are many) will enjoy it, others....beware.
