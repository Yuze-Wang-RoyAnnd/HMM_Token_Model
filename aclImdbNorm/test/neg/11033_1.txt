avoid this film if you are looking for entertainment.<br /><br />it is filled with wannabes trying to be something that they are not and emraan is just wasted in the role of a tour guide who falls for a newcomer who needs to go to acting school. seriously, where to they get these people from? just because you're pretty doesn't mean you can act or should be an actress.<br /><br />asmit patel needs to send an apology letter to everyone who accidentally watches him makes a fool of himself in this poor excuse for a film. he plays an insipid wannabe gangster who drugs girls and forces them to fall in love with him and sells them off to the highest bidder.
