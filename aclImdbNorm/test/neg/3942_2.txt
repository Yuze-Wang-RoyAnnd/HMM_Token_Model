stay alive, stay alive, stay alive, i am called the attention it was the trailer and not the cartel.<br /><br />the topic of the movie centred on a video i play that was created by a countess to kill the people and to live eternally is acceptable.<br /><br />first that quite, bad movie of horror, the blood sees more or less sparked(spread gossip), these scenes is bled they are the more bad.<br /><br />but actually(indeed) that bad is this movie, very, very, bad, but bad in all the aspects.<br /><br />i do not recommend this movie to anybody, trailer well, movie bad.<br /><br />i do not deal since(as,like) they spend(consume) money and time doing these senseless movies and too bad.
