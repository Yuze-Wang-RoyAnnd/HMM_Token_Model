first, i would like to admit that chokher bali was not my cup of tea. this movie was evidently not targeted toward the masses. it's the type that critics would enjoy watching. the hype and publicity were quite misleading.<br /><br />i was expecting something very dramatic like devdas. understanding that the story and time-period demand it, i found the movie extremely slow-paced.<br /><br />i'm a die-hard aishwarya fan, and i regret to say that i thought she was miscast. the role of chokher bali required an actress who can portray herself as subversive, not innocent and naive. everyone else gave a good performance. tagore's depiction of the human condition does come across the celluloid to give the movie an interesting theme.
