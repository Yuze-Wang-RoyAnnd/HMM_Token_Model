terror in the jungle is a real find. if you saw it, you're one of the few lucky ones. it's hilarious!<br /><br />the story is about an airplane crashing in the middle of the south american jungle. the crash scene has to be seen to be believed. everyone dies in the crash or they're subsequently eaten alive by crocodiles. only a young blonde boy survives. a nearby tribes brings the kid to their village and they (all males) venerate him because of his golden hair! i kid you not! at the end, there's a lot of wrestling between the natives and the man on the search for any survivors of the downed airplane. all the while, the kid sits on a throne and his blond hair is surrounded by a golden halo and he cries nonstop!! it's a hoot!!!<br /><br />very obscure and contains very questionable subtexts. a must if you're into obscure, it's-so-bad-it's-good movies.
