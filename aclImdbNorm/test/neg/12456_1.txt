i'm not even going to waste more time describing how bad this movie is. bottom line: it was horribly acted, had enormous plot holes and went absolutely nowhere. the only good thing about it was the description my digital cable gave for the movie: "a married man with a struggling business has a fling with his secretary." huh?? wrong movie apparently, although it may have made things slightly more interesting if any of the description were true.<br /><br />--shelly
