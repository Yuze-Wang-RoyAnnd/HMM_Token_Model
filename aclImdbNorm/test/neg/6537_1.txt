in spite of many positive reviews this is a very slow film with three essentially good actors improvising the most banal dialog you will ever hear. this is another road movie that really goes no where. the camera frequently goes out of focus and the constant panning in some of the over long scenes is annoying.<br /><br />the three characters are attractive but note likable. the cast also sets what must be an intergalactic record for the use of the tired word "dude". (even howard stern has abandoned this tired pesudo pronoun).<br /><br />the three primary actors and one supporting actor show great promise. they are clearly comfortable and bravely allow themselves to be depicted as shallow and even goofy. the character actors all seem as they are plucky amateurs who generously volunteered to speak a few lines.. indeed they all physically fit their roles well.<br /><br />all in all a dull 90 minutes that seems more like an eternity. this is among my ten worst films of all time.
