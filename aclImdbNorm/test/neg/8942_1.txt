oh my god i am lost now i know everything this guy does is pointless r j a wrote at august 13th, 2006 (posting no. 881): what an awful experience. it looked like a bunch of 3rd graders stole a video camera, borrowed some old editing software from 1995, and played a joke on each other. trash rgc wrote at august 1st, 2006 (posting no. 747): this movie is a piece of @$#@#@. it sucks calling this a movie would be misleading. this was a group of friends having a good time and videotaping one another. the storyline was very hard to follow. the attempted artistic camera angles detracted from the story and in to themselves made the entire time a dizzying experience. the acting although comical was very amateurish. the concept is ok, i guess. perhaps next time, the producers should raise some capital and hire actual professionals and try again. i must say that i'm sick and tired of so many thinking that making a good movie is easy. it is not easy... this fact seems to be lost or ignored by many that believe that without any training/experience and talent that they can make a good product. i guess in the end they will learn just how difficult it is i am so disgusted i have no comment chrisite wrote at august 5th, 2006 (posting no. 762):
