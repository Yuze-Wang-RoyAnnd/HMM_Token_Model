this is about as pretentious a movie as a shallow director like joel schumacher could make, i suppose. a group of medical students take it turns to die for several minutes; upon revival they discover that their sins have manifested themselves somehow or other. as some of the characters are visited by dead people and some just seem to be haunted by their guilty consciences it's not quite clear exactly what the connection is, but the visions do all seem to look like sixth form art films. why the students treat their experiment as some kind of grand journey that'll make them famous is a bit of a mystery, as the results are completely unproveable and, as the movie mentions several times, have been documented plenty of times before. still, it's nice to see schumacher practising for his batman trainwrecks with a bit of the old neon paint and coloured lightbulbs. and william baldwin is a plank.
