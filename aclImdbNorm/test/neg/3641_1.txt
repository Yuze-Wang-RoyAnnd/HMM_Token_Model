right, where do i start? i cannot even imagine to comprehend this preteen pathetic excuse of a show. picture this: a boarding school, where kids whose parents are rolling in money simply chuck them in there so as to jet around the world themselves. it could not get any more diabolic than this.<br /><br />if you taught these kids, shall not even upgrade them to the term teenagers, because they hardly even act like sane homosapiens, were self-centered, think again. about 23 minutes choked full of their so-called problems, boy troubles, and the like.<br /><br />the heroine of the show, of course, mademoiselle zoey, played by britney's polly pocket little miss i'm all that sister, jamie lynn spears, has obviously much to learn about acting. however, i will give her some face, because her superficial, one dimensional character, does not allow much room for depth. she plays pacific coast academy's sun, moon and stars, crusader fighting for the plight of all women, equality of all genders.<br /><br />perfect in everyway, always with her two loyal sidekicks, nicole, the daffy bimbo, who obviously has too much of daddy's cash, and tough chick, dana, who proves a hard nut to crack. both left the show in seasons 2 and 1 respectively, not that i blame that. but horror of horrors, in comes lola, who deems herself the greatest actress since natalie wood, with green feathers in her hair and fake tan. she is even more rude than zoey herself, if that is even possible, and even more dumber than nicole, and hell, we know that cannot be possible.<br /><br />this show, like all the sorry excuses for television programmes nickelodeon has been spewing out since 2000s, is a prime victim of stereotyping. get girl next door and dense to her best friend's feelings for her zoey, a great albeit inarticulate at times best boy friend, chase, a cool, arrogant ladies man, logan, a boy and clothes crazy girl, who is not very bright, nicole, the one whom everyone thinks is weird just because she is extremely smart, the nerd, quinn, the over-dramatic, annoying yet super thin, malibu picture perfect model, lola, and the tough yet soft inside woman, dana. now, where have i heard these characters before? i am sorry, but what is so wrong with having a personality? just because quinn is passionate about science, and actually cares about her future and doing well in the academic aspect, in which the rest should be concerned about as well, she is "weird" and a "nerd"? lola at the beginning of the series, proved to be a potential great character with her sassy ways and different outlook in life, zoey just had to go, get out your pitchforks, burn her at the stake, she's going back to weird town and all that jazz. so much for womens rights. unfortunately, lola just became nothing more of another oc clone, in all its anorexic glory. probably so as to not outshine her mistress.<br /><br />but hey, the 2000 generation of myspace whores seem to love it with the chase/zoey typical fairytale romance, the tension between adamant, "hot" logan and "kick-ass" zoey or dana, whichever to your liking, and the pretty people. please, this show exists to remind us that people do not like realism, they prefer a pretentious, shallow and vapid lifestyle. sorry to break it to you darlings, that will not happen, unless you have a major trust fund and parents to cushion you.
