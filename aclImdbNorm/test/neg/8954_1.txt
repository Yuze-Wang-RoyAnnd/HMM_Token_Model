the fact that this cruddy series could elicit dozens of comments (much less hundreds of 'votes') speaks volumes as to the decline of western (or at least american) civilization.<br /><br />read proust, you morons!! or at least dave barry or calvin and hobbes anthologies.<br /><br />chuck norris. wrap your brains around the fact that in order to rate or write about this series you'd have to have spent minutes..nay, hours...viewing this poor sod treading the boards and spewing lines with less emotional impact than the gal who used to call off the correct time on your local service.<br /><br />please don't watch this show!! spare your few remaining brain cells!
