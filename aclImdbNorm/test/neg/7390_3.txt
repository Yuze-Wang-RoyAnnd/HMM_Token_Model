"the king is alive" is a flawed and contrived mess of a movie which comes off like a self indulgent auteur's excuse to transport a bunch of actors to a godforsaken namibian desert where he can play major-dogme-domo and film his selfishly conceived, silly, overwrought drama with utter disregard for the real forces of human nature, market appeal, common sense, and even good art. in other words this is one dumbassed flick and if you don't believe that, your penance is watching it. only for filmheads, critics, dilettantes, and the like.
