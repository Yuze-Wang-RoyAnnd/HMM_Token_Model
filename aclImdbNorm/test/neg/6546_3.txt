this movie has a few good performances going for it -- and that's all it has going for it. the leads, especially pauley perrette, are appealing. (although some of the bit players seem to be acting from a teleprompter.) the material -- that is the problem. i feel as though the screenwriter/director watched the entire run of felicity in one sitting, then sat down to write a script without catching any sleep. it really did remind me of felicity -- a thoughtful young woman finding herself, finding love, with a shake-them-up-and- see-what-happens approach to the characters and their relationships. except that while i usually enjoyed watching felicity, this movie left me cold. the writing is just awful. it's amazing that the cast could come off as well as they did, as the dialogue is dull at best. at its worst it becomes trite, stilted and amateurish. there is nothing original here, with plot elements recycled from gimmicks that weren't so brilliant to begin with. (angels and fortune tellers? come on.) for the first half of the movie, i rooted for the actors and hoped to be rewarded for my patience. by the second half, i just wished for it to end already. my sympathies to the cast, who deserved a better vehicle for their talents.
