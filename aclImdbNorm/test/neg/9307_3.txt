mr. accident is a deliberate series of non-stop disasters and near death experiences reminiscent of saturday morning's warner brothers cartoons. like the coyote who falls off the cliff 5 times per episode, the "leading man" (more like an over grown klutzy child) always manages to postpone his meeting with the grimm reaper.<br /><br />this australian "surprise" is offensively unfunny, and at times even depressing. the 2 (out of ten) are is for the visual stunts (some never attempted by anyone since daffy duck) and the use of vivid colors (like in those high class national laundry detergent commercials).<br /><br />there may be an age bracket where this "comedy" finds a following. i have definitely passed that age long ago. calling all preteens: here's a "ha-ha" for ya!
