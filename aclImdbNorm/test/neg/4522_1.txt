get smart should be titled get stupid. there is not one funny line or gag in the entire film. this film is so bad it makes the austin powers films look shakespearean. a few more films like this and steve carell can kiss his career goodbye. as for anne hathaway, what is she doing in this film? she's a good actress but is just plain terrible.<br /><br />the writing is pathetically lame. there is not one funny, clever, or witty line. there is not one good sight gag.<br /><br />the directing is terrible. comedy relies on timing. someone should tell the director that. every line that is supposed to be funny (and isn't) is delivered with absolutely the worst sense of comic timing i've ever seen.<br /><br />0 stars
