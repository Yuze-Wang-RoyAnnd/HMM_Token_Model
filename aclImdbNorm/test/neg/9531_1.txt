i am one of those people that respect every film-maker as having achieved, each film i watch i usually respect(although i admit i select carefully) and appriciate for what it is. not any more. this is truly one of the worst scripts i have seen produced as a film...so much so i felt compelled to warn others off it. the dialogue was truly unbelievable, the main protaganist was about the last person i would be interested in finding out more about. a scene were an old school friend 'tells it like it is' made me laugh only because it was a pathetic attempt to reveal the subtext of an already concluded plot. the direction is glib at best and at worst film-making by numbers. to compare this film to the atmospheric majesty of a film like five easy pieces is a travesty.
