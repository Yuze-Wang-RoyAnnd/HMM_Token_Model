ram gopal verma usually makes so-so cookie cutter formula fare, lifted from some hollywood flick. his every film after shiva is in the cookie-cutter genre. occasionally, he makes a truly horrible movie like this one. <br /><br />for the first 55 minutes, we are introduced to the only 2 characters, a struggling gymnast masquerading as a skilled dancer (go figure!) and a wannabe actor trying to strike it rich in bollywood. they fall in love, zero becomes hero, dancer/gymnast gets no break, gymnastics, angst, the usual heartbreak, more gymnastics, angst, song, dance, angst, some more gymnastics, more ridiculous gymnastics and before you know it, you're fast asleep. and this despite the hot sexy hot hot sexy hot bod of the leading lady-cum-gymnast-cum-dancer.<br /><br />but hey, you're not alone!! the editor, director, photographer, in fact the whole cast and crew are asleep thru-out the entire production. only difference being they got paid to snooze while you paid money for this crap, so you lose. ha, joke's on you. don't feel sorry for yourself but for our poor broke gal as she tones up daily in her high-rise penthouse in the sexiest of leotards and exercise-wear. puh-leese, when will the poor thang get a break, she's starr-vinnng?!<br /><br />antara mali cannot act. rgv's lost his marbles. abhishek tried hard but failed. no plot. no story. nothing. she must've paid rgv handsomely to make this all-nonsense stuff in addition to free gymnastics lessons on his casting couch. what a super deal. no need for an acting career.<br /><br />such absolute rubbish can only be "made in bollywood" of course!
