let's face it, a truly awful movie, no...i mean a "truly" awful movie, is a rare, strange, and beautiful thing to behold. i admite that there is a special place in my heart for films like plan 9 from outer space, half caste, species, etc. and although i'm giving this film a 1, i highly urge anyone who enjoys a bad film for what it truly is (a bad film) to find a friend, snacks, something to drink, and make the special occasion it deserves out of: aussie park boyz. <br /><br />from the very first moments of the lead actor's side to side eye-rolling performance as he attempts to inject intensity directly into the film without ever looking at a camera (a slice of ham straight out of silent pictures--eat your heart out rudolph valentino) to the sudden hey-we're-out-of-film conclusion, you...will...not...stop...laughing. <br /><br />to sum the film up, its a poor man's warriors down under, complete--and that description alone should be enough, but then comes the wonders of "the spaghetti eating scene", "the 'we've got their tickets; they won't be leaving town now' scene", "it's the asians! run!!" and more. the only truly objectionable part is a gratuitously filmed rape. outside of this, i dare you to watch this film. and i dare you to find evidence of acting, or lines, or direction, or any of those other boring and superfluous elements that so-called critics say a film needs to be judged as good. <br /><br />if this movie doesn't cause fits of uncontrollable laughter before it ends, all i can do is roll my eyes menacingly from side to side at you and shout, "you dog! you dog! you dog!"
