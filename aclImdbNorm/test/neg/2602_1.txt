ya know what? family guy started out as something fresh, funny and more original. the random humor used to be funny. i actually used to think it was the best animated sitcom next to the simpsons. after watching the new episodes that aired for the past few weeks; i grew fed up with the show relying too much on random humor to be funny. south park was right about fg dead on when they brought up the manatees and the idea balls.<br /><br />and watching the show itself, i don't understand why my parents like it so much; there's nothing great about it. the "intellegent" humor is funny and would've been funnier if the show didn't rely on randomness.
