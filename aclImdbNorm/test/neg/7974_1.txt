the first question is: how many talentless idiots it takes to screw a movie up? answer: one is more than enough, if he writes the screenplay and directs it. the second question is: did anyone teach the actors to handle guns properly? answer: hell no. i wonder if kristy swanson got hit across the face with hot brass - because it damn seemed so! the third question is: how many times we did the "super secret government agency conspiracy gets uncovered from inside" plot? answer: a good couple too many! the fourth question is: are michael madsen and ron perlman overrated? answer: in this movie, sadly, yes. the fifth question is: can a pair of boobs save this movie? answer: even three (kristy swanson's pair and the director/writer) didn't.<br /><br />god... if i see the (most probably) assassin getting her guns ready for a hit, and then the morons from prop department give her a completely different set the first bloody thing in the goddamn movie, the "suck" meter hits the peak. time from beginning of the movie to me switching the tv off: fifteen minutes. just a little bit more than it took me in case of "alone in the dark".
