to call this film a disaster will be an understatement. i don't even know where to begin! i have questions though, and lots of them. i would like to know who conceived of this script? who gave them money to make this film? who was in charge of casting and costuming? they should all be sued! i saw this film in my local library's catalog and i thought "hey! great!" i had just seen the two fog movies that hollywood had produced and then realised that bollywood had a version. unbeknowst to me, that it would turn out to be a total and utter crap-fest! <br /><br />dhund - the fog, is a film about four friends (actually just one of them but you should know that there are four friends), one of them is a beauty queen (played by india's 1st mrs. world, aditi govitrikar) and the director spares no expense at letting you know this. the script even claims that she (the character's name is simran) has aishwarya rai eyes, kareena kapoor lips and rani mukherjee hair. feel free to barf if you want to, at least at this point you haven't seen the film, unlike poor me. :*(<br /><br />anyway, simran receives a death threat one day from one of the contestants' uncle, who tells her to drop out of the contest so that his niece would have a better chance of winning, but simran's boyfriend doesn't allow her to do this and thus she participates in the pageant and wins. this causes the crack-cocaine-sniffing uncle of her former college classmate tanya to come after her. but with the help of her cousin kajal, simran drowns the culprit and they enlist both their boyfriends in the task of getting rid of the body. it's tough but they eventually get around to doing it.<br /><br />in a scene that borrows from hollywood's film diabolique, the pool where the dead body is hidden is drained only to reveal that the body is missing and this begins a conundrum of whodunit and where-is-it? by the time the film is over, the film successful steals scenes from 'i know what you did last summer, i still know, scream 1, scream 2, scream 3, murder she wrote episodes and not to mention, columbo and scooby doo'! shameless, i tell ya!<br /><br />inconsistencies and problems within the film include but are not limited to: <br /><br />1. a scantily clad simran answers phone-calls three times from her would-be-killer, the camera shows her drop the phone off the hook yet the phone is able to ring again each time and she picks it up to answer. <br /><br />2. tanya tries to kill herself because she doesn't win the beauty contest? wtf? even aishwarya rai who is ten time more beautiful did not attempt suicide when she didn't win miss india!<br /><br />3. in the pool scene, the kids who come to retrieve the ball that has fallen into the pool conveniently disappear as soon as the police arrive. and the ball disappears too. <br /><br />4. the clich'e blue contacts lenses of the killer change from blue to brown in the drowning scene, yet when his corpse surfaces again, his eyes are blue. <br /><br />5. nobody who dies in the film is mourned (strange, especially for indian society).<br /><br />6. when vikram jumps into the dirty murky pool, an underwater camera shows us his actions and miraculously the pool is transformed to olympic size and is clean and clear as day. <br /><br />7. sexy belly-dancer performs a pseudo-orgasm drenched song and dance number about coming of age. that would have been cool for some bachelor party, but they were celebrating simran's pageant win! hello!!!! <br /><br />8. kunal, sameer, simran and kajal can neither dance nor lip synch properly. but don't blame them, just accept that there was no choreographer for the dance numbers.<br /><br />9. nothing within the film was choreographed, it was like they just told the actors to show up and do whatever the want. <br /><br />10. the film played out like there was no script. either that or the director was high and drunk when filming this junk!<br /><br />11. when simran's picture was published without her consent in a magazine, she flew to the police headquarters to have the photographers arrested, yet she receives death threats and never bothers to alert the police.<br /><br />just to mention a few of course. this film was a painful experience for me and i advise everyone to skip it by all means necessary and possible. bollywood should be terribly ashamed of this kind of film-making.
