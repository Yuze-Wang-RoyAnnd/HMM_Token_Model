i just wanted to leave a quick comment as its not listen on here ,but i have just seen this movie,the version i just rented was released in 2005 as far as i know and it was actually called "don't go into the attic" i only realized it was the same movie as devils harvest upon searching for some of the actors who looked familiar in the movie. anyways i'm in ireland so maybe this has only been released over here and in the uk now,but thats what its called over here..........not really like it matters because i would not recommend this movie.the only words that spring to mind watching it are cheese cheese cheese!! my one mark out of ten is purely for the one little jumpy bit :o)
