the combination of dan haggerty (elves) and linda blair (exorcist) is enough to make any horror fan excited about this movie. and once you see the cover art to this film of a frozen zombie coming out of their cryogenic chamber, you'll think you were in b-movie horror heaven. at least that's the way i approached this film. but boy, was i in for a shock<br /><br />i love horror movies. i love b-movies as well. nothing makes my day more than a cheesy little film about zombies, monsters, murderers, that sort of thing. but to say that this movie was lacking, is an understatement. this movie was pure trash. you'd think the zombies would look somewhat like what the cover-art of the box displays, but instead, you get actors with masks that are clearly sold at any halloween display counter. furthermore, the script is beyond pitiful. our main character, joseph, suffers the loss of his wife and son and seeks solace in the warm-hearted mary, played by blair. not once do you see any sign of sadness or discomfort on the part of joseph's character. instead, we see the head of the cryogenic labs, a man named dr. miller, eager to get the dead bodies and experiment with their organs. there is no emotion or anything to make you believe you should give a damn about anyone in this film.<br /><br />all and all, very disappointing. all the elements to make a great horror film were there. you had your zombies, your decent actors, and your story. but the lack of good writing and little if any sense of direction screwed this one up royally. overall, 4 out of 10
