i am shocked and amazed to find reviews short of miserable for this horrible film. i rented this "movie" or feces, whatever you wish to call it, with several friends and after thirty minutes we had to stop watching. just listening to the dialog left a horrible taste of sour milk in my mouth. this film was about as intelligent as an ass pimple.i hope i never see that bra-less, raggedy anne look alike (julianne nicholson) again.it was like watching the most putrid pilot for a sitcom that will never make it to television, but instead of being a quick but painful 30 minutes( all i could bare)this was an excruciating 90 minutes.
