while the david lynch version of dune is choppy, awkward, and unfaithful to the novel, it is visually well designed and well acted. the best one can say about the sci fi channel's attempt to make dune into a miniseries is that it's ambitious. actually, that is virtually the only positive praise one can offer. the actors (with few exceptions) seem happy to recite their lines with the least emotion possible, and the least appropriate accents. the costumes seem to have been designed by someone with a a large surplus of mylar fabric on hand and an unhealthy love of unflattering headwear.<br /><br />in part, this miniseries suffers from living in the shadow of lynch's already well known effort. however, it takes elements from lynch's film which were not present in the novel and copies them nearly wholesale (i.e. the guild steersman's navigation sequence), and this only encourages encourages negative comparison to lynch's film. a for effort. d for virtually everything else.
