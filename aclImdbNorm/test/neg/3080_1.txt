committed stars (heather graham) along with (casey affleck) and (luke wilson). its the story of joline who is determined to find her ex-husband who is in the process of a mid-life crisis. <br /><br />committed was not at all what i expected it was lacking in comedy which was ultimately the genre. it was beyond stupid and un-realistic, casey affleck delivered a reasonable performance, graham's recent roles have been lack-luster and this is not an improvement.<br /><br />graham's most recent role was blessed which i also found misleading and didn't appeal to me at all.<br /><br />pros affleck<br /><br />cons predictable, unrealistic, poor acting and not a comedy movie!
