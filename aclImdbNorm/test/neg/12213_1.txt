i am an atheist with little love for certain aspects of christian fundamentalism.<br /><br />that said, this movie is reprehensible, vile and transparent. it only works on the level of the currently fashionable (and tired) hatred motif of white american christian fundamentalism. had this movie been made about a fundamentalist jewish or muslim family, or even a black christian family, the outrage would have been palpable, and the movie would have been roundly panned in all circles. as it stands, though, it's "ok" and "artful" because white christian fundamentalists remain one of the last "acceptable" targets for garbage such as this.<br /><br />and garbage it truly is. if you want to see a quality film of a similar bent, find and watch or review "badlands." nothing good was done in "the king" that wasn't done better decades ago in that masterful film.<br /><br />as other reviewers note, the characters are almost completely undeveloped in "the king," the lines are a snooze, the cinematography is lackluster. we've seen the tale of the sociopath done better 100 times. this movie doesn't cut it for thoughtful viewers.
