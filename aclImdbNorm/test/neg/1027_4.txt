technically abominable (with audible "pops" between scenes)and awesomely amateurish, "flesh" requires a lot of patience to sit through and will probably turn off most viewers; but the dialogue rings amazingly true and joe dallesandro, who exposes his body in almost every scene, also gives an utterly convincing performance. a curio, to be sure, but the more polished "trash", made two years later, is a definite step forward. i suggest you watch that instead.
