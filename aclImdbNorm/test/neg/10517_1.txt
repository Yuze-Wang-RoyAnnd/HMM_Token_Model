everyone knows that late night movies aren't oscar contenders. fine. i mean i'll admit that i was a bit tipsy and bored and figured i'd get to some skin-a-max. it's pretty bad when the info on the tv guide channel makes fun of the movie in the description. it even gave it half a star. to be fair, i did sit throw the whole thing cause man it was soooooooooo bad. i couldn't stop laughing. i mean the words coming out of these people mouth and how they were trying to be serious. most of the time i think the people on the screen were trying their hardest to not to laugh. in fact i think in one scene they did laugh. anyways the movie didn't make sense. it was like that one sopranos episode with the fat gay guy. only the sopranos is great show. but it was terrible, i mean, no nudity, just sex scenes out of the 90's. you know the kind that use shadows and silhouettes instead of flesh. i gave it a two cause this flick makes for a good drinking game movie. i mean with all the cheese, it helps to get the wine out. if its late at night, and all that is on tv is this and that tony little guy and his exercise bike, then i suggest tony little.
