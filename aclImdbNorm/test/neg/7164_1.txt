films like this infuriate me simply because they don't deserve the funding that enables them to end up in my dvd player. this movie is ambiguous in its jacket blurb and even more impenetrable in its casting choices (why is ms. song a romantic interest? did they just want an asian woman in there, or does her unconvincingly wise character actually lend this "message" movie's story a fresh perspective)? one has very little to go on in approaching this film, and even less as the story unfolds. but a good hour into the proceedings, i realized the dull casting is all the casting agent could dredge up, the unconvincing character studies are the result of writers' brain-fart, and the story is amorphous and plagued by unsubtle references to the woes of capitalism, materialism, and getting ahead in the postmodern world. towards the end of this film, just before i nodded off and missed the last two minutes, i got the sense that "everything's gone green" is a product of "connections" in the world of film - someone with very little talent knew someone with very little directorial skill, knew someone with absolutely no marketing sense (but plenty of disposable ego) and out popped this dull and inefficient attempt at whimsy and humor-with-a-conscience nonsense. and this is what is most maddening - how many infinitely better scripts were passed over in favor of this almost unwatchable tripe? skip this film, and feel good about yourself for doing so.
