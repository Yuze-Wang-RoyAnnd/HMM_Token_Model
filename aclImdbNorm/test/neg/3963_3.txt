you know the movie could have been a lot better when the animal - in this case, a little dog - is the best actor on the screen! the acting in this film is so bad, so amateurish, by dog got embarrassed watching this. he ("rusty," our golden retreiver) could have done a better job than the people in here.<br /><br />by now this is almost a trite story: kid finds animal, pet is not liked nor wanted by one of the parents but the "pet" winds up saving one the kids and is now a hero and an official member of the family. sound familiar? <br /><br />i remember this movie being a big hit, but never got around to seeing it until the mid '90s on vhs. i was shocked how bad it was. why so much fuss over a film? was it because there was so much sleaze in the early '70s that a nice family film stood out in the crowd? possibly. there wasn't a whole lot of wholesome entertainment in the decade of the '70s plus a lot of people are suckers for cute little animal stories. who could resist this cute little dog? not me. but the movie i can resist: it's a grade b storyline with horrible acting. <br /><br />recommended only for small-dog animal lovers and i mean "lovers" because even the average pet owner will fall asleep trying to watch this film in this day-and-age.
