there are many mysteries in life. for example: why did any of the people other than carrot top agree to appear in this movie? why did anyone distribute this movie? why did anyone pay money to see it? i guess none of these questions will ever be answered, but one thing i know for sure, this movie is one of the worst ever made with a budget this big. it would already be bad, but the addition of carrot top's "humor" makes it even worse. the only entertainment one could possibly get from this movie is to burn it, smash it, or otherwise destroy it in an amusing fashion. if you were to rank it against every movie ever made, it would be right between "problem child" and "biodome". nuff said.
