this isn't exactly a complicated story. it's not a mystery, or a plot you have to spend time re watching because you missed an intrinsic part of the dialog. claiming a movie has to be seen multiple times for you 'to get it' may apply to a very few films, however this isn't one of them. those type of movies have substance and are so involving it's easy to miss an important portion of dialog, or a subtle nuance to plot details you may have overlooked. with goya's ghosts this doesn't apply. the main flaw in this movie is an absence of detail. it jumps from one character to the next, never giving enough substance to any one set of scenes to allow the involvement of those watching. because of that you don't connect with any of the characters. you don't get to the point where you care. either the main actor is gone just as the movie seems it's going to redeem itself, or their actions are despicable and you're not inclined to anyway. goya's refusal to go very far to help ines is a good example. his refusal to commit himself further mirrors the overall tone of his part. the only characters you may momentarily feel for are ines, when she's being questioned and then tortured. after her rape by lorenzo any focus on her character is pretty much gone. following that the only other in depth involvement comes from the best scenes in the movie centered around lorenzo's invitation to supper with ines' family, and her fathers all out attempt to force lorenzo into signing a bogus confession and getting his daughter back. then just as things start to be developing again, they're gone from the movie. i've read a lot of the comments here about how the movie didn't know what it wanted to be, etc. i found that basically it succeeded in not being much of anything. from lorenzo's return and the coincidental viewing of ines' daughter by goya, everything seemed nothing more than contrived. without much of a storyline, no effort to really examine the turbulent times they lived in took place. the essence of who goya was didn't materialize, other than his actions, or lack thereof, proving him to be more self-centered than anything else. as for his art, the movie seemed intent on examining a few of the paintings he did but again frittered away another opportunity in examining the reactions to this work rather than the work itself. to sum things up best, the movie had no cohesion, it grossly lacked the substance to delve into the historical environment it covered, and upon ending, left you feeling like what you'd just seen was a series of aborted attempts to engage the viewer by switching from one thing to the next without adequately engaging the viewer in any of them. you can't watch something like this several times expecting it to improve with added examination. there's just not enough to it to waste the time. it's not a case of your missing out on something, it would just be more proof that the ingredients needed to make this movie good, just aren't there. as for best film ever made? it's not even the best film i've watched today.
