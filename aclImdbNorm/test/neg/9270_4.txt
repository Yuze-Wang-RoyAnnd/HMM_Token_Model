this is a very strange film, with a no-name cast and virtually nothing known about it on the web. it uses an approach familiar to those who have watched the likes of creepshow in that it introduces a trilogy of so-called "horror" shorts and blends them together into a connecting narrative of the people who are involved in the segments getting off a bus. there is a narrator who prattles on about relationships, but his talking adds absolutely nothing to the mix at all and just adds to the confusion. as for the stories themselves, well.. i swear i have not got a clue why this movie got an 18 certificate in the uk, which would bring it into line with the likes of nightmare on elm street and the exorcist. nothing here is even remotely scary.. there is no gore, sex, nudity or even a swear word to liven things up, this is the kind of thing you could put out on children's tv and no-one would bat an eyelid. i can only think if it had got the rating it truly deserved (a pg) no serious horror fan would be seen dead with it, so the distributor probably buffeted the bbfc until they relented. anyway, here are the 3 tales in summary: 1. a man becomes dangerously obsessed with his telekinetic car to the point of alienating his fiancee. 2. a man who lives in a filthy apartment is understandably freaked out when a living organism evolved from his six-month old tuna casserole. 3. a woman thinks she has found the perfect man through a computer dating service.. that is until he starts to act weird.. and there you have it. some of them are pretty amusing due to their outlandish premises (my favourite being number 2) but you get the feeling they were meant to be a) frightening and b) morality plays, unfortunately they fail miserably on both counts. to sum up then, this flick is an obscure curiosity.. for very good reasons.
