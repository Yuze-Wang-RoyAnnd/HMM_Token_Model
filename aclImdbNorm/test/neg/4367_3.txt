it would be wrong and reprehensible of me to advise you to watch killjoy 2, you must have better things to do, washing the car, throwing stones in a stream, but at the same time it's nowhere near as awful as you probably think it is. it's almost a proper film, which a lot more than most straight-to-dvd sludge can manage. killjoy 2 is helped a great deal by trent haaga's manic turn as the eponymous clown, he throws himself into the role with such fevered abandonment that he almost tips the scales in the movie's favour, but, of course, it takes more than one man in big shoes. tammi sutton gives the most entertaining director cameo since roger corman in creature from the haunted sea and the whole thing is nearly destroyed by the rushed, sugary ending. all over the place and almost good fun.
