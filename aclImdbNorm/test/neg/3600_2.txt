this coming from an adult who happened to come across the first one expecting a movie aimed towards children and was surprised at the adult humor that was in emperors new groove. the character i liked most of all was kronk, so i was thrilled when i heard of the sequel (sp) featuring non other than "kronk".<br /><br />i just watched kronk's new groove, it took me two days because i had to shut it off, i was so bored halfway through it. i finally watched the rest of it the next day and unfortunately the 2nd half was every bit as lame as the first.<br /><br />being a disney film, i was expecting to have some musical scenes, however this one was filled with them and they were not amusing. the great thing i found about emperors new groove was that it could be appreciated by a wide audience, from toddlers to adults. kronks new groove in all honesty did nothing for me nor my girlfriend and we both loved the first. it is really aimed towards young children, the comedy is pretty childish, the musical scenes are not very well done and the plot itself is extremely corny.<br /><br />save yourself some money and rent this movie if possible because its definitely not worthy of a second viewing. i was extremely disappointed and shocked at how thrown together this film was. they actually managed to make a character(kronk)not funny in this film, that is amazing in itself.<br /><br />obviously every ones opinion differs but i am very easily amused, i usually enjoy sequels (sp) even when others discredit them, mostly because i loved the first so much i needed more of the characters and no matter how bad the plot was i would enjoy the film. i cannot say the same for this one, i never would have thought i would be turning it off half way through due to pure boredom.<br /><br />buy at own risk.
