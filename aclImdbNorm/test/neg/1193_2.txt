i am a massive fan of the log. i thought the first two series provided some of the best comedy this country has ever seen and the third series, though different, was wonderfully dark and imaginative. the thought of seeing tubbs, edward and briss on the big screen made july 3 something to wait for. yet, somewhere, it all went horribly wrong. the writers had no story and no real ideas. the part set in old england showed the glimmers of genius that we know the league are capable of but these scenes did not fit well with the film. geoff provided the best of too few, largely poor jokes and lipp and briss's performances were big let-downs. if you love the league, save yourself the time and money and watch episodes from the tv series again. and again. a massive disappointment.
