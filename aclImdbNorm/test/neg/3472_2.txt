for a good take on the roman empire watch the excellent bbc produced miniseries "i, claudius". this just sucked. the acting was pathetic and you could almost see the actors looking at the camera. hans matheson was irritating. cheese factor was so high that it promotes constipation with repeated viewings. even caligula was tame. i think this film was silently supported by "religious" groups who shall remain nameless ;). the overt tones of christian favoritism and persecution were blatant if that gives any hint. stay away what ever you do - the running time is so long that i was able to read harry potter's first book faster than the time it took to view this tripe.<br /><br />italy has done better - don't let hans cute face fool you. he is not a great actor...he is a great bore.
