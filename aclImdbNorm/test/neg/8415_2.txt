i was hoping that pulp would be a interesting movie, but was profoundly disappointed.<br /><br />pulp has very little storyline, and what there is never holds your interest. it was a real struggle to keep watching it. when its over you say to you self "huh? that's it?!?". this is one where you think after watching it - why did they ever bother?<br /><br />its too bad since michael caine is a good actor. i was also hoping to see the great lizabeth scott in this, but she only appears on screen for a total of perhaps one minute. scott is one of the all time great film noir femme fatale girls and this was her last film.<br /><br />oh well...
