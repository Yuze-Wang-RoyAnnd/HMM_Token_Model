hilarious!! i would have sworn ed wood wrote this. terrible. i loved every frame. bad movie aficionado's, this is your trophy! i will watch it again. words cannot explain how entertaining this movie is. pare's career must have dipped low, but i really think he's heading in the leslie nielson direction. he was perfect for this. terrible, just terrible!! you'll love it!! get some friends, lots of beer, and you'll have the time of your life. it's an mst3000 party, waiting to happen. enjoy!! it is worth the rental!! you like the "colombo type" cop and the comic relief coroner. the bad guy will have you on the floor laughing. he's also in another pare movie, komodo vs cobra, and he's just as good there. i don't know what the budget was but they'll get it back because this film is destined to be the best unintended comedy of the year.
