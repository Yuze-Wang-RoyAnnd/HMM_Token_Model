it's weird, this film; you get the impression that the makers of this snooze-fest spent more time in the local bars than on set. in fact, it's a surprise not to see harry alan towers' name on the credits; it certainly has the flavour of one of his tax-shelter productions but here the motivation behind the project seems to be for all involved to enjoy a prolonged stay in provence. despite the fact that the film is supposed to take place all over the region, les baux and the area around it stands in for almost everything.<br /><br />david birney makes for a spectacularly colourless hero - as michael lonsdale says at one point "you're a walking clich'e". what lonsdale is doing in this is anyone's guess. for some reason, the most interesting character, played by rampling, is sidelined, whereas, regardless of the book, she should have been the central figure because she clearly has the skill to carry the movie (which would have been dull anyway, but at least we'd have got more of something pretty to look at).<br /><br />all in all a pointless affair that is only worth watching to see how action-less an action movie can be.
