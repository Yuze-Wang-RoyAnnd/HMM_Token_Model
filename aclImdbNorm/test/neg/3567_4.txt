would a different translation have made it chillier or scarier? are the subtitles too compact to convey the nuances of the original language? does it even matter? you may have heard that great actors can make reading a phone book exciting. well, this is an opportunity to judge for yourself. <br /><br />if this isn't about homosexuality, murder, dismemberment, psychopaths, insanity, deviant psychology, then it is about acting - acting helped along with lots of dialog, so, enjoy the acting or muse about how titillating the dialog actually is.<br /><br />for english speakers, "twelve angry men" might be a better choice. there's a bit more interaction, and you can judge if the acting is consistent with the dialog. you don't have to wonder if you're missing something.<br /><br />i would recommend andy warhol's "empire" to those who like this film.
