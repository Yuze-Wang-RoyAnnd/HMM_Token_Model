for any wrestling fan, this is the wrestlemania to forget. no logic to the matches, some garbage gimmicks (doink the clown, and the giant gonzalez) this was a forgettable ppv something rare for the wwe(f). the logic of hogan winning the world title at the end made no sense, and many people feel that alone help put the nail in the ppv. from the meaningless gimmicks of the roman soldiers, to simply some real bad wrestling (doink vs crush being the worst match) to simply bad match making (scott "razor ramon vs bob backlund, how can you have one of the greatest mat wrestlers, making a comeback, and working his first wrestlemania, face a power wrestler who was undefeated at the time), this is a ppv that even the wwe has since admitted, was way below what the expected. just all around a stinker
