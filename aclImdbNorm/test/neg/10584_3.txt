it's not fair. i was really expecting this to be a hilarious, entertaining movie. i mean, i like drake bell from drake and josh, and leslie neilson is nothing to be sneezed at since his earliest classics, airplane and the naked gun. however, after seeing superhero movie, i'm glad i didn't even have to pay for it. it just wouldn't have been anywhere near the 9$ per ticket. more like a dollar and a few pennies. because that would sum up for the hour and a few minutes. and as disappointing as this film was i'm glad the running time was that short, if not shorter. i just cant believe how incredibly vulgar, unnecessary, and above all, stupid, some of the scenes were! and above that, i've seen better acting from a wooden dummy(without the ventriloquist). it's as if craig mazin purposefully wanted to make a film that deserves its 3.7, if not lower, and even try to be worse than "meet the spartans". very disappointing indeed.
