"go fish" garnered rose troche rightly or wrongly the reputation of a film maker with much promise.<br /><br />its then hard to understand how she could turn out a movie made up of stereotypes that one associates with inferior sitcoms. the entire film rings hollow. i cringed the whole way through.<br /><br />its supposed to be a look into nineties human sexuality. well not much more here to be learned than from "in and out". by now most of us actually do know, that there are men who are sexually attracted to women and there men who are sexually attracted to men and there are even men sexually attracted to both sexes. <br /><br />seldom has this revelation been portrayed on the screen with so little wit and style.<br /><br />pathetic.
