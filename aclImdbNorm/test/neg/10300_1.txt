in the european tv industry, movies like this one are called "stickers". tv stations buy them and air them because when they wanted to buy broadcast rights to, let's say, titanic, some not-really-blockbusters were a part of the deal.<br /><br />14 hours is a story of a hospital, its employees and patients who have to face the worst flood slash storm ever. unfortunately almost from every scene or shot one can tell that is was a low-budget film.<br /><br />newborn babies are very obviously not real, there is no background action and probably the worst thing is the doctor-acting. the actors are not believable in their roles: their lines, when spoken, sound way too memorized, as if this was a read-out camera test.
