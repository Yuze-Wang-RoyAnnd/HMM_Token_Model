seriously, i couldn't find anything that constituted a rational human thought in this movie. for some reason, the writer decided to have a bunch of actors in random places grunting, groveling and yelling like cro-magnon bipeds. i understand that this was about gymnastics, but seriously, what's with all the roaring and human bleating ? i also saw at least five actors with overactive terrets syndrome and stage 10 syphilis.<br /><br />although this movie has actual human acrobatics, i must say it is surprising that you can make a movie like this without having any intelligible form of human speech patterns. this is truly a milestone in the history of film-making because there was no conscious decision to make the characters express anything more than a timely urrrrr ! or rfff ! sound.<br /><br />incredible.
