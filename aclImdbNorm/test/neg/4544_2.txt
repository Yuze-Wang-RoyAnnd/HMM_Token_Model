woof! pretty boring, and they might as well have shot it in black and white, it was so colorless.<br /><br />the movie starts with rolling text explaining cryogenics, and asking whether god or satan is behind it. there are some protests outside a cryogenics lab. some people rob a bank, and many of the robbers and guards get shot. the father of one of the robbers (i think) arranges to have his son frozen. there's a lot of jumping around in the beginning from scene to scene introducing characters without us knowing how they relate.<br /><br />there's a power outage, and the cannisters containing the frozen people get struck by lightning, and they emerge as zombies. they're all wearing silver mylar-like suits, and their skin is dark green and wrinkled (no idea why they look so bad - being frozen evidently didn't preserve their looks), and they have silver eyes. they go around killing people, sometimes lurching like zombies, sometimes moving like normal people.<br /><br />linda blair keeps showing up every once in a while, to what purpose i'm not really sure. i think her character works at the cryogenics lab, but she's not very important to the plot, and her role is very small.<br /><br />the movie ends with some freeze frames with text captions that tell us what happened to the characters next, which are pretty silly.
