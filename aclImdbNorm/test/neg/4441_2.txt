the earlier review is pretty much on target, which altman was not with this film. i haven't seen it since its original release but i have seldom spent two hours in a theater feeling as miserable and disappointed as i was with this film. if some pretentious community theater attempted a sci-fi version of a ingmar bergman film, it might come off like this. i can't bring myself to give anything altman has made a "1" but this is probably the nadir of a career that has had some remarkable highs and lows. i would have walked out, but as a paid film critic i couldn't. (think about that the next time you envy movie critics.)
