i guess i was prepared after all the years of hearing about it. first heard about it from siskel and ebert. when they said divine ate excrement, i had to look it up. then a friend told me about it in 1991. she said also that her parents saw it when it first came out and that her mom almost dumped her dad over it! so by the time i caught pink flamingos on sundance today, i was prepared. for the most part.<br /><br />i still couldn't help but be surprised by the anal close-ups and the blowjob scene. that said, the only characters i sympathized with were edie and the egg man. her crying scene early in the film, though over something frivolous to normal people, actually makes me sad. though she sure wasn't pretty, she had a cute voice. i was happy for her and the egg man, and they actually touched me.<br /><br />on the other hand, the acting in this poverty-level production was not good. and as for the script, just how does john waters come up with this stuff? well, at least it's different.
