i enjoyed the prequels, and found the relationship between tucker and chan previously hilarious. rh3, however, was a re-hash of the first two without the charm or humor. i think i may have laughed once - and it was during the ngs. tucker was exceedingly annoying in this film, and his character didn't seem to have any purpose other than to bungle everything up in the most irritating way possible. chan is always likable, but he seemed tired in this film. i was able to predict everything - who the villain was, who the girl was, (spoiler alert) who the good-guy-turned-bad-guy was, etc. i hope to see more movies from tucker and chan in their separate endeavors, but not in any more rush hour sequels. it's just too tired. i recommend a rental, but not a purchase.
