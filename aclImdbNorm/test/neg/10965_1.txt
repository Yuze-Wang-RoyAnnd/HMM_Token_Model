produced by nott entertainment, this movie is "nott" very good at all. i sat through the first 15 minutes of the film before judging that the acting is bad, the casting is bad and camera work is bad. as i hear that there is a download of this film floating around on the internet, it is "nott" even worth the bandwidth.<br /><br />up until the time i wrote this review, the average vote for this movie was an 8.5, which prompted me to view it and there was an average high majority of 10's for it, obviously voted on by liars and shills. this movie is "nott" for everyone. or parents, if you want to punish your kids with this awful film, have them sit through this one for halloween.
