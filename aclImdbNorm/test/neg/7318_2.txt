oh boy.. this movie is so mediocre i don't really know what exactly to write about it. <br /><br />i think it's easier to write what it's not: <br /><br />it's not very entertaining. it's not original. and there's not one character in the whole movie i cared about.<br /><br />kind of reminds me of a certain reality tv show on mtv, but without any interesting people. it just drags on and on and i could hardly wait for it to end. the only thing that kept me from switching it off was jennifer lyons (c:<br /><br />i thought a long time about this movie to find one good thing to say about it. what i liked was the reminder not to judge a person by the first impression you get (as holly did when she accused nicole) which earns it a score of 2 out of 10 instead of a 1.
