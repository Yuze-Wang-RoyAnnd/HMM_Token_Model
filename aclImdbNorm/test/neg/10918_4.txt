cujo is a movie adaptation of a novel of the same name written by stephen king.<br /><br />i've never read the novel but just scanning the comments page has given me some insight. i noticed a reference to the change in the ending.<br /><br />the plot of the movie is as follows - a st. bernard dog gets bitten by a rabid bat and goes on a killing spree.<br /><br />the plot sounds quite worn now, having been done in various movies. however it might have been something new when king wrote the novel. or perhaps king's novel put a twist on the story that was never shown in the movie.<br /><br />anyway, the first 40 minutes of this movie have nothing at all worth mentioning other than the dog being bitten. nothing else happens - nothing scary, nothing funny, nothing to add depth to the characters and nothing interesting in any other respect. i found this section difficult to sit through and was constantly shouting at the tv, "come on, get started!". the events that i was seeing on the screen were reminiscent of a tv movie of the drama genre or an extended episode of a tv soap opera. unfortunately, there was only one family in the movie given any focus so it couldn't even work on a soap opera level. the dog was the best character in the movie, but it didn't get enough screen time in this section. there was nothing to indicate why this dog would go on a killing spree later.<br /><br />after the 40 minute mark point, something finally happened. the dog suddenly transformed from a lovable pet into a vicious killing machine. it began attacking some people. there was also an interesting cat-and-mouse chase when two characters became trapped in a car, unable to leave because the dog would attack them. even in this overly long second half, the suspense would build up well before dying again. it was just a stop-go situation repeated over and over again until the movie reached its conclusion.<br /><br />without giving the ending away, i can tell you it was very formulaic and unworthy of a stephen king story.<br /><br />the suspense scenes when they are on the screen are exciting to watch. some great camera angles add menace to the dog's vicious nature when he attacks people. this is particularly important because as others have mentioned a st. bernard dog is nowhere near as scary as, say, a rottweiler. unfortunately, the movie fails to utilise suspenseful music to support the images on the screen. the music is far too melodramatic rather than suspenseful. this may fit a tv movie but it looks incredibly out of place in what should be a dark-toned movie presenting a living nightmare to the viewer.<br /><br />this brings me on to a wider problem with this movie - the photography. the camera-work and especially the choice of colours make this seem like a very cheap tv movie one would expect to see as the daytime movie on channel 5 here in the uk where i am writing this comment from.<br /><br />the top two actors deliver good acting performances that help to breathe life into the movie's dull segments. dee wallace and danny pintauro should be given credit for doing a great job with the poor material they are given. i could forgive a few brief moments of overacting by paying closer attention to the dialogue, which could not have allowed any other interpretation in my opinion. i won't pass judgement on the other actors because they are given virtually nothing to do.<br /><br />as someone who is a fan of salem's lot and stephen king's it, both movie adaptations of famous stephen king novels, i had high expectations for this movie. but it turned out to be a massive disappointment.<br /><br />overall, i do not recommend fans of stephen king or horror movies in general to watch cujo. this is one of those moments where i have to recommend the book rather than the movie. hopefully it brings the story to life in a way that the movie failed to do.
