director michael ritchie and actor robert redford's second documentary-style drama, 'the candidate', is a political satire that still seems fresh and pertinent today. so it's a pity that 'downhill racer', made a short time before, seems so dated by contrast. the music is ugly, and the perhaps innovative ski-ing sequences are now standard in televisual coverage of the sport. the world of ski-ing seems strangely amateurish (probably accurately, given the time the movie was made, but it's hard to relate to today's professional world), and the theme of americans in europe likewise seems hundrum in an age of ever easier travel. perhaps the biggest problem is the flat plot, centred on the arrogant but enigmatic hero; unfortunately, it's a dreary performance from redford, offering us little insight into his cares or motivations. and a character-driven film without much of a character is never a good bet. i expected much, but sadly this is a boring movie.
