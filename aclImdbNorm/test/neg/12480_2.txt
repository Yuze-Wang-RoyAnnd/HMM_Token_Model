lucio fulci was famous for his italian splatter movies, mostly his undead films like zombie or the beyond. here he directed a black comedy of sorts, but there's just one problem: its nauseating. i say this knowing that i like city of the walking dead (which is also gross but not like this). a compulsive gambler gets money for his habit by romancing ugly and deformed rich women then murdering them and stealing their cash. the film makes this plan look that easy. i guess the women were too ugly to go to a bank, so they always had their cash on person. after the upteenth murder i began to suspect what i've always heard about fulci: he hated women. he must have. at any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies. avoid this film at all costs.
