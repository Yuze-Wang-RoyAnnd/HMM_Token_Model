mixing small town sheriffs, high-school students, fake rock music, and some weirdo who kills for, well, no reason in particular, this film is essentially a re-make of "the giant gila monster" - except without the gila monster, of course.<br /><br />now, anyone who has actually seen "giant gila monster", knows that it is one of the worst made films of all time, frequently so slow, it's not even funny. and i can't believe that by 1967, "giant gila monster" had earned such a reputation that young directors were just dying to get to work on a sequel, let alone a remake. so will someone please explain to me why this film was made?! the dance sequence, by the way, is historically interesting, although about three years out of date; but even that's spoiled, since it goes on... and on... and... on....
