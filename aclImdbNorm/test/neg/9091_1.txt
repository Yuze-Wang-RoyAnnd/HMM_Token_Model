i was rather disappointed. the first tetsuo made me an instant tsukamoto fan, from the first 5 mins of the film. it was fresh, innovative, and just.....different. i rather enjoy having a movie be in your face and push all those "make you squirm" buttons. tetsuo did just that where for me, few movies can.<br /><br />for those of us who enjoy getting a breath of fresh air, those that appreciate those offbeat styles used that make indie films so worthwhile, testuo ii will likely be a disspointment. if your looking for that visceral "hyper-kinetic" feel of the first movie, skip this one, as thats all been stripped away. tetsuo ii is for some odd reason, just a typical hollywood style action flick. i was rather confused. however, it's still worthwhile in my opinion for any die-hard tsukamoto fan.
