a plane carrying a rich scientist's daughter goes down in thick wilderness. he assembles a group to go and find her and the others, but the rescue party soon suspects that something is stalking them. then ulterior motives for the expedition are revealed and that only adds to the already existing tension.<br /><br />the movie is a decent idea and a take on the popular sasquatch legend was bound to wind up on film sooner or later. however, the film's direction breaks a fundamental rule of horror/thriller directing and that is showing too much too soon. of course the audience knows there is something stalking the characters, just read the title! but showing what should have been the film's kicker that early just ruins most of the suspense and, as a direct result, much of the fun. the film also lacks a good atmosphere and there are almost no landscape shots that show the expanse of the wilderness, but there are plenty monster point-of-view shots that add nothing to anything. they actually knock off 'predator' quite shamelessly. the low-budget horror film 'wendigo' did what this film tries to do much better.<br /><br />some of the character tensions and a non-clich'e ending manage to make up for this rise above the crap pile, but it is still poor and given the premise and potential, very disappointing. --- 4/10<br /><br />rated r for some violence and profanity, but it's pretty tame compared to most r-rated horror.
