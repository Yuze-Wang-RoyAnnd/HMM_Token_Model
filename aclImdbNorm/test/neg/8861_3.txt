...when this movie was on.<br /><br />what a bore. an attempt at humor, but really not pulling it off too well. some good ideas were cast, and the actors makeup and wardrobe were ok.<br /><br />i expected a lot more, unfortunately i couldn't sit through any more of it, i switched off halfway through the video, and ejected the tape, went to the rental store to get my money back...
