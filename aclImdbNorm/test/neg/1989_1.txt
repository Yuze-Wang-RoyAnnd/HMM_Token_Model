this movie is worse than "heaven's gate" or "plan 9 from outer space". don't know why it got even one oscar, it should have gotten a million raspberries, just like the audiences that either walked out or didn't show up in the first place. the hospital was a first-rate financial failure, but i'm certain the elite classes of left-wing, gutter-mouthed intellectuals railed that the american public was far- too plebeian to appreciate biting social-commentary when they saw it, and on and on. george c scott, in one of most-artless and embarrassing roles, along with aging sex-symbol diana rigg spend most of the movie trying to cuss in an increasingly-blas'e manner as they push along a silly plot. poor old george is impotent and is just crushed by the event, but after lots of dirty language between him and rigg, he rapes her multiple times on lovely night in a filthy, crumbling nyc hospital that looks so disgusting that i wouldn't want a dying pet rat treated in it. there's also some sacrilegious junk-dialog tossed about hither and yon, laced with plenty of cussing as well. it ends by portraying the faulty notion that unusual stress without physical exertion always brings on cardiac arrest. never want to see another minute of this awful movie again.
