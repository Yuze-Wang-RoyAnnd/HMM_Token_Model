don't waste your time. one of those cool-looking boxes that you pick up at blockbuster on a hunch, but not even worth that. you will not say, "it's so bad, it's good." just, "it's bad." the greatest american hero is a writer who rents a cabin on african island, called snake island. some other tourists are on the boat that drops him off, but they are not staying on the island. they just stop there to let off the writer. then the boat is stranded there, and --in true hollywood originality-- the one and only radio on the island is busted. so they start walking around and see a bunch of snakes. like hundreds of them, which really became annoying and you knew the plot would go nowhere. it's not like there ever was one main snake. like a giant mutated snake or an extra poisonous king of all snakes. instead, there are just a bunch of ham-and-egger snakes of all kinds of breeds. their only goal, then, was to escape the island...as opposed to having to conquer the enemy. because there were so many snakes, you knew they couldn't possibly try to kill them all, and they didn't try. i've seen a similar movie where a town was haunted by snakes and they lead all the snakes into a cave then blew it up. at least then you get the feeling that the good guys killed the bad guys and it was a normal ending. in snake island (by the way, every single character was shocked to see snakes on the island...duhhhhh, it's named snake island for a reason), there was no plan other than trying to get gas for the stupid boat. oh, they never do get gas by the way. they "just happen" to find another boat on the island already gassed up.
