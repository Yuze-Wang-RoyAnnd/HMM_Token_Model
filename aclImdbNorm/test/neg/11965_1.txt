well first and for most i'd just like to say that i'm back out of retirement from writing well deserved comments about horrible movies. only the movie in titled "scarecrow gone wild" could bring me back, so here i am.<br /><br />with that being said, i like to start off with this comment. ouch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this movie was really horrible, i mean i know it was going to be bad. but i had no idea that i would be spending 60 minutes out of a possible 90 minute film laughing at what i thought was a horror movie.<br /><br />let's start with the biggest flaw of the film (to me that is). ken shamrock. now if memory serves me correctly, shamrock is one of the worlds most dangerous men. now if memory serves me again, he was also in this stupid movie being a stupid comic relief (or that's how it looked to me). i mean how else do you explain all of his lines. my all time favorite line of his in this so called movie was "it's been a long time coming". ok????????? the funnest thing about that line was that no more then five minutes prior to him say that, he was sitting on the beach talking to the soon to be dead kids about how the dam scarecrow could not be killed. so if he has knowledge of this, why on earth would he start trying to combat it as soon as he sees it (the scarecrow that it). like i said before, he must have been the comic relief, except i don't think his ufc buddies where laughing.<br /><br />now that i've finished that well deserved paragraph on to the movie.<br /><br />i'll admit that i can't remember a lot of scenes, and that's not good considering that i just watch the movie no more then fifteen minutes ago. so what i'm going to do is list the top five things wrong with this film 1. usually when horror movie monster have their own theme music, it's not heard by the victims or even by the monster itself. so why were just about every person involved in this movie able to here this pathetic whistling. i mean i saw the scarecrows face and nothing about it said that he was the whistling type.<br /><br />2. why on earth were there murders on a beach. i'm sorry, but threw out history beaches are associated with party time and vacation type feelings. but i guess this horror movie thought it was going to be such a success that it would change all of that. plus was it me or did the beach seem to be the size of someone living room. i mean every time an actor or actress was running around on the beach, it looked as if they were running in the same spot.<br /><br />3. the girl running in the gray sweat pants. that really bother during the duration of this film. i mean she looks so ridiculous. plus it didn't help any that she looked as though she was the youngest out of the whole group. i mean what was she like twelve or something. there no excuse for someone to be that thin on camera. i mean doesn't the camera add like ten pounds or something, so what was her excuse.<br /><br />4. people trying to get record deals on camera. just when i thought that this movie could not get any cheesier, out comes the wanna be gorth brooks and oh man was he lame. i don't' remember the whole scene, but from what i do remember it was not pretty. this one guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing, and i mean nothing to do with what's going on in the film. the funniest part of the whole happening is how everyone seems to being enjoying this. i mean the only person who doesn't really know how to response to this is the "token black guy". and that's sad because if i'm not mistaken he was the one that encourage this latest addition of american idoal. but here's where it gets funny. while this guy is all into his new song or whatever. in the far distance we see or villain aka the scarecrow. and boy does he look pi**ed off at this. i mean there's actually a moment where he looks like he's really jealous of this guy. so what does he do about this jealousy, well i'm glad you ask. he wait's for the guy to finish his song, and then he finises the guy. i don't want to give the death scene away, but i can tell you this. if that scene doesn't make you laugh, then nothing on this earth will.<br /><br />5. this movie was way longer then i expected. and it didn't help that they tried to pulled some pathetic twist bulls**t at the end to squeeze another 10 minutes out of this film. i mean i'll admit, i didn't see the twist coming, but that had a lot to do with the fact that i was hoping that the film was over and done with. but no they had to do they twist s**t. needless to say that when i say that coming, i just turned off the t.v. and said f**k it, there's no way that movie could have gotten any worser. thanks to my rather fast judgment i can say that i'll never know what was to happen next. but i promise that i do not care!!!!!!!!!!!!! all and all the movie is good for a laugh, but please don't buy it. just hype it up to one of your friends and watch it on there expanse.
