having read the books and seen the 1982 anthony andrews/jane<br /><br />seymour version, i have to say that this is not good at all.<br /><br />according to the books, percy is supposed to be a seemingly<br /><br />foppish aristocrat when he's being percy, and witty and clever<br /><br />when he's being the pimpernel, but here he just looks bored as<br /><br />percy and mean as the pimpernel. marguerite is supposed to be<br /><br />the most beautiful woman in europe, not a tired and frumpy-looking matron (she looks middle-aged, probably due to<br /><br />bad make-up). richard e. grant has done much better things, and<br /><br />elizabeth mcgovern's acting is uninspired and flat. the wit and<br /><br />dash of the books and the andrews/seymour film is here replaced<br /><br />by brawn and flashy editing that just don't make the cut. <br /><br /> i might add that to a person who hasn't seen any previous version<br /><br />or read the book, it would probably look ok.
