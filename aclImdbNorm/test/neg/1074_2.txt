i caught 2:37 at the afi fest in los angeles. it's a very well shot first film (though the dv format begins to show itself in outside scenes), and i'm sure it has good intentions of showing us the "dark side" of high school - in other words every side of high school. but the filmmaker doesn't have the talent to write or direct up to the premise's promise. there are several characters, but none of them are any more than what the plot requires them to be. there's no depth to these caricatures beyond the machinations of "i am troubled teen x, i have y problem." the perceived roles of men and women in this story are phenomenally troublesome.<br /><br />let's start with the men. you have the stoner kid who's gay, the jock who's also gay, the boy who rapes his sister, and mr. peepants. as the stereotype requires, all gay men must be sexually unfulfilled and violent toward women and themselves. naturally (or unnaturally as the stereotype assumes), the two gay male characters beat up women, peepants, and themselves. i'd be perfectly fine with these characterizations if the stereotypes were turned on their heads, or if the characters somehow transcended them. yet neither took place, and that's all there is to these characters' stories.<br /><br />next, the ladies. one young woman wants to be a bulimic housewife, another is the pregnant rapee of the sister-raping brother, and there's the girl who kills herself (i'll get to that later). again, i don't think there's a requirement of political correctness for filmmakers (i'd be out of a job were that the case), but i do think that it's only justified if there's more to that character or story. if that archetype were being used to reveal something about character other than "i'm a teenager and life sucks," i'd be happy as a clam. but nothing new is revealed! nothing is subverted, or changed, or sublimated.<br /><br />finally, the girl who kills herself. this is blunt and highly sloppy storytelling. we're supposed to sit through 5 minutes of a girl violently killing herself who we've seen for maybe 30 seconds through the whole film? we've followed all these other stories for an hour and a half, and now we're invited to torture ourselves for a character that isn't part of the story? it's cheap, exploitative, and sloppy. despite the millions of crappy indie films that came before this, you have to earn something like that. you can't simply purchase it on credit. so this suicide happens, we get wrap-ups from the characters that go similarly nowhere but down, and the film ends. what have i learned? i already knew high school sucked - been there, done that. i already knew people have stereotypical views of gay men and young women. i already knew that kids with disabilities are mocked.<br /><br />what else is there, then? smoke, mirrors, and some really nice views of leaves. oh, and the nastiest deus ex machina i've seen in a while.
