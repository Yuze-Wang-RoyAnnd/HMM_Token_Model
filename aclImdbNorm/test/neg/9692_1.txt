i could not believe what i saw...(once) brilliant actors appearing in this dire effort that should never of been made. the plots are dreadful and the dialogue appauling (at first i thought it was a spoof), and the acting abysmal. everything about it is bad, from the cheap sets to the phony backdrops, a bunch of paintings enlarged. respectable filmakers struggle to get their vision realised, yet this blasphemous, pathetic attempt at a mini-series makes it to our television's, with 3 oscar winners making appearances. i can only guess everyone involved somehow hurt the writer and director and were forced (maybe at gunpoint)to star in this worthless t.v. trash.
