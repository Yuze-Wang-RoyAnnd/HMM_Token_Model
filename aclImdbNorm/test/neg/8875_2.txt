i didn't even watch this whole movie. now, i like 50's sci-fi movies even when they are wildly inaccurate but this one just annoyed me. for one thing, one member of the crew on the spaceship talks and acts like he might have made it into the tenth grade. he sounds like he ought to be on a bowling league, not a space ship. out the window of the spaceship the crew is marveling at earth and this boob says 'can you see brooklyn?' and another guy says 'sure'. and the boob says 'gee, i wonder who's pitching?' pardon me a moment, i think my sides are splitting.<br /><br />when they first get up into orbit the boob says 'the moon is just for looking at! take me back down!' watching the crew making stretched mouths and screaming from the g-forces of acceleration during takeoff is also not one of the better moments of the film. (perhaps the film's best moment can be identified by a big "the end" on the screen.)<br /><br />we also find out that they can't open the hatch because 'the boob' greased it before they took off. sure, a space vehicle is going to be 'greased' by a member of the crew, who we later learn has never even had a space suit on before and doesn't know anything about zero gravity. as baby huey the overgrown fat cartoon duck once said, "that sounds logical!" the no-gravity-in-space effects are so bad it's painful to watch. (everyone knows, in the absence of gravity, everything tends to go up.)<br /><br />how this movie gets 6.3 stars out of 10, when other vastly superior films don't rate any higher, is a mystery to me. i really do like old sci-fi movies but this one is not realistic, and the lame attempts at character humor by throwing in that boob from a gas station grease pit does not work at all - it just ruins the movie. i think in retrospect it's not the whole movie i hate so much as the fact that 'the boob' is so obviously not someone who would be on a space ship - not even to 'grease the hatch.' omg. i wonder if he checked the fan belts too. maybe if they'd left 'the boob' off the trip it might not have been quite so excruciating. even so, it's only average. what everyone else is raving about, i don't know.<br /><br />you want to watch a neat 1950's space movie? 'rocketship x-m' beats it all to heck. maybe not so much 'realism' but a more serious story and less goofy characters.
