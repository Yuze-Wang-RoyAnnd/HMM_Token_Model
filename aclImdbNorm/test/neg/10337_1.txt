i hafta watch crap like this all the way through to see if there are any redeemable qualities whatsoever to justify including it in my clients' video libraries. don't you watch this, not even a minute of it, unless someone has a gun to your head. you will, as i did, moan & groan at least 500 times, and pray that one of the one- dimensional characters, all played by really bad actors, would turn and shoot you dead.<br /><br />even if you are the biggest sandra bullock fan in the world, it is not worth even watching the two or three short scenes in which she appears.<br /><br />i want to kick the asses of the sleazy marketing people who put sandra's huge picture on the face of this dvd box and have them thrown in jail for mugging me or something like that. i really wish i had the chance to read a review of this film before i bought it.<br /><br />please, give me a call, and i will pay you $10 to remove this movie immediately from my inventory before it stinks up the whole place! (just kidding--please don't call)
