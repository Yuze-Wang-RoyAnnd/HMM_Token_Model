the movie "the cave" has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. there was no plot, no story-line, and the lighting was terrible. for most of the movie, i was unable to make sense of the scenery as it was being highlighted by flashlights. the persistent 'grey' spaces throughout the movie were irksome. the only scene that really came through clearly was in the cavern lit by what appeared to be a bad simulation of the conditions to be found in hell. all in all, the movie was not really worth watching. if the producers cannot come up with something better than this, they should find another occupation. the underwater scenes were particularly awful, being mostly made up of bubbles and flashlights, with the occasional look at the actors. in summation, a really awful movie with bad lighting, extraneous flashes throughout.
