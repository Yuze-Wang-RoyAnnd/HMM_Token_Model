as an ancient movie fan, i had heard much about the controversial movie caligula assessed ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others. i decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusations towards the film. i sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch. the beginning quotation from the new testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in me...why to entail a sentence from the gospel by mark in the movie about pagan rome? but the prelude pastoral scene with a young half naked couple (caligula and drusilla) running hopelessly through meadows seemed quite sentimental. the music which sounded memorably whilst the credits also provoked me in the positive sense. yet, the negative feelings raised in me quite soon, particularly at the death of tiberius. the cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated. however, it was not that horrific to the middle. during the second half of the film, i felt as if i watched no historical epic but an extremely disgusting porn. in the end, i said to myself "this is one of the movies that one may really hate" ... i am aware that a movie may be controversial but i had never expected that caligula would go that far in removing all limits of taste. i hate this film due to many reasons, but particularly one.<br /><br />caligula does not serve a purpose of an ancient epic (which it claims to be), but bob guccione, the director and the founder of penthouse pornographic magazine, aims at combining film art with porn. that is, i think, the most serious matter the film may be accused of. movie is an art that should be reigned by taste, by message, by some feeling of epic grandeur whereas this movie kills all limits of good taste. caligula shows the most bestial side of human being in the most wicked, decadent manner. some scenes are so disgusting that i don't think there are any people whose psyches will not be affected by them. some say that the rome under caligula's reign was so brutal. yes, it is true. corruption bloomed at that time, various sexual deviances were preferable to roman citizens. yet, i do not think that it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and make it constitute an emphasis of an ancient epic. i believe that it rather proves the bizarre psyches of the producers and their strange tendencies... <br /><br />huge historical mistakes: the screenplay by gore vidal is notorious for inaccuracies. it is noticeable, for instance, with the figure of proculus (donato placido), a historic roman senator. yet, the film shows him as a simple soldier on whom caligula forces his most decadent ways of tortures and rapes. moreover, livia was not proculus wife raped by caesar on her wedding. what lies behind changing the stories of historical characters into the stories filled with unbelievable vulgarity and violence? another example of historical travesty is the figure of caesonia portrayed by helen mirren. she is presented as caligula's wife together with drusilla, his sister. in fact, caligula married caesonia long after the death of his sister. the sexual abuse on his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical bases. i also hated the moment with the killing machine - a pure imagination of the director that has nothing to do with historical facts. <br /><br />technical aspect and cast: from the technical point of view, the film is nothing special. the cinematography cannot boast to be exceptionally fine and the sets together with costumes are as well nothing outstanding. yet, the only strong point of the movie are the performances, particularly the one by malcolm mcdowall as caligula. he does a perfect job in the main role portraying madness and cruelty of the emperor. mcdowall raises the value of the film. if everything bothers you in caligula, you may at least admire his performance. i also fancied helen mirren as caesonia and teresa ann savoy as drusilla (yet the film is based on a gossip by suetonius that caligula made love to his sister). sir john gielgud as nerva and peter o'toole as old tiberius are also memorable. o'toole does his finest piece of acting in the capri grotto sequence portraying the decadence and the exhaust of the old emperor. yes, i admit that the only thing i like about caligula are the performances. therefore, i don't rate the movie 1/10.<br /><br />lame continuity: the historical inaccuracy of the film also goes in pairs with poor continuity. let us analyze just the beginning: caligula comes to capri grotto where he sees the awful pleasures of old tiberius. then, after about 15 minutes, the action moves to rome where a black bird near drusilla and caligula's bed constitutes a bad omen. and immediately the characters are again in capri where nerva (john gielgud) is dying...? <br /><br />all in all, i don't recommend to see caligula to anyone. if you want to know the story, read robert graves' gorgeous novel i, claudius and claudius the god or watch herbert wise's mini series with the magnificent performance by derek jacobi. caligula is a sick film the most serious crime of which is the destruction of art. it is, in its most part, a porn movie that should never be called an epic.<br /><br />there are movies that are truly artistic and sharpen people's taste of beauty,<br /><br />there are movies that are average entertainment; yet they have something to offer,<br /><br />there are movies that show extreme violence; yet they still convey some moral,<br /><br />there are, however, movies that show sickness and decadence for their own sake and consequently harm people's minds,<br /><br />caligula unfortunately belongs to the latest group
