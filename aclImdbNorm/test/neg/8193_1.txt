^^contains spoilers^^<br /><br />this movie is utter crap. do not watch.<br /><br />there is no one in this movie to root for, or even like, except for the wife, and she wins by default. everyone is selfish, and many things happen that make no sense.<br /><br />the acting is mediocre at best and everyone breathes too heavily about everything. no one can even cry believably.<br /><br />if you leave the room for even a second, then something totally out of left field will happen, and it will make no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />for example, i left the room for a second, while jennie garth's character was sleeping with her manager. i come back, seriously about 4 minutes later, (also i'm pretty sure there was a commercial somewhere in there) and she's sleeping with that berko guy. <br /><br />i gave up on this movie around the time that berko was being an ass to his fianc'e in the car, because she didn't want to call off the wedding.<br /><br />i wasted 2 hours of my life. you shouldn't.
