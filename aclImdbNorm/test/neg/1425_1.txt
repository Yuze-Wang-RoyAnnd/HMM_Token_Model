not since "8 heads in a duffel bag" and the "how high" previews<br /><br />have i laughed so little at something that the film makers thought<br /><br />would be hysterical.<br /><br />jerry lewis is the richest man in the world. he is rejected as 4-f<br /><br />by the army, and decides to use his money to raise his own army-<br /><br />of about half a dozen. he then impersonates a nazi commander in<br /><br />italy, and eventually tries to kill hitler. that is the description of the<br /><br />flimsy plot.<br /><br />this film is as funny as a heart attack. this film makes "hogan's<br /><br />heroes" look like shakespeare. if the money men of "the<br /><br />producers" had really wanted to lose their cash, they should have<br /><br />shown this film. i cannot stress how bad this thing is.<br /><br />lewis' direction consists of two different cameras shooting the<br /><br />action from two different angles, then being edited together. this<br /><br />sitcom type of direction works on television, but here it is an<br /><br />obvious attempt to cheat the audience. he ends most of his<br /><br />scenes with a still shot, as if giving the viewer a chance to double<br /><br />over in stitches before going to the next tired set up. i spent most of<br /><br />the movie doubled over in abdominal agony, accompanied with<br /><br />severe flatulence, over this thing.<br /><br />lewis, the director and producer, sets the film in 1943, but makes<br /><br />no attempt to use period costumes or sets. everyone wears the<br /><br />latest style and has the latest interior design...for 1970. the<br /><br />supporting cast is lost as lewis goes off on his patented tangents,<br /><br />which last as long as major surgery and are just as painful to<br /><br />watch. when lewis becomes the nazi commander, he spends the<br /><br />last half of the film screaming at the top of his lungs in a<br /><br />performance so odious as to stink up any good will you try to bring<br /><br />in at the beginning.<br /><br />the final embarassing shot has lewis and his cronies trying to<br /><br />put one over on the japanese. they wear buck teeth, squint their<br /><br />eyes, and talk in a "funny" accent. it may be one of the most<br /><br />blatantly racist occurrences since the internment camps. i was<br /><br />slack jawed at what lewis did through this whole thing, but that put<br /><br />me over the edge. watch for kaye ballard's very tasteless scene<br /><br />where she tries to attempt suicide over and over again.<br /><br />"star trek"'s george takei has two small scenes, then wisely<br /><br />drops out of the picture. this has less laughs than mel brooks' last<br /><br />three films combined. there is nothing sadder than watching a<br /><br />formerly respected comedian screw up a project so horribly, you<br /><br />actually feel ashamed for them. jim carrey learned that with "the<br /><br />majestic," but jerry lewis still shows up on television once in a<br /><br />while pulling the same unfunny schtick. i feel sorry for him.<br /><br />"which way to the front?" is cheap, unfunny, offensive, and stupid.<br /><br />i feel bad for everyone involved, and anyone who must endure this.<br /><br />i do not recommend it.<br /><br />though rated (g), this contains some physical violence, some gun<br /><br />violence, and some adult situations. if your child shows interest in<br /><br />seeing this, please consult professional help.<br /><br />
