a man kicks a dog 2' in the air.<br /><br />a woman kicks a cow out of her bed.<br /><br />a man kicks a violin down the sidewalk.<br /><br />a woman sucks on a statue's toe for 15 seconds.<br /><br />a man kicks a blind man in the stomach.<br /><br />jesus rapes a young girl.<br /><br />there you have it. i just saved you an hour of your life. surely there are those to whom this "shocking vanguard of cinematic expression" would appeal. but i found it no different from the puerile, disconnected videos i used to shoot with my friends in the 9th grade. except we never had a real cow.<br /><br />having heard endless sermons from beard-stroking art connaisseurs of how this is such an important film, i thought it would be worth my time. make no mistake, this is crap. if i hear one more person call bu~nuel the "father of cinematic surrealism", i think i'm going to punch someone. if anything, he issued a major step backward from the surrealist beginnings pioneered by his seniors fritz lang (metropolis), f.w. murnau (faust) and robert weine (caligari) 10 years earlier. this made a joke out of the whole thing, as if bu~nuel didn't have the confidence to truly embrace the art sans sarcasm, sans l'absurdit'e. it would take bu~nuel another 40 years before he would refine his style into something admirable. skip the early stuff and hop straight to 1970 if you want to be more impressed by his work.<br /><br />i'm sure he would agree. in 1977, bu~nuel himself stated that he would happily burn all the prints of his old movies. in this case i would be happy to pour the lighter fluid.
