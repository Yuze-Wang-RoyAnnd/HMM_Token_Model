35 years after this was made, castro still reigns. unfortunately, we're left scratching our heads wondering how the dim-witted maniac played by scenery-chewing jack palance made it as far as 1960. i stumbled back across this recently, and was amused at noticing the incomparable sid haig and "b" movie favorite paul (untouchables) picerni among the rebels. fleischer was obviously well past his prime when he directed this foolishness. some of the lines are classic in a "did he really say that kind of way?' the other thing i just noticed is that the score and the sound (not the dialog) are actually excellent -- the only first-rate elements of the entire production. so, don't watch this to learn anything about history or acting, but if you feel like watching this as a goof, bring the beers and have some fun.
