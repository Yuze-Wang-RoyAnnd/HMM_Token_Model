the 3rd in the series finds paul kersey (bronson) turning vigilante to get revenge on the thugs that murdered his old buddy. i don't know why this movie shoved me into it, but somehow it did. i found myself rooting for bronson to wipe the floor with those punks. every time he blew one of them away i felt good. this movie does not take itself seriously, but what if it did? there is a good build-up to the fireworks finale in which bronson goes on a rampage. but as far as acting and plot go, it just doesn't measure up. if i lived in that neighborhood, i would get out as fast as i could, but it seems like the people are asking for trouble. i know there is that mentality that we need to save our streets, but there is a limit here folks. i had to give it a 4. sure there are good "blow 'em away" scenes but that's about it. at that time, bronson was 64. i'm sure if those thugs really wanted to they could have their way with bronson. bronson takes the place of a schwarzanegger or stallone in this movie. this movie gives you a sense of rejoice. the common man can save the neighborhood, save the day. to sum it up, this is far from being the original death wish, but it is rather good if you are just looking for an hour and a half of shoot 'em up.
