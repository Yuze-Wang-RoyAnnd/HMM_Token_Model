i did a screen test and read the script for this turkey in 1988. it was awful then and even worse now - i spotted it on vhs at the local hollowwood video and said, "oh, what the hey, for auld ang sine". yech.<br /><br />they had to shoot most of it in mexico after they ran out of money, a couple of the "stars" pitched bitches because they ran out of some kind of exotic fruit drink crap. the movie's plot is ok, i suppose, but i happen to know that the writer intended for it to have a spy catcher thread running throughout.<br /><br />dr o ended up being a cartoon character. he must still be whirling in his grave over in the kremlin wall.<br /><br />technical errors were all over the movie, not only with the infant atomic technology but with the uniforms, insignia, and military jargon. they were too cheap to hire a professional military adviser, of course. even mr. newman's august and expert presence couldn't have saved this bird from being stuffed for thanksgiving.
