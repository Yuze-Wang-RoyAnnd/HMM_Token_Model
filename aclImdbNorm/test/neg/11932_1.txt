this film is a cash in. a cash in reliant on a rousing theme tune created for an earlier classic. yul brynner has long since jumped ship and so have most of the production values. lee van cleef takes over the lead role of chris. i can't think of any actor who looks less like brynner than van cleef. hey, he could have at least shaved off his hair and lost the moustache, just for the sake of continuity. some correctional centres show this movie in order to punish offenders. one step out of line and the magnificent seven ride! is brought to the fore and wielded. they didn't even bother trying to make this movie not look like a tv movie! abysmal.
