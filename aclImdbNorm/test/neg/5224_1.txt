this is quite possible the worst movie ever made. i know people talk about how horrible ed wood movies were (plan 9) but this movie makes plan 9 look amazing.<br /><br />chuck norris makes a cameo, for what reason i have no idea. perhaps to ruin his movie career. aside from chuck norris, the movie's cast consists of extras in daytime soaps and mike norris... that's right, chuck's son.<br /><br />this director doesn't even have a resume and i have no idea where the plot or screenplay originated. this must've been green lit by a horrible southern baptist minister that somehow had a 3rd cousin that owned a studio (which i'm sure has since been shut down).<br /><br />i don't really know what else to say about this movie. i would like to give you a plot summary but i'm lost. there is something about jesus and satan... some eternal battle. other than that there are indians. and a bunch of freaky kids that don't know how to act... they're just awkward and should not be on camera. i don't know what was going on most of the time but i know the movie was a great laugh. mike norris pushes his daughter (on her bike) into the street somehow... but in the shot he's in the middle of the park. so somehow she learns to ride her bike with speed equivalent to that of the flash and gets hit by a car or bus... i don't know. but she's dead. this is actually the funniest scene in the movie. i know that sounds sick but once you see mike raise his hands in victory and then hold his head and scream in terror... you'll understand. it doesn't show the daughter getting hit or anything... you just have to assume she got hit by some vehicle. but, the movie's not clear. so maybe it was completely unrelated and she died from cancer. anyway... after that the movie gets really confusing and i have no idea what really happens. i am a christian and i have no idea why this movie was made. i don't see any value for this movie in a religious or non-religious sector. this is probably the first thing they show students in film-making 101... this is what you don't want to do.<br /><br />just see it... you'll hate it and me for suggesting that you see it.
