much as i really like catherine zeta-jones, i wondered once again, why remake a good movie? this version lacked the tension and passion of mostly martha. it was a clear rip off. maxime foerste was more convincing as a hurting child who healed with love. i couldn't believe abigail breslin. martina gedeck owned this role. unfortunately zeta-jones should have found another one that she could own (she has other roles she does own.). sergio castellitto was good as a vulnerable but joyful italian. aaron eckhart seemed passionless in comparison. this version was pleasant but bland.<br /><br />the love between mario and martha was perhaps predictable but satisfying. the therapist added an interesting bit of color that didn't seem important. i liked it when at the end he said he'd be back but the movie was over before he returned. i have mostly martha at home. every now and then i revisit it.
