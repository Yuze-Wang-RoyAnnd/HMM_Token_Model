i don't think this movie had the effect on me that was intended: seeing american soldiers shooting wounded soldiers from the other side, and punching wounded prisoners in their wounds to torture them into making them talk made me root for the other side. it certainly made the us forces look anything like "the good guys". was this supposed to be acceptable?
