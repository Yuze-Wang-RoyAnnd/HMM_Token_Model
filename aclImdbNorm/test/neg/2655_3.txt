being a harrison ford fan i am probably being kind. it was predictable, sappy...my husband made a lot of gagging sounds while we were watching it. what a disappointing movie. our local newspaper (san jose mercury news) actually gave this 4 stars out of 4 stars!!! hard to believe that the reviewer saw the same movie we did.
