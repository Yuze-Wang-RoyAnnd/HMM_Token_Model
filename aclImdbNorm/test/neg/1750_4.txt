i felt that the movie skammen, directed by ingmar bergman, was very dry. it shows the things people will do to survive during a war and the shame that comes out of these actions; however i feel that it was not complete or attention holding. he never fully got into the plot or deep into the character emotions or reasons behind their actions. the only thing that i found rather attention holding in the movie was the transformation of the two main characters, jan and eva. many times during the movie was just the two main characters sitting around or doing their daily chores and not even having a conversation. i understand this was to show the reality of these people however i feel there are other ways to show reality and have it be entertaining. i think that ingmar bergman could have filmed this movie in a more riveting way.
