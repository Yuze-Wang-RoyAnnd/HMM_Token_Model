probably the biggest thing about wild rebels that hurts it the most is the hero. he's got loser written all over him, but that doesn't stop him from "getting the girl." probably one of the world's worst race drivers imaginable, he decides to stop racing after he crashes his car. well, his new job is racing still, as a bunch of biker types pick him to drive their getaway car as they commit crimes. there's nothing really to endear you to rod, even the situation he's thrown into is pretty stupid. in the end, at the lighthouse scene, you'll wish that rod gets killed with all the bikers. get this: he's shot twice, once in the arm and once in the leg, and still manages to crawl up the stairs a little. if only jeeter had better aim...<br /><br />avoid this one unless you're watching the mst3k version.
