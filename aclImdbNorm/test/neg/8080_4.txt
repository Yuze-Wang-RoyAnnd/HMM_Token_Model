**major spoilers** watchable only for the action sequences not the story or acting in it "nature unleashed: fire" has one of the longest and excruciating endings in modern motion picture history. we have the fearless ranger jake, bryan genesse, leading this trio of hysterical bikers to safety in of all paces an explosive fume beaching mine shaft! this during a raging forest fire! it seems that ranger jake with all his knowledge of the great outdoors didn't realize that a mine shaft that's leaking with dangerous and explosive methane gas is the last place to go when all the woods around it is on fire!<br /><br />***spoilers from this point on*** all this started some time ago when ranger jake in an effort to save the not that on the ball miner tiny, chris harz aka "the sherd", let him slip through his fingers and fall to his death at the bottom of the mine shaft, or did he! even though we were kept in suspense to who's setting the forest fires for the first half of the movie it wasn't a surprise at all the tiny was the culprit! as you would expect in movies like these tiny seemed to be made of hardened steel in that nothing that ever happened to him, fires explosions as well as impaling, could stop the crazed miner.<br /><br />before tiny's reappearance, or resurrection, ranger jake got involved in rescuing bikers chris mel sharon & marcus, josh cohen melanie lewis anastasia griffith & ross mccall, who were trapped in the woods with fires breaking all around them. having the usual know it all-marcus-among the bikers things don't go as smoothly as ranger jake wanted them to go. marcus not only eggs on the meek chris to do something stupid, jump with his bike over a 10 foot pile of logs, but has the guy break his leg. this makes it almost impossible for ranger jake to have chris air-lifted out before the fires consume him as well as his fellow bikers!<br /><br />for the remainder of the movie ranger jake, who put himself in charge, makes boner after boner in his attempt to save himself and the trapped and lost in the woods bikers! all this ends with jake's brilliant idea to hide in a dangerous and abandoned mine shaft with the rescue party just yards away from rescuing them if they only stayed put and in the open where the rescue team could find them!<br /><br />even though he was supposed to be the life of the party, or movie, tiny for all his efforts in being another indestructible super villain came across as a man who spent too much time out in the sun. the make-up job on tiny was so outrageous that he looked like he dumped a jar of spaghetti sauce over his head instead of having it burned to a crisp.<br /><br />ranger jake came across as either somewhat very naive or retarded in his being so taken in by the dangerous tiny in always trying to save the rampaging psycho who never hid his feelings about what he had in mind for the play by the rules forest ranger. in fact ranger jake actually encouraged tiny to do both him and the bikers in by showing him how incompetent he was in trying to save them. the fact that ranger jake was successful wasn't because he was so smart but because tiny , despite his indestructibility, was so brainless!
