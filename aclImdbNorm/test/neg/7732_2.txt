my gosh, this movie was nothing more than filmmaking by numbers. struggling salesman can't make a go of it in new york, mentor with a heart of gold takes him under his wing, struggling salesman moves to california and makes it big, then loses it big, then bounces back with the simple life, then hits rock bottom trying to get back to the top. i don't think i can remember any part of the plot that took more than five seconds to develop. case in point (spoiler?): when the john kapelos character calls to say he and his girlfriend were coming to santa cruz to visit, and james woods says there's practically no chance he would come, you knew with 100% certainty they were coming in the next scene or two.<br /><br />on the other hand, sean young sure looked good.
