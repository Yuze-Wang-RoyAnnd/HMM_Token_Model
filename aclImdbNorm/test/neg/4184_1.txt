just above the box i am typing in now, i was required to pick a number between 1 and 10, and rate this feature film. unfortunately there is no option for a number less than zero, and i have to put something. if i had my choice i would just put nothing, no number, because there exist no digits that express the worthlessness of this movie.<br /><br />if you do decide to watch this film even after reading all of these horrible reviews, make sure there are no sharp or blunt objects in the area, this will help prevent you from trying to kill yourself in the middle of the film.<br /><br />i don't know how this film was released to the public, it should be locked up and guarded 24/7 somewhere in fort knox. i am angry that this film was even available for me to watch. i feel cheated by humanity, i had no idea humans could be this cruel. stalin, saddam and hitler got nothing on this douche bag cowell.<br /><br />do not be fooled by the movie's cover. 1) there are no scarecrows, no one knows why there is a legit looking scarecrow on the front. 2)none of the characters on the back of case are even in the stinking movie! 3) the tag line says something about "new moon, more victims", there were no frigging victims no one even died. we don't know if the dam cop died, and i'm assuming the killer didn't die because it sounded like he was being hit over the head with a frigging whiffle ball bat.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie, it wasted about 4 hours of my life. that's right four, it took an hour for me to watch it (i fast forwarded thru the 4 minute zooming scenes that reveal nothing in the plot), i stared at the television for about an hour after it was over, contemplating my life and the direction it was heading after watching this crap, and then i began to cry for the next two hours because i know someone out there will unfortunately see this movie and there is nothing i can do to stop it.
