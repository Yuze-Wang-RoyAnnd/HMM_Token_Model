i was watching tv one day with a friend and we caught the last twenty minutes of "going bananas." believe me when i say it was enough to get a good judgment of the film. the first scene that i saw was the monkey, the kid, the fat guy, and the black guy who looked like dave chappelle, flying around in a crop duster thousands of feet in the air. while everyone else was solemn about the journey, the monkey seemed to be on some kind of drug binge where he kept shouting something that resembled the english word faster. they then landed on a twenty yard long dock in africa. after a heart felt goodbye where the monkey cried (hahahaha), the "villains" of the film appeared. they were tearing complete ass in their vintage cadillac when the evil monkey took an air jordan leap form the dock onto the boat that was sailing away a clean 40 yards away and made them sink their beautiful car into the pacific ocean. after seeing this film, i have a new purpose in life; to find the midget who played the monkey and stab him in the eye with a fountain pen.
