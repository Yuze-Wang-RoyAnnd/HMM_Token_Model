i always try not to be harsh while criticizing something that i didn't like, but after watching this mini-series i was so disappointed that could not help my irritation. on the one hand, it is true that series stayed faithful to the novel and of course i found that very nice, but on the other hand terrible casting, poor acting, especially of key characters
