after a few misfires, we are still waiting for the french horror movie that the critics will certainly vilify, but will launch a new trend. not this time. doug headline can't be accused of not being knowledgable in the genre (he is editor of a high-class fantasy imprint, has worked for legendary magazine starfix.), but why a scenario that uses every clich'e in the book (except maybe the odious comic relief) ? why make it so predictable ? even the nods towards argento fails flat. it's not even an euro-teen movie like the german "anatomy", much better, just a compilation of scenes that barely seems to have any relation one with the other and features lots of plot holes. the whole "celtic" aspect is barely touched. and, after a "revenation" painfully predictable, the screenplay offers us a boring, endless chase in a subterranean necropole which seems bigger than parisian catacombs. i really wanted to love this film. really. but even a mother would not. oh, and writer valerio evangelisti was supposed to have a cameo, but i vainly looked for him.
