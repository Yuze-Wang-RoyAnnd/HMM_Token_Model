possible spoiler alert, though there's not much to spoil about this film. i saw project a part ii not having seen the first movie. i don't think i missed much. project a part two is not only the worst jackie chan film i've seen to date (yes worse than `fantasy mission force'), this film is one of the most unwatchable films the world has ever seen. it's right up there with `plan 9 from outer space' on the sleep inducing scale. the plot is twisted up and knotted like a 50 foot ball of yarn the cat's been playing with and finally left for dead. the `humor' if you could call it that, seems to have been written by an annoying high school freshman, who despite how many people tell him he's not funny, is determined to get his lame humor out no matter how painful a movie is made. and this movie is painfully bad. the plot involves jackie chan as a navy officer recruited by the police force to round up `all known criminals'. he rounds them up in the first half hour of the movie, and i prayed for a quick ending which i didn't get. why the movie bothers to progress from this point i haven't a clue. the movie drags on and on and on with no purpose, no plot, and attempts at humor that fail so miserably, they make carrot top look like a comedic genius. the kung fu in this movie is lame, and forgettable. there's better kung fu in that movie about the 3 ninja kids. project a part ii is neither an action movie nor a kung fu movie, it is however a complete waste of the talents of jackie chan and maggie cheung who have made films worlds superior to this. as jackie chan repeatedly escapes certain death, i enter `blair witch' mode asking (and wishing) `is he going to die now, so the movie can end? `. an example of how ludicrous this movie is: jackie chan is handcuffed to another man. a gang of pirates (that look nothing like pirates) throw axes at jackie. does jackie grab one of the wayward axes and break the chain on the handcuffs? no! you see that would spoil the `hilarious' gag of him being handcuffed to another person. if you have a friend who laughs at everything, i encourage you to watch this movie with him or her, and watch as even they won't get a chuckle out of this film. if you're an insomniac this movie is sure to put you to sleep. do not operate heavy machinery while watching plan a part ii. possible side effects include headache, retinal strain, and death by boredom. 0/9 stars
