seriously, sci-fi needs to stop making movies. they're all horrible. and this one had john rhys-davies in it, and he couldn't help the movie. dr. pena (giancarlo esposito) captures the legendary goat eater of mexico, the chupacabra, and brings it aboard a cruise ship captained by captain rudolf (john rhys-davies). the creature then escapes and starts killing crew and passengers. captain rudolf and the crew then go after the creature, guns ablazin'. but they can't stop it. so they call in the navy. they can't stop it either. then the thing kills all 5 (or however many of them there are). then the captain and his daughter along with some other guy, figure out how to kill it. stay away from this movie. the chupacabra looks incredibly cheesy, the navy men shoot at the slightest movement,throw grenades on the ship, and the acting is horrible. 3/10.
