aside from frank kress (who played abraham gentry), an appearance by henny youngman and the last seconds of the movie, there really wasn't anything particularly good about this film. why it is currently rated 5.3 and adored by some reviewers is beyond me--the film is 99.44% crap...and exactly what i would have expected from director hershell gordon lewis. in the 1960s and 70s, lewis was known for making a string of incredibly low budget exploitation films, such as blood feast and monster a go-go. however, in recent years he's been christened "the father of gore" and he has many, many fans--fans who ignore the ineptitude of his work and only focus on how groundbreaking some of his films were. but apart from the liberal use of fake blood and real guts, at heart, his films are pure crap--and don't believe scores of 9 and 10 for his films. this would be like putting a velvet elvis painting in the louvre!!<br /><br />the film is about a string of very grisly murders that happen to strippers. when i say gruesome, it's very bloody and sick for 1972--though by today's standards the special effects look amazingly lame. so, while some very deviant and cruel murders happen in the film (i'd rather not explain them--they are from a pretty sick mind and show a particularly sick disregard for women), at least they won't nauseate you because they were done so poorly. it's obvious that in many cases they are cutting apart rubber dolls and mannequins. but to have them doing some of the sick acts, even if unrealistic, is pretty nasty and shows a lot of misogyny.<br /><br />the only hope in the film, as the police are all idiots, is a guy named abraham gentry--whose mannerisms and style of speech are very close to the stock actor, david lochary, from the early john waters films. while his acting is bad, he is so flamboyant and funny that he kept my interest. he could be pretty funny and oddly this is the only film he ever made!! it was also odd that so many women wanted him--especially because they just didn't seem like his type.<br /><br />as for the rest of the folks in the film, they are cretins and idiots who could not act. in fact, i was kind of hoping more would be killed--they really had it coming! none of their acting was the least bit believable and apparently the director never re-shot a single scene--as most of the scenes in the film were worse than any of the ones in ed wood's masterpiece, plan 9 from outer space. in fact, for many of the women in the film, the only prerequisite for their appearing in the film is that they be willing to take off their clothes. now i know this will sound pretty mean, but most of them were incredibly unattractive and looked like drug addicts who strip to get their next fix. when these ladies take off their clothes, men in the crowd give them money to put it back on (wow--henny youngman should have said that in the film)! but, considering lewis' budgets, these were probably the best "actresses" he could get.<br /><br />overall, a sleazy bucket of bile that manages to be worse than most of the director's other films...and that's saying a lot! it's violent (yet dumb), anti-women (treating them like meat and things to be mutilated) and is thoroughly incompetent from start to finish.
