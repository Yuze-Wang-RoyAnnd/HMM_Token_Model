this cheap, grainy-filmed italian flick is about a couple of inheritors of a manor in the italian countryside who head up to the house to stay, and then find themselves getting killed off by ghosts of people killed in that house.<br /><br />i wasn't impressed by this. it wasn't really that scary, mostly just the way a cheap italian film should be. a girl, her two cousins, and one cousin's girlfriend, head to this huge house for some reason (i couldn't figure out why) and are staying there, cleaning up and checking out the place. characters come in and out of the film, and it's quite boring at points, and the majority of deaths are quite rushed. the girlfriend is hit by a car when fleeing the house after having a dream of her death, and the scene is quite good, but then things get slow again, until a confusing end, when the male cousins are killed together in some weird way, and this weirdo guy (i couldn't figure out who he was during the movie, or maybe i just don't remember) goes after this one girl, attacking her, until finally this other girl kills him off. hate to give away the ending, but oh well. the female cousin decides to stay at the house and watch over it, and they show scenes of her living there years later. the end. you really aren't missing anything, and anyway, you probably won't find this anywhere, so lucky you.
