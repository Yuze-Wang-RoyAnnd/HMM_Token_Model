i know that this show gave a lot of liberation to women in the late '90s and early 2000s, but come on! you have a whiner, a buzz kill, and an over-analyzer. this show really made women look bad. i cannot stand carrie's analyzing every little thing on this show and that's what really killed it for me. also, charlotte's whining about her nonexistent predicaments made my ears hurt and miranda's cynicism was a complete buzz kill. i mean, can't she just be happy? samantha was the only cool one on the show and the only one worth watching. there was also a good episode when nathan lane was on the show, but that was the only one worth watching--the rest of them were pretty much the same. the humor was drier than a bucket of sand, and not very interesting plot line. all in all, not a very good show and i'm glad it's over.
