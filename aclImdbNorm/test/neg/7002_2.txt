i rarely shut a movie off after the first 10 minutes but that is what i did with this one. what turned me off was it was so obvious that the only purpose of this movie was to expose as much skin of as many b actresses as possible, and nothing else really matters.<br /><br />don't get me wrong; i like pretty actresses and sex scenes, and sexploitation movies have their own scale of merits, but this director does nothing else right.<br /><br />for example, take the scene where the two cops (of course one guy one gal and of course there is all this supposedly witty banter between them) are talking over while standing over the first dead body. the camera pans between them for each line, (there's more than one screen-width between them!) and you end up wondering whether you're seasick from that or the clueless dialog.<br /><br />well, it might have gotten better after the first 10 minutes, but i wouldn't know. i declined the sucker bet and found something better to do.
