this movie, quite literally, does not have one redeeming feature. the characters are one-dimensional, cliched, incredibly misogynistic and stupid. the script looks as if it was cobbled together from 100 other movies, the acting is horrible, and some of the 'gross-out' humour made me feel nauseous.<br /><br />shame on you, gregory poirier, for thinking any of this would be funny or interesting!<br /><br />the worst movie i've seen in several years.
