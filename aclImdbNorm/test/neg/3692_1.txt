in moscow, the priest owen (vincent gallo) hires a team to guide him in the underworld to find his friend sergei (rade serbedzija) that is missing while researching the legend about the existence of demons and an entrance to hell beneath the city. <br /><br />i bought this dvd based on the name of val kilmer and the interesting pictures on the cover. i am totally disappointed since this film is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i do not understand how val kilmer accepted to participate in this production. there are two shameful reviews in imdb promoting this movie and they are typically fake, written by users with only one review in this site. there are two possible ways to see this boring and awful film: my wife and i napped many times because of the monotony of this pointless story, and we used the rewind button of the dvd to repeat each lost scene. however, the correct way should have been the use of the fast forward or the stop button, to end this crap faster. my vote is one.<br /><br />title (brazil): "cidade sombria" ("dark city")
