deepa mehta, arundhati roy and a host of other so called intellectuals get the title of intellectuals because of the fact that they love portraying india and hinduism in a bad light...and deepa mehta makes her money from it anyway. anyway hindus are too gentle or scared to protest the way muslims protest so anybody can take any liberties with hinduism. and it is a fact that during the 1930's women in the west were also illtreated when they were widowed...just that nobody likes to point out anything bad about the west or anything other than india and hindus. she paints an inncorrect portrayal of india and the situation of widows there. nowhere is it mentioned that child marriage is illegal. she ended the movie saying there are 34 million widows in india. of course among a billion people, there will be that many widows. but how many are living life she has depicted in the movie?? deepa mehta finally is selling india and poverty to make dollars. how pathetic....
