okay, it's a movie for children, and it's not one of those movies that adults will enjoy as well. however, there are some unintentionally funny moments, most of them involving holes in the story. for example, the kid needs a computer part to bring his dad back to normal, and he doesn't have the money. so, does he ask his father for the dough? nope, he steals it and gets caught. kids, if i'm ever turned invisible, i'll advance your allowance, ok? also, while this kid is at the police station (no doubt about to be charged with criminally lame acting), his beautiful blond teacher comes in, announces who she is and where she works, then busts the child out of the slam in front of the cops! to make matters worse, instead of making a quick getaway, they then sit in the parking lot of the police station and laugh about their achievement. you know, i hate to pick, but the kid did steal something and ought to face the consequences, but maybe being in this movie is punishment enough. y'all avoid it!
