watchable but pretty terrible. how shocking that this was the great gregory la cava's last directing credit! even in his better known roles, i don't care for gene kelly. he seems to me to be smug, hostile, and self-involved. here, paired with a minor actress like marie wilson, he seems to show those characteristics in spades.<br /><br />marie wilson, playing an heiress who falls for a military man, is exceptionally hard and unsympathetic. the actors seem to be working hard to get past the hard, disagreeable core of the picture and they do ok.<br /><br />the know-it-all butler is apparently meant to be funny but he seems like an extended riff on the prissy bits for which franklin pangborn was famous (and in which, despite their stereotyping, he was generally funny -- unlike this guy.) phyllis thaxter is as always very appealing in a rather underdeveloped secondary plot.
