if you have never read the classic science fiction novel this mini-series is based on, it may actually be good. unfortunately, if you are a fan of the book, you probably won't be able to watch more than the first hour or two. all of the political intrigue has been taken out of the film, the most important scenes from the book have been taken out, characters motivations have been changed completely, and words from the wrong characters mouths. where in the novel paul atredies was a teen age boy with incredible political skill and a great understanding of the way the world worked, in this film he is hot headed and and frustrated. avoid this movie at all costs.
