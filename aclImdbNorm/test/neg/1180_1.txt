what a waste of time to watch this movie. poor picture quality, poor sound, poor acting and definitely not based on actual facts. the deputy's "girlfriend" did so much overacting, as did the sheriff, that it was more comedy than horror. the deputy tries to make an emergency phone call by dialing 911...problem...in 1957 that emergency number was not in existence. that is just one example of glaring inconsistencies.<br /><br />the "scary" aspect was way underdone. just did not come across as horrific.<br /><br />i did think that the actor playing gein did the most admirable acting job in the whole movie. i could well see mental disturbances in his character portrayal.<br /><br />sorry...this one just does not get it!!
