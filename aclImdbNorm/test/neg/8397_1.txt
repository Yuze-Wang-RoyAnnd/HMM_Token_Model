how any of you gave this more than 2 stars amazes me. i made an account on imdb just to comment on this cr@p film. the acting is cr@p and the plot is cr@p. it would deserve no stars at all if it weren't for the descent soundtrack (and yet there are still some outrageously clownish tracks in there too, most notably the ones featuring the oboe and sound like black and white cartoon comedy background music and in no way fit the intended mood of the scenes that they haunt) and quality cinematography. the dialog and plot are about as complex as that of a dr. sues book. these actors are horrible. i am actually watching this movie right now and, with every word, am stunned you all swallowed this shitte. the only reason i didn't turn the movie off was because i have gotten wrapped up in creating an account on imdb and posting this review. i dig mainstream films, i dig silly stupid films, i dig retro indie films, and nearly any other type/genre if carried out well. my brother convinced me to rent this because he said he heard it was good and he generally has great taste in movies; from the moment he told me the title i looked at him like he was crazy. i'm having a tough time ending this rant because there is just so much badness to talk about. the only way i can rationalize the good ratings on here is that you guys were paid to give this movie high ratings. it is so poorly done and no where close to dramatic, artsy, complex, well written, well preformed, or even bearable. if this was the final product of my hard directorial work, i would be to embarrassed to release it to the public, so i don't even feel sorry for the director if he reads this -- what the hell were you thinking guy?
