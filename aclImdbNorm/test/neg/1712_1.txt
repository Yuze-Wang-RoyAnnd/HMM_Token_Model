first, i would like to apologize for my rating of "1"... the only reason i give this film such a high rating is that i can't delve into negative integers. all "this is a spoof" musings aside, and while i certainly have tried to give it due consideration, have left me with a certain notion, namely; "this is quite possibly the worst film ever made." on any level and in any plausible quantification of qualitative measurement... seriously, i tried, i'm just as in to any indie born-for-cult-video-distribution film as the next buff, but seriously, this movie sucked rhino balls...<br /><br />honestly, if i had directed this "film" i would have seen it as a legitimate cause for suicide.
