an interesting premise, and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: i'd love to see drago, stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!). the soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.<br /><br />but the acting--even that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable. still, it was the sets that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale. i don't know where this was filmed, but were i to hazard a guess, it would be either an open-air museum, or one of those re-enactment villages, where everything is just a bit too well-kept to do more than suggest the "real old west". okay, so it was shot on a college kid's budget. that said, i could have forgiven one or two of the aforementioned faults. but taken all together, and being generous, i could not see giving it more than three stars.
