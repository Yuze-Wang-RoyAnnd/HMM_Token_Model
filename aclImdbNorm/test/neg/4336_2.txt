talk about a bore-snore. this 3rd rate biker film was putting me to sleep as soon as the opening credits came on the screen. the shame is that the cast included many fine actors, among them-george kennedy, karen black, leo gordon, richard lynch, lance henriksen and william forsythe.<br /><br />a take off of the western classic, high noon, this is basically the story of a former u.s. army green beret (henriksen) trying to get someone to help him rid a one-horse town of a gang of creepy bikers.<br /><br />everyone tries, but the script is on grade-school level. sad to see academy award winner kennedy in such a comedown from his out-standing performance in cool hand luke. <br /><br />if you have trouble sleeping at night, this would be a perfect movie video to rent..........you'll be sleeping in no time!
