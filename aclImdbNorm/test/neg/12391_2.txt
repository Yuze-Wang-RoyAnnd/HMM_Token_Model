it seems at least vaguely possible that this movie provided a bit of inspiration for "the sopranos," as its main character, martin blank (john cusack) is a hit man who has so many issues from his past and his profession that he's in therapy trying to deal with it all. everything finally comes to a head at his 10-year high school reunion. the problem was that by the time blank got to the reunion i had stopped caring. frankly, i found this movie a drag from start to finish.<br /><br />it had potential. there was a reasonably good cast, headed by cusack and dan aykroyd, playing grocer, his arch-rival in the hit-man business, along with minnie driver as debi, blank's high school sweetheart who he stood up on prom night, and a limited role for alan arkin as dr. oatman, blank's psychologist. that fairly talented cast never really seemed to come together, though. the drama lacked intensity and the comedy lacked real humour. what i thought had the most potential to be a comedic storyline was grocer's proposal for a hit man's union, but aside from becoming a bit of a running joke, the idea never really got developed. as for the romance, one wondered why debi would even think of letting this guy back into her life.<br /><br />there were a handful of chuckles, but nothing really caught me and held me and i spent most of the movie wondering whether this thing was ever going to start to click. it never did - not for me, at least. 2/10
