as someone who has read all of baroness orczy's books and seen most of the movies based on them, i must say that the 1980's version, with anthony andrews and jane seymour, was better than this. it was better written and stuck more to the spirit of the story than this one, which seemed to go out of its way to involve people getting shot. this new adaptation is less light-hearted, yet does not have as much depth, either. although there is some good acting, the actors did not have much to work with. nice costumes, though.
