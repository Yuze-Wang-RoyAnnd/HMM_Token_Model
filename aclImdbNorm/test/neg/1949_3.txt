this is a classic b type movie that you'd rather not waste your time and see. it started well and i thought it will grow up as a good thriller, but i was mistaking. all movie long you get the feeling that soon something interesting will take place and it will suddenly turn into a tensed thriller, but that doesn't happen. it runs slowly and peacefully til the end, with nothing interesting in it. just the ending was unexpected and original, but that's it. vote: 2.5 out of 10. oh, one more thing. why is this movie rated r anyway???
