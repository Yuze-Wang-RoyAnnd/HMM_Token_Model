this movie was so awful that i can't even describe it. i was amazed that i even sat through this pile of trash. i couldn't believe that a movie like this was even thought of. it was a about a serial killer that clucks like a chicken. he doesn't just cluck a couple of times, he clucks non-stop through out the whole movie. he even flaps his arms like a chicken which is even stupider than anything i have ever seen. i couldn't believe this came out in 1990. i thought it came out in the early '80's or something. then the daughter isn't very smart either because she was protecting the geek or man chicken. the end just gets worse and is the worse ending i have ever seen. this movie is just chicken s**t. i was laughing more than i was scared and i strongly suggest going out and getting a bucket of fried chicken instead of seeing this movie.
