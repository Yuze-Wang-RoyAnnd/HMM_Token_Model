actually, i am not narrating the main plot in this comment but with just 2-3 sentences i can make it a spoiler. ok here are these- <br /><br />speed is just a 85% conversion of hollywood flick cellular into bollywood by using the software vikram bhatt. title has no match with the story, only it goes in the thriller direction. just that!! it doesn't deserve even a single star for its imitation, imperfect casting, poor standard and predictable story. undoubtedly now i can say that viram bhatt is slowly vanishing away from his director status as no any matured audience will appreciate his recent works including this. beside him, aftab shivdasani too making his outlook as cartoon-comic type. who knows how long will he last in the film industry more? sometimes the standard in the performances and cinematography look like lower than a c-grade movie. but most supportive role was played by zayed khan which was somewhat identical with chris evan's role as ryan in cellular. with innocent face sanjay suri has no contribution in the movie as he has nothing to impress. that's why those who have already watched cellular i advise you never to waste your time again with this imitation sack.
