i saw this late at night on a minor channel and i put it on expecting a laugh or two. martin lawrence is a good comic actor and i reckoned he might be a good stand-up comedian/actor in the style of richard pryor.<br /><br />i couldn't have been more wrong. this concert was awful. it was full of racist comments directed at white people, muslims and people from india (muslims and indians are the same thing in lawrence's narrow mind) and rambling, clich'ed cod-philosophy (lawrence, like many black comics and directors, can't resist the urge to preach when given a platform. do we really need a lecture on martin luther king and the civil rights struggle during a stand-up comedy show?). then there were his fawning comments designed to ingratiate him with women, it made my skin crawl listening to him.<br /><br />worst of all, the show simply wasn't funny and i found it boring. i turned over halfway through and flipped back to find him either still preaching or going on and on and on about the birth of his child (there was no humour in the story of the birth of his child and it was self-indulgent on his part to bore us with the details. he clearly didn't have very much to say or he would have cut this section of the show out).<br /><br />this show was rubbish: runteldat!
