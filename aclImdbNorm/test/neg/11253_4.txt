first off, i am critical of this movie because i really had high hopes and instead, this movie sucked.<br /><br />*possible spoilers* (if you haven't seen the tv series) where to begin??? well, let's start at the quality. the movie was barely better than the original tv series and the two fight scenes were very nicely crafted. however the cgi was horrid.<br /><br />then there is the plot holes and questions that still remain after the whole movie is all said and done. this movie does not close off as a successful conclusion to a very broad universe known as fma and only returns to expand the universe more before leaving us with nothing but our imaginations to decipher what would happen in the future.<br /><br />and then there is the stories biggest fault. adding wwii and hitler... why ?? the series was perfect... and didn't need hitler. it didn't even need germany.<br /><br />overall the entire movie was sorely lacing in what a true fma movie could have been and if i were the directors, i'd scrap cos and make a new, more "ending", ending.
