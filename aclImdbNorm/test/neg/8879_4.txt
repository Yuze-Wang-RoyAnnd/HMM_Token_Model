having watched this movie several times, i have come to the conclusion that milos forman made a very daring decision to manufacture a muse for goya, when the artist led what most would consider a tempestuous,passionate life while the french revolution and the napoleonic era raged across europe, surely one that would have sufficient drama upon which to draw. while i do understand that mr. forman was relating in the microcosm of the tragedy of ines' life the devastation of the world at that time, i was left feeling that there was just so much of goya left out, so much of his humanity. the strongest and most eloquent point this film made was that because of man's fallen nature each of us is a potential villain in the stream of life, each of us has evil within us that we must fight with the help of god. how eloquent when goya says he should have helped ines more, how true for all of us! we must defend and protect the innocent. the superbly ironic scene in which the once imprisoned priest sentenced to die pronounces the death sentence on lorenzo who condemned him originally is the stuff of genius. i was left wanting something more when the credits rolled. maybe less of the unreal coincidences, and more of the inner life of the characters.
