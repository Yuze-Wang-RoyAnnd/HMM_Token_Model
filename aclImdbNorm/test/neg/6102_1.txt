it is apparent that director, writers and everyone else knows nothing about their own religion or the people who practice it. this movie is endlessly flawed and overall a complete crock.<br /><br />for instance, there is a scene where the rabbi enters the woman's ritual bath while a naked woman is bathing, puts his hand on the head of a woman there and blesses her. this is complete mockery of the laws, in this scene alone some of the laws broken include: modesty, a rabbi would never enter a ritual bath house while there are woman in it.<br /><br />improper contact, a rabbi would never put his hand on a woman's head, not to mention that it is not the way a blessing is given.<br /><br />the woman from the ritual bath is dunking a naked woman by pushing her head under the water, the laws regarding ritual bathing require the entire body to make direct contact with the bath water; this means nobody should be in contact with the person bathing, certainly not pushing them under!<br /><br />there was more just in that scene alone, like dunking 13 times (where does that concept even come from?) not to mention the rest of the movie was a total fallacy. it is scary what ignorance can concoct!
