apparently the film has a harsh anti-bush message... if it does (i didn't get it), that's all it is. it's boring and useless, period.<br /><br />it's too serious at times to be a comedy, too slow to be a thriller, not funny, not gripping, not exciting, not film. it's too everything to be the opposite, and vise versa. i was amazed at how bad a film could suck. don't even think of watching it.<br /><br />i have watched literally hundreds of films, and never have i been so obliged to write a warning on imdb. avoid at all costs. you have been warned.<br /><br />even "the making of..." is painfully boring. it's just people talking gibberish with loads of inside jokes infront of a camera, sort of like a home movie. there even is a part where a guy takes you on a tour of the food that was consumed on the set by the film crew. still, beats the movie i guess...
