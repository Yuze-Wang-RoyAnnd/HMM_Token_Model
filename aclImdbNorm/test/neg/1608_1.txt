it is so bad, i can not tear myself away. i keep asking myself, "why?" "why?" with every scene.<br /><br />there is no continuity, but then again if you want to make a very overtly homosexual movie with a fetishistic attitude towards all things big, big boats, big boys, big planes, then you don't have to worry about things like plot or character. i am baffled, and very concerned that the cag looks so much like richard pryor. it seems wrong to put a pryor look alike in such a terrible movie. but i can't tear myself away. this movie is the first movie i've ever reviewed. that is how phenomenally bad and bizarre it is. it motivated me to join this site. i have counted 50 main characters. perhaps if i was stoned i could follow this, but as it is, i feel like i'm in some kind of never ending bad dream, where it is always 1988, and we were the greatest cocktry on earth.
