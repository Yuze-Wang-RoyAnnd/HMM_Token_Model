this movie was terrible. the acting was lame, but it's hard to tell if someone was acting well since the writing was so bad. this is one of johnny depp's worst movies- i highly discourage anyone from watching it.<br /><br />if you must see cry-baby though, i recommend muting it and simply ogling at mr. depp for and hour and a half.
