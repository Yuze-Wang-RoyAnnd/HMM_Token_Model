this french film is supposedly about a creepy, dim-witted cop who investigates the rape and murder of a young girl in a small town. however, the film is really about nothing and it takes forever to say nothing. if it takes a character ten minutes to walk from point a to point b, the film spends ten minutes showing this walk, and these are the "action" scenes. there are also static shots that last for minutes, making the viewer wonder if he accidentally hit the pause button on the remote. the script has enough material for a 20-minute movie. the movie lasts seven hours or so. you do the math. the actors were apparently amateurs and it shows. note to self: never see a dumont movie again.
