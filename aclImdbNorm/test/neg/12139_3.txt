let me be clear. i hate these kinds of movies. i do not like anything where the protagonists are all bourgeoisie english. i find this kind of literature and film awfully pretentious. you will never get me to read a jane austen book willingly. that said, the only reason i read w. somerset maugham's book and watched the subsequent film was for a class.<br /><br />mary panton (kristin scott thomas) is a beautiful english woman living in a borrowed villa in florence before world war ii. one night after dinning with some of her rich royalty related friends, she willingly picks up an austrian refugee, has sex with him and ditches, and then he kills himself. as the movie gets further and further, you really want to dislike mary.<br /><br />what a load of crap this movie was. first of all, there were many subplots and characters invented in the movie that weren't even in the book. i doubt very much the late mr. maugham would've appreciated them. the characters, though wealthy, were some of the most superficial and self-centered people i have ever seen.<br /><br />the only reason i didn't give it anything less than three stars was because the acting was the only thing redeemable. the always talented kristin scott thomas is perfect for the role of mary. in fact, i couldn't picture anybody else filling her shoes. sean penn and anne bancroft also had supporting roles, that were just as good as the lead.<br /><br />save yourself the pain of watching this movie.
