sex,drugs,rock & roll is without a doubt the worst product of western civilization. the monologues are both uninteresting and pointless in the rare monologue that captures the audience's attention it is quickly lost through overly long repetition and unnecessary additions (the hells angels at mcdonalds comes to mind) i guess bogosian's one man show needed some filler material to give a length that he thought justified the price of admission.<br /><br />i would rather sleep with my aunt and be hung upside down and drained of my blood than see sex,drugs,rock & roll again.
