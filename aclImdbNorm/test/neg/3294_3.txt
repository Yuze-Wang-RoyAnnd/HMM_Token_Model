i grew up watching sitcoms such as seinfeld, roseanne, simpsons, etc. etc. in other words mainstream television. over the years many sitcoms have come on the air and of those a very small percentage are genuinally smart and funny. the war at home is a prime example of the majority of modern american comedy.<br /><br />i give the show a 3 out of 10 because it is what it aims to be, a comedy, but it doesn't seem to go out of its way to be a good comedy. a good comedy should have you swept off your feet with its big jokes, you shouldn't be able to see them coming and in twah i see just about every joke coming. the characters are probably the most simplistic and horrible stereotypes i have seen yet on screen, and the acting isn't very good save for the father who portrays a stereotypical beer drinking sport loving american idiot perfectly.<br /><br />poor acting, unbelievable characters, and jokes that don't catch you off guard detract from this show to a point of where it is unwatchable. if you don't have cable and would like to see a comedy worth watching, try boston legal. it is more worth your time.
