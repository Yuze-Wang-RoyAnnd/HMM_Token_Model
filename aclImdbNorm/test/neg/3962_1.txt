if you are like me and observed the original "benji" phenomenon from afar, finally seeing the movie for the first time 30+ years later, you may be shocked to discover how truly awful it is, and more mystified than ever about its popularity back in 1974.<br /><br />my judgment is not entirely objective as i tend to have a favorable bias toward children's films and for that reason cut them considerable slack. on the other hand i have always hated this particular dog, a feature on the last couple seasons of "petticoat junction". never a great show, the dog-less early episodes were at least a nice showcase of beautiful actresses and the introduction of the dog cut into their screen time.<br /><br />benji is an 86-minute mega-dose of the dog, following him on several daily circuits through the town of mckinney, texas. if this sounds boring you would be advised to give "benji" a wide birth and to never let your remote control fall into the hands of a "benji" fan (if there are still any out there). <br /><br />unlike "my dog skip", "monkey business" or "because of winn-dixie" the human actors in the cast are extremely weak. "big valley's" peter breck plays the standard stern father and just seems to embarrassed at the idea of appearing in something this lame. <br /><br />if one of your children (of any age) appears to be finding "benji" entertaining you should consider cutting back on their medication.<br /><br />then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.
