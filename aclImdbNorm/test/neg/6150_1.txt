awful wot more can i say i remember seeing it in the cinema (see how it sticks painfully in the memory)as a 16 yr old lad. mark hamill was the older generations skywalker and wasn't great at that, he was worse in this. plus a dour soundtrack by then jericho aaaaarrrrrrgggggghhhhhh. there is one film equally as bad as this i saw in the cinema arthur 2 on the rocks. funny how that question "what is the worst film you have ever seen is?" is easier than "what is the best film?" which incidentally varies between the italian job (original), untouchables, casino, things to do in denver, goodfellas (getting a sense of what i like??? - this will fool you!) finding nemo, pirates of the caribbean and moulin rouge! please never watch this film or it will stick in your memory too!
