i have decided to flush this show from my memory down the toilet of bad tv show into the obscurity of forgetful, disappointing, pointless, garbage tv show hell.<br /><br />the skyler guy who is the host/star/creator of this show is boring, uninteresting, unbelievable, not particularly good looking and not at all funny, in short why is this guy on tv and especially why is he in a comedy show when he's not funny, pretending to be a professional con man when he definitely is nothing but an obvious pretender? others have said it here already but this guy is a total fake and fraud, if you believe any of these cons i think you should seriously consider going to get your head checked because they're all fake, and the ones that might possibly be true are so pointless, like spending all day to con someone out of giving you an average meal at a restaurant? seriously this guy needs to go away, glad this show got canned.
