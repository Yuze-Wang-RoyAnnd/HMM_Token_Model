i thought it was weird and just gory, not scary. i have seen a couple of the japanese horror films, ringu and juon, and loved them; but this movie was a disappointment. it never even explained anything about the curse. i just didn't see any horror... it wasn't scary to me at all. the whole time i was watching i was waiting for kirie to discover the secret of the curse and why it was happening now. if this was some ancient curse, why didn't it happen before shuichi's father? and it never told us what happened to her father. i kept waiting for someone to tell us the meaning or the reasoning behind this curse and then it just ended. i was very disappointed.
