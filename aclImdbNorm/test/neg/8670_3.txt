why bother, itv? admittedly, mansfield park is the most difficult of the novels to "get," and fanny is certainly the hardest to like, but... if one is going to take it on, then have the courage to risk being true to the book and its rather complicated spirit. and for heaven's sake, have the guts to cast fanny as she was written: a prissy, good-hearted, sweetish, whiner! mrs. norris wasn't nearly as awful as she should have been. and what the heck happened to portsmouth? the contrast between fanny's rather dubious family and family home and the splendors of mansfield is key to, well, so many aspects of fanny's refusal of henry, her uncle's rejection, henry's near transformation to a good person, etc., etc. again, given the complexity and challenges of the novel, why did they bother? it's beyond me...
