very resistible but ultimately harmless film version of the children's literary classic which incorporates an animated portion in the style of mary poppins (1964) and bedknobs and broomsticks (1971). the human cast is very distinguished - james mason, billie whitelaw, david tomlinson, joan greenwood, bernard cribbins - but their roles range from the miscast (a 69 year-old mason as a thieving chimney-sweep!) to the inconsequential (greenwood as a befuddled aristocrat) to the bizarre (whitelaw plays several 'exotic' characters - including a circus performer, an old hag, a maid and a fairy - for no apparent reason).<br /><br />the animated segment of the film, handled by a group of east-european animators, is hardly inspired but mildly enjoyable in itself and, as usual, with this type of thing, there is an assortment of songs one has to put up with, one of which in particular is reprised far too often for its own good. the film was directed by noted character actor jeffries who had previously directed (far more successfully) other children's films namely the railway children (1970) and the amazing mr. blunden (1972; which i've yet to watch myself but which was released some time ago on r2 dvd by anchor bay uk).
