c'mon, let's put aside the sophomoric humor that we can find in racism and be honest...it isn't funny. i was appalled at the fact that the two main stars would agree to do a film that was so offensive and so detrimental to race relations, and i'm not referring to the obvious black/white commentary in the movie, but to the slams towards other ethnicities, such as betty white's characterizations of the hispanics. should we just chalk up her agreeing to do this movie as a sign of senility...is she too old to distinguish comedy from stereotypical trash? or is it the fault of the writers? how about the third assistant makeup person??? nope, the fault is with us for perpetuating this kind of crap (in the guise of comedy), that hollywood will continue to feed us until we have the decency to say enough is enough...racism is for real and it isn't a laughing matter. we're all different, let's celebrate that diversity, not poke fun at it and promote divisiveness.
