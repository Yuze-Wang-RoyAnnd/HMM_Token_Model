when i checked out the review for this film after i'd watched it, i was surprised that there were people giving it good ratings.<br /><br />this is a film of bad camera-work. everything 'frightening' happens off screen, usually accompanied with a closeup of someone yelling "did you see/hear that?" well, no, we didn't see that! we can't! and when there weren't any close-ups, the camera was doing something weird like rotating upside down, or shaking back and forth really, really quickly, to either convey action or to make us physically sick.<br /><br />the characters were unlikeable because every two minutes, they started screaming the same thing over and over again. i don't care if that's what it would 'really' be like, i did not rent a scary movie to see reasonable things! i expect unreasonable things, like aliens, demons, or good acting! they were stupid, too- let's go have intimate relations in a cave! with all of our clothes on! speaking of which, the ending somewhat contradicts what domingo said immediately before he died. this bugged me a bit, though not nearly as much as the fact that the ending resulted in a... serious invasion of one girl's privacy.<br /><br />no plot, no climax, no good acting, terrible camera-work. what's left? oh, right. the ending may have had a 'twist' but generally with horror movies, the twist at the end actually has understandable relevance to what occurred during the film. sixth sense does- it explains a lot. hide and seek did, too. but the cavern had a lame twist that served as an 'explanation', if you could call it that as it doesn't. explain. anything.<br /><br />don't see it. please.
