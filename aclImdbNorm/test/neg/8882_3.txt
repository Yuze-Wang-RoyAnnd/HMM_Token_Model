with a title like that, you will be forgiven for thinking this film is about the great painter, goya. then after half an hour you decide it is more about the roman catholic inquisition. with even more latitude, perhaps it is just a snapshot of the period. with lurid characterisation, too many axes to grind and a scant regard for fact, milos forman dishes up a colourful but shambolic, rambling mish-mash that fails on all three accounts.<br /><br />milos forman (who lost his jewish father to nazi concentration camps), is the great director who painted the artist mozart as a buffoon and got away with it. won awards for it, in fact. his life in czechoslovakia gave him a taste of diverse, repellent regimes, especially communism. he also made the equally over-the-top but rather impressive, one flew over the cuckoo's nest. so, at the age of 74, how does he come to offer us this mess? in goya's ghosts, goya is one step removed from buffoon. the main character is brother lorenzo, passionately acted by javier bardem. natalie portman is equally vibrant as goya's model ines (and later in the film, her own daughter). the tenuous connection with goya is that he happens to paint both of them.<br /><br />lorenzo tortures (and then rapes) ines who he suspects of being a jew. her father tortures lorenzo. napoleon dashes in to liberate spain (briefly). ines gets out of the dungeon the church has left her in and searches for her child. goya is still painting but has gone deaf. his main preoccupation seems to be helping ines. and so on.<br /><br />historically, goya was also a historian. as forman had sadly relinquished the idea of a biopic of goya the painter, this one fact could have been used to pull the whole film together
