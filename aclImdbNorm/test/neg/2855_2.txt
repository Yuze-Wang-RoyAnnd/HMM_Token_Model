this movie is just plain dumb. don't bother watching it; believe me, you're better off.<br /><br />long and short of the plot: a defense attorney represents a man who murdered his son and other children. in defending him, she comes across a wooden doll of pinnochio. she takes the doll home. pinnochio is possessed and begins to start killing people.<br /><br />this movie moves very slowly only to have such a weak ending. the plot is very bad and the dennis michael tenney's musical score is pitiful. the story, written by kevin s. tenney, is just pointless and evokes no horror or fear. this is a far cry from his work on night of the demons and witchboard, which are decent outings but nothing to write home about. his directing is ok, but with such a bad story no one could have made this movie any good.<br /><br />in conclusion: 2 out of 10, perhaps the blandest, most boring movie i've seen all year.
