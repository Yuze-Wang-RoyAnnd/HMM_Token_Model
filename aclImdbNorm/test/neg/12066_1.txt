warning!!! some possible plot spoilers, as if that was possible!!!<br /><br />okay, if you haven't figured out the plot yet, i am going to give it to you. two couples head out to a camping site, but a clown masked killer shows up and causes all sorts of mayhem.<br /><br />now it is time for me to give these couples some advice.<br /><br />1. never, ever go to camp dubbed camp blood by the locals. 2. don't have sex or make out in front of the killer. 3. don't go chasing after the killer if he or she runs away. 4. don't yell profanity at the killer. 5. make sure your cellular phone works before you go camping. 6. everybody needs to bring a sharp or dangerous weapon and carry it on themselves at all times. 7. wear loose and comfortable clothing and bring a good pair of running shoes. no tight and binding clothing and no high heels or sandals. 8. wear glasses or contact lenses if you need them so you don't stab the wrong person. 9. always carry your car keys on you. 10. put out a camp fire when you go to bed. 11. watch your step. if you trip on something, your going to break a bone. 12. check the backseat for uninvited guess. 13. if the killer has you cornered, at least put up a struggle.<br /><br />and guess what? at least one, but usually all four of the main characters breaks all of these common sense rules. they are the dumbest characters ever to grace a film.<br /><br />now for some brief comments. this slasher film was on a very tight budget. so low four of the 7 or 8 actors play more than one role. the acting, writing, direction, sound, lighting, camera work, plotting, editing, etc. are all bottom of the line. but like the classic film jack o this works on a sooooooooo bad, it is very entertaining and campy fun level. so rent this and have a good time and laugh. my rating: 5 out of 10.
