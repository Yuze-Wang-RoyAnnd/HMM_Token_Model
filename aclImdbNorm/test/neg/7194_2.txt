ever have one of those sneezes that seems to build up forever? you gasp and you convulse and you grab the nearest paper product in preparation for the world's greatest hanky-blower...and then it fizzles. "frankenhooker" was the cinematic equivalent of that lost sneeze. now, i'm big on b-movies, and i always look the other way when a boom mike pops onscreen or an actor speaks his or her lines with all the enthusiasm of gerald ford, but this one really let me down. the cover of the video, for instance, is the tag-line of the whole movie. using parts from murdered new york prostitutes, dr. franken rebuilds his deceased fiancee, only to have her run amok in manhattan as a sort of superprostitute with a bad attitude. after an hour and a half of build-up, this fairly funny ten minutes seemed a little anti-climactic.
