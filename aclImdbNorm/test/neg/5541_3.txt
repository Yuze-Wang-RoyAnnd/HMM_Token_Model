i realize it's a small statistical sampling (8 votes as of this posting), but 5.9 out of 10? i'm giving this movie a 3 and even that's generous. i've tried to watch this movie three times now (the saturday night 9 p.m. premiere on scifi channel, and the saturday night at 1 a.m. and thursday night re-broadcasts) and i've fallen asleep all three times before the movie ends. which leaves me with a laundry list of unanswered questions. for example, is lance henriksen that strapped for cash that he has to keep playing supporting roles in these god-awful "pumpkinhead" sequels? is henriksen contractually banned from doing any non-"pumpkinhead" movies? can't the creators of this franchise do better than a monster that looks like a geriatric, emaciated "alien" who walks like he has a stick jammed up his a**? when are the hick characters in these movies going to realize that handguns and rifles don't hurt the "pumpkinhead?" why don't they try jamming another stick up this thing's a** instead? and, lastly, are the writers of this movie so creatively challenged that they couldn't come up with names for the two feuding families more original than the hatfields and the mccoys? while you're at it, why not write a screenplay about a fictional president and name him george bush? someday i may have the mental stamina to watch this movie all the way through without drifting off to sleep. until then, if somebody has the answers, please let me know.
