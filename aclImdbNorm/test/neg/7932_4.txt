this movie examines the now infamous wannsee conference where top nazis gathered to discuss the organisation and implementation of the "final solution" first off, i want to say i was amazed to see kenneth branagh play a nazi. with the slicked back blonde hair, he certainly looked the part but he didn't really act the part well. there was none of the menace & cruelty and in the end, he came out looking like a grinning cheerleader, keeping the meeting going. the real heydrich would not have let the conference get out of control the way it did in the film.<br /><br />the best performance of all was undoubtedly colin firth who played dr william stuckart, the man who wrote the 1935 nuremberg race laws and who gave "legal respectibility" to everything the nazis did. firth's performance was stunning, the main vocal opponent to what heydrich was proposing. the best part of all was when he was verbally dressing down one of the nazi thugs. the thug muttered "i'll remember you" and firth replies "you should! i'm very well-known!!" the film is historically accurate but let's boil it down to what it really is - 90 minutes of a group of men around a table discussing, shouting and bragging. there's no excitement, no real conflicts (except the brief argument). it's just 90 minutes of talking! same room, same table, same people.<br /><br />i'm not sure if the dvd is worth the money. i for one felt short-changed.
