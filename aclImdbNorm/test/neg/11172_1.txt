don't be fooled by the plot out-line as it is described on the cover (at least the swedish version). the story on this seems rather interesting, with speculative hints. nothing can be further from the truth. this is the absolute most sad movie experience i've ever had... it is plain and right awful and should not be sold or rented to anyone. if you still think the plot seems intriguing, reflect on this: telephones can move, run and kill people as can also any other electric appliance. it can throw things at you, haunt you and run after you. please do not watch this movie it is a disgrace for the horror genre...
