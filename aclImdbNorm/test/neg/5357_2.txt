what can you say after watching this movie? that is, if you had the interest and concentration to see it to the end. i was left speechless, due to the amazingly dull story, annoying situations where one american equals that of a fifty or more iraqis, and boring dialogue. i think that if this movie has something to teach, it probably goes like "don't screw with us, or we'll come and kick your butts". plus, this film truly encourages and votes for killing masses of foreigners, in the name of war. i got the image of tackling chess pieces out of the playing board. except, now it's fast and there's not so much thinking. and on top of that.. no character there has any spirit; then, how can you care at all what happens to any of them. excluding war movie fans with no taste, i wouldn't recommend this to anyone. there should always be something more interesting to do.
