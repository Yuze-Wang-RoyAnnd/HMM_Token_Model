most of you out there really disliked this movie... you were right. a small minority of you really loved the movie... can't say you' re wrong. for me, this movie was too stupid. i have seen many dumb, silly comedies but this one surpasses every one of them. as i was watching i couldn't stop rubbing my eyes, not believing what i was seeing and trying to decide if i should laugh or cry, as *really stupid* stuff were going on on the screen, and people were leaving the theater.<br /><br />according to the leading characters, time travel is accomplished, just enter any museum and you will actually travel to the past. plus, if you are seeking an after death experience, just go to the nearest planetarium, there you shall meet lord - sorry, loydd and be given important commands... all te above doesn' t really make sense, right? well, go ahead, watch the movie (i almost never regret the movies i watch), you probably won't like it, but you will be intrigued by the writer's ability in producing the ultimately stupid script...<br /><br />i' m giving it a 3 out of 10, not good, far from being the worse...
