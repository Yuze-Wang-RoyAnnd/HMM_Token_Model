this is one the worst movie i've seen and certainly worst movie nagesh kuknoor has made. i can't believe person who has created movie like teen deewarein can create utter crap like this. <br /><br />plot of the film itself is really faulty that zeenat has to search meera and get her clemency to help her husband avoid death penalty in soudi arabia. common logic says if zeenat cannot search meera easily so won't the soudi government, so zeenat can safely forge meera's signature or thumb-print and produce it before the soudis. another silliest thing is shankar has given incorrect address in his passport, so indian government officials cannot get to the address but after sometime meera gets shankar's suitcase through soudi government. wow! doesn't it make soudis well networked in india more than indians?<br /><br />nagya makes a slightly more than cameo in the movie with role of chopra, who is eyeing meera and seeks meera's father-in-law, girish karnaad(this guy is just wasted)'s help to get her as a keep. <br /><br />nagya cannot speak hindi and he has been assisted by other guys to translates the english dialogs he writes, in hindi. this time, it seems that his aide was in serious intoxication, when writing dialogs like "imaan ki chalaang" (leap of honesty). within minutes, to our worst nightmares, meera not only takes this honest leap, she taps her feet to do "imaan ka naach" (dance of honesty).<br /><br />one of the only bright spot movie has is its cinematography and really nice hues. but since bollywood has learned the thing called post-production, almost all the movies have vibrant colors and nicely blended backdrops, so no big deal.<br /><br />conclusion is that making a cheesy movie is not limited to chopras or johars or barjatyas, nagyas and all are ready to get affected.
