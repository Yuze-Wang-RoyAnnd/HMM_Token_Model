ok, we got jp from grandma's boy and chuck from, well chuck. i thought this movie would be quite good based on the reviews, and it did start out pretty high on my movie scale, but about halfway through it was just dragging out for so long i kept losing interest. i actually got so bored, probably because you can see right away what's going to happen in the end; the story is actually quite thread-bare, i skipped over 15 minutes and didn't miss a thing! this film should have been a short work, maybe around 45 minutes to an hour max. it starts out good and finishes good, too bad the filling is bland, boring, dull, and lacks everything but time. some people say they like it for the music; i don't care for jazz and i don't go see movies for their score, i go for the story and when that's drawn out... well, ratings drop in my book.<br /><br />bottom line: good open, great close, boring filler. story was cool, but if you don't know what's going to happen a quarter of the way through, you haven't seen too many thrillers.
