the only thing i expected that this film didn't have was an intelligent, talking motorcycle.<br /><br />this film is just plain awful. i gave it 1 star, which of course, means i enjoyed it tremendously. bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, bad fight choreography. the only real actor in this movie is martin landau, who of course does a good job playing the villain, although the character is your standard cardboard cutout evil ceo/villain. even the so-called "plot twist" at the end was no shock.<br /><br />there was so much to make fun of in this movie, i enjoyed it a lot. and it did have a few impressive car wreck stunts.<br /><br />like bad movies? check this one out, ouch. want a good movie? not here.
