i just saw this early this morning on the fox channel quite by accident (my dog woke me up) - i had seen it years ago and thought i remembered it fairly well. as a kid, i had enjoyed it. but now? as another poster commented, several of the reels were out of order, and while it was disorienting at first, and bizarre, it seemed to fit the production - what was just awful became surreal and amusing. musical numbers for what i think was the "big" fundraiser show("you're in show business, i'm in show business, most of the kids are in show business, let's put on a show")come out of nowhere before all the talk about putting on a show, and then fade without applause to totally unrelated "straight" scenes. the leading man's girlfriend shows up, spits out lines and lines of dialogue, then disappears. i was half awake, and loved every insane minute of it.
