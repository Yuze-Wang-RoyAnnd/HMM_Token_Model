the acting was bad, and the plot, well i don't think there was one.<br /><br />some fat blonde chap who is always dressed in a dinner suit, kidnaps a sort from a nightclub, i think he then kills a copper. pointless fights then happen kidnapped girl is put in cage on a boat, why? tough uncompromising martial arts trained cop turns up, speaks bad english and does stuff that does not make sense. its utter tripe. but he does have a nice car. christ on a bike, this film was a waste of 90 minutes.
