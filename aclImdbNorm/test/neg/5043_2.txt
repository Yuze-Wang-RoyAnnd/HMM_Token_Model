this movie is like porn with all of the good parts removed. it's like all of the porn stars that didn't want to fulfill their obligations banded together around this awful, trite, useless piece of gargoyle abstinence.<br /><br />this is a helpful movie if you're in the mood to torture a loved (or no longer loved) one. it's important that, if you choose to use this movie as a method of torture, that you put in earplugs and put on a blindfold to keep yourself from going insane.<br /><br />if i had a choice between this movie and the 700 club...i'd choose girls gone wild.<br /><br />overall, better if you've been drinking. but only because it becomes a drinking game of epic proportions.
