pretty lame and awful slasher about someone killing the members of a high school track team after their star runner dies during a meet.<br /><br />christopher george gives a hilariously over-the-top performance as the track team's coach. i don't think anyone has ever taken track and field as seriously as chris does here - not even in the olympics. it's a typically divine cg performance, and if you are a fan of the man/the legend, you should run right out and grab a copy.<br /><br />but we watch slashers for the murders (you know it's true), not the performances, and graduation day fails to deliver on most counts (there is one really good kill). true horror only comes during a performance by the band "felony". never heard of 'em? watch graduation day and find out why.
