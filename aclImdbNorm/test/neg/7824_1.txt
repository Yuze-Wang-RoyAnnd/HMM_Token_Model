this film was terrible. i thought it would be ok but it just got worse and worse. from the starting scenes it seems to be heading in the direction of another safe predictable rom-com, but the moment he arrives at the house it just disintegrates. none of the characters have any depth and the only person who was anywhere near believable was tom, although the way he became so easily distracted just annoyed me after a while. the dialogue is ridiculous and the structure of the film almost completely non-existent. in an insulting attempt at comedy the writer/director introduces a new character or event in practically every scene, none of which are realistic, making it very confusing to keep track of what is going on. the plot is barely an excuse for a movie : guy likes girl, house sits fathers home to get to know girl, destroys house, gets girl. a complete waste of time.
