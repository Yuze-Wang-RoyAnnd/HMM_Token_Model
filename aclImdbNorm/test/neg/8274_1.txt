ok.. at the time of writing, 65 people voted for this movie, bringing it to a 5 out of 10 rating. my guess is that only the film crew voted. so i'm here to bring some justice to it all.<br /><br />never has a movie provoked the audience's intelligence more than this one. given, i laughed out loud quite a bit - but the movie/story absolutely didn't want me to.<br /><br />i've seen a lot of bad movies. a lot. but man, this one blows them all away.<br /><br />speaking '96 computers, ridiculous acting, and wheelchair chases - and we have young tarantinos who can't get their ideas financed. yup, life's a cruel joke.
