i fail to see how anyone who has actually read the m. didius falco mysteries could make such a mockery of them. an aussie has no business in ancient rome. nothing of the books is in this film except the setting and characters, and they are wasted on a plot thin enough through which to read the silly script. kevin connor and lee zlotoff have a lot of nerve displaying their names in the credits.
