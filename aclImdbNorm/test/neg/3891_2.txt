lovely music. beautiful photography, some of scenes are breathtaking and affecting. but the dramatic tension is lost in a film that is so poorly edited it is hard to know what exactly is going on. at times, the dialogue is incomprehensible. then there is richard gere. he's supposed to be a factory worker who gets into trouble and gets work on a farm. we see dozens of farmhands sweaty and dirty in the hot sun. then we see gere, looking like he just wandered away from a calvin klein ad. sam shepard, another glamour guy, is supposed to be terminally ill. but he looks great. nice try, but it just doesn't work. brook adams try hard but she gets lost in the scenery.the real star is the girl.
