this could have been a good biopic, but what a mess! i had this film when i was a theater manager. when i put the film together, and watched it, i thought i had some reels out of order. as it turned out i didn't, and if i did, nobody would have noticed. i couldn't figure out what's going on! everybody who walked out pretty much felt the same way!
