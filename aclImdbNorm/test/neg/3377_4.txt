having already seen the original "jack frost", i never thought that "jack frost 2" would be as absurd as it is. boy was i wrong! then again, a-pix movies have a way of showing unbelievably bad material, even worse than you might expect. i believe this is the first a-pix sequel, and it may be an indication of what to expect in the future: more a-pix sequels.<br /><br />it's hard to watch this without laughing, especially during the later parts of the movie in which jack frost's offspring (which are essentially snowballs with eyes, arms, a mouth and sharp teeth) start killing people with the typical comedic dialogue and silly voices to go with it. they are shown both as puppets (with a stick underneath to move them) and as computer animation, which i have to say looks very cheesy. the computer animation surprised me, as the first "jack frost" had no such effects.<br /><br />i'd strongly recommend that you see the original "jack frost" before seeing this one (both of which it would be preferable to watch with a group of friends) to get the full amusement out of it, and because it would make more sense ("sense" being a relative term).<br /><br />now only if there was "uncle sam 2"...
