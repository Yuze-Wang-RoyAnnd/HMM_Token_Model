i always wanted to see electra glide in blue for a very long time. i've always been intrigued by the title, the star and the desert but for some (now pretty clear) reason, this film is never shown on tv or i've happen to miss it if it's ever shown. well, after watching the dvd, i now know why the movie is rarely shown: it's because it's not that good. in fact, i'd say it's pretty much of a mess.<br /><br />electra glide in blue was made by a first time director and it shows. the film is mainly a series of vignettes with absolutely nothing holding it together. more like a collection of short movies haphazardly strung together. the movie can be boiled down to this: intro (murder); cop and girlfriend together; intro credits; cops going to work; crazy guy tells story; cop finds dead body; cop and chief and girlfriend at bar; chase scene; etc. the scenes just don't flow together. they're very distinctively independent from each other and because of this the characterization is weak, borderline amateurish. the scene at the bar with the girlfriend, the scene at the farm with the hippies, the scene with big john and the chief yelling at each other were cringe worthy. i almost stopped the film during those (awful) moments.<br /><br />the film-maker's lack of experience is in evidence throughout the film. the style, like the 1970s, is all over the map. the intro credit scene makes the movie look like a commercial for law enforcement. then it tries to be a buddy film (big john and zipper) then a murder mystery; then a melodramatic love story; etc. a film doesn't have to have one particular style in order to be successful but i'm afraid the style in electra glide in blue was confused. you can clearly see that the director had no idea what he was doing or where he was going with it.<br /><br />the film is not a complete disaster. while the content of electra glide in blue is almost amateurish, the look of it is extremely (and deceptively) professional. the cinematography is stunning. every frame is worthy of an exhibition at an art gallery. or, because the first (and last) time director was involved in the music business, worthy of an album cover. the beautiful look of the film gives more credence to the finish product than it really deserves. and thanks to robert blake's acting (of a really badly written character), the film maintains a certain level of realism, even though nothing else makes much sense. what's remarkable about the look and composition of the film is that it's been copied and duplicated a million times over. the intro credits reminded me of something like top gun, which was made 13 years later. scenes of johnny dressing up, with his clothes on the bed, reminded me of american gigolo. strangely enough, electra glide in blue has a very contemporary feel to it, due to the stunning visuals, even if the story and the philosophy behind it are hopelessly outdated.<br /><br />so, electra glide in blue is, on one hand, a remarkably underrated and overlooked film because it obviously influenced a lot of future filmmakers out there when it comes to the look and composition. very few films can claim to have achieved this and legendary cinematographer conrad hall should take full credit. but, on the other hand, egib is also deservedly forgotten because the poor characters, confusing story, and muddled direction, none of which are worth of remembering.
