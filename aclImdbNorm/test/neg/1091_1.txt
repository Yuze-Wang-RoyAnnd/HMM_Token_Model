well, i notice imdb has not offered any plot info...that's because it's not possible to do that without sounding vile and disgusting...because that's what this movie is...vile and disgusting !! i watched it because i am a humongous fan of chris noth, whom i have met in person and he is a great guy...but if i ever meet him again, i will have no qualms about asking him whatever posessed him to star in something so awful. he plays a former child prodigy who is now a brilliant doctor, who spends his spare time running over small children with his car, with the intent of maiming and crippling them...this is not a "spoiler", because all this is made very clear from the begining...sickening enough?? oh, it gets better...he is manipulated into doing this, by his incestuous sister, who threatens to with-hold sexual favors from him if their latest victim fails to die...even clive barker couldn't write anything so hideous. please, if you want to see chris noth in something worthy of his talent, rent "teddy roosevelt and the roughriders"
