this film without doubt is one of the worst i have seen. it was so boring that i simply could not wait for it to end. i talked my girlfriend into watching it after this site had good reviews and after even 30 mins in she looked at me as if to say "your nuts" the scenery was as boring as the film with nothing but driving around in the car looking at the wind blowing bits of bush around. the acting was un-inspiring and the film was simply a waste of what have been a good idea into a waste of a dvdr.<br /><br />guy pierce should have stuck to neighbours as at least he washed his hair. all he done was talk on his phone but yet sold nothing as a salesman. he would have been sacked weeks before. his girlfriend (once in coyote ugly) should have remained dancing on the bar as at least she looked hot in that.<br /><br />the guy who played vincent (those who watched know) was so annoying with his phone calls that any normal person would have drove to his house and hit him with a bit of 4 by 2.<br /><br />i do not on this earth know what anyone liked about it. i actually want people to watch this to suffer the torture i went through.
