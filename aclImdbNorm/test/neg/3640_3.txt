this show makes me(and many others) hate their lives. let's face it, zoey is perfect; she's bland pretty, gets good grades, everyone goes to her for advice, she's popular, she goes to an amazing school with amazing rooms. reasons why i gave this show a 3: 1. the acting is horrible.sometimes i just want to hurt the people who put these untalented actresses(especially victoria justice) on television. 2. the characters are unbelievable and mismatched. you have your typical popular girl. a peppy, shallow, stupid ,stereotypical, girl who is portrayed by a horrible actress. then you have a typical jock guy who is somewhat normal and actually nice.then the stereotyped smart girl who is a freak and obviously does not fit in with the perfect popular friends of hers. then a stuck up rich pretty boy that would be happier gazing into a mirror all day. then the wanna be actress who is played by another stinky actress. and last a normal nerd person guy. 3. the plot is boring, and lame. 4. i hate how spoiled these characters are. can't they just be normal! 5. everything ends up perfect for them, and we all are reminded of how much our lives stink.
