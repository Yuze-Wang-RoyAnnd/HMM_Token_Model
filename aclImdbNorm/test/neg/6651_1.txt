this movie is absurd. absolutely terrible. michael keaton and andy garcia must really have needed the work to do this movie. the plot is totally not believable! michael keaton agrees to donate bone marrow to the dying son of a detective, but then escapes. he manages to elude the police throughout the hospital - not believable that he would have so much knowledge of the hospital. he takes an extremely convoluted route to get out of the hospital, blowing up the power generators and a pedestrial bridge (why?). and to top that andy garcia (father of the dying boy) and a doctor help the criminal so as to get the bone marrow. the plot is such baloney! maybe the worse movie i have ever see.
