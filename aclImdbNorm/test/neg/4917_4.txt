at the rate these movies are ploughing through the artifacts from the amityville house it won't be long before we get down to the floorboards, but for now it's a mirror that's causing problems for more cardboard characters in this sixth entry in the series. a homeless man hands it over to artist hairdo ross partridge, who then has strange visions and discovers some unpleasant revelations about his past. this mundane horror trundles along at a dull pace, leaving us waiting for a build up that never comes as the various 'spooky' goings-on lead to a dumb finale. bland and lifeless, with ropey acting and partridge's huge hair not helping matters.
