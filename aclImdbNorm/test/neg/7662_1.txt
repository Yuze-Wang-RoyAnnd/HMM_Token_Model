this final installment of the "airport" franchise was so incredibly awful that it took me awhile to realize it actually wasn't a slapstick comedy, like "airplane". george kennedy shooting a flare gun out an open window to divert heat-seeking missiles was comical. what would happen to your hand if you held it out a window at mach two speed? you'd lose your grip on the gun and get a broken arm. the passengers were unintentionally hilarious, as was the interior of the plane. the sophisticated french woman coming on to slobby george kennedy was like jackie kennedy coming on to ernest borgnine. ain't gonna happen. susan blakely, a talented and unappreciated actress, did not get any points on her resume for this one. neither did robert wagner. this movie was so lousy it seemed surreal.
