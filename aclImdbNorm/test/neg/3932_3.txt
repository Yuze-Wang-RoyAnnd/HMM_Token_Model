this movie was not that good at all. here is the first clue and that it is not gonna be a strong movie, harrison ford's name not only appears first but it is also bigger than the title. the music was nominated for an oscar, what the heck was that? that music was probably the most annoying thing in the movie. the acting was sub par at best, except the amish boy he did a decent job for being so young. then you have the story which was weak and a little over the place, and it won for adapted! the music was horrid, i know i already said something but it was really bad. the premises was real good and it should be remade. well that's all i really have on that.<br /><br />your average movie guy,<br /><br />-trever
