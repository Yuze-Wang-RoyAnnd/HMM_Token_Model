the worst movie i have ever seen i didn't even watch it all i just fast forwarded it to burt's bits and then the end!!! he is the only reason to watch this!! i have to admit to owning a copy as i am a huge burt fan (stop laughing) and needed it for my collection i wouldn't care when this movie came out i had a nightmare renting ti as my local store only had 2 copies and fans of all the various stars always beat me there, imagine my disappointment when i sat down and watched this movie!! there are just no redeeming qualities about this movie!!! absolutely nothing what so ever to like about this movie!!! this movie became a running joke between myself and a mate burt's worst!! rob lowe's worst worst hour and a half of my life
