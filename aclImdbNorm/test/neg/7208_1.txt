dark harvest 3: scarecrow: 1 out of 10: in einstein's theory of relativity time is of the perspective of the one that views time. (or so i've heard) in other words this movie feels a lot longer that an hour and change. even on fast-forward (and you will be reaching for that fast forward button) it clocks in somewhere around eternity.<br /><br />if you are familiar with lionsgate's own version of project greenlight (this is where they buy a home movie but a fancy cover on it and sneak it into the horror section of your local wal-mart) you will not be surprised by the complete and utter lack of entertainment value contained within.<br /><br />the line reading (i refuse to call it acting) is uniformly awful. this is a collection of deadbeat dads and strippers pretending to be in a movie between cans of schlitz. the camera work is drunken father shooting vacation film quality and while the special effects are okay the scariest effect is the breast augmentation scars in the nude scene.<br /><br />the story is awful, the sets are from a haunted halloween put on by adhd middle school students and once again the line reading (remember this is not acting anymore than sinking to the bottom of a pool is swimming) is distracting beyond mere words. avoid.
