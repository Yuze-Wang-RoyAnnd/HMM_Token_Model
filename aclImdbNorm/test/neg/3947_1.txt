i tried. god knows i tried to like this swiss cheese of a movie, but the story was too full of holes, some big enough to drive a horse drawn carriage through. the acting overall was even and the characters endearing enough that you regretted they died off like recently sprayed roaches, scattering off to die their own gruesome deaths. overall, however, it was not really very scary. afterall we have seen spooky quickly moving figures in the background since "the brood" why back when / and it was scary then just briefly. this film just never resolved the basic plot points and thats the writer's job. naturally you would expect the director to pick up on the fact that the story did not make sense. like who's was the secret room behind the wardrobe, why did the blood hungry ghost not die when she received the nails as prescribed by the book they read earlier? why did the computer say "game over" for frankie's character even though he lived? the list goes on and on. i don't really feel comfortable recommending this film as its makes you feel like you wasted your time and there was not enough payoff in truly scary moments.
