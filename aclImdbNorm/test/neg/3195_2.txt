wow. i watched one night at mccool's yesterday, and all i can say is, "wow."<br /><br />here i go. major spoilers.<br /><br />would you like a summary of the plot, just to see how stupid and pointless this movie is? i would never tell anybody to watch it, unless i was out to inflict pain upon them. anyway, here's a glimpse (or a huge chunk) of the plot.<br /><br />randy works for a bar, mccool's. he meets up with this woman named jewel who convinces him to, surprisingly, have sex with him. her ex-boyfriend ends up trying to rob them and gets killed. randy and his cousin and the detective at the scene of the crime all fall for jewel. she, being the mascot of stupidity, uses every one of these guys to get what she wants, involving a dvd player. randy hires a hit man to kill her, and eventually the detective is killed by the ex-boyfriend's psycho brother and the hit man and jewel take off.<br /><br />seriously. that's it. i left hardly anything out, except for a few more sex scenes and a nearly-pornographic scene of liv tyler as jewel using a hose to flaunt her sexuality.<br /><br />what was the point of this movie? to be honest, i think it was so that the producers and directors could show off their male urges. which i think is absolutely uncalled for and just plain stupid. when i watch a movie, i want a plot. i want characters. i don't care about sexy woman flaunting anything they might have. something should happen in a movie, for goodness' sake. this is as bad as fight club.<br /><br />it gets even worse. john goodman is the detective devoted to the higher being. i myself wondered why goodman would play in something so outrageously pitiful as this, but then i remembered that he was in o brother, where art thou? as well. his reputation just went down a notch.<br /><br />liv tyler was an amazing actress in the lord of the rings series. in this movie she is nothing more than an unintelligent slut who wants nothing but her way. her reputation has gone down seven or eight notches, to me.<br /><br />i am amazed, simply amazed that people would work so hard to make something so stupid. the music is absolutely crappy (having "ymca" play while john goodman's character is being killed doesn't really fit), the characters are totally unlikeable, the plot is one of the most stupid ever conceived by man, and to top it off, it doesn't even fit into any genre. the closest it gets to is pornographic comedy. if it was even supposed to be funny. which it wasn't.<br /><br />i think i'm done ranting now. but let me just assure you that nobody in their right mind would ever, ever want to see this movie. unless they lust for liv tyler as much as the characters do, that is.
