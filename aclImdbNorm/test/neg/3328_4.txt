i want to say i liked this film, i really do, but when it boils down to it it was just far too boring. it starts off looking promising, and even once they get inside the mines the creepy atmosphere and mood is great. the problem is the monster, or lack of it. as people have said it's a stop-motion monster, but that's not the problem (stop-motion can look great if done properly). the problem is that we don't see enough of it and we don't get to see any deaths. this is meant to be a horror film so a lack of monster and a lack of deaths equals boredom. there were some scenes i liked, such as when one girl is using her camera in the dark and the monster is coming towards her. there are also a few other creepy scenes but they are far too few to hold your interest and definitely not worth watching the film for. it's a shame, because i can see that had it been handled correctly it would've been an effectively creepy horror flick. the saddest thing is that films like this will never be made again, because film makers over-polish their films these days and rely on crappy cgi effects.
