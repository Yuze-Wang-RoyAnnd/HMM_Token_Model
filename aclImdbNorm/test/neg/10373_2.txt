being a gay man who lived through the time period examined in this tedious documentary, i was eager to see how the subject matter was handled. unfortunately, the film makers wasted what could have been an energetic and insightful opportunity to shed some light on our collective gay history. this film only concerns itself with the period within new york city, ignoring the rest of the country. while i spent a fair amount of time in nyc at that time, i can assure you that there was a gay life outside manhattan! the men interviewed here are the same "a-list" queens who thought they were better than anyone else during the 70s, and here they are again, waxing nostalgic and still throwing attitude. the film should have at least tried to cover larger topics, such as race, ageism, the burgeoning gay "caste system" based on wealth, body image, and the rise of the "clones", discrimination of sub-groups within the community, and the ability to grow a decent mustache (which was very important in the 70s!). alas, we have none of this presented, and the recollections of those interviewed are no different than my own memories. if you were there in that decade, you'll enjoy the archival photos and grainy home-movies of the bars and discos we haunted. if you weren't there, this film will undoubtedly seem dull. it should have been so much more, but sadly, it's not. two stars for jogging my memory...i still miss going to the anvil!
