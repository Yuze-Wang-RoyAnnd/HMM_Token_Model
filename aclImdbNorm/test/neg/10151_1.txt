i love cheesy horror movies, i think dead alive and bad taste are great and i think slumber party massacre ii (not even related to this movie) are hilarious. but this movie absolutely stank, i didn't laugh, i didn't even enjoy it.. you can see all kinds of mistakes that aren't even campy. the best take of the scene where the woman leans out the window is the one where she smacks her head on the sill? give me a break.<br /><br />don't rent this thinking it's related to the slumber party massacre series. it's awful and i don't even have a clue how it got any distribution. rent it with a fake name and burn it, do everyone else the favor.
