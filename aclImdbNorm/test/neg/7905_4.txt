this movie wasn't too funny. it wasn't too horrible either. just a fun ride aboard the soul plane. it's a black-owned flight service with a kick-ass disco, beautiful bar, and pumping stewards. the plot takes you through the whole idea of a black (not race or color, but 'style') -owned plane with the same style of black humor. at times, there are some great rare scenes like when the main character uses the 'normal' lavatory in the 'normal' plane. check that out. there are lulls, however, and i find it most in the character who played the soul pilot. watch to find out who it is. all in all, it's a fun movie. tom arnold adds to the fun with his 'cracker' attitude. this is one movie to watch when playing poker, when you're drunk, or just vegging.
