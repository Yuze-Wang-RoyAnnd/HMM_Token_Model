the dog can act...unfortunately nobody else in the cast of this sordid faux children's film can. a stray yet very clever dog insinuates himself into the lives of two motherless children, much to the chagrin of their bitter and cold-hearted father. in what can only be described as dickensian, the evil widower forbids his children --- who may or may not be mentally challenged --- from playing with benji. neither the children nor benji obeys. soon the children are kidnapped and benji has to help the police find them. it's only then that the old man realizes that benji is good, not bad.<br /><br />tom lester, whose only previous acting experience appears to have been playing the dim-witted eb on green acres plays one of the kidnappers. so does the regrettably over-utilized deborah walley. walley's previous screen triumphs include beach blanket bingo and the woeful it's a bikini world. she also played both gidget and tammy in the past and here attempts to obliterate her good-girl reputation by playing it bad! <br /><br />stay away from benji...he's a dog and this movie is a dog!
