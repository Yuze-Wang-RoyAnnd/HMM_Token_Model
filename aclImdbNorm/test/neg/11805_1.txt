no one can say i wasn't warned as i have read the reviews (both user & external), but like most of us attracted to horror movies... curiosity got this cat. (come on, we all scream at the people in the movie not to go into the dark room, but you know that's horror aficionados are always dying to know what's in there even if we know it'll be bad).<br /><br />the bottom line is that this movie left me angry. not because it pretends to be real (who cares...gimmicks are allowed), or because the actors and dialogue are so lame (is this an unusual event in horror movies?) or even because the movie is so bad (and i am being polite here). what really got me mad is that the film is not only a rip off of bwp, but also a half-hearted lazy rip off at that.<br /><br />i don't believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could outdo bwp then kudos to them, but they didn't even try. the movie was made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in horror (or any) movie!
