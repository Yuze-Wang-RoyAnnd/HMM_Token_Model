after reading many good things about it ,i finally watched "the clearing".with a cast of great actors like redford and dafoe ,one would,at least, expect a decent film.after the closing credits had rolled i was still shocked by how bad and incoherent this movie actually was.<br /><br />is it supposed to be an "art" film??i don't think so cause it is too melodramatic for that.the bad thing is that the drama seems way too forced and unrealistic.<br /><br />the truth is that the script makes absolutely no sense.first of all it never really explains the motive behind the actions of any of the characters,it just overblows their so called "personal issues".what's so bad about redford's character's life that he has to "clear it"??the fact that he cheats,occasionally,his wife??the guy is a millionaire who has had a good life,has a great son and a great daughter,a wife that loves him(and a girlfriend that also seems to be way above the generic mistress type of woman)o and a new-born grandson.the only problem seems to be that he...has been working hard for all his life to be a successful person.so what??it seems that his hard work has really paid off and there's actually no real problems with his life.<br /><br />then we come to dafoe's character:here's someone who was a manager for one of redford's companies and was fired.why is this guy unemployed for ...eight years???it seems that he must have some kind of good education to have a job like the one he had in the first place and seems to have been a man with solid ideas about his work(as evident by his flashback of a conversation that he had with redford when he was working for him).why couldn't a man like that get a decent job and have a decent life??cause he was ,once,fired??totally unrealistic.<br /><br />the film really tries to portray these men as "tortured souls" or something and that comes off as really cheesy.in fact i would say that if the creators of this film were trying to say something about the american dream then they failed miserably.<br /><br />as for the actual events that take place during the movie ,they also make no sense at all.in fact the last 20 minutes of the film come off as an insult to the viewer's intelligence,because there's not one thing that takes place that actually makes any sense.redford seems to have about a 1000 chances to escape ,yet he doesn't.at one moment he is ready to escape and yet he misses his chance cause he feels sorry for his kidnapper and doesn't want to hurt him!!!then dafoe picks up his gun from the water and the mud,which should be useless(if you fire a shot with a gun after the gun has been in the water and mud it will possibly blow up in your face)and the gun is in perfect condition!!! the way an unemployed ,useless(as portrayed in this film) and mentally unstable character,manages to outsmart the entire fbi with such ease brings the narrative of this film to "twilight zone" levels.the cheesy ending(with redford's wife illusion) comes to finish the viewer off.<br /><br />this film pretends to be something,it's not(i.e a quality,sophisticated psychological thriller).unfortunately it fails so hard,that it becomes a disaster and that's the word that describes this film best:a disaster.
