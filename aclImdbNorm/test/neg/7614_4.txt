i am still waiting for that dark muppet film where we won't know how it ends from the beginning. i think linklater could do one hes experimented with animation. this time i was intelligently not expecting such a thing but deeply wishing.<br /><br />joan cusack sucked. she moved to a made-for-tv level lazily acting this one with cliched cynic. the muppets were more life-life than she was. a disappointment.<br /><br />but then the entire film was, bar pepe. i loved him. he was the only one to ever get me laugh(while goldbergh as god got me choking and cursing). if we can't see a dark muppets than how about at least a pg:13 one with more of pepe's controversial jokes and animals metal-head, egg-nog-chuggin persona.<br /><br />the worst muppets i saw even the boring christmas carol beats this one out. the muppets need to avoid this over commercialized holiday.<br /><br />5/10
