following the whirlwind success of the wrestler (see my review), mickey rourke had this "gem" head straight to video. every copy was rented for months and i even heard some good buzz around it. so months later i caught it on a movie network and sat down to watch it. first of all...one of the locations in the film (walpole island) is a place i used to visit on a regular basis as a child because we lived very, very close to the reserve. cool huh? that's about where the coolness ends with this dud. i mean the story is decent enough to warrant a four and even the direction is not bad but the performances are just awful, and downright ridiculous with some truly wasted star power and mickey $%#@*&! rourke playing a native canadian/american hit-man?!?! what in the lord's name were they thinking?? he doesn't even resemble native blood and his attempt at the generic native accent made him look even more ridiculous. they could have went anywhere with this story...they could have hired a native actor, or changed rourke's character, how about a white man raised by native parents? instead they made killshot a complete and utter joke.<br /><br />as you may have caught mickey rourke "stars" in killshot, i use that term loosely. i have never liked rourke much although his oscar winning performance was decent enough. this shows and confirms my dislike for him. he looks bored, constantly bored, and his lame attempt at portraying a native is bordering on insulting i would think. he makes a decent cold blooded killer but then the story never explores that part of him which is totally backwards to the story. diane lane, although well respected in hollywood, turns in another drab performance. she has had her moments but overall she just usually doesn't take off in any one performance. she looks like she is going to be great but then when she isn't, its even more disappointing. thomas jane plays her protective husband. i've always felt jane deserves a bigger career than he has. i think he's got action star in his blood. all said and done his performance in killshot is actually not bad. he doesn't take things too far and he's tough and almost heroic in a way. him and lane manage to have decent chemistry but he doesn't get a lot in the way of his character. i have absolutely no idea why rosario dawson a) did this movie and b) had a character at all. her character is absolutely useless and had no point to the plot or story making any performance she would give equally as bad. i have rarely seen a character who is supporting so incredibly useless. the only redeeming character and performance in this film is that given by joseph gordon-levitt as the deranged mini killer who wants to team up with rourke's hit-man. gordon-levitt is over the top crazy and entertaining and his character is actually engaging. if this film had been entirely about him it would have been a smash. he literally saves this from utter crap. his performance is almost worth watching this drivel for.<br /><br />oscar nominated director...whoa wait? yes oscar nominated director john madden (i think the football coach could have done a better job) helms this mess. i have actually never seen shakespeare in love, but i remember the critical acclaim it received and it surprised me because the direction in this film and with the characters was downright awful. screenplay writer hossein amini has done nothing i recognize but apparently has been slated to write the next jack ryan movie and after this mess i can't even imagine why they'd want him. i understand this is based on a novel and i really hope the novel is worlds above this mess. a little bit of action and some sort of hokey attempt at an emotionally charged story of a hit-man and his partner and the mess they get involved in. unfortunately unless you're a huge rourke fan or really love joseph gordon-levitt then there is no reason to put yourself through this pain. i did it for you and i still feel the pain. 4/10
