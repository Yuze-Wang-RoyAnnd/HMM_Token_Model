i's a big struggle. as a story that is surreal, this movie could've been great (as great as it is rated by some here), but mixed with the acting (director and relatives playing major roles, due to financial reasons i reckon) found in here ... although calling this acting, is not only a stretch of that word, it's giving it a new meaning! a whole new meaning! <br /><br />if you are into surreal movies (there are some that i do like actually, see the japanese strange circus for example), you might be able to overlook the flaws (see above) and enjoy this more. there are great ideas here, after all! many great metaphors and ambiguous scenes, but while watching this (with a group of friends) almost all of us, just couldn't stop laughing ... not the intention of the director of course! again, everyone has their own liking, as one can see by the high rating of this movie, but i could only recommend the movie if you're aware of the work that alejandro jodorowsky has done and/or are a fan of his!
