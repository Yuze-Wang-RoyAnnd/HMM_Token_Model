this isn't a very good movie, but it is easily the best troma studios film i have ever viewed. lloyd kaufman - the "brains" behind troma - isn't concerned with a good plot or even making a moderately entertaining film. his chief concern is making something bizarre. and his definition of bizarre oftentimes mirrors my definition of terrible cinema.<br /><br />in this film we have the titled character luther - whose favorite pastime isn't baseball, but biting the heads off of chickens - receiving his release from lockup. the board has deemed him rehabilitated despite the fact that he doesn't speak - he merely clucks like a chicken - and has a set of razorblade dentures at his disposal. of course, once luther is set free, he goes about causing mayhem, first at a grocery store and later at a farm house.<br /><br />violence: $$$$$ (lots of violence in this oftentimes tasteless flick. luther sinks his razorblade chompers into a poor elderly lady waiting at a bus stop and then spends the rest of the film terrorizing the mother and daughter at the farmhouse).<br /><br />nudity: $$$$$ (stacy haiduk delivers some noteworthy skin in his picture, as the former lois lane (i can't recall which superman edition she was from) gives us a shower scene followed by a romp in bed with her boyfriend - a guy who just doesn't have any chemistry with ms. haiduk. the extended shower scene footage in the dvd extras gives the viewer quite a bit more of stacy. she is quite something).<br /><br />story: $ (forgettaboutit!!!! whitey styles' screenplay may just be the worst ever written. the way in which luther is released from the asylum completely throws all credibility out the window. his dialogue is something that a pre-schooler might write and the actions he writes for his characters border on the absurd. it's as if styles spent ten years without human contact and completely forgot how people react in certain situations).<br /><br />acting: $$ (the film belongs to edward terry who actually does a decent job as the geek. he is quite menacing in a stupid barnyard fashion. joan roth as the mother does a super job in support but haiduk and her boyfriend's lack of chemistry made their roles awkward at best).
