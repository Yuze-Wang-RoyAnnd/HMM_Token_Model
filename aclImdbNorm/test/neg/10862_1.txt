this film oh my god this film is so poor , i'm amazed i managed to watch it all ..<br /><br />first off id like to say that vinny jones should only play a london thug period that's it end of story ..<br /><br />pisttolero is so unconvincing its almost comedy.. banging in dennis hopper and david carradine did not save this film .. in fact i think its a total comedy and as a comedy it deserves its 1 star..<br /><br />avoid at all costs .. vinny oh my god i thought i saw it all when he played that irish tinker :p<br /><br />i think the average viewer will realize that this film is maybe just a never will be type of film.. i cant see how anybody could actually fall this crap
