"terror in the aisles" might look like the ultimate treat for horror fans but it has, in fact, very few to offer. granted, it presents a decent and versatile (too versatile?) selection of horror/thriller fragments that are considered classic but ...what's the point? this documentary primarily aims for the horror-loving public so we've pretty much seen all these clips already, haven't we? the only thing really praiseworthy about this project is the editing. if you're into scream-queens, chases by vile murderers and that sort of things, "terror in the aisles" has some neat compilations of the most famous sequences. all these different scenes hang together by a lame wraparound story starring donald pleasance and nancy allen sitting in a movie theater. in between two sequences, the address the viewer and "explain" why we love horror so much. those speeches naturally are soporific and rather obvious (it's in our nature to be afraid ...bla bla bla) and i fail to understand why many people love the concept. this is worth a peek in case you're a loyal horror fan but it certainly isn't essential viewing. on the contrary: in case you still have to see a classic genre title, beware that bits and pieces of it here don't spoil your future viewing. the main reason why i overall disliked it is because it shamelessly ignores a lot of lesser known, but fundamental (foreign) titles endlessly focusing on "halloween". this does result in a cool inside joke, however, when donald pleasance screams to the screen at his own character.
