um... okay, this is very poor indeed if compared to the first film, the very-much-so critically acclaimed rosemary's baby. in fact, it's a pretty poor film in general. yes, there are a few redeeming qualities, but i'll get to that later.<br /><br />well, it has been quite a while since the last film took place... in fact, it's been pretty much eight years i believe. rosemary is still trying to escape with her child and influence him in a good way, rather than let him succumb to the evil future that the coven (or "tribe", as it is referred to as here) has laid out for him. when she runs off with him and an empty bus comes and picks her up, leaving her child with a hooker, the hooker raises him until he comes of age, where satan tries to possess him since he seems to be rejecting his evil heritage in every way.<br /><br />obviously, things don't go as planned, and then there is the ending that i would have felt seriously ashamed at had i not seen it coming since hearing that there was a sequel to "rosemary's baby"! okay, when i was around 11 years old, i witnessed the masterpiece rosemary's baby and then read the book sequel. thinking that this film was an adaptation of that, i tracked this film down and got it... was i right in doing so? well, in some way, yes... i am a true fan of this "franchise" and can say that i have seen the sequel, and i have some idea as to what happens after the events in the first film (speaking of both this film and "son of rosemary", ira levin's own book sequel, not yet adapted to film).<br /><br />ruth gordon, who played minnie in the first film, is shown a few times in this film, but why-oh-why is the coven so different? the knife rosemary had dropped in the first film is shown sticking out of the ground, yet minnie pulled it out! the coven is now called the tribe (as i said earlier). they now go around in hooded capes chanting "hail satan... hail adrian... hail satan... hail adrian..." and so on and so forth. the gothic building is now like a two-story house on a lawn in the middle of nowhere, it looks like a little nice suburb home or something! and the child itself is pretty normal-looking, with his eyes only going all "catty" when he gets mad and kills someone or something in that vain.<br /><br />as far as the acting goes, it's pretty poor on all parts, except for stephen mchattie, whom plays a very-grown up adrian. pattie duke astin, replacing mia farrow as rosemary, has to have one of the flat-out worst performances ever to be caught on film! it is so bad it's almost not even funny... when she screams "oh my god!" and cries for like the fifteenth time in the movie, you're just like "okay, it's not funny anymore," and then by the time she is gone and the movie has been on for twenty minutes only, you're like thank the lord i don't have to hear her say "oh my god" any longer!! sheesh! in the end, this movie has very, very, *very* few redeeming qualities, enough to get it at least four stars. but, if you look at it as a serious sequel to the first film, it's pretty much non-existent.
