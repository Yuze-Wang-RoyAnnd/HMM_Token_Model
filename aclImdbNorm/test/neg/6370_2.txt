i was in 6th grade and this movie aired on pbs during a series called 'wonderworks.' i distinctly remember sitting on a couch watching the movie with tears running down my face at the end. in the film jesse, the main character, forms an unusual friendship with a girl named leslie. due to a very simple, but careless mistake one of the pair dies. at the time, i found the story very powerful, because the fatal mistake is exactly the type of mistake a kid would make and so any kid watching the film will find it very easy to identify with and feel the emotional weight of the tragedy that ensues.<br /><br />last year, i finally tracked down a vhs copy of the show. i probably should have stuck with my memories. watching the show as an adult i was absolutely shocked by what a horribly made film this was. my girlfriend had a similar memory of the movie as well, and she too was pretty sad about how bad the movie was compared to her memories. <br /><br />many adults probably have a good memory of watching this movie when they were kids. i strongly advise that these people leave their memories intact, and avoid seeing this film as an adult.
