the only reason i rented the movie was to see jeri ryan in it! omg that was the most boring, pointless movie i've ever seen!!! how lame!!! i mean really, give me a break! after voyager, i'd hope she'd be offered better roles!!<br /><br />if i were one of the last people on earth, i would not still be living in a travel trailer in the dessert!! this is just such a bad movie!! the thing about the indian tribe and how he compared it every 10 seconds really, really got old. poor jeri, better luck next time!
