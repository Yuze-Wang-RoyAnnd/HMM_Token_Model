julien hernandez is certainly an attractive and likable on screen persona. in fact, his character pretty much carries this whole film, or what's worthwhile about it. the problem is, with the exception of his gal pal (played by marisa petroro) and paul lekakis (as a trick/date/ boyfriend for some of the characters) no one else even comes close. hernandez plays a 30- something director of cuban heritage, and unknown sexuality, who comes to l.a. and gets a job making a gay documentary. in the process of meeting a group of gay people while finding subjects, he comes out...but very s l o w l y. even at 88 minutes, the film has obviously been stretched out and padded with various film-school devices, most of which only end up pointlessly interrupting the narrative (which ain't much to begin with) or pointing out the overall amateurish-ness of the film-making. <br /><br />which is a shame, because there's a love story in here somewhere, and the final three minutes, when hernandez's sebastien finally clicks with a wealthy west hollywood party- thrower (nicely underplayed by lonnie henderson) and they share some sexy soulful kisses, it works despite all that came before. but we don't really care about any of the other characters or their situations: why would handsome dante have a eurotrash priss for a boyfriend? he wouldn't. and don't even get me started on sebastien's friend paulie's "rules" for dating -- no gay man i know, hell no sane person, period, would put such constrictions on himself or others. and please tell me how sebastien gets a peeled banana (which is normally fairly shmushy, right?) stuck up his butt and has to go to a doctor to get it removed? <br /><br />i noticed hernandez won an award for this film as a "short" -- it probably should have stayed that way. all this said -- i'd look forward to seeing hernandez on screen again, in a better scripted comedy with more assured direction.
