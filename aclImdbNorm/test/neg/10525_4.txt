what i wouldn't do to give this film a re-write. extra disappointing due to the great beginning, solo dios sabe degenerates into a mess of superstitious bull after the halfway point and ends on a note so ludicrous, soppy and melodramatic i couldn't believe i was watching the same movie i started with. the film had numerous elements in its favor, such as chemistry between diego luna and alice braga so palpable i thought the screen would start sparking, a great soundtrack, and beautiful locations. instead of ending with the heavy-handed religious mumbo jumbo, the film should have kept the focus on being a frothy road movie with maybe some undertones about fate and superstition vs. logic peppered through. i understand the director's entire intent with the film was to make it about religion, but the fact is that it just didn't work, and he threw away so much great stuff from the beginning by doing so.
