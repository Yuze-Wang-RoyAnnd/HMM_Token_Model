anyone remember the docudrama threads ? it's a drama documentary which shocked britain in september 1984 . whilst not exactly wholly entertained by mick jackson's nuclear holocaust horror film i could respect it . unfortunately i can't respect this docudrama broadcast 20 years later which deals with terrorists letting off a radioactive dirty bomb in the centre of london <br /><br />the problem i have with it is that director daniel percival production values are far too good when in fact this would have benefited from rather cheap production values . the cinematography is superb but in this type of speculative drama do we need superb and well lit oscar standard cinematography ? what we certainly don't need is a musical score as the survivors of the blast slowly stagger out of the smoke . neither do we need vaguely well known cast members . did anyone else sit there asking themselves " hey what was he in ? i know that face " several times ? i know i did and it's very distracting . <br /><br />perhaps the biggest production flaw with dirty war is that someone decided to make it a docudrama with too much stylistic emphasis on the drama . in threads the action cuts away from the action in sheffield umpteen times and becomes an edition of horizon on the effects of nuclear war before cutting back to the fictional protagonists again and threads is very effective because of this . here the information presented suffocates the drama which drowns in expositional and totally unconvincing dialogue . the characters in the teleplay aren't really characters they're just cyphers there to inform the audience what happens when radioactive material is exploded . it would have been better for the action to cut to captions to convey this type of information ala threads . the worse thing is that director daniel percival used the same technique as seen in threads a couple of years ago with his docudrama about smallpox . he should have used the same style with dirty war<br /><br />i should also lay my cards on the table and state that while i don't consider most muslims are terrorists i am getting slightly fed up of tv productions like the hamburg cell , the grid and dirty war having to point out this fact to me by whalloping me over the head with it which is somewhat typical of patronising pc attitudes in tv companies nowadays<br /><br />i managed to miss the studio debate that bob mentions here but i have also heard it discussed elsewhere and i can't help thinking it makes better viewing than dirty war itself with its heated arguments between differing factions of the political spectrum . if dirty war is remembered twenty years from now ( highly unlikely i know ) it may well be remembered for the discussion it caused more than anything
