a teen-age boy, who is not in the military and has not trained to be a jet pilot, takes off for a foreign country to rescue his dad. if this is not ridiculous enough, he talks a colonel in the air force into helping him get his hands on a jet [wow!]. to make the picture even more absurd, the colonel risks his career and life by giving the spunky lad some hands on aid. they not only don't make colonels like this anymore, but they never did. this sappy, corny film should be tossed into the air and blown away by a mig.
