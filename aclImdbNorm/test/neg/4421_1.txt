this film is a hodge-podge of various idiotic cliches. for instance, boy-meets-spoilt-rich-girl and gets her to fall in love with him by harassing her in college (an over-used backdrop in recent indian commercial films). a male chauvinistic glorification of sexual conquest. the climax is predictable (having been used ad nauseum in several other films). as with many other recent commercial hindi films, the film abounds with the incongruous insertion of songs, which probably contributed to the film's success more than anything else.
