this very finely crafted film commits the unforgivable (which is ironic, given the film's theme). no one coming into this film knows what they are in for. worse than that, 3/4 of the way into the film, no one still has any clue of what they're in for because everything up to that "moment" is a different movie.<br /><br />as a front-row fan of dutcher's first two films, easily competing for the best 2 mormon films to date (competing with saints and soldiers and, now, new york doll--saw that at a screening), dutcher had me wanting to see his film for a very long time. i was there. i wanted to believe, believe that i'd see the next great mormon movie, one that would hold the numero uno spot for a very long time. but no. three-fourths in the film took the sharpest of left turns and dragged me through something that i never wanted to go through. he takes on the mt. everest of all moral issues, yea, both of them, with little time or emotional capacity left to adequately address them, but instead waves them both off with a nod towards jesus as if that will make all things well, instantly. (true it is that jesus saves. don't accuse me of not believing that. that's not dutcher's problem.)<br /><br />is the film shot well? indeed. do the actors act? they acted their pants off. was the music appropriate? all but whatever was over the closing credits. everything about this film was superb, except the story, which was so dank and wrong, that all else doesn't matter. (i learned "dank" from new york doll, very decent show, by the way.) the third act of the film was neither desirable nor pleasant nor faith affirming. i know dutcher was bending over backwards to make it so, but i was so far shoved out of the movie at that point that nothing, no thing, could have brought me back. the preposterous unbelievability of dozens of details in the final minutes didn't help. anyone who's been on a mission knows what i'm talking about, especially anyone who
