when you see barry corbin in the cast of a movie, you can never be sure if it will be a classic or trash. guess which category solo falls into. apparently derived from a popular sci-fi novel, weapon, solo stars mario van peebles as a human-looking robot who decides to think for himself and is thus targeted for elimination. he hides out in a mexican village, obviously to save money on locations and extras. paying in pesos is cheaper than paying in dollars, i suspect. william sadler is along for the ride, as one of the robots and soldiers sent to destroy van peebles. van peebles manages to beat them all with ease, of course, while corbin watches all this with bemusement from afar. the movie is a horrible ripoff of the the terminator and cyborg series, and apparently has little to do with its source material. it is horribly written and acted, and the big fight at the end if downright comical. van peebles, a decent actor elsewhere, is a scream as he pretends to be a robot covered in synthetic flesh. he looks like he is doing the robot dance most of the time.
