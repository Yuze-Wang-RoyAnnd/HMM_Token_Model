this proves just how awful the wb network was in the last few years of its existence. as a homeschooler, i of course deplore this show for its ridiculous, fantasy land, obscure & unfunny stereotypes about the kids being "weird hippies who are so smart they're alienated from the super-cool high school students". sorry tv writers, the world as viewed from inside your ass (containing your heads apparently when you wrote this show)is not the world we talented people see with our eyes as we live in a little thing called reality. as for those who actually liked this show...please, dear sweet jesus please rethink the statement that you actually liked this crap over a very long walk. the acting is even more hollow, phony and wooden than the stereotypes the whole show was built around. thank you wb for doing the right thing and putting this horse out of its beginning-to-end misery. this show never, ever should've even had the privilege of being made, no less having so much as eight awful episodes. i really hope that these actors eventually got a clue and stopped playing roles in garbage tv shows like this as soon as this show ended.
