why did they not follow the book ... i am really sad and disappointed. i was so looking forward to seeing this movie, however, if you have read the book (maybe recently) it might be very difficult to remain objective. my wife had not read the book, and she loved the movie.<br /><br />reasons for the disappointment are: 1) cern's involvement ... gone with the wind, such a shame, there is a very small part at the start, where the antimatter is created, but even that does not stick to the facts (why not, the fact that vittoria's father was burned with the first illuminati brand, which is how langdon got involved would have been a perfect start to the movie_ 2) story-line between the (deceased) pope and camerlegno completely gone ... this completely screws up the motive for the stealing of the antimatter 3) story-line between langdon and vittoria vetra completely non-existent<br /><br />all-in-all, too flaky storyline, and cannot understand that dan brown allowed them to put his name against it. maybe i should revisit this film in 10 years time, when i cannot remember the excellent book anymore (fat chance on forgetting the book i am afraid)<br /><br />really sorry for the negative review, which was spoilt by expectations
