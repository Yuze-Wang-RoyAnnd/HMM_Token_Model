love sublime says the title. another blurb during the promotions of the film talked about inner vs external beauty. well in this case the beauty - you decide inner or external - is provided by scantily clad (or is that scantily dressed/ undressed) zeenat aman who the director raj kapoor called "a volcano of talent" while the film was being made. one can't accuse him of sarcasm of course - after all he was promoting his own film.<br /><br />the paper thin plot is about a woman with a disfigured face who has a - er - well proportioned body , a great voice (thanks to lata mangeshkar) with whom the hero shashi kapoor falls in love. he doesn't want her face only her voice. the acting is desperate and even the 4 is because of the music with lata mangeshkar giving some good numbers. the rest is of course bunkum. avoid - save your money. inner beauty vs outer beauty. !!! you need not be an einstein to figure out which one the director was concentrating on
