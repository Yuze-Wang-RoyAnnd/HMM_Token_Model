well, this movie wasn't as horrible as i thought it would be. i was expecting to give it one star. i chose to give it three. why? well, for a cheesy horror/sci-fi movie, it's not all that bad. sure the characters are tacky (as is their acting - including a young leonardo dicaprio), the effects cheap looking, and the monsters...well let's just say that i've seen some more effective halloween costumes in elementary schools... but there was something about this movie that made me watch it till the end. a little bit of humor helped out a bit i guess. and if you ever wanted to see an alien pass gas, this movie will let you live your dream. 3/10
