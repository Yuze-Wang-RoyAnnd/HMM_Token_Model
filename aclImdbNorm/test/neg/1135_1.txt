this movie was awful. it centered too much around eddie, clark griswald's brother-in-law. eddie works much better when changing good quips such as in "christmas vacation" and "vacation".<br /><br />i really don't understand how a movie like this would be given the thumbs up. now, don't get me wrong, i like randy quaid, but just felt this movie was totally wrong for him and for the character in general. this movie leaves much to be desired and really needed some bigger name actors.
