that was one of the worst movies i've ever seen. why would someone make a movie about getting away with murder!?! mr. allen again plays the only type of character that he's able, the sexually stunted man who can't get the girl. get a clue, allen, there's a reason that's the only character that you can successfully portray. stir clear of this movie! it's a waste of time, unless you want to know how to successfully murder someone. i feel sorry for the actors who say 'yes' to woody allen. look at his cast, and tell me how many of those people are still working. my respect for all of the actors, who work for him, immediately goes down, because they chose to participate in the film.
