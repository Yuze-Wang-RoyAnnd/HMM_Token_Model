i lasted almost ninety minutes through this dreadful movie waiting for some revelation about dance or spirit or inspiration or something and gave up! what possessed the filmmakers to do this? this is an old woman of limited talent who is obsessed with herself and nothing else. to fill in a story without a point we get some stuff about the other folks in her thrall, her aid to burros, and, of course, her ten cats! do not see this film. and have nothing more to do with anybody who loved it - they do not have a clue. there are fascinating people in this world with wonderful stories to tell and insights to share - but marta becket is not one of them. the people i took to this movie say they have forgiven me - but that they will never, ever stop kidding me about it.
