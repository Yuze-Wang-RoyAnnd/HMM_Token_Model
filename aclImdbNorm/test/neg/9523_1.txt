unlike one of the reviewers below, i don't think that a great and glittering career should lie ahead for the director of this inept and tedious piece of navel-gazing. whereas it is good to see a british director attempting to break out of the confines of convention, aka's only claim for innovative fame rests on the novelty of the triple screen. at first you think that this might prove to be an interesting device, but its only real contribution to the film is to test your eyesight and patience. seeing the same character from 3 different angles in a 2-dimensional movie does not make it more revealing or complex. if you can forget the triple screen (which, granted, is very hard to do), you then have to deal with the unintentionally hilarious script. the audience is beaten into submission by chiche upon chiche about the british class system. the film has the political and emotional sophistication of an episode of upstairs and downstairs. to sum up: the emperor's new clothes. and a rather poor outfit, too.
