i guess the previous "house" movie was a hit, prompting universal to wring a few more drops from the monster cash-cow. the creative team must've been in a recycling mood, starting with the opening theme lifted from 'son of frankenstein' and some of the stock footage dispersed through the film, like one unintentionally funny bit of business where footage of glenn strange as the monster is mixed with clips of karloff from 1935's bride, and compared to how robotic strange moved, karloff seems to move like a cheetah in comparison.<br /><br />previous film continuity is thrown by the wayside, concerning the miraculous death-cheating abilities of the wolf man and dracula, but when dr. edelmann & larry talbot discover frankenstein's monster with the skeleton representing boris karloff , edward t. lowe does at least acknowledge some of the past movie history, though talbot curiously never mentions having met karloff's dr. niemann. <br /><br />since this was to be the last of universal's horror cycle, the supernatural elements of the wolf man and drac get(unconvincingly) morphed into medical ailments. drac is told he suffers from a blood disease, a very rare sickness that allows him to transform into a bat or evaporate if sunlight touches him. >:-] and larry talbot just has a little pressure on the brain. of course all of this is painstakingly explained with a 'lot' of medical jargon being related in many scenes throughout. this proves to be the biggest hindrance, as somewhere along the way the filmmakers seem to forget about actual horror or entertainment in favor of giving the monsters conditions that seem as treatable as a flu. <br /><br />as a huge fan of the old universal horrors, it's rare that i feel so bored while watching one. the whole thing just feels like a movie that was made just because it could be, but if this mess hadn't been slapped together, the monsters might never have met abbott and costello, so i guess some good came of this.
