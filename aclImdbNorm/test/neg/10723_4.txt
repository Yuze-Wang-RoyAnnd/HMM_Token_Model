i thought the movie was sub-par. the acting was good but not great, the story was funny but did not come out that way. the director dropped the ball on this movie. it was not james (jim) or tea. imho it was the music that killed it. there is a scene where things go down hill and jonny cash music is playing - man was that depressing (not funny) killed my mood. after that the movie could not recover. the deportation scene had potential funny situation, good acting good set up - i even smirked but the music again was unsuited to the scene. the music kept me from being pulled in to the movie.<br /><br />i say it had potential but was poorly done, i would even say rushed into final production. kind of reminiscent of the prequel to the exorcist: the beginning. the theater release was good, i though so after watching it, but the movie release exorcist:dominion was a helluva lot better. same story just different director. same should be done here.
