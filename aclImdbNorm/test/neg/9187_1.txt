jeff fahey has such alert eyes and a smudgy, insidious smile that every character he plays seems villainous; therefore, it doesn't really work to cast him as the good guy of the piece, the audience is just waiting for his character to crack and start blowing people away. drew barrymore, fresh off her acclaimed role as "poison ivy", must have done this film simply as a favor to director phedon papamichael (he was the cinematographer on "ivy"); playing a character named daisy drew (!), she's bumped off right away, which leaves us with no one to look at but jeff fahey and sean young (who hasn't had a single subtle moment on camera since "blade runner"). this witless script, by michael angeli, concerns a police sketch artist who draws his own wife's face from a murder witness's testimony, and while that's not a bad idea for a plot, it would be much better suited to an hour-long tv series. this cable-made movie is short on inspiration (beginning with the casting) and shorter on surprises. * from ****
