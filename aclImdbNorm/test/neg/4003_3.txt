predictable unmotivated pointless caricatures contrived actors did what they could actors clearly indicated they were embarrassed to do this not one emotional connection real sequence from film "who you callin?" (sic) "the police"(sic) "you can't do that, stevie. hang up the phone"(sic) "jesse got a sh-t load o' drug money, you can't go involving the cops"(sic) "i'm not so sure stealing money from criminals is a crime. even if they arrest him at least he'll be alive"(sic) "listen to me, stevie, this ain't handled right, jesse's gonna end up dead. now hang up that f-in phone." (sic) best friend starts to load up guns brother, "hey, what're you doin'?" no answer. "hey, i got a family to worry about." (keep in mind his child is sitting right there watching-ish all of this) then more and more and more exposition<br /><br />notice how in the above sequence, at no time do the police on the other line say, "hello? hello? uh, we can hear everything you're saying. we're sending someone over there right now." <br /><br />embarrassment for all. oops.
