i don't know where most of you were at, but where i watched the film we didn't have people singing as some have told they experienced, we had people laughing, mostly at the campy plot line, the horrible dance sequences and the singing of the likes of brosnan. the only people in the audience who seemed to be enthralled with the film were the seventies generation folks who were some how reliving the past with the songs. i was a dj in the seventies and even went to the abba concert at northlands coliseum in edmonton in sept of 79, so i did appreciate them then and i still do now. but this film should have gone the same way as their marriages and ended in divorce. the sequences were so poorly staged, the dubbing and editing absolutely horrible and this has to be meryl's worst production. i cannot believe an academy award winner would stoop so low as to do this piece of garbage. so save your money, wait for it to come out on dvd and then maybe spend your money on something better, like cat litter.
