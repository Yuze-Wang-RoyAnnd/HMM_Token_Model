jon stewart (aka john liebowitz) constantly rips conservatism and anything republican. this liberal comic is anything but, as he pours his cutting "humor" down the throats of impressionable youths. i've viewed the show while stuck in a waiting room while my car was repaired and this guy borders on treason. he'll take al queda's side over bush any day. he's shameless and everything he says is punctuated by a phony laughtrack. i do remember four years ago when he "interviewed" john kerry. the two made faces at each other that seemed to preclude a makeout session. it was like, "get a room, you guys". i just don't like smirky little traitors who peddle their propaganda. call me shallow. the daily show has had a long run and there are many likeminded liberals who have a seething hatred for republicans and conservatism. i'm not surprised at its success, but do that many people actually watch comedy central? that mancia guy makes me barf.
