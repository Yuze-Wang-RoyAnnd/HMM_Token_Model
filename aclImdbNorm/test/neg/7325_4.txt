i tried to love this movie. i really did. kevin bacon plays a cerebral palsy victim who is befriended by a 10-year-old girl whose fantasies of digging to china, flying away in a balloon, and so on, are her way of coping with a dreary existence. i admit i did fast-forward through one of the scenes in which the two of them share friendship and simple pleasures while soulful piano music plays in the background. okay, three or four of those type scenes. maybe nine or ten. okay, okay, it was fourteen. but i did sit and watch most of them.
