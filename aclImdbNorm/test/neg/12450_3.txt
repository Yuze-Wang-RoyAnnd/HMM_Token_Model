slow-moving ponderous movie with terrible acting on the whole - but lovely locations & clothes to admire, and, of course, timothy dalton, who does a compelling job, as always. i wanted to laugh out loud at the voice-overs - so silly!! but dalton is always worth watching, even in bad movies, a wonderful actor, older now, but still very handsome and masculine. this movie is worth viewing only to see him....and he seems like he wandered into a bad dime romance novel, poor fellow. your time would be better spent watching mr. dalton in 1970's "wuthering heights" or the early 1980's bbc version of "jane eyre". poor sela ward, so lovely, but so wooden.... surely she's been better in other movies.
