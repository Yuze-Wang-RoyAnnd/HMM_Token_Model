you know, i really hate imdb's censor system, since my entire review is almost gone if you take out the cursing. but here we go. editing time!<br /><br />holy moley is this bad. i thought it might be a cool little movie, judging by the plot summary, since yknow i've blindly rented such gems as frailty and american nightmare before. but this is just abominal. it's about a killer who uses edgar allen poe's works as reference for his murderous exploits, and the story of a detective who has to stop him. can't these blithering hacks make a good movie without defiling the grave of a great horror writer? i mean, the kills in here are completely devoid of thought or originality, and the references to poe are hokey and fake, without enough thought put into them. they're shallow, and they put poe's work to shame. full of holes, with awful sequencing. the acting is bad too, reminding me of the abortion that was known in some third world countries as "fear x", what with all the pausing and un-emotional lines.<br /><br />i realize this is an indie movie, but that's no excuse. i've seen high school kids act better then these morons, and i myself could've come up with better kill scenes and a better plot, given ample time.<br /><br />this has no reason to exist. avoid at all costs.
