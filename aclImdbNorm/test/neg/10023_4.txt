everything everyone has said already pretty much rings true when it comes to 'the prey'. endless nature footage, bad acting - aside from these elements, this is a watchable film for slasher fans that in some cases, is considered a cult classic.<br /><br />jackson bostwick and jackie coogan play pretty well off each other. there's also a three minute banjo solo that shows off bostwick's skill behind the instrument. not too bad if i do say so myself.<br /><br />the last ten minutes of the 'film' are its saving grace. the ending still haunts me to this day. this can also sport a short lived plus in that an early john carl bucheler does the special effects. some may know him from films like 'troll' and 'friday the 13th part 7 - he directed both these films) all in all, this isn't a movie everyone will find something redeeming in. in fact, on a hollywood level, this can rank right up there with one of the businesses most amateurish efforts, but for that handful (yet very loyal) of slasher movie fans in the world, even the bad acting and atrocious nature footage can be forgiven.
