when i first heard about this movie, i eagerly went out to rent it, believing (mistakenly) that it was one of those so-bad-it's-fun movies and that i was in for a treat. i was wrong.<br /><br />for starters, the pace is agonizingly, mind-numbingly slow. the pace doesn't even begin to pick up until the last 15-20 minutes of the movie! the plot was boring, and the ending was nonsensical and confusing. for those looking for a cheesy horror movie with cheap thrills, look elsewhere. this movie provides the cheesiness in spades, but is sorely lacking in "thrills," cheap or otherwise.<br /><br />try "child's play," instead.
