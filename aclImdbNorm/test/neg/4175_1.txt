this movie was really funny even though it wasn't meant to be! the acting was stupid and so were the voices. pretty much all it was was some guy walking around a corn maze for an hour and a half. they threw in this stupid super natural thing that made it even dumber. it wasn't even like a normal movie, this weird creepy music was playing almost the whole way through the movie. what is it with corn maze horror films? children of the corn was really scary i thought and i thought this would be something like it, but really it was just stupid. the main character guy just walked around aimlessly yelling for these two little girls. and then at the end he like kills someone or something. it's worth seeing if you're with your friends because it's really funny how bad it is, but if you're looking for a horror movie then don't waste your time
