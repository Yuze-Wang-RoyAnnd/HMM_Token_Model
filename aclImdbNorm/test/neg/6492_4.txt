robert lansing plays a scientist experimenting with passing objects through solid matter, but he goes too far one night and unintentionally makes himself four-dimensional! atomic-age fantasy is rather charming in a very cheesy way. perhaps it was considered a thoughtful sci-fi in its time (with psychological overtones), yet seen today the film is mildly overbaked and naive; it's a camp-fest tailor-made for tv's late-late show. wooden performances by lansing and lee meriwether barely rate as one-dimensional, though patty duke (playing a cute brat pre-"miracle worker") gets a colorful, memorable exit. <br /><br />** from ****
