firstly, this is not an adaptation of a stephen king book, short story, novella, or anything else. from ew's web site, and their review on the show when it first aired, "...he never writes down to his audience, and he never betrays contempt for his subjects. his first original work for television, stephen king's ''golden years'' (cbs, july 16, 9-11 p.m.), is no exception."<br /><br />the series was apparently going to be (as others have mentioned) an ongoing series, which is why we never saw the ending after the cliffhanger they left us on. but this was never quite made clear to the viewers who were left wondering how it all ends??<br /><br />when the series came out on videotape, it touted itself as having the "never-before-seen ending!" it should have said, "the should-never-be-seen ending!" <br /><br />*** spoiler ***<br /><br />the very ending was the only significant part changed for the video (though parts of the whole were left out), and that changed ending was what destroyed the story. for example, rather than our two intrepid fbi agents realizing that they were now labeled as bad guys and on the run from the evil jude anderson of the shop (as originally broadcast), jude simply walks up to them... and they shoot him. bang, dead, and no real emotion to speak of in the scene. ditto on the bit with harlan and his wife going poof. whereas the original ending left us with a spectacular cliff-hanger, on the video, they simply get out of the cock-a-doodie car.<br /><br />*** end spoiler ***<br /><br />it was a sad ending to a rather well made mini-series, and makes the video completely not worth buying, or even renting. sincerely, save your money and your time.
