how can you go wrong with a film that mixes the sophistication of peter cushing, the determination of donald pleasence and the bust of luan peters? easy, you give them a terrible script to work with.<br /><br />peter cushing, in an evil role, leads a satanic cult that has captured a couple friends of donald pleasence. donald plays a determined but aloof priest that desires to locate his friends but needs the help of fred from scooby-doo to locate them. he summons the help of a new york bloodhound, who dresses just like the hero of the cartoon, in his task. meanwhile, the girlfriend of one of the missing people, luan peters, joins the search. if all this sounds interesting, then you, like myself, were mislead.<br /><br />it doesn't take long for the trio to sniff out the baddies but their methods of bringing the bad guys to justice are foolish. also, women will find this a crapfest. every time they get on the bad guys trail, our two male heroes tell luan to stay at the hotel even though she can handle herself better than the squeamish priest played by pleasence.<br /><br />story: $ (the script really lets us down. no tension is built. no worthwhile dialogue is given the stars and you'll need both hands to count the number of times luan peters is told to stay behind and let men do men work. if you're interested in seeing a minotaur on film don't bother. we get a statue of a minotaur that spits flames).<br /><br />violence: $$ (there are some attacks and a few sacrifices, but those of you who drool for gore will be letdown).<br /><br />acting: $$ (even though there are three of my favorite actors in this film, there is nothing redeemable here. peter cushing doesn't have much screen time, donald pleasence is clearly aware that he is on the set of a stinker and luan peters is ill-used. this should have been much better given the talent involved, but then again, the yankees lose a game here and there too).<br /><br />nudity: $ (luan peters takes a bath but you see next to nothing. she isn't as obliging here as she was in the flesh and blood show).
