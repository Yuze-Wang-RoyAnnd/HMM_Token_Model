two movies: "the fifth element", "armageddon". the same subject: to save the world. the same main actor: bruce willis. one difference: "armageddon" is very inferior to luc besson's film. some spectacular special effects don't succeed in hiding a labored and globally conventional screenplay. several parts of the movie are showing it. i think about the president's speech and especially willis' relationship with his daughter, "grace". at the beginning of the movie, he tends to neglect and overprotect her and this makes her weary. then, at the end of the movie, it's true love and understanding that shine in him. on another hand, the movie falls in the following trap: michael bay takes his subject too seriously. of course, the movie tries to be funny but the result doesn't work as the humor introduced in the movie is often crude and pretty low-level whereas in the "fifth element", the humor was zany, involuntary and enabled to overlook the serious side of the action. the movie suffers from two other handicaps: it often falls into the ridiculous (the russian astronaut) and almost all the actors are bad used. bruce willis is all the contrary of his "fifth element"'s character. he plays the he-man, he hams it up and sometimes, he's unbearable. the other actors are barely credible in their own roles, particularly, willis' sinking crew. it seems that this crew is here just for having fun. one of them is taken for being very qualified but he looks like a fool. and poor liv tyler! she's at the nasa just to be decorative.<br /><br />when the movie was released in france in august 1998, bruce willis expressed is weariness of saving the world. his weariness was probably justified by this spectacular but poor movie.
