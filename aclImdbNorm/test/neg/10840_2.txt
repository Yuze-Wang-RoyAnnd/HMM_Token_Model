there were some decent moments in this film, and a couple of times where it was pretty funny. however, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie. there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film, and i couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by. there was better chemistry between him and liv tyler in armageddon. hell, there was better chemistry between sly and sandra in demolition man.<br /><br />there were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.<br /><br />this was a poor remake of "my best friends wedding". wait until it's been out for a year and a half on video and rent it in the .49 cent bin if you've got nothing else to do on a rainy sunday afternoon, and you can't think of any better movies to rent.
