on this site i've often lambasted the americans for not knowing how to write comedy, but, while they've never produced anything of the quality of 'fawlty towers', 'blackadder' or 'the fall and rise of reginald perrin', they have also never (to my knowledge) made anything as bad as this: the nadir of british comedy.<br /><br />on my richter scale of comic awfulness, it rates only behind the truly execrable 'are you being served' as the worst comedy show in the english language, with bad acting, annoying characters and humour that i'd grown out of before i left primary school. unfortunately, it was part of a large crop of shows back then, along with 'dad's army', 'it ain't half hot mum' and 'allo, allo' that relied on ridiculous situations and familiar catch-phrases to keep audiences "amused".<br /><br />michael crawford proved later on that he's a talented performer, but personally, i'd rather be sentenced to a month of watching 'rhoda' than endure a single episode of this drivel, which makes me ashamed to be british.
