i love most jet li movies (with the exception of romeo must die) and i bought this movie in a very cheap three-pack with "the master" and "twin warriors". while twin warriors was very impressive and i was thoroughly intrigued by it, and the master was a bit "karate kid" but also enjoyable, i thought this movie was terrible. i'm not just saying that because i'm used to better movies. i'm saying that it was almost down there with "kazaam". the fight scenes were terrible (blurry cameras and no real fighting) and the plot was your typical "stupid kung-fu plot". if you are going to have a plot this stupid (see 'man turns into woman to become all-powerful then falls in love with jet li') you best have some great fighting to go with it. if you are looking for an original hk jet li movie, i suggest you go rent "shaolin temple 2" (aka kids from shaolin).
