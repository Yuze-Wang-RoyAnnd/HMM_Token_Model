i really wanted to like this film as i have admiration for italian rip-off cinema (especially jaws rip-offs!), but the simple fact of the matter is that monster shark isn't very good. all the signs of this being a great piece of trash are there; we've got one of the kings of trashy cult cinema, lamberto bava, in the director's chair - one of the best ridiculous cult actors, michael sopkiw, taking the lead role, and a central creature stupid enough to give even the best that this sort of film has to offer a run for it's money, yet somehow the film still manages to be rather stale. the fact that the 'monster shark' doesn't feature too often is probably a good thing given the creature design, but there's never enough elsewhere to pull the film through without it. the plot focuses on a resort off the south coast of florida (or rather, somewhere in italy) where several local people have turned up in the water with arms and legs missing. it's not long before the local authorities decide that this creature has never been seen before, and it's up to a motley crew of various sea experts to catch it alive! <br /><br />the main problem with this film is that it always feels very pointless, and since there is little in the way of characters or plot development, even the least demanding of viewers are likely to start getting bored before long. this sort of film is hardly famous for being brilliant, although the fun element of films such as 'the last shark' and 'killer fish' is unfortunately absent for most of the running time. the thing i love about lead actor michael sopkiw is that he always seems like he's taking himself seriously no matter what film he's in (although he only ever made four). this is certainly the case here, although bava never really allows him to completely dive in, and often he feels as much like a spare wheel as the rest of the film. much of the runtime is spent watching the various characters sup american lager, and it's not very fascinating; although bava does manage to come good by the end with an entertaining flurry of action as the central monster finally gets to wreak havoc upon its would-be captors. overall, there really isn't much to recommend this film for. as mentioned, i really like this sort of stuff and even i found myself bored on numerous occasions. for hardcore italian horror fans only!
