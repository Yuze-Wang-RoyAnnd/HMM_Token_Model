this movie was so predictable and poorly acted. i really can't recommend it to anyone, not even for unintentional laughs. it is just plain bad. it is pure tv movie hell, the cast doesn't seem all that bad, but they act terribly. just stay far away from this movie and rent something more intellectual, like porn.
