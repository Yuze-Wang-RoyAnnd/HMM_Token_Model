the depiction of ichabod crane's character was so terrifically unlikable, my wife and i were hoping that the horseman (or some other character) would not only cut off crane's head, but do it slowly and painfully.<br /><br />i mean, this brent carver guy played it over the top---like he was on broadway. and he was such a relentless jackass that we had no sympathy for him whatsoever.<br /><br />i could go on with specific critiques of how this movie failed, but i prefer to not devote the energy.<br /><br />just skip it and go for the johnny depp version. either that, or rent the haunted pumpkin of sleepy hollow (animated). it is quite good--entertaining for kids and adults.<br /><br />better yet, read washington irving's original story.
