the message of hero is quite clear: the idea of greater china is more important than the death and the suffering of millions. at a time when china is dangling its war toys over taiwan, it is unacceptable for western viewers to endorse this piece of over-produced, government-sponsored, dogmatic trash.<br /><br />particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media. roger ebert of chicago tribune, david edelstein of slate, charles taylor of salon, and many others have wholeheartedly endorsed hero. in so doing, they have implicitly legitimated its reactionary political message. the only critic (that i know of) who saw through the film's glossy facade was j. hoberman of the village voice, who wrote of the film's "sanctimonious traditionalism" and its "glorification of ruthless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of national greatness." i, for one, sign my name under hoberman's final pronouncement: hero is nothing more than "fascinating fascism."
