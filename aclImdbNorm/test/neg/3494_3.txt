okay, it was very good...but best picture? please, not even close. munich was better, capote was much better, good night and good luck was much better...brokeback mountain - well, that should have won! the academy voters seem to act like the current day democrats - please just a little of everyone, but don't dare take any concrete positions. that's why we have a complete moron in office in the us.<br /><br />this has been the worst aa presentation ... and forget 1987 ... since way before that. hollywood is so afraid of it's bottom line, that it can't be set "straight". many voters apparently didn't even see brokeback mountain. get real and get with it.<br /><br />this was the most pathetic year since i have been watching in the mid- 60's and i was only two.<br /><br />wake up, whoever you are. hollywood is mainstream, and that's what happened to the box office in 2005. king kong, the last star wars film, another batman film, a re-make or whatever of charlie and the chocolate factory, and much more to come in 2006.<br /><br />at least there were original best pictures, i.e. munich, but heard that one before, capote - great; katherine keener should have won, even though now we know reese can sing like a cash/carter, etc., syriana was a much better picture than crash. that film has been done, since the early 1960's and we have to make that the best film? what a horrible oscar night and a horrible year to end with in 2005 and another boring year in 2006. at least the bafta for best picture went to brokeback, and what about the horrible song that won? pathetic. i think we only have about 20 years left as america or the usa, before someone comes in and changes up things a bit. maybe it will be china since they own so much of this country ... or india, because they have all the high-tech jobs and are the largest democratic country in the entire world.<br /><br />america has become the land of the fat, the pathetic, and the stupid. trash can be found in more places than florida, west virgina, south dakota, and in the mid-west.<br /><br />drive-through a local mcdonald's or burger king for goodness sake. order all you want until you get a heart attack. put yourself out of your misery.
