this train-wreck begins with brujo and alma crossing the mexican border. alma is suffering from some horrid curse that causes her to vomit garden snakes and nickelodeon gac every few minutes as well as clench her teeth and mutter nonsense. so apparently alma has this uncle in los angeles who knows of a cure for her. they hop aboard a train to get there and luckily a friend of theirs pays their way. alma and brujo stay in the luggage cart the whole movie since they can't afford upper class seats. meanwhile in the higher class we see a bunch of nobodies on their way to la for whatever reasons. a balding guy on a business trip, two girls, one of whom is carrying $5 grand and a wad of cocaine, three stoners, and some mexicans. the mexicans rough it up with brujo and try to take his "weed" which apparently is a sedative for alma's snakes slithering inside her. they realize that the snakes don't attack, they enter your body through your veins! very twisted and b-movie. brujo saves the guy by ripping out his heart (temple of doom style) and procuring the snake. for some reason he cannot have the snakes harmed or it'll hurt alma. while this is going on a narcotics expert tries to bust one of the girls and gets a little action (topless) in exchange for not telling about her shipment of drugs. a mystery guy shows up and has a gunfight with him. as a grand finale alma turns into a vampire, bites her man and then becomes a giant pathetic excuse for a cg snake the size of the train, eats the train and is blasted into a nuclear bomb hurricane whirlwind and disappears. everyone then heads to la on foot.<br /><br />the credits actually say at the end "any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental, and very weird. we suggest moving and/or taking a plane". odd since a line in the movie from the bald guy is "yeah, i hate planes!" the credits go on to say "no snakes were hurt during the production of this screenplay. only a small child but it's cool." there actually were a lot of real snakes used in the movie, and all of them very tame. there is actually no scene of cg snakes attacking anyone unless you count the large one, but then it just eats the train and the other fake snake is just the head and it looks like a muppet. the snakes don't really attack anything, they're just...there. one crawls out of toilet paper actually!<br /><br />the movie isn't funny, isn't scary (as there's no real snake attack), and is just a 'quickie cash-in' which is when a low-budget movie company hears about a big budget hollywood release, then they rush to put out a similar film, or even a parodic version, for release just prior to, or simultaneously with, the big name flick. the effect of this being that many people will either confuse one for the other, and go see the quickie rather than the 'biggie' or, they will want to see both, for whatever reason... like myself. avoid at all costs.
