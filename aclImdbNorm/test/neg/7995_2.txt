terrible action movie in which lead franco nero exchanges his cowboy hat, gun belt and the coffin he dragged around in django (1966) for an all-white ninja outfit with all the snazzy paraphernalia that goes with it! despite virtually non-stop action, the film is utterly clich'ed and unintentionally funny - with a campy villain, to boot, in christopher george. susan george (no relation) is the attractive woman with a washed-up husband, nero's wartime companion, whom the villains are trying to push off her oil-rich land - but the latter haven't counted upon nero's martial-arts (and stunt-heavy) gymnastics. the solution to their problems is to hire a similarly-skilled ninja for themselves who, as it happens, turns out to be nero's deadly enemy (played by sho kosugi, who appeared in two more sequels and is currently engaged in another!). the climax takes place inside an arena where one-man army nero 'eliminates' george and what has remained of his gang from previous confrontations; the subtle way in which he despatches his nemesis, however, is effectively done.
