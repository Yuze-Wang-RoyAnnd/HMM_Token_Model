while watching this movie you notice right away the cheesy elements of a standard tv movie... though through out the picture the plot changes (if you are bold enough to say this movie has a plot) are by the book and unoriginal... and with every one the movie kept getting worse!<br /><br />candace cameron bure, famous for her role as dj tanner on the hit tv show full house, is not very convincing as a possessed twenty something.. trying to avenge the possesers death. i believe she is fine actress.... just not in the thriller range.<br /><br />the filming was trashy, and like i said the plot stale... though watching it i knew i was in for automatic cheese, i had no idea how much worse this film could get...<br /><br />i highly do not recommend this movie... unless cheep filmaking and poor writing is what you looking for
