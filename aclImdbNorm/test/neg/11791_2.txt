i suppose for 1961 this film was supposed to be " cool " , but looking back now ( 45 years ) it's charm was just as silly as it's entertainment value ! granted , the special effects do well on t.v. with the series that started in 1964 , but for the big screen ?? i once had a fish tank that was equally as exciting ! i must agree about the octopus scene near the end where it attached itself to the seaview. obviously not well staged...or trained ! overall , it's pretty bad acting with shoddy special effects and i still do recommend it - for fun laughs sake. this was probably one of irwin allen's biggest films and i think he thought a lot of it . barabara eden went on to play " genie " on t.v. micheal ansara was her husband . now that is a cool part about this film ! i always enjoyed seeing real life husband and wife teams star in the same movie . neat !
