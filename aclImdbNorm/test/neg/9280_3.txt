the 3rd and last big screen spin off from the very popular itv sitcom of the early 1970's,holiday on the buses is every bit as resistible and crude as the previous two efforts,and observing from a standpoint three and a half decades later,it is truly mind boggling that even one film was produced in this franchise.<br /><br />what constitutes the plot surrounds the adventures of stan butler (reg varney),his conductor jack (bob grant) and their bumblingly autocratic inspector blake (stephen lewis) after their sackings from their regular jobs at the bus depot.they all find work in similar positions at a holiday camp with stan's family (doris hare,anna karen,michael robbins) following therewith.<br /><br />british cinema had a deserved and considerable reputation for high quality in the 1960's,but much of this was due to american financial support and guidance which sadly drew to a close as the 1970's dawned.thereafter,notable homegrown titles (get carter being the among these very few exceptions) became as rare as mick jagger in a stable marriage,and uk cinema went down the road of cheap budgets,sleazy and witless sex comedies (the confessions series,come play with me) and flabby,elongated celluloid versions of various tv shows,mostly sitcoms (this being one of many hideous examples).only dad's army and porridge came off fairly respectably in this regard;the quirky success of the first on the buses film (it was the biggest box-office hit of it's year in 1971,nonsensical to think now!) led to two further sequels.<br /><br />to be fair,the tv series itself had a cheerful,ripe,non-pc vulgarity about it which was reasonably tolerable in half-hour sitcom form,but stretched to three times that length it taxes the patience beyond belief.it's ironical that hammer films produced this effort as it virtually resembles a horror film in the literal sense,with ancient puns,hackneyed,poorly-timed slapstick and awful,seedy production values.<br /><br />a chance to send up the cheesiness of the british holiday camp is totally wasted here in favour of the above elements,and it is most bizarre,if not gruesome,to see the obviously 50-something varney and the beaky-nosed,long-toothed grant managing to instantly charm young women barely in their early twenties,while constantly laughing at their own bravado and lame jokes.the presence of wilfrid brambell (from steptoe and son) romancing the aged miss hare does not help matters either,and even though the film lasts about 1 and a half hours,it drags on to an interminably depressing degree.<br /><br />thankfully,this was the last film in this most dire of film trilogies,and the tv series itself came to an end around the same time,with a sequel (don't drink the water,which was roundly savaged by the critics and ignored by audiences) following in 1975.most of the leading actors involved were not seen much afterwards,but the worst affected was bob grant.afflicted with depression and other mental problems for many years,he committed suicide in 2003.a sad coda to a sitcom that was the most popular of it's era (it has not aged too well either),and should have remained that way,rather than the three financially successful but artistically hopeless big screen hybrids which diluted the happy memories and occasional merits of it's tv counterpart.<br /><br />rating:2 and a half out of 10.
