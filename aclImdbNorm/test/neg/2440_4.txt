justine cannot find the perfect mate to make her first time the perfect one. with geek friend in tow, she enters a virtual machine to improve her appearance. when she sees the opportunity to create her perfect man, an explosion occurs and the results are left to your imagination. problem is, how many obvious sex jokes are left anymore? how predictable can these kind of movies get? a few funny moments here and there, but nothing too outrageous or different from jokes in other movies or even normal life. if you liked weird science or jokes about the 'fish out of water' combined with 'gender identity crisis', then by all means these 90 min, you could enjoy.
