at the beginning of the movie, ramgopal verma says that "sarkar" is his tribute to the godfather. this one feels more like an insult. it pales terribly in comparison to the coppola classic. although no one was expecting ramgopal verma to fill coppola's shoes, the movie did create a lot of expectation and buzz. <br /><br />amitabh bachchan plays "sarkar", a character automatically drawing instant comparisons to indian political party shiv sena's supremo bal thackeray. abhishek bachchan plays his son shankar who returns from abroad and gets caught up in sarkar's politics at home. just like al pacino in the original godfather. <br /><br />as most bollywood fare, incidents and characters are overtly simplistic and devoid of any kind of solid foundation. quick phone calls and sudden announcements turn the film from one direction to another. abishek takes to mumbai's murky underworld politics-crime nexus like a duck takes to water. amithab bachchan as sarkar is supposed to look magnificent and powerful, he just ends up looking old and clueless. most of his acting is centered around constantly staring at different things around the movie set - the actor in front of him, the floor or in some other random direction. <br /><br />however, kay kay performs exceedingly well as the wronged elder son vishnu. so does zakir hussain as rashid, the dubai based dope smuggler who wants to gets his footing in mumbai. this actor has awesome screen presence and can send chills down your spine with just the way he looks. the moment he enters the screen, you want to run and hide under the bed. <br /><br />all its obvious flaws not withstanding, the film did well at the box office. the buzz and the big star cast obviously helping. also verma manages to hold your interest albeit mildly towards the later half of the film. he is actually making a sequel to this one which i am sure will be more of the same fare.
