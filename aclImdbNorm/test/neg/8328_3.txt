"tragic hero" is a film that is most definitely trying to emulate the classic godfather films, focusing on family, crime, loyalty, and revenge. also, this is part of a two part series as the godfather also was (at the time). however, this film comes nowhere near the level of those classic films and actually fairs worse than other triad thrillers being released in hong kong at the time.<br /><br />one reason is the acting. with the exception of chow yun fat, the acting is generally over the top and unbelievable. the audience tends to find the proceedings humorous simply because the actors' inability to maintain any degree of seriousness. as a result, we find the film not truly emotionally involving or intense since we don't particularly care what occurs with these characters.<br /><br />another reason is its lack of focus. the narrative tries to incorporate many different story elements into the film, but this results in portions of the movie becoming underdeveloped as well as lacking any real sense of coherency. the audience sometimes becomes lost at the proceedings we are viewing, not knowing what the character's motivations are.<br /><br />the film's climax does contain a decent gun fight, but again since we don't care about the characters, we don't care who lives or who dies; the scene loses it's intensity and suspense because of this. the other action set pieces are rather mundane in nature, with a feeling of it being too controlled rather than free flowing.<br /><br />in general, this is a strictly average film and isn't recommended to the general film viewer... only hard core genre enthusiasts and fans of chow yun fat should consider this film for viewing.
