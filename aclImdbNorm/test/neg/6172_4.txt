i decided to watch this movie in order to fall asleep. it kept me awake, so it was interesting; however, it was pretty bland.<br /><br />the acting was good. i don't think any of the actors did a bad job. mickey rourke is as believable as an over-the-hill hit-man can be. the dialogue in this movie does not provide much opportunity for these actors to show off their full potential, but they still shined.<br /><br />the atmosphere was great. music was good and colors matched the mood that the director wanted to paint for the viewers. even the weather enhanced the mood of the movie. everything was well done.<br /><br />the failures of this movie are in its story development. the storyline with the mafia vs. blackbird doesn't get enough attention. the storyline for carmen and wayne's divorce doesn't get explained. the fbi seems to work extra fast here. is there no paperwork for all these processes? is it really that easy to dig up your brother's body from his grave, burn the corpse, and have it be identified as you? there are too many loops in the storyline for me to give this movie anything higher than a 4 out of 10 rating. i wouldn't recommend this movie to people unless they're really bored and have smoked some really good weed. even if wow is down for maintenance, go find something better to do than watch this movie.
