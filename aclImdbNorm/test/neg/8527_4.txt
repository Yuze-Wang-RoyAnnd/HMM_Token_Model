directors of "the messengers" danny pang and oxide pang are responsible for "the eye" and its sequel and their premiere american picture plays like "the grudge"-lite set in a farmhouse.a family of four move from chicago to a run-down sunflower farm in rural north dakota.almost immediately their teenage daughter jess starts seeing ghosts.of course her parents and the police are skeptical.admittedly the film is well-made and there are two or three effective scares,but relies too much on 'boo' effect.still the plot is a carbon copy of many ghost stories and the ending is anti-climatic and stupefyingly awful.scares are on the low side too with a tendency toward cgi.overall,"the messengers" is a pretty weak horror film that simply doesn't deliver.4 out of 10.
