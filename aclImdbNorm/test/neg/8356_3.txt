i have a question for the writers and producers of "prozac nation": what is the root cause and what is the solution to the widespread problem of personal depression in america? in the moving performance of christina ricci as liz wurtzel, the film portrays a young woman with unlimited potential as a harvard student and as a writer. but this is not a story of success, only one of self-destruction as we watch liz bring misery into the lives everyone who comes in contact with her. the film examines divorce, family dysfunction, drugs, alcohol, and prescription medication as possible reasons for liz's unhappiness. but none of those superficial explanations are satisfactory.<br /><br />at some point in the film, it would have been helpful to suggest that liz needs to take responsibility for her life and her problems. no light was shed on what the film alleged to be a runaway problem in "the united states of depression." in the story, liz had a caring therapist (anne heche), a caring roommate (michele williams), a caring boyfriend (jason biggs), and a troubled but caring parent (jessica lange). in a key scene in the film, liz is lying in a hospital bed watching the break-up of the space shuttle challenger. instead of equating challenger with liz's life, the film should have used the image as a starting point for her healing and recovery.<br /><br />this film reminded me of a generic made-for-cable "victim" film on the lifetime network. an excellent cast was wasted, especially in the earnest performance of christina ricci. the real-life elizabeth wurtzel obviously found within herself the resources to cope with her depression and become a successful author. it is unfortunate that the film could not offer us even the slightest glimpse into her courageous spirit.
