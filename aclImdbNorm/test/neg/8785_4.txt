whoa. i mean, whoa. i mean, whoa whoa.<br /><br />i saw this movie, waaay back when i was eight, in 1996. back then, cgi films were a rarity; and good ones even more so. also, back then we listened to things called cd players. but i digress. i used to like this movie a lot, way back then, and up till viewing it again, i've held reaally fond memories of it. hey, it's don bluth! anyone who hates "all dogs go to heaven" is clearly a robot. but, again, i digress.<br /><br />then, i saw it again. this really isn't one of his best, i can say now, eleven years later. i've seen a lot more films, and i've garnered a little bit more knowledge. now, sure, the voice acting is good, i'll give 'em that. story's...okay. i mean, we see it all the time. a lot. but, it works. the musical numbers are what irk me. this would've been more at home in the eighties, with these kind of musical numbers. in '96, most kids movies had epic numbers, like the lion king (which came out a year or so previous, but whatever)or stuff like that. you get showtunes here, vaudeville style.<br /><br />the animation kind of hurts, too. at times choppy, and at others completely changing style and format with the change of a shot, it's really hard not to notice.<br /><br />i still like "all dogs go to heaven, but this could've been waaay better.<br /><br />4/10
