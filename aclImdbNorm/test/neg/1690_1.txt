this is a dreadful adaption of charles kingsley's story. the animation is, to put it bluntly, awful. and the songs are a disgrace to film songs, epsecially the "high cockororim" song, which they keep repeating. i feel sorry for jon pertwee and david jason, 2 of britain's finest talents, providing the voice for the depressing animation sequence. bernerd cirbbins tries his best to perform in this awful production ,but fails.<br /><br />avoid this film at all costs, even if it is the last film on this planet!
