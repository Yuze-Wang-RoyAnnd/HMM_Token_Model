honestly, i didn't really have high expectations for this movie, but at the same time i was hopeful. having it be directing by albert pyun - one of the more well known b-movie auteur's - didn't exactly raise my hopes. i mean how many albert pyun flicks rank that highly? yeah, exactly ... but still the movie advertised a decent cast. rob lowe, burt reynolds (pre-reborn stardom), ice-t and mario van peebles.<br /><br />it all amounts to squat however as the movie is so boring and moves so slowly that the energy just seemed to drain right out of me the longer it went on. it runs over 90 minutes, but it's telling a story that could have been told in 30 minutes flat. i don't know what pyun was going for here. i mean the movie drips artsy-like style, but it's a blur at times and maybe i'm an idiot for expecting more from pyun this time around. here he seemed to actually have a budget and a potentially great cast for the material, but it's all wasted. crazy six isn't much of an action film, it's not much of anything really.<br /><br />i guess what's the saddest here is the fact that i found the end credits the most entertaining part of the movie. the music score is actually half-decent with some smooth female vocals too, but the rest is a complete waste and the less said the better. avoid.
