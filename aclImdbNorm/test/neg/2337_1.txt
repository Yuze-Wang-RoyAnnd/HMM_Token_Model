some directors take 2 and a half hours to tell a story, david lynch takes 2 and a half hours to piece together scenes with "clues" and his trademark oddity, but there's never a story. no plot. no progression of the characters (unless you find revealed delusion a "progression"). it amazes me how anyone can call lynch's garbage "art", but if beauty rests in the eye of the beholder, so be it. lynch's movie and tv work in the 1980's came off as "avant garde" and "alternative", fine. 20 years later, work like "mulholland drive" comes off as a 2.5 hour david lynch masturbation piece. it's embarrasing. i've finally seen the movie that takes my top spot as the worst ever. at least the people churning out "godzilla" and "rodan" weren't passing them off as "art".
