after the suicide of his father, charlie 'kid' davis (ray `boom boom' mancini) accepts the invitation and advice of his friend tiny (michael chiklis) and travels to las vegas with him trying to become a boxer. on the road, they meet gina (jennifer beals) hitchhiking, they give a lift to her and she becomes charlie's girlfriend. johnny ticotin (rod steiger) is convinced by tiny to be charlie's couch, and the powerful agent alex dumas (joe mantegna), after watching him fighting, becomes his manager, promoting charlie's career. this movie is so boring that it indeed does not deserve to spend much time writing about it. i do not like boxing, but sometimes i watch some worthwhile movie about this theme. but this one is horrible! predictable, full of clich'es, having an awful lead actor, a pure waste of time. my vote is three.<br /><br />title (brazil): `corpo e alma' (`body and soul')
