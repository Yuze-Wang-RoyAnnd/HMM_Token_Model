that's what i felt like yelling as well as stomping out of the theater, but i restrained myself. yes the acting was great, no this wasn't the typical hollywood film, but the dialogue just wouldn't end (or get interesting)! and despite all the gabbing, you never get to really know or care about any of the characters. definitely the most boring film i've seen since sphere, but i was expecting that one to be boring. i had to sit through it, but please, spare yourself
