"electra glide in blue" is a slow moving b-flick in which blake plays a desert motorcycle cop who wants to be a homicide detective and becomes embroiled in a murder investigation. a mediocre film at best, "eg in b" features some members of the band chicago, a whiff of action, some philosophizing, and lots and lots of boring dramatic filler. not worth the time.
