legendary pop star steve alaimo ("don't let the sun catch you crying") stars as an unlikable stock car racer whose career has hit the skids (ha ha) because he constantly crashes his car (or as he laments, "i'm tired of being run down by every grease monkey that gets behind the wheel"). he falls into a bad crowd of humorously inept nazi bikers, improbably named jeeter, banjo, fats, and, er, linda. fats is the most likable of the bunch; he took a surfboard to the back of the skull and now only communicates through grunts, sort of a harley davidson leatherface.<br /><br />anyway, steve is fooled by the cops into catching the dastardly crooks in the middle of one of their bank robberies. the gang only robs banks for "kicks, man". i guess they give the money to charity. steve fails constantly, the bikers get greasier, and the whole thing never comes off as daring because it's so dull. this movie looks like it was filmed through a grease-soaked paper towel. not since "necromantic" has a movie so trampled my soul.<br /><br />the guy who played fats went on to direct "deranged", the ed gein biopic starring robert blossom.<br /><br />anyway, in summary: wild rebels: hilarious on mst3k, dreadful everywhere else.
