there is only one word to define the whole movie, that is: awful. how "mostly martha" was remade is awful. the title of the movie is awful. the actors are awful. and the idea of combining good cooking and usa is awful. if you have seen "bella martha", well that is the original title and it means "beautiful martha", this one is a punch in the stomach. the acting of ms.jones is so poor and unnatural that even jessica alba, considered one of the worst actresses (http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomactr.asp) would have done better. not to mention the cook, who would better play a different role. and the little girl... not worth mentioning. bella martha was a very nice movie, an authentic one... why was it remade? there was a story.... here they took it out. there is no story... what shall it represent? in one way also this movie was perfect. you know when all ingredients fit together? well this is the case here. a perfect crap....
