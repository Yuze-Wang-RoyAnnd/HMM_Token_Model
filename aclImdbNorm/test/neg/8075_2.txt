stephen king tv movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no one complains, right? so why give the stooges only 96 minutes? i'm not asking for a pbs mini-series, but would a two parter had killed anyone? the movie steamrolled over events that should have been mentioned and mentioned events that could have been omitted. i do want to give a salute to the performances of the stars...they had a tough job because they didn't really look like the stooges, but the spirit was there. after watching the movie, i pulled out a tape from american movie classics that had the real deal on it and laughed myself silly. the movie was pretty tough emotionally, especially after curly has the stroke and moe needs to keep the business going. when curley started crying i lost it...like i said, the movie was good, but could have been and should have been much, much better. maybe it's fitting though...the stooges got ripped off when they were alive and now, 25 years later, it happens again.
