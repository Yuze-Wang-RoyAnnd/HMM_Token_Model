can i just start by saying i'm a fan of bad movies. and this is a really bad movie. it states on the front 100 passengers, 3000 snakes, but i think it's more accurate to say 12 passengers and about 20 snakes.<br /><br />the snakes don't do anything particularly interesting, the whole movie in fact just blunders on with little happening. although there is occasionally a great gore shot of pulsating arms and green goo puke (bad movies have to have green goo don't they?).<br /><br />but then the ending comes along and will quite literally smack you off you seat in hysteria. and for that, this movie gets a boost up to a 2* rating.<br /><br />there are certain movies about in the world that you will want to show to your friends, just so you can watch there reaction when a certain event happens in them.<br /><br />for example the arrival of 'big man' in r kelly's 'trapped in the closet' 'the line' in 'shark attack 3' (you'll know it when you hear it) the arrival of the mama shark in 'shark attack 3' almost every scene of 'troll 2' the ending of 'dracula 3000' (just for utter disbelief and confusion) and the end of this movie proudly sits in this category. it's worth sitting through just for that. so get drunk, stoned, whatever your poison is and watch this movie with some mates.<br /><br />quite simply, if you like bad movies, get this, but don't get it confused with 'snakes on a plane' ... there's no relation.<br /><br />and don't pay more than a fiver for it either ....
