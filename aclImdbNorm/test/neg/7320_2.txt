i had high hopes for this one after reading the back of the dvd, "in the spirit of american pie and animal house..." after suffering through this i realized i just blew $2.50 to rent it. this movie started out slow and just got slower... brief and fleeting moments of levity proved that it was in the spirit of american pie if you mean "spirit" as a dead thing. not very entertaining or fun! don't be fooled like i was and expect anything barely watchable because this movie will depress you more than entertain you. "need to fill up three more lines for this stupid movie that doesn't deserve the effort... what a stupid piece of ignorant crud. this movie wreaked, even the brief nudity sucked!
