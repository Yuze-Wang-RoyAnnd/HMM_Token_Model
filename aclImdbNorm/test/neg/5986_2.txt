i lived next door to the author in 1980 when he first moved out to portland from downer's grove, ill. with two of his high school buds. he seemed like a normal-enough guy, though he had a lot of artistic pretensions. within a few years, he jumped into portland's post-punk music scene with buddy phil and a few others, and a band that definitely wasn't headed anywhere, although it got him a lot of action, including a fling with courtney love in her portland groupie days. he seemed to think his musical prospects were good enough to move to san francisco, then n.y.c.<br /><br />i was surprised to hear that he got a publishing deal in '95 after the band crashed and burned. courtney love's name seemed to be the clincher. i have no idea how the movie came about, especially with this cast, but i doubt that gus van sant was involved. anyway, the reviewers here seem to be unsure whether the lack of narrative focus is intentional or not, so i would just say that this is the work of a fairly intelligent guy who wants to be a writer, or artist or something, but doesn't have anything to say. like kerouac without the benzedrine.
