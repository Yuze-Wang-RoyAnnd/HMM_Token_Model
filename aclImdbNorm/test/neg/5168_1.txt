from all the bad comments about this movie and add them up i feel the same way. it may look like the australians are weaklings instead they were brave soldiers. in this film it was very terrible and too graphic. i didn't see enough heroism just more cowardice which is ashame because its nothing from what i read. we don't need the extremity of violence like that we can use our vivid imagination of what they went through. it's like saving private ryan where the nazi is pushing his knife slowly in the soldier. for example mel gibson is a over extreme director for his movies not because of the violence but for the level of historical inaccuracy. letters of iwo jima was one of the war films that was close enough to history (although i could be wrong) except flags of our fathers and bridge of the river kwai. you're better off reading it its an insult to the victims and the fallen if you don't tell it right, and the movie drag on for too long there was nothing interesting about the dialogue and not enough retribution from the aussies to kill japanese soldiers. just read history on the internet, mags and in books. movies always kill the sense of realization. what they did to pows in singapore and the philippines was just dreadful escpically to civilians. it just makes me feel proud to see goodies beat the baddies but movies like this ruin it.
