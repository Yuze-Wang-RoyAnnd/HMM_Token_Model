i once had a conversation with my parents who told me british cinema goers in the 1940s and 50s would check to see a film's country of origin before going to see it . it didn't matter what the plot was or who was in it , if it was an american movie people would want to see it and if it was british people wouldn't want to see it . this might sound like a ridiculous generalisation but after seeing the astonished heart i can understand why people in those days preferred american cinema to the home grown variety back in the 1940s <br /><br />british equity was devoid of working class members and it shows in this movie . everyone speaks in an english lad dee daa upper class accent that makes the british royal family sound like working class scum and what this does is alienate a large amount of a potential british audience who would no doubt prefer to be watching jimmy cagney in white heat because people would have , if not related to then certainly empathised with a violent gangster in cinematic terms more than some high class english shrink in 1949 . that's entertainment , the reason people go to cinemas . even the characters names seem bizarre - leonora ! how many british people were named leonora in 1949 ? and the protagonists drink cocktails . and they use words like " austere " . you do get the feeling that this wasn't marketed for a 1949 mainstream british audience . but why should it if the majority of british cinema goers were queuing up at cinemas to watch far more entertaining american imports ? <br /><br />watching the atsonished heart in 2005 i was astonished how dated everything was , in fact it's so dated i thought maybe it might be a spoof from the harry endfield show . what didn't astonish me was the fact that these types of movie came close to sinking the british film industry , an industry that didn't pick up until american money invested in crowd pleasers like zulu , alfie and the james bond movies
