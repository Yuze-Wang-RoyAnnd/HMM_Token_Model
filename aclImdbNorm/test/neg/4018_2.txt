when you're used to lana turner in the postman always rings twice, and compare it to this low budget, low talent, low quality film, well, i was just embarrassed for ida lupino's 'singing' (more like talking) and non-piano playing scenes. when the first non-singing scene started and all the people just stared flatly at her, i was positive they were all going to roll their eyes and start leaving or at least talking among themselves (she stinks, c'mon let's get out of here). the actors are flat - emotions are deflated. and ida is a real spoiled bi-otch throughout - just a 100% turnoff. this was like betty boop on conscious sedation meets a gas station attendant in nowhere's ville usa. the story was flat, the music was flat, the acting was flat, her chest was... no never mind. i felt sad for the rest of the actors. perhaps if the right actress was to have been given the lead role, and the men actors had more emotion, then the film could have had a chance. sorry for offending those of you who thought it was out of this world. i wouldn't have minded if it stayed out of this world.
