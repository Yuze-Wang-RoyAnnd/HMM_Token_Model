i got this thing off the sci-fi shelf because i remembered seeing the first of the series when i was a kid. i'd rented the second one and it was a decent "b" sci-fi. this one was out right obnoxious. the "special" effects on the cars looked like something my 4 year old cousin could have done. the two assistant female cyborgs were so terrible that i literally cringed every time they came on the screen. the plot left so much to be desired that it made me sick. i don't know what anyone was thinking when they agreed to be a part of this movie but i'm sure that they'd have done better to have left it at 2 movies. the movies in this series are going from good to decent to terrible. i only hope that no terrorist groups have access to this movie as it makes an excellent torturing device.
