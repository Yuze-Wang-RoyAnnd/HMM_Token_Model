yet again, director j. lee thompson unites with actor charles bronson for a violent and uncompromising action flick. in fact, this is probably bronson's most brutal film (quite a feat for a man who appeared in death wish, ten to midnight and chato's land). however, brutality doesn't on its own make for a good film, and the evil that men do is ultimately a disappointment. if you were to take away its brutality the film would have precious little else of interest.<br /><br /> the story is about a retired hitman (bronson) who lives a cosy life on a caribbean island. he is persuaded to come out of retirement to track down and eliminate a sadistic torture doctor who has been plying his vile trade around various south american hell-holes. throughout the film, especially at the beginning, we are treated to some graphic torture scenes to show us just what a nasty piece of work he is.<br /><br /> these themes are actually quite serious. torture does go on in suppressive latin american dictatorships, and everyday folk are made to suffer some despicably painful experiences simply for voicing an unpopular viewpoint. but the evil that men do - for all its worthy posturing - isn't really bothered about the plight of these poor people. it is bothered purely with giving charles bronson an excuse to blow away some unpleasant scum-bags. it's just an exploitative actioner which hangs its coat on genuine issues. the torture sequences make you, the viewer, feel like a dirty, sick-in-the-head voyeur, rather like someone who gains pleasure from viewing "snuff" movies. the script is full of horrid dialogue, including some excessive descriptions of acts of torture. the evil that men do fails to explore its disturbing ideas... its serves them up as entertainment and asks us to enjoy them. sorry, but that's just wrong.
