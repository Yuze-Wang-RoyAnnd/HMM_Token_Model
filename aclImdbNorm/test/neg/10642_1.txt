hellraiser: bloodline is where the sequel mediocrity of the hellraiser series well and truly sets in. gone is the imagination and invention of the first two movies. gone is the ethos of pinhead and his minions. gone are the sick desires of humans. in fact everything that once made hellraiser so original has been trashed by this mess of a picture.<br /><br />all that is left is that basic premise of christian mythology that there is a hell with evil demons. what happened to the evil that men do? this watered down excuse for a hellraiser movie is padded out with endless psycho babble, so that pinhead becomes a nonsense spouting philosopher and not the harbinger of doom as he is meant to be. <br /><br />the film uses the most basic of film formulas with characters separating and getting individually killed. pinhead is not alien. the link between the box and the 'demons' or 'hell' is never established it just arrives at a sacrifice and sits on a sideboard.<br /><br />the lead female character is called 'rimmer' and the producers obviously think it really funny because everyone keep saying her name. really the film should have been retitled to give it that characters name.<br /><br />shame on you kevin yagher and alan smithee.
