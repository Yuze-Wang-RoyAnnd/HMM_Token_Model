the movie was slow, the dialogue between actors/actresses felt "flat" and basically there was no development of the characters in the story.<br /><br />omar epps skulks around with a mad look on his face the entire time, pouting and basically looking annoyed with everybody. danes has no on-screen magic, and ribisi's character is a goober that nobody would want to hang out with even if they were paid to do so.<br /><br />throw in the weird scene where epps has to dance with an old man, and you have what quite possibly could be the worst movie in cinema history.<br /><br />i watched it on satellite (thank goodness i didn't pay for it), and wished i hadn't.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and go sort your underwear and socks drawer if you need something to do but are tempted to watch this movie when/if it comes on your tv. awful movie if you ask me, and i generally have something good to say about just about any movie out there.
