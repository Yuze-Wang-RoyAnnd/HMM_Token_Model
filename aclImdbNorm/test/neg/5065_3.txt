controversial german journalist jutta rabe who herself got divers to the estonia wreck, put this silly "thriller" together to save her investment.<br /><br />donald sutherland is of course always watchable - but he's only in three scenes. he delivers his material perfectly - as you can ask from a professional. also, the main lead, j"urgen prochnov, is at times very good.<br /><br />the rest of the cast is, however, bad. the actress that plays the swedish minister secretary (or whatever she was - she seems not listed in the cast) is extremely bad.<br /><br />the script has some nice ideas, and the story is actually kind of interesting. the final screenplay should have been re-written a couple of more times though. some scenes are plain ridiculous - especially the end scenes.<br /><br />the film is almost 2 hours, which is about 45 minutes too long. presented as a 60 minutes tv-film, this could have been really interesting. as a two hour feature, it's pretentious, boring, stupid and plain out silly.<br /><br />jutta rabe might be a good journalist (her ideas about governments using estonia to transport military items from estonia to sweden have been concluded as true recently, when the swedish military officially said that they actually used the ship estonia for this), but as a film producer she sucks.<br /><br />the director, the writer and the actors suck more.<br /><br />i give this film 3/10. i would've given it a 1, if it wasn't for the fact that the story is quite interesting at times, donald sutherland is in it and it has real stock footage.<br /><br />but we don't even see the boat sink! what kind of movie about a ship that sinks is that? like a werewolf movie without werewolves...
