i had a bad feeling ten seconds into the film as a pair of overworked tumbleweeds (probably left over from a bad western) blew across the scene. the bad feeling grew ten seconds later when the obligatory opening stranger-turned-human-sacrifice for no apparent reason lowered his rear view mirror to see a shadow in the back seat. for the next five minutes over the opening credits we are treated to an overhead shot of the car rocking back and forth and only the dramatic made-for-tv-movie music informs us a killing is taking place, not a make-out session. for the next 27 or so hours we are treated to two idiotic psychotics who for some reason seem compelled to drive through the desert southwest together, going after each other like a demented abbot & costello. even with the "shocking" twists at the end, we are merely left to shake our heads and wonder if the producers and director/writer feel as ashamed and embarrassed as they should for creating this inconsistent, incoherent nonsense.
