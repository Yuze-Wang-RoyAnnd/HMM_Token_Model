"you know - i've been in some towns where the girls weren't all that pretty. in fact i've been in some towns where they're downright ugly. but it's the first time i've been in a town where there are no girls at all" i am sure the fans of great classic remember this phrase that belongs to vin... one of the truly magnificent seven (from the first movie)...<br /><br />now i'd want to re-phrase him here. you know - i've seen some movies where the plot isn't all that good. in fact i've seen some movies where the plot is terrible, but that's first time in my life that i saw the film where there isn't any plot at all.<br /><br />ok. maybe my above statement is little bit over the top, but honestly... how one can call the plot a crap that is going on in this movie. the bad guy (oh, don't ask me to give you his name, because i don't remember and his not even somehow close to calvera who's name and character is unforgettable...) is trying to build the church in the name of his late sons, that were killed in some battle, and this bad guy is kidnapping poor villagers to force them to build the church...<br /><br />first of all how big must be church to have to force hundreds of villagers to build it... is it some egyptian pyramid or something? but ok, let's stop here about the plot and absolutely forgettable character of a bad guy and let's say few words about the seven itself...<br /><br />yul brynner's good old chris, always calm, always silent, talking less but talking wise is gone (unfortunately). oh no... he's as calm as he was... but now, he's calmness are so fake that you just don't buy it. (imagine, he meets a good old friend chico, who he must rescue after so many years and there is just a few "hi, hello" and not even handshake (as far as i remember))... honestly, it looks more like meeting of two strangers in some internet chat, rather then meeting of chris and chico. that makes "new chris" more look like robocop or terminator rather then our beloved wise quickgun...<br /><br />i won't stop here talking about other characters. there simply aren't any... (imagine if strong actor like yul brynner is so much fake forgettable, then what will be other characters look like)...<br /><br />there still are some attempts to give us a background story for each one of them... for example one is women favorite guy, second is a man with dark past who's wife was raped and killed by indians and he since then is killing everyone and everything that is moving... but non of these characters are making any sense or non of them can take your heart.<br /><br />i remember i was a little child and when o'reilly (charles bronson's character) died in the first movie i was crying. here, i just didn't care about each one of them... even if whole of them with all the crew of the film would die, it seems i wouldn't care more...<br /><br />so, please, go and see this movie... i recommend it, because you won't have the other chance to see something worse then it.
