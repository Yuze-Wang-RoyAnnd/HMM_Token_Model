maybe it's unfair to dislike a movie for what it isn't, rather than what it is, but i approached this hoping that finally a filmmaker would make a movie about small-town rural gay men and women. instead, the focus is primarily on the outrageous bigotry (big news!) of the locals (and those in outlying areas) and the really gruesome torture/murder of a young gay man.<br /><br />so much time devoted to stupid people squawking about aids, sin, hellfire, and perverts. so much time devoted to the ghoulish preacher ranting about the bible and gay people getting what they deserve.<br /><br />i wanted to see more of the people that came to the "small town gay bar", not those who opposed it. in addition, the young man who was murdered isn't even from this town.<br /><br />the whole movie works as a warning rather than a celebration, and it's very suspect.
