this episode had potential. the basic premise of a woman living next door to an empty apartment (but a phone that constantly rings) is somewhat interesting. and when she explores the noise, there is genuine tension and fear. but stupid script writing ruins any promise the episode had.<br /><br />first of all, the woman readily admits to seeing things that would send most of us running in the other direction (e.g. "it's funny that the door slammed shut even though there is no wind;" "this door has serious damage to it that wasn't here a minute ago;" "the door opened by itself, without me touching it;" etc.). given these supernatural phenomena, plus the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room, wouldn't she take some precaution before entering it? maybe she could investigate in the day time. or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else. or maybe she could turn on the lights!!! also, while in the haunted apartment, she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and gets into an argument over who has the power to disconnect the phone, and then they begin discussing the details of the suicide. just unplug the phone! the phone company doesn't need to be involved. walk up to the phone and unplug it. case closed.<br /><br />finally, showing the phone scamper across the floor like it's alive was just comical. if the director wanted the woman to get strangled by the phone card, he could've done it in a way that didn't look cartoony. brave little toaster anyone?
