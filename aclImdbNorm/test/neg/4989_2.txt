let me start of by saying that i never wanted to see this movie in the first place; i had to watch it one day, and i figured that i guess i can lighten up and enjoy it for what it is, and it might turn out to be entertaining. what i got going in with that expectation was one of the worst movies i have ever seen, bar none. first of all, there was nothing humorous in the least bit. the creators expected humor to be laughable/passable if they include sarcasm in every line that comes out of underdog's mouth and use scene after scene of bland, played out aspects to "charm" the audiences light-hearted side, while still making them "ooh" and "ah" for more with boring action scenes and insipid, lackluster performances that made me want to yell at everyone in the audience that was enjoying it. the acting was dull, the humor was tedious and the characters/plot felt like they spent about 10 minutes creating their entire personalities which gave the uninspiring actors/actresses no range on how to portray their characters with the least bit of depth. this movie is plain and simply awful in every field and really only kids under the age of 10 will be able to enjoy it, which even though that's what age range it was aimed at, that does not excuse it for being so poorly daft and causing me to feel so penitent. parents, spend your money on up, wall-e, the spiderwick chronicles, the water horse or hotel for dogs for the best, recent family/kids flicks, or even alvin and the chipmunks is better than this filth!
