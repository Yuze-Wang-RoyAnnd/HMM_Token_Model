i will never get back the three hours of life this film has stolen from me.<br /><br />the film is basically a psychedelic drug trip disguised as an important creative process. i'd love to know what they were on when this film was being made.<br /><br />its also the most historically-inaccurate film in existence; 2001 has come and gone without any of the events or predictions taking place.<br /><br />characters are unlikeable, design is simplistic and everything just rambles on without any sense or logic to it.<br /><br />and the ending is probably the worst of it: its supposed to be thought-provoking but the only thought that entered my mind is "what the f$*k is going on?!" <br /><br />i'd say for anyone looking for serious entertainment purposes, avoid this film at all cost and choose a sci-fi movie that isn't stuck up its own @$$.
