i really wish i had read everyone's review before going to see the movie... it was one of the most excruciating films that i've ever seen. i was ready to leave the theater 5 minutes into the movie; i should have followed my instinct. the movie offered nothing new or clever, it was boring and very clich'e. i was surprised to find that it was directed by a woman! the characters did not represent any women that i know, they were boring, bitter and melodramatic. the movie was unrealistic and depressing and a waste of time and money. and the actors looked tired, poor make-up and hair styling. it was recently compared to the sex and in the city movie; it was not even half as good. my suggestion, do not see this movie!
