for what it's worth, this is a fairly decent road runner cartoon, if a little short (just under 6 minutes). the gags are adequate at best, the animation is competent, and the new restored dvd master looks nice. however, that's where the qualities end. allow me to provide a little backstory: in 1958, thanks to a labour dispute, wb got hold of a bunch of canned music that would be used in 6 of the year's cartoons.<br /><br />there is only one phrase to describe this short's music, and that is "it has the 4kids sound". i use that phrase to describe music which has absolutely no correspondence to the on screen action, and feels like it was recorded by an orchestra consisting of members of a sonic youth cover band. the music in this short feels hopelessly tacked on and incredibly obnoxious, especially considering there are scenes in this short (namely the piano trap) that would have worked best with little or no music.<br /><br />i didn't think a wb cartoon would be ruined by awful music (even lava's scores aren't this obnoxious), but considering the cartoon isn't that notable anyway, it becomes almost painful to watch with the music. it's kind of like how late 80's episodes of doctor who could be bad anyway, and yet be made unwatchable thanks to keff mcculloch's unbelievably awful music (which sounded like he hit the demo button on all 5 of his casio keyboards at the same time).<br /><br />i am going to have people call me crazy for this, but i'd easily watch one of larriva's rr cartoons over this. at least the canned music was usually in sync with the action on those.
