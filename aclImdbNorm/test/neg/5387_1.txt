i hadn't heard of soap girl but i saw a poster with a five star review from film threat outside the theater so i figured, how bad could it be? well, i soon found out. my god this film was awful. the most wooden acting i have ever seen outside of a porn flick. absolutely agonizing dialogue. i just can't understand how this was made and why anyone agreed to be a part of it. and i find it completely unfathomable that this was actually being shown in a theater and money was being charged to see it. how did this happen????? and most importantly what the was the guy from film threat thinking?!?!?!?!
