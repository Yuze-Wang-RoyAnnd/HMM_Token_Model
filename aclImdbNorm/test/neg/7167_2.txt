'book ii' isn't a film, it's a sermon. this nauseating, sickly and almost unbearably tedious misfire probably works as religious propaganda but has no entertainment value beyond a few wisecracks from george burns. louanne plays a little girl who is asked by (ahem) god to mount an advertising campaign that will get people to believe in him again. no really, that is the story. it's a leaden load of old cobblers that has far too much self-justifying, 'explanatory' religious waffle but barely any decent dialogue and certainly a total absence of anything even approaching magic or charm. 'miracle on 34th street' this ain't. suzanne pleshette breathes a bit of life into this rancid puddle of quick-setting concrete but the pudding-headed script and rubbish performance by the irksome louanne quickly send this one down to the fiery depths of you-know-where.
