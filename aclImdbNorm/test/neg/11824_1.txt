this film is an embarrassment. nothing works on any level. the direction, screenplay, acting , and editing work together to repel your eyes from the screen. everything is inappropriate and incoherent. at first you can sit there with and groan, wince, and laugh at it, but very shortly the whole effort of watching just becomes too ponderous.
