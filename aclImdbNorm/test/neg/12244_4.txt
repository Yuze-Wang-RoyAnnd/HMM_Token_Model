with so many horrible spoof movies, this is sadly a breath of fresh air to the genre. compared to classics like airplane or the naked gun, this is awful, but compared to recent spoof movies like meet the spartans and disaster movie, this is very clever and original. don't get me wrong, though, this was not a good movie in any way. i laughed a few times, and there are a few inspired gags, but any pop culture reference falls flat on it's face, as does most jokes in the movie.<br /><br />lambeau fields (david koechner) was a bad coach in the past, but now he's brought back to teach college football, and this time he'll do a good job. his wife (melora hardin) is feeling distant from him and his daughter is dating a football big shot to spite her father. spoofs of various recent movies come into play, as do a lot of sight gags and nonstop stupidity.<br /><br />the best parts of the movie are the gags not relying on reference to recent movies. spoofs of radio, rocky, dodgeball, friday night lights, invincible and many other sports movies are not funny in the least. it's mainly the smaller gags that get a few laughs, like a bizarre crotch scratching scene, or a chewing tobacco spitting joke. these little throwaway giggles cannot carry the movie, and by the end, it's hard to watch. the last 20 minutes are grueling to sit through.<br /><br />the characters are surprisingly developed for a sports spoof movie, however, i'm sure the characters were built on clich'es from the genre. nonetheless, they're not too bad. david koechner can pull lead actor in a movie off. too bad they gave him so much crummy material to work with. matthew lawerence has fine comedic timing in a not always so comedic role as a ballet dancing football player with a cross dressing father. carl weathers rounds off the cast, once again playing in a sub-par sports movie (not the rocky movies...happy gilmore!) overall, this is a goofy comedy. at times, it's funny, but more often than not, it's just very annoying and predictable.<br /><br />my rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 90 mins. pg-13 for language, sexual humor and drug humor.
