this film sucks a big one. so many holes in the plot. if the devil is invincible, why does he require the protection of arnies bodyguards? i couldn't fathom why arnie didn't turn up for work for several days and then suddenly appears, takes their entire armoury and disappears again!! nice work if you can get it. it's sad that the last 1/2 hour has to result in the standard arnie 'uzi 9mm' finale. arnies interpretation of a depressed cop is to bow his head and sniff. i thought he had a bad cold for most of the film. dreadfully scripted, arnie is called 'buddy', 'dude' etc for 95% of the film and then suddenly we hear him being called by his real name of jericho cane (where do they get these names from??). the ending is so twee you'd better get the barf bag ready. shame that gladiator pulled off the same ending with 100% more class.<br /><br />
