this movie starts out with kids telling each other urban legends such as the poodle in the microwave and getting something extra at a chicken place. unfortunately, it then turns to your basic anthology movie. the first being about a janitor with a bit of a secret. this one is okay at best. then it gets worse as the next story about this kid obsessed with dead flies is on and it goes on and on and on. it is way to long and not all that interesting to begin with. after that you get the typical shock scene and it ends. you need more than this in an anthology movie. you need at least three stories and one shouldn't be so long it becomes dreadfully uninteresting especially considering you can see how it is going to end a mile away.
