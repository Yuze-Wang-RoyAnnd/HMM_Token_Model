academy awarding actor sidney poitier of "lilies of the field" reprises his role as lieutenant virgil tibbs from the 1967 oscar winning best picture "in the heat of the night" for veteran director gordon douglas' tired, uninspired sequel "they call me mister tibbs," with nobody the equivalent of rod steiger with which to swap dialogue. clearly, both "bullitt" scenarist alan r. trustman and robert d. webb of "cape fear" were off their game when they penned this predictable police procedural potboiler. the dialogue is drab and none of the characters are interesting, not even the chief suspect. absolutely nothing remotely exciting, suspenseful, or surprising occurs in this tame whodunit. meanwhile, things have changed considerably since virgil was last seen in "in the heat of the night." he worked as a homicide detective for the philadelphia, pennsylvania, police department. in "they call me mister tibbs," our hero works for the san francisco police department. moreover, he has a wife, valerie (barbara mcnair of "change of habit"), and a family, a young rebellious son, andy (george spell of "the naked kiss"), and a younger doting daughter, ginger (wanda spell of "hickey and boggs"). tibbs drives a medium blue mustang and his wife holds down the house and hovers over their two children since he doesn't have as much time to spend with them. literally, there are no surprises in this pedestrian murder mystery. indeed, the best thing about "they call me mister tibbs" is quincy jones' terrific orchestral soundtrack with a memorable opening theme, more memorable than this forgettable crime thriller deserved.<br /><br />everything begins sensationally enough with a struggling prostitute, joy sturges (linda towne of "the adventurers"), being bludgeoned to death in the bedroom of her downtown apartment by an unseen assailant. apartment handyman mealie williamson (juano hernandez of "intruder in the dust") enters joy's apartment and finds her strewn on the carpet dead with a bloody forehead. he picks up the statue briefly and then puts it back on the floor and reports joy's death to the superintendent of the apartment, rice weedon (anthony zerbe of "license to kill"), and weedon gives mealie and fistful of dollars and sends him packing. afterward, weedon anonymously notifies the sfpd that popular minister logan sharpe (martin landau of "nevada smith") beaten joy to death and was seem leaving joy's apartment. captain marden (jeff corey of "true grit") assigns tibbs to handle the case; it seems that both tibbs and sharpe have known each other for 18 years. naturally, tibbs' wife valerie cannot believe that the well-known, politically active evangelist could have committed such a crime. just to give the movie context, it should be noted that when tibbs and the police study the crime scene, they mention the word 'semen,' no doubt a controversial term to mention in an early 1970s movie.<br /><br />tibbs questions weedon whom he suspects is either a drug pusher or a pimp. weedon explains that he has no records on joy sturges because she was subletting the apartment from another realty company. tibbs visits the realty company and realtor woody garfield (ed anser of "jfk") flees and drives off, essentially doing an o.j. simpson until he crashes his car after a lengthy but tame pursuit. when tibbs proves that woody didn't kill joy, he allows him to leave, with his disgruntled wife, marge (norma crane of "penelope"), prepared to file for divorce after the revelation that he paid a hooker to stay in an apartment.<br /><br />tibbs tracks down handyman mealie and clears him of the crime, and then he goes after weedon. luckily, for tibbs, our hero catches the evil weedon in the middle of a narcotics transaction. one of weedon's henchmen assaults tibbs, but tibbs dispenses with him briefly before he embarks on a long foot chase after weedon. eventually, he corners weedon in an underground parking garage and they shoot it out. guess who wins.<br /><br />the scenes in the tibbs' household are more interesting than his investigation. andy runs rampant, striking his sister, and smoking in the garden. our hero wants him to clean up his room. when andy refuses, tibbs pops him three times on the jaw. these child rearing scenes could probably never be handled today as they were back in 1970. at the end of the movie, as if to solidify the family sequence, tibbs is seen walking off with his wife and kids. there is on confrontation between valerie and virgil about the welfare of their children and how his long hours at work has affected them.<br /><br />director gordon douglas directs in competent fashion. surprisingly, for a film released in 1970, the filmmakers never play the race card. in one scene, when tibbs searches a billiards parlor owned by an african-american, we see a mixed breed of races scowling at the hero when he finds mealie and leaves with him in tow.<br /><br />altogether, "they call me mister tibbs" is a poor follow-up to "in the heat of the night." mind you, poitier delivers another fine performance with nuance, but everything looks prefabricated. all of the sets look fake and there isn't much physical violence: one underground parking lot shoot-out that doesn't last long and a fight. beyond jones' seminal jazz score, the only surprise
