my roommate and i have another friend that works at a local blockbuster video. he finds truly awful movies for us and tells us about them. one of them was a "christmas horror" film starring former professional wrestler bill goldberg as a killer satna claus. we didn't watch it immediately, but we didn't think there could be anything worse. apparently, we were wrong. we were shown this slasher film "starring" ken shamrock versus a murderous scarecrow. at first we thought ken would actually be the killer scarecrow, and that's why we wanted to watch, but he wasn't, and that made the movie even worse. what absolutely ruined the movie was the teen drama. if you want to save your brain cells from trying to escape from your head, never ever watch this movie.
