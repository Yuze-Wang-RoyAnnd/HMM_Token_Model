it's dreadful rubbish. i liked 'how do you want me', 'father ted', 'green wing' and bill bailey's standup act but i file this with 'hippies' and 'planets of the apes' (the re-imagining) under 'great pedigree, went badly wrong'. my guess is that it appeals to the same people who like 'withnail and i'. it's overwritten but to little end, a luvvie-ish air pervades it and bernard black is simply a less camp withnail. and i thought it was self-indulgent even *before* dylan moran became the writer. but the set up raidiates such comic potential that for the first 2 episiodes i didn't even notice that it wasn't in the slightest bit chortle-worthy.<br /><br />the things they are saying/doing *should* be funny but somehow they don't manage to register as more than mildly amusing or "i can see how someone writing this down might have thought that this would be funny". what i am trying to say is that the situations/remarks are mildly humorous and yet too mundane/gentle/self-consciously surreal to be worth creating for and depicting in a sitcom. <br /><br />life is too short. avoid.
