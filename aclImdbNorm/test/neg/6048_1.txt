just saw it....the story, the plot, the script makes absolute no sense!! its samvise the brave part 2(without the ring), its characters showing up out of the blue(for no reason),its hercules hated by everyone(no one knows why), its leelee sobiesky showing her true talents(two of them), its crappy special effects, its a few good actors wasting their talents(did i mention leelee's two talents??)... do i have to say more??? its just awful, even for nbc-tv standards!!! its just the lowest....what a waste! by the way: how can you people give this mini-series so many stars????? its beyond me!.... shame on you! have to make 10 lines, so this is my final word: avoid, avoid, if u are considering buying it!
