i began watching this movie on t.v. some weeks ago, but gave up after the first 10 minutes or so. at the start, the person on the witness protection scheme located in an isolated farmhouse becomes nervous about his exterior placed guards, and then asks the guard inside the house whether he can make a telephone call - only to discover the line has been cut.<br /><br />shortly afterwards, roy scheider as one of the witness's assassins turns up and duly executes the witness and his wife - upon which the roy scheider character duly picks up the wall telephone in the kitchen, dials a number, and then speaks: it is done!!!! that was it for me!
