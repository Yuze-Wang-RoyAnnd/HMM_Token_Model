the reality of the mafia environment is absolutely dog-eat-dog where a gangster will be killed for showing any sign of weakness because they become a liability. i've got no problem with the human side of gansters' being portrayed but bugsy steers too far in the direction of soft, comical, men. the film is enjoyable but is only light entertainment and not a biopic of a man who, though exciting, was extremely dangerous and fearsome.<br /><br />the acting's all good and the direction very solid. the locations and era are very well represented and the themes very interesting. did bugsy really want to kill mussoulini?
