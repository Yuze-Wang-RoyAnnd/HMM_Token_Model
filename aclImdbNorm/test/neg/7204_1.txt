as you may remember i have seem all three of the trilogy of trash and the first movie is the only one even remotely close to be watchable. part two was low grade sewage and this installment is slightly better then two, but still one steaming pile of something i removed from my backyard last monday. the premise doesn't make sense, why did the moonshiners murder that poor old lady and even in 1921 i think someone would notice a bunch of oily guys where a sweet little old lady once lived. second, that scarecrow is pathetic compared to how cool they looked in the first movie. it's just old clothes and a burlap sack. let's face it, the series is garbage and should be forgotten about. the noose!
