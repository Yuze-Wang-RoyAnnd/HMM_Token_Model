franco films can be divided into 4 categories- the "earlies" (often black and white and inventive), the "naughties" (late 1960s/early 1970s often involving soledad miranda), the "nudies" (of various periods, but using full frontal female nudity as plot drive)and "the rest".<br /><br />this is part of the "rest". it is not really a cannibal movie at all. it is certainly no gorefest. the few women in the picture dont even lose their loin cloths and there is little full frontal stuff at all. the picture quality on the german dvd i watched is poor. the film peters out (insofar as it ever catches fire). as a franco fan, i would tell others not to bother. do something else with your time...read a book....get a copy of "women in cellblock 9"...anything really...
