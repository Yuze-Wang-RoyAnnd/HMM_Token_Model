it was full of plot holes, inaccuracies (doesn't the time-clock stop for injured players or loss of helmets in texas football games?) and not so much redemption (so your dad beats the crap out of you? well, do something right for once and then he will love you and make it all worthwhile).<br /><br />either make the movie about a team and its quest for a championship or make a movie about a player within a team and his personal struggle but instead, this movie tried to do it all and came up more than a couple yards short. the book probably showed the whole story much better; the movie should have picked one element of the story and stuck with that.<br /><br />instead, the movie jumped from one character dialogue to flashes of game play and then another character dialogue months later without actually telling you who people were or why they were important--the qb calling his sibling to take care of the mother--whatever happened with that? because the mother was coherent by the end of the final game, does that mean she's not crazy anymore? its one redeeming quality was the soundtrack. buy that and then watch sportscenter highlights while iggy pop plays in the background.
