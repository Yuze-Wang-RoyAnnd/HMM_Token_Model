the movie begins with much voice-over, a bad sign. then it just slides downhill with silly and intelligence-insulting scenes involving trappers and indians. but, it reaches new and impressive lows when all the merry mountain men square dance with each other in a high alpine meadow. meanwhile, the happy-go-lucky indians sit around watching them. it's a better scene than the dancing cowboys in "blazing saddles". there is a minor flaw in this comparison; "across the wide missouri" is not a comedy.<br /><br />
