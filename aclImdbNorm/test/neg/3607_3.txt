...but of course i was wrong.<br /><br />now, i never expected to like the first movie. i'm not sure what's up with disney's marketing group, but it seems that every trailer they make for an animated film ends up turning me off as too childish, or silly, or stupid, and yet the movies themselves are usually anything but. and no movie looked worse to me in the trailers than the emperor's new groove, which is why i was quite surprised to actually find myself quite enjoying that film when i finally broke down and saw it. i entered with zero expectations and came out pleasantly entertained.<br /><br />despite disney's track record with direct-to-video sequels, i had nonetheless hoped for a better experience with kronk here... but in the end i was nothing but disappointed (and unfortunately not exactly surprised that i felt that way). there's almost no humor targeted towards adults. the original songs are uninspired and sickly cute. the animation, while not bad, still doesn't come close to emperor (which was no lion king to start with).<br /><br />the main plot, as such, is astoundingly "minor" and is comprised mainly of a sequence of mini-plot flashbacks - in fact the while thing felt more like a sequence of pilot episodes for a saturday morning cartoon series than a well conceived single entity.<br /><br />david spade gets about four lines throughout the entire movie and there isn't exactly a lot of john goodman either, so overall we're just left with far too much of patrick warburton's kronk - who was entertaining as a secondary character in the first movie but is completely inappropriate as the main lead here.<br /><br />although kids might find it somewhat fun, the only thing kronk's new groove managed to do for me is make me want to go back and watch the far superior original.
