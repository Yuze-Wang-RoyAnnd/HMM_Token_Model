this movie really is that bad, and i'm normally a sucker for bad movies, but this was too much. seeing this is like od'ing on pure suck. now, you may think you've seen the bottom of the barrel. you may have waded through every title from full moon and troma, all the movies of edward d. wood jr, uwe boll, albert pyun and direct to dvd-flicks from faded men-of-action. you may even have seen death tunnel, ghost lake and a vast array of the movies that mst3k covered, but in their original form. but you do not know truly awful film-making until you have seen darkhunters. and if you haven't, you shouldn't. don't bother. not only is this movie amazingly poorly written, directed, shot, edited, acted and splattered in crude, cheap aftereffects. first of all, it's a pretentious mess. but not good, greenaway or lynch-style pretentious or hilariously messy in an ittenbach or early waters sort of fashion. it's the kind of pretentiousness that comes when someone incredibly stupid thinks they've come up with something incredibly smart. sort of like m. night shaymalan (sp?), only that man seems like a freakin' messiah when compared to this trainwreck (and this coming from a rampant shaymalan hater). it's also boring. not heavy going-type boring, which is okay, if the movie awards your patience. darkhunters does no such thing. it's boring in a "oh my fu(king god, if i see another shot of a cat set to an obnoxious audio cue i am going to fu(king kill myself!"-kind of way.<br /><br />btw. anyone who claims to like this film is a boldfaced liar and anyone who claims this film is complex or deep knows what their mother is like in bed.
