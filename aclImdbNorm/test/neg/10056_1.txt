filmed in arizona by a mostly-foreign crew, "nightkill" is one of the clumsiest crime dramas i have ever seen. robert mitchum (in a cowboy hat) trails recently-widowed jaclyn smith around, hoping to figure out if she had a hand in her husband's death. jaclyn's wardrobe is of the dale evans variety and her dog is named "cowboy"...seems as if somebody sure bought into the american myth that all westerners talk and dress like descendants of john wayne! screenplay by joan andre and john case may have worked better if approached as parody; this mystery thriller just plays tame, with director ted post asleep at the controls. don't be drawn in by the video box art of jaclyn screaming while taking a shower. she does indeed take a shower in this film, but it is not revealing (nor does it further the murky plot one iota). no stars from ****
