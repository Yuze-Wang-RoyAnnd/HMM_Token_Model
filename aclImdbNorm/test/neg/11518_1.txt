i am in a movie club at my school and i was forced to sit and watch this utterly dismal film. the film's story is not dismal, but the entire movie itself is exceedingly dismal. the acting was absolutely dreadful. the children were overly whiny. a metal pole could have done a better job. i wanted desperately to fall asleep, but because the television was so loud, i was kept from peace. the monkey's are neither cute, nor are they funny. the drama is laugh-worthy. i cannot remember when i saw a more dreadful film. the story is weak, thin, predictable, and completely fake. the adults try to be good actors, but they just can't seem to break through stereotypes. the girl even appears to want to leave the film via falling off a hill during the movie in order to leave it, i don't blame her. micheal anderson should publicly apologize for this film. not just to me, but to everyone else who was forced to sit through this awful film. in fact, i apologize to you. even if i had nothing to do with this project, i apologize for this film, because this means at least someone will. this film even surpasses the dismalness of films that of rob schneider and the cheetah girls. i would even go as far to say that it is even worse that hilary duff's collection of films, but that's pushing it. just please don't see this film, or else you'll be pushed to write a review similar to this one on how awful this film is. i'm very sorry.
