i am astounded that so many people find this film even close to good. let me make it clear that i am a huge hitchcock fan and went out of my way to own as many of his films on video as i could but this one i felt was so below par not only for hitch's films - aw heck, i'm being far too nice here. this pictured really sucked. i don't care that hitch did a favor for the very talented carole lombard, but i have seen 50s sitcoms with more cleverness and style than this boring turkey. chemistry between lombard and robert montgomery? listne i like mashed potatoes and ice cream but i wouldn't want to taste them together. i have seen better chemistry in chemical spills on th highway than here.<br /><br />if you really love hitchcock, avoid this film and see any one of his better ones. for crying out loud, the bits hitch did on the old tv show were funnier than anything this film fails miserably to deliver.
