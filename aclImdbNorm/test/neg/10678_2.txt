i will not even make any more comments about this movie. instead i will make a recommendation for all you euro-horror fans: if you want to see an enjoyable low-budget vampire flick, check out nattens engel (1998). it has everything razor blade smile lacks: acting, nice locations, terrific score, and less hissing vampires...
