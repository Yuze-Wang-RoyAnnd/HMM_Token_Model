the whole movie was done half-assed. it could have been a much better movie but, that would have required a re-write and different actors. compared to "traffic" this was a wreck. i am just glad i didn't have to pay for it.<br /><br />spoiler:<br /><br />what was the point of having crooked cops getting arrested? to share the guilt of drug dealers and make them feel better? pu-leaze! the parents were scum, driven by greed, and didn't even consider the harm they were doing; as pointed out by ice-t. <br /><br />2 out of 10
