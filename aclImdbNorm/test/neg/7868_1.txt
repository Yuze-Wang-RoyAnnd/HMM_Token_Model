target is the story of a special agent who, after carrying out orders to assassinate turkish "terrorists" (note that this is one of those american "movies for guys who love mindless nationalistic super-patriotic crap movies"), returns home to find that his ex-wife and two kids are taking hostage. charlie snow has just a couple of hours to do whatever the terrorists tell him in order to get them back.<br /><br />this was by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen. and, had it not been for someone i know actually (and probably, mistakenly) taking it out of the video store, i would never have watched this giant pile of garbage to begin with.<br /><br />the movie plays out like any generic action movie story i have ever seen before. in fact, these are the kind of things they spoof on variety shows, that is how bad it is. i half expected in living the color's 'homey the clown' to mad tv's will sasso doing his steven segal impression to bust out on the screen half way through, to remind you that this was just an exaggerated action movie, but now our characters are here to spoof how ridiculous it really is. there were not even any good fighting or action sequences. by the way things are played out, you wouldn't even think that anyone was kidnapped, that there were any terrorists, or that anything remotely interesting was going on.<br /><br />not only is the story completely and utterly uninteresting, the acting is so terribly wooden. just watch the part where stephen baldwin, as former special agent charlie snow, is talking to the kidnappers on the telephone. they tell him that they have his wife, and they put her on the phone. she says "charlie, help!" or something to that effect. and baldwin replies "it's okay, honey" in such a deadpan manner, you think he was reading the script and trying to sound out the words phonetically. i imagine that, despite being such a ridiculously bad movie (one that belongs on the bottom 100 on imdb--a list that they should expand to at least 250 movies and should contain nearly every stephen baldwin movie), someone with some talent could have at least made the effort not to ham it up as much. someone. anyone. i couldn't get past the fact that everyone sounded like they were reading from a script. save that is, the only person in the whole friggin movie who has any talent whatsoever (and thus should not have been in this), mad tv's deborah wilson.<br /><br />this was the capital cheese fest. how truly embarrassing.
