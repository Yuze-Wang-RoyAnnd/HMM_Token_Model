if it was possible to give negative stars i would for this stinkburger.<br /><br />don't get me wrong i loooooovvveeee a good crappy movie. i am a big fan of films like octoman, wizard of mars, queen king and others. real classics of b-cinema.<br /><br />but this film actually makes jack nicolson and boris karloff in the terror look like an academy award winner!! the dialouge is so needlessly long-winded, and mostly inappropriately used. (ie. "i will now condensened (yes, condensend!!) to your wishes. the acting might have been a lot better if they had some more logical lines.<br /><br />the story? what story, a count is exiled because his wife had leprosy? i'm still not sure on that count. a (rich?) fleet one and the captian of one of his ships crash on the island? people acting unnaturally? ok, i like camp in b-films a lot, there lies a lot of it's charm, but this was just dumb..plain dumb. a salty sea captian who sounds as well versed as a college professor? a fleet owner who is as clueless as they come (i felt this guy had no idea of how to play it, one scene he's spanish acting, the next english/european)? the count, who's not sure if he's a reincarnation or really desade (don't ask me how desade figures into this, after 4 beers my wife, friend and i still couldn't figure it out.<br /><br />the scare factor? i could show this turkey to my small grandkids and only worry about them sleeping through it. i like a lot of early 60's horror movies, and some still have good shocks, but this thing...never had a shock, or even a hint of of a scare.<br /><br />on the info on the back it says, "this movie contains scenes that are so vivid and degrading that they will surpass your worst nightmare." the only degradation is watching this movie. it's 90 mins.(the case says it's 74 mins.) of your life you do not get back.<br /><br />i paid only a buck, yes one buck, for this and another film. i still feel like i am owed .50 cents for even sitting though this.<br /><br />to sum up dungeon of harrow had no one named harrow in it, but, it did have a lovely cardboard dungeon.
