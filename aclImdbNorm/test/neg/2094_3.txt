not to be mistaken as the highly touted samuel l. jackson vehicle snakes on a plane; snakes on a train is low budget, features no actors(to speak of), but some pretty decent visual effects. an attractive young woman(julia "rayanne" ruiz)does not want to marry someonelse's choice for her husband; so she is put under a powerful mayan curse that has snakes hatching inside her body, slowly devouring from the inside out. her only hope for survival is a shaman who lives across the border in texas. time is running out for her; and she is put on a train from el paso to los angeles. before long the snakes are leaving her pain wrecked body and rapidly growing in size. the passengers aboard the train are now trapped and soon to be snacks for the snakes. the finale sequence is no doubt the best of this 91 minute flick. also receiving acting credit are: alby castro, al galvez and giovanni bejarno.
