i have seen nearly all the films of kurosawa and dozens of other japanese films as well. compared to these other films, this is a rather average to poor film. the plot features two warring brothers--neither one of which i cared much for--and it is very confusing keeping up with who is allied with who. the music and cinematography is pretty good, but the special effects, at times, are terrible--rubber heads flying off with about the same realism as the average high school play! on top of these complaints, the ending of the movie completely destroys and undermines the entire picture. it turns out that the end isn't true but was completely "fudged". what's the point of this, then? if you have seen this film, understand that there are many better films out there, so don't give up!
