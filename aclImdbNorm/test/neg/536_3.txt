this movie stinks majorly. the only reason i gave it a 3 was because the graphics were semi charming. it's total disregard for a plot and the lack of even insubstantial surface character development made it seem like just a bunch of nice drawings. this is by far the worse anime that came out of japan. i can't believe they actually put their names on this garbage. what a rip off selling this thing for $20. if you haven't seen this don't bother. if you have, i pity you.
