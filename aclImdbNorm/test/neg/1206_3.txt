don't bother to check for logic. there is none. but on the other hand, there are many really great movies that totally lack logic, so why bother?<br /><br />i both like and dislike this film. i like it because the action sequences in the air are really great, you get to see a lot of dogfighting. i also like the f-16, which is a very cool plane.<br /><br />but there are just too many goofs to make me really enjoy it. i guess it's not fair to wish for some sort of continuity, as it is hard to make a really good fighter film - but i also think there should be some sense of reason.<br /><br />and i have a question: do they fly from california to the middle east in f-16s without air refueling? i'd like to see that happening.
