don't buy this film for comedy value like i did, i didnt find it one bit funny, but so f****** miserable and lame it's unbelievable. i gave it to a friend for christmas which was pretty funny (on my side) i recently heard that he watched it and told me what an a**ehole i am!<br /><br />there is nothing more frustrating than watching an over-lit, over dramatic, poorly scored scene in which the camera is sat there on a tripod and doesn't move... the film work is truely pathetic, and i can only say dont watch this movie!!!!!!!!!!!
