first of all, no one with any law enforcement experience (not er or emt, but real law enforcement) takes this show seriously. walker would be drummed out of any police force in the us for his illegal and totally unprofessional tactics. on top of that, he is a comic book character---no acting ability, incredibly trite lines, no character development. the fact that alex cahill loves him shows just how dumb blondes really are. and trivett is the ultimate clown in black-face. come on---if you think walker is a heartfelt show without bias, then explain why jt is treated as a dolt, always is the subject of walker's jokes, never is allowed to be the one to solve the crime, and never rescues walker, who should be dead 50 times over for the stupid things he does. while it may be true that many criminals are even dumber than the detectives who go after them (and believe me, most cops are dumber than dirt), the smart ones walker comes up against never seem to get the point that once walker is captured, the jerk needs to be put of his misery. but then again, norris produced the show as well as starred in it, so how could he willingly get rid of himself or even show how stupid his tactics are. as if six guys are going to wait around to take him one at a time. what a terrible series! it is more demeaning than any of the hokey westerns like the lone ranger, roy rogers, the cisco kid, and wild bill hickock, though i would imagine that most of you on here are far too young to remember those shows. but like those shows, in the same way as those shows, walker tr is just as insulting and just plain silly.
