this series takes a classic story and makes rubbish of it. robin is somehow mystified by an elk-man in the forest and is embroiled in all sorts of druidism and outright satanic episodes. the story is more about him avoiding the evil sheriff than helping the poor. this is barely watchable. and to top all the ridiculousness they kill robin at the end of series 2 and replace him with another actor. some people may like this show as a fantasy show but it is not a robin hood show. if you want robin fighting in king richards name against prince john and the sheriff and if you want robin feeding the poor and oppressed, watch the classic series or the newest from the bbc.
