friday night with jonathan ross must have those in charge of ross rubbing their sweaty little palms together. they know the bbc lacks imagination when it comes to talk shows so when they have jonathan ross at their disposal they are quite settled to just sit back and let a half wit command this primetime slot.<br /><br />ross spends most of the show grooming his ego and smiling about how much the bbc is paying him. the show is a complete copy of many us chat shows - leno, letterman, conan o brian, the list goes on - but he and his team have clearly seen what works on the masses can also be done for the dumb masses in the uk also.<br /><br />the unfortunate situation - he has no competition? parkinson has gone by the reality is he was never really up to much except grooming a celebs ego. can't we have someone funnier and slicker on british screens instead of jonathan ross? once ross has built up his ego enough he will then proceed to the very boring concept of the stiff celebrities in the green room - so trying to get on with each other. if an a-lister is present (which is so often the case these days - as there are no other chat shows they can turn to - to promote their latest movie) - he will spend the next hour either flirting with them or trying to be their best friend in the universe. sqeamish when he had ringo starr on - a man that cares nothing for licking arse - ross genuinely was begging for his mobile phone number (as common policy on this show is for jonathan ross to get everyones number so he can be seen in the right company when not working). of course ringo said it how it is - and simply said no i don't like you - dead pan serious.<br /><br />ross needs to be axed from all awards and tv shows - the masses will get over it.
