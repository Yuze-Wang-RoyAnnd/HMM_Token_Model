there is no reason to watch this film.<br /><br />why? many reasons. first up, the acting is awful. there is hardly a line that isn't misread - but that is hardly surprising given the banality, stupidity, and repetitiveness of the dialogue the actors are asked to mouth. it is awfully written. one of the most annoying things about the script is that the writers only seem to know one way of keeping their characters talking after a certain point and that is to have them repeat the most important words of the previous character's line.<br /><br />"repeat?" <br /><br />"yes, they repeat it. for the whole movie." <br /><br />"the whole movie?" <br /><br />"yes, the whole movie." <br /><br />etc. <br /><br />in movies like this you generally know who the bad guys are and what they are after. (all the good guys usually have to do is stop the bad guys. setting up a good "mwahahaha! with x in my grasp i will rule the universe!" villain is the first stop in any cheapo sf plot) but in this turkey? - you tell me.<br /><br />as i understand it our "heros" are a bunch of mass murderers sent into the past on a dirty dozen type mission. they are sent by a fascistic totalitarian state to stop some other mass murderers from altering the course of history. the new history would not include the rise of totalitarianism, and a war that kills 30 billion people and leaves the earth a dead planet (we know all this because this movie has one of those handy long on-screen situation reports just before the action starts, telling you who is who and what is what. it's an indication of who the producers think their target audience will be, that it is narrated as well as appearing on screen - just to save the audience from taxing their brains too much by doing a lot of reading.) so just who are we supposed to be rooting for here? i guess we are asked to believe our hero undertakes some sort of journey from totalitarianism to love, peace, and understanding while shooting loads of people - but that doesn't work as an arc because we are shown he is a decent(ish) human being right at the start when he tries to rescue all the civilians aboard the rebel station.<br /><br />i guess the makers were aiming at some sort of deeper than normal complexity in this film but they just ended up with an unholy mess with more plot holes and logical inconsistencies than a dozen or so of your average crap sf movies.<br /><br />the opening credits were nice.
