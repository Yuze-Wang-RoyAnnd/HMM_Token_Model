i have seen shallow grave years ago, and *that* was one of those movies i kept in memory for a very long time. it was intense from beginning to end and with plenty of sudden twists. but all of these made sense.<br /><br />i can't tell the same about dead bodies. above the title is a subtitle that claims it to be "even better than shallow grave". this is a big lie.<br /><br />dead bodies looses strength and gets far less convincing during the movie.<br /><br />two supporting characters for example, turn out to be a whole lot less innocent than they first appeared to be. that could work as a surprise, but it didn't surprise me. i could see it coming minutes before, and *that* is a big difference with shallow grave.<br /><br />another thing i have to mention is that characters in this movie often respond not very realistic. they behave like that more often when the movie gets to it's end.<br /><br />i would have found it far more interesting if some of the characters would have stayed completely innocent, not knowing what is going on. it would have been better for the contrast with for example tommy and his friend who have to carry a *huge* secret with them.<br /><br />but no, for some stupid reason the makers of this movie decided that all characters should show their darkest sides. it does not work in a movie like this.<br /><br />the end felt much like an open end. it left me with an unsatisfied feeling. i expected a whole lot more of it.<br /><br />at first i would have given this movie six stars because it is not entirely a bad movie. i liked watching it. most of the time.<br /><br />but occasionally i saw some really poor acting and unrealistic scenes and because of the disappointing open end, i stick to four stars this time. and because it turned out to be a mistake that i have spend my time and money to it. unlike shallow grave, i will probably forget dead bodies very soon. it is just not such a special movie.<br /><br />the makers could have done a far better job with this movie. it is a shame that they did not.
