gritty drama? emotionally powerful? blah! the bbc has lost out big time to masterful productions such as the wire, sopranos and carnivale from hbo. okay, so the budget may be a lot smaller but 'the street' last night was badly acted, predictable, unrealistic, stereotypical, insensitive and a big fat waste of time. tv (british tv) is not as good as it used to be and is falling further and further behind the american productions.<br /><br />there was no sense of brutal violence from the 'local gangster'. there was no indication that this man was 'insane' enough to beat up a man he has respected for such a long time. there was no remorse when he did it and this shouldn't be the sort of character that would back down when bob hoskins called his son a pansy, in a display of 'bravery'.<br /><br />i wish i was more eloquent to express my disdain for this show, but i am not and although i can't prove my point well enough, believe me when i say that this was rubbish, shock tv, that provides no real inward looking perspective on life.<br /><br />1/5 stars.
