larry clark is not renowned for his talents as a writer or a director, but he has made some undeniably important films. kids, bully, and to a lesser extent ken park all achieve their intended purpose: shock, revulsion, and even disgust. these films are uncompromising in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth. kids exposed us to the proliferation of a.i.d.s. and sexual promiscuity among the young. bully touched upon similar issues. ken park dealt somewhat ham-handedly with sexual abuse and suburban ennui. irrefutably, all of these films exposed something horrifying and left a bad taste in your mouth.<br /><br />wassup rockers is about a group of poor hispanic skateboarders from south-central las angeles who go to arbitrarily go to beverly hills to skate. that's it.<br /><br />wassup rockers is nothing.<br /><br />it has no substance. it has an essentially nonexistent narrative. and, like kids, it features a cast of first-time actors who were drawn out of the films setting. however, unlike kids, none of them have any semblance of talent. there is better acting in porn. this film features, without a doubt, the most terrible performances i've ever seen in a feature film. one can respect larry clark to exposing these young men to the film-making process, but these kids are absolutely cringe-worthy, folks. might i add that apparently these gents also produced the soundtrack, which features some of the most dismally inept garage punk you'll ever hear- my advice is to pop a couple of migraine pills before you enter the theater, or you'll regret it afterward.<br /><br />but then again, it's not like they had much of a script to work with. every line that is uttered is a contrived, pathetically-delivered, and irritating beyond all measure. the story itself is ludicrous. it starts out reasonably enough, but soon slips quite unexpectedly into sheer absurdity. this begins of course with a capricious sexcapade with a pair of rich white girls, followed by a series of clich'ed national lampoonish encounters, characters being killed off for no reason, and finally resulting in a ridiculous anti-climax. shots go on much longer than they need to. be prepared to watch people fall of skateboards for about fifteen minutes straight, overlong, lingering shots of characters doing nothing or skateboarding down streets. but then again, with the script at a scant 32 pages they need as much useless filler as possible. perhaps wassup rockers would have worked better as a short film.<br /><br />anyways, i could go on like this. this is the worst film larry clark has made yet. for those of you who are interested in seeing a clark movie if only for his shocking pederast antics, look elsewhere. this is by far the tamest film he's made yet, and it's also the worst. it's flat out horrible. like, uwe boll horrible. definitely the worst one i saw at the festival.<br /><br />1/10
