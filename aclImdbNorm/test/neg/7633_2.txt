rebecca de mornay can be a fascinating beautiful actress but as for the parts she's given to play,if you cannot say something nice...<br /><br />de mornay portrays a woman who had terrible traumas as a child with a father she can hardly stand now that she's a grown up and has become a -of course brilliant- shrink.she has an affair with banderas ,whom we suspect of being (ouch!how original!) a serial killer.sometimes she recalls banderas's mother-in-law tippi hedren's character in "marnie" .but i wouldn't count on it:hitchcock died twenty-four years ago ,and a lot of regents desperately try to replace him .here the director pulls out all the stops to make a thriller with an unexpected end,but that ending is so far-fetched it is absolutely impossible to buy it.the movie includes the obligatory "conversations with a serial killer" in the "silence of the lamb" tradition,murders (human beings and cats),split personality,and open ending in case the crowds should call for more.apparently they did not,and they were right.
