i am a longtime fan of the original of this movie (bella martha/mostly martha), and everything that makes that movie great and enjoyable to watch is missing from this one. i miss the slow pace, the build-up of characters and their style in small gestures, the dominance of lights and moods and moves over dialog. i don't think that the story itself is enough. martha/kate is more secluded, and mario/nick is not a clown. in most of the cases the things that makes one scene great in the original, its is not working in its copy here. the small alterations take away the tension. my opinion is that you should go and see the original. it'll worth the inconvenience of subtitles.
