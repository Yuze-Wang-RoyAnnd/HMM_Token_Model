this film was just on two nights running on itv1.. dear oh dear. someone actually bought this on the strength of robert carlylse.. ok, i missed the start.. but what i did see was so bad i thought, no... i watched in embarrassment for the stars who were in it. nothing was based on reality, i doubt things would progress as they did in this film. everything was poor about this film. ok, cgi.. but no reality. the write up gave the impression of a cliff hanger end..sorry, i wasn't impressed. yes, formulaic. couldn't guess the end. from what i saw the military had the upper hand, people doing the heroic stuff were given next to no time to do their thing, it just wouldn't have happened that way? it was worse than leave your brain at the door. it was annoying.. as someone else said.. yeah, right.. of course that would have happened... not!! the credits mentioned quebec and canada.. so it was a co production, missed the third party concerned.. i'll have to check back on this site. i'm not usually this critical, but this annoyed me.
