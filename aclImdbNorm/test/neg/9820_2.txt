i am assuming that the rave reviews on this page were from people who have never read the book - unfortunately for those of us who love the text, hollywood outdid itself on destroying this one.<br /><br />i am not sure where on earth the woman love-interest came from, except that she replaced the cat, nor why our rogue male acquired a helpful family back in blighty - in fact the vast majority of the book has been cut out and replaced with your standard cruddy love story. the ambiguity about which world leader was in his sights was removed completely and our rogue was given a name (neither of these appeared until the second book).<br /><br />i gave it a 2 rather than a 1 simply because of the wonderfully bad cockney accents. joan bennett outdoes dick van dyke in mary poppins by miles and this goes a tiny way towards saving it.<br /><br />ah well - brits should probably avoid this. trust me :)
