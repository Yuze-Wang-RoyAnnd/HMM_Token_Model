i am the sort of person who never, ever watches animated movies, but i make an exception for thumbelina and the swan princess. being absolutely in love with the first installment of the series, i bought this and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind, determined to love it because i'd spent money buying it. i finished the movie, and all i can think is the horror!!! i wanted to like it, i really did. i tried very, very hard to like it. but i couldn't enjoy a second of this grueling film. the songs made me feel like ripping my ears out of my head. the dialogue was so lame i felt myself twitching with frustration and irritation every time someone opened his or her mouth. the villain was laughable and i felt myself wanting derek and odette to die in the end... and i was absolutely in love with them from the first film.<br /><br />i am going to try repress the memory of this movie, because it almost destroyed the first one for me. there is one song in the movie in which there are a series of flashbacks to the first film. the difference in animation between the two is made very obvious, and i began yearning for the first one and wishing i'd never set eyes on the third.<br /><br />do yourself and favor and don't waste your time.
