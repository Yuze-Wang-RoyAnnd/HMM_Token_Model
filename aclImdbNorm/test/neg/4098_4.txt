although i enjoy steve carrell's work, evan the almighty, like so many other overdone films turned out to be a lot worse than i hoped it would be.<br /><br />this turned out to be a cheesy family movie, the kind that employ famous comedian to improve their image, but ultimately fail to deliver.<br /><br />the usual carell's dorky humour is almost absent from the movie and though he did make me chuckle a few times, there was nothing hilarious about him in evan the almighty.<br /><br />his 3 kids, although were probably somehow important for a biblical character, were really quite useless in the movie and terrible actors. even his wife, was somewhat of a third leg for such a simple storyline.<br /><br />spending so much money on making a comedy was a huge mistake. although, carell's career might profit from this movie, there's no real reason to go see it.<br /><br />if only there was a little less of his family, a little more of carell, molly shannon and maybe some other snl cast, it could have actually been a lot more entertaining.<br /><br />4/10 for a few chuckles here and there.
