"carlito's angels" is a spoof of "charlie's angels" that is not afraid to spoof even itself at times, however that does not mean that the film is above criticism by the viewers as well - it is amateurish and juvenile (i think "fast-motion" stopped being funny around 1914). the assaulting rap music often drowns out the dialogue, and the film feels longer than it is, even though it runs barely over an hour! the girls themselves are hot & adorable, with wonderful lean bodies, and even though they never get naked, their outfits leave little to the imagination. by checking out their imdb pages, i found out that one of them (alessandra ramos) is actually going through with a film career; i wish her luck, because although this film is bad, she (as well as the other girls) gave it whatever energy it has and i wouldn't mind at all seeing her again on the screen.
