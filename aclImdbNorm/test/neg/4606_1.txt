the idea behind this movie was great. the story of a little girl facing abuse (both emotional and physical) and trying to deal with it and survive. what makes the movie fall apart is the terrible use of voice overs and the corny dialog. the actors have to point out the most obvious things over and over again. also, there is very tedious, almost funny, overuse of metaphors in the voice overs. the high point is the acting of the little girl. nice try, but this one's a stinker.
