j carol nash and ralph morgan star in a movie about a mad scientist in love with a pianist's daughter. when his advances are spurned he injects the father with a disfiguring disease so that she will be forced to come to him to get a cure.<br /><br />god this is awful.its dull and boring and you'll nod off before the pianist gets uglified, i was on the verge. yea it picks up once things are set in motion but this is one of those old movies better remembered then seen again.<br /><br />if you must see it come in late<br /><br />4 out of 10
