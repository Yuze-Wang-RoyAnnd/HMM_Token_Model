this movie is awful. if you're considering to see this movie... two words do not. it's tasteless, the storyline is really lame, and the jokes are even worse. the acting is really pathetic. i can't believe that this movie was made. rather watch american pie, going greek or road trip if you're in the mood for a teen comedy. it's about two girls who head for malibu on their spring break. as usual they didn't do much planning and called (i think her names michelle)'s uncle to crash at his malibu mansion. uncle bennie strictly forbids them of having any kind of party, and as you would of guessed, they go ahead and do it. please, i urge you, do not see this movie.
