because they all just watch there mst3k with their artificial friends who make (mostly) not that funny and obvious comments about movies. and that's the only way these people watch them and then they comment and down-vote them on the imdb based just on that, they don't even try to watch the film on it's own.<br /><br />i watched this film on it's own, i didn't read the reviews first, i didn't have some people telling what to laugh at, i just got the dvd (bought for the flip side morons from outer space, an old fave) and watched it.<br /><br />of cause i knew kind of what i was in for when it's a golan globus, albert pyun film, but usually they can be quite entertaining.<br /><br />the film is a non too stressing on the brain alice down the rabbit-hole story done so many times, and kind of similar in basic structure (but completely different in content) to warlords of atlantis, another entertaining b-movie.<br /><br />the voice, was annoying, but then that's the idea, which they even poke at with a few lines in the movie.<br /><br />the hero character had one of the worst over-the top voices/accents in english language film history, but you grow to accept it and enjoy it.<br /><br />it's not a good film, but it's not a really bad film, it's just a bit of an average b-movie dtv kind of film, nothing too new nothing too outstanding, and probably would be enjoyed more by a younger age bracket (say 7-14 year olds) than i. it's a bit of light-hearted fantasy.<br /><br />will i see it again, probably not maybe about 10 years ago i would have.<br /><br />don't be so harsh on a movie because a couple of puppets told you too, this film isn't taking itself seriously and it's certainly no troll 2 or space mutiny.
