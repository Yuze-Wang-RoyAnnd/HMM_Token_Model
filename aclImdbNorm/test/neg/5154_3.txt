my mother took me to this movie at the drive-in when i was around seven years old, which is thirty years ago. she had no idea a family movie would be so violent. my clearest memory was of the boy's father's face of pain as he was stabbed in the stomach and killed. this image haunted me for weeks. i had learned that i lived in a world where a person might stab my father at anytime. how could i stop them? how could my father protect himself? you must realise that this stabbing is not fantasy to a seven-year old. it is as real as witnessing an actual event, and has no place in a child's innocent mind. it is sad that we still do not understand the impact that bringing violence into the lives of our children has both on our children and our society. if only parents would protect their children from images of violence with the same vigor that they protect them from images of nudity and sex.
