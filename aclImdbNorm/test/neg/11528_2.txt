what a clunker!<br /><br />it must have been made for tv or cable.<br /><br />look: forget the screenplay - forget the bunch of forgettable actors. excuse me? continuity? the nsa/nia/whatever or whoever he is (an agent) takes-off in an f16 - is shown in an f18 chucking his guts up and, later, the aircraft shown taxiing is an f4 phantom! oooh, wish that i could be so cavalier.<br /><br />apart from the male actors(!?) the women are wasps: blue-eyed and long-legged and, eventually, get to cry about the heroes who save them. even when a solid weld could save most of the cosmo- astro-nauts, the blond drops the welding tool. duh!<br /><br />as an sf movie one out of ten. as a movie per se: 1/2 (that's a half point). they should have ditched the space station and headed for mars.<br /><br />major raspberries.
