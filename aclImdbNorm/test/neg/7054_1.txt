my brother was working at a movie theater when i saw this movie; i saw it for free and still walked out. i have seen a lot of movies in my time but this was the worst. when people ask me what the worst movie i have ever seen was i mention this movie in less than one second. this movie is bad because it goes from one lame plot set-up to the next, it encourages stereotypes about blacks that are sickening and the flow is awful. if you want to see how to make children cry and vomit at the same time then study this movie. okay, this movie is not good "bad" but terrible bad. if you are like one of those people that watch horrible movies for fun, like me, you will not even be able to make it through this very short film. please for the love of god destroy all copies of this movie.
