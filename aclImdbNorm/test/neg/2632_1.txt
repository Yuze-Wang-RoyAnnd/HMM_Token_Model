this movie sucked sooo bad, i couldn't even watch the ending. milo's voice was too low and i couldn't understand what he said as well as some of kendra's lines. also, where did he get all these wedding dresses from; it was very impractical. the movie failed to elaborate on milo's drowning and how it made people ridicule dr. jeter and his practice. overall, i was disappointed that i was unable to give this movie a rating of zero because by grading this movie as a one, i felt i was giving it undeserved praise.
