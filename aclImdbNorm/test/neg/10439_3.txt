in the mid 1800s, irishman dennis hopper (as daniel morgan) emigrates to australia, seeking a share of the continent's gold. instead, mr. hopper finds himself branded, and thrown in a torturous prison; there, he is gang-raped. upon release, hopper hooks up with aborigine david gulpilil (as billy), with whom he seeks revenge upon sadistic bill hunter (as sergeant smith), jack thompson (as detective mainwaring), and others. eventually, vengeance becomes heroism; hopper is admired and assisted by the common people, and hunted by corrupt and powerful authorities. hopper's "scarcely human" performance certainly fits the disjointed feel of the film. mr. gulpilil heads up a strong supporting cast. the personnel involved in "mad dog morgan" make it not only worth a look, but also a huge disappointment. <br /><br />*** mad dog morgan (1976) philippe mora ~ dennis hopper, david gulpilil, bill hunter
