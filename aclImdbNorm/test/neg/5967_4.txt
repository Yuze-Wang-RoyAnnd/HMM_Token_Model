i saw the movie in original italian. it must be said that the acting and interpretation is most heavily polluted by the tv-generated trend to speak in a severely muffled voice, not moving lips, straining tones, as emerged in the "that's real life"-productions and "let's-raise-our audience-with-a-few-tears"-screen-playwriting. the late massimo girotti towers upon the other characters for intensity, clarity of expression and intellectual honesty. the movie has some good hints, but (as in another comment before mine) it lacks a focal point and dribbles away in many plot-lets of lesser and lesser relevance, another trend dragged in from the tv productions, well known to italians. a few drops in style could be spared to the public, such as the patisserie drag (charm and aesthetics of cooking plus sensual payload of sweets, see chocolat, babette's lunch, vatel etc.) hammam and the fairies are definitely more truthful, seems that ozpetek has learned the tune of italy in the early 2000s and is humming along... i'll give him a last chance though...
