i disagree 100% with the reviewer who disagreed 100% with the reviewer who gave this short movie an "f" grade. cashing in heavily on political propaganda only obscures joe dante's lack of ability to pull another howling out of his bag of tricks. the masters of horror series was a phenomenal collection of truly horrifying tales, save for this episode.<br /><br />despite gaining acclaim from those who wish to promote it's political slant, "homecoming" is the least effective episode of moh season one. unlike the rest of the series, dante's entry is a parody of the genre, falling short of both horror and humor in it's ham-fisted delivery of a hackneyed political point.<br /><br />dante can really only be blamed for pulling this stinker off the shelf, as it wasn't his creation. the zombie sub-genre is very popular this decade, and among the crop of predictable george romero tributes and vacuous fantasies are a number of works designed to push political or (ir)religeous messages. such works are not written by or intended for true horror fans. maybe dante really isn't a a master of horror, either. what has he been up to since the howling, after all?<br /><br />if you want a lame anti-war zombie flick with a few pop culture references passed off as humor, homecoming may be just your thing. if you are a horror fan looking for something masterful, pick up... most any other episode of the series. my personal favorite was dario argento's "jenifer," based loosely on a classic comic short by the team of bruce jones and berni wrightson -- truly creepy.
