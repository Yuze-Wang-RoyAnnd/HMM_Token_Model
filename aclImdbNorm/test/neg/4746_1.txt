if only i had read the review by alex sander (sic) on here rather than looking at the rating of over 6 from a select choice of the ignorant viewing public i would not have seen this desecration. alien was a fantastic, dramatic and well made horror/sci-fi. predator was a great sci-fi/action mess-about. i do really have only myself to blame though as i saw 'alien versus predator'. it too has an average grading of over 6 stars from the connoisseurs of film that frequent this site.<br /><br />stop reading now if you have any fear of this ever so suspense ridden plot being ruined for you.<br /><br />right from the beginning this film was ridiculous. no explanation was offered for the predator ship overrun/not overrun by aliens. ok so maybe they were again going to throw aliens down to earth to hunt them and something went wrong but how did this result in an alien/predator hybrid and why did the rest of the crew not realise sooner despite their great technology? the start was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had some idea of who was who or what was what and perhaps why. from then on it gets really ridiculous. i always leave my disbelief strictly suspended above the door of the screen before entering and collect it on the way out. i couldn't here.<br /><br />a father and son are hunting in the woods. the damaged ship crash lands to (from the view given) i would calculate at the very least 10 odd miles away through thick woodland. the man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get face hugged. even at this point you feel very little for them mainly because the face huggers are almost comical rather than scary in their movement and actions and the father seems like such an irresponsible, dumb redneck muppet.<br /><br />an edgy, thriller-type scenario is introduced with an ex-con returning to the town near the crash site to be met by his somewhat emotionless, dull now cop friend from the bus. when i say introduced i mean a feeble attempt with crap actors and no feeling is played out. a slasher/horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or somehow undesirable cute guy who gets beaten up by the over protective, crazy, nasty jock type (american sportsman not a scottish man). oh the cute/not cute boy is the ex-con's brother by the way. yes they're clever these director brothers whose name i will research in order to avoid any other shite they put out again. then a modern role reversal oh so boring attempt at pc, ripley credential type character introduction comes with a female soldier returning home to her husband and child.<br /><br />guess what happens next? i won't tell you much more about the actual (smiles sadly to himself about the demise of storytelling in the large majority of recent films) plot just in case you have got this far and are not the brightest star in the alien-ridden universe.<br /><br />the predator is stupid for the reasons stated by the previous poster whose post i read too late. the aliens are boring. the predator-alien is ridiculous. the action is at times exploitative, gratuitous, disgusting nonsense. the hospital scene with the pregnant mothers?!?! oh i was shocked alright. shocked at how low some people will go to get what? a scare? some shock? to titillate the perverse? what? if you really wanted to shock, titillate and scare people who are not pregnant or expecting fathers or who have no souls why not just have the alien/predator shagging the saucy women and teenage girls rather than killing them? the characters have no depth and neither does the plot. it's filmed and paced badly. it's acted by disinterested people not that i can blame them. it further tarnishes two rather interesting and good sets of sci-fi characters. this film was rubbish and if you gain enjoyment from it i really have to worry about you. if you haven't seen it then well please make your own decision.<br /><br />ps did i even mention the way that trained soldiers are all killed in about 20 seconds while amateur civilians survive throughout?
