the film begins in latvia just after wwi. being a history teacher, i knew that multinational troops occupied much of russia during this time. there was serious concern about the spread of bolshevism and the troops were there ostensibly to protect their nations' interests. however, some times they flew missions or had armed conflicts with the communist army, as the nations involved really wanted to see the so-called "whites" win. however, the whites were deeply factionalized--some wanting the return of a czar, some wanting a republic and some wanting something in between. because of these mixed goals and a lack of a real commitment by the foreign armies, the whole expedition was doomed and left the ussr after only a year or two. however, what i did not know was that german troops were also involved. this surprised me, as they had just lost wwi and weren't in the best shape to be mounting such an expedition.<br /><br />this is the backdrop for the film, but it's also about a pro-communist rich lady and her ill-fated love for a childhood friend who is among the german troops. she throws herself at him repeatedly but in each case he rebuffs her. so, she then sublimates these desires by various affairs. while none of this sex is all that graphic, this and the underlying reason the man isn't interested make this a rather adult film and one i wouldn't show to younger audiences.<br /><br />while the setting for this film is interesting, the overall film is as gray and lifeless as any i have seen. i don't recommend it unless you are an amazingly patient person or you are really into overrated german films. i especially warn away anyone who suffers with depression, as it will no doubt make it worse. the simple fact is that there are so many better german films out there waiting to be seen--such as mostly martha, das boot, mother kusters goes to heaven, wings of desire or ali, fear eats the soul (among others).
