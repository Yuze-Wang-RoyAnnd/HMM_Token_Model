in spite of its high-minded ambitions, zurlini's film must be seen as a failure. it's one thing to create a world which draws the viewer into feeling the tedium and angst experienced by the protagonist (which i think is what zurlini was attempting). it's another thing entirely to make a film that is itself tedious and meaninglessly episodic. despite beautiful cinematography at a haunting location - and a wonderful score - the film never lures the audience in. too much is unintentionally funny (the phony sound of dripping water in drago's quarters, for example, or the silent-movie mugging by some of the actors) or simply confusing (why exactly does drago want to leave the fort the first time?) for the film to succeed as a coherent work.
