this movie started out cringe-worthy--but it was meant to, with an overbearing mother, a witch of a rival, and a hesitant beauty queen constantly coming in second. there was some goofy overacting, and a few implausible plot points (she comes in second in every single competition? all of them?) unfortunately, the movie suffers horribly from it's need to, well, be a tv movie. rather than end at the ending of the movie, an amusing twist in which the killer is (semi-plausibly) revealed, the movie continues for another twenty minutes, just to make sure that justice is done. of course, now that the killer is revealed, she suddenly undergoes a complete personality shift--her character gets completely rewritten, because the writers don't need to keep her identity secret any more. the cheese completely sinks what otherwise could have been a passably amusing movie.
