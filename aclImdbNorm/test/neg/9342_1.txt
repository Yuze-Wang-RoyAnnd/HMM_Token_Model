i'll not comment a lot, what's to??? stereotype characters, absolute ignorance about colombia's reality, awful mise en scene, poor color choice, not funny (it supposed to be a comedy and they expect that you will laugh because some distend music it's beside the nonsense scenes), very poor actors direction (if you see somewhere those people, i mean the interpreters, you'll know they are at least good, but seeing this so call film, it is impossible to guess it), you get tired of the music... this "comedy" has no rhythm, the only good rhythm in it, it's the rap sing in the final credits....pathetic, doesn't it? etc...etc... it has been a long time i haven't seen a movie so bad!!
