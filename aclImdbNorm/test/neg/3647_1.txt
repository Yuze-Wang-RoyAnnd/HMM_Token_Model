just do a little research on the making of this film. something so simple as a google search. it was funded by the us army and promoted just in time for the elections. it is a great idea, but i'd much rather see a documentary, not something edited by the bush administration and told its reality. the timing of the movie's release, its tone, and the fact that ms&l promoted it, raised questions about the intent of the movie. "according to ms&l managing director joe gleason, he and his colleagues also deliver key targeted messages about the war in iraq to specific constituencies," wrote eartha melzer. "was the left-leaning art house crowd one of those constituencies? is the government hiring documentary filmmakers to propagandize the u.s. population? nobody involved with the film is willing to say who initially put up the money for the film or how they ended up represented by the army's pr firm."
