it's hard to write 10 lines of copy about this so-so film noir. there just isn't a lot to say about it. it is not memorable enough to add to your collection, and i have a considerable amount of noirs.<br /><br />paul henreid plays a tough guy in here. he's not one i would think of to play this kind of role, but he's fine with it. he's a fine actor, anyway.<br /><br />everything, including the cinematography, is okay-but-not memorable. one thing that stood out: the abrupt ending. that was a surprise. it was also a surprise to see this under the heading "hollow triumph." i've never seen the film called that. it's always been called "scar."<br /><br />if you read about a "tense film noir," etc., don't believe it. "tense" is not an accurate adjective for this film.
