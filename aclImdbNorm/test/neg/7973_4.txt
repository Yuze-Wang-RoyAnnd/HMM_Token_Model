when kristy swanson gets an attack of the guilts about what she does, she wants out. unfortunately, madsen is her immediate superior in a company where "giving two weeks notice ain't an option."<br /><br />as a teen killing vampires, kristy did a very good job. the valley girl image seemed to fit. but as an assassin on the run...well, keep running kristy. run, run far away! this film is not a concept that hasn't been done before, but it has been done better!<br /><br />i didn't want to watch the rest of this film, but i felt i should if i wanted to give a review of this movie. i've always liked madsen, and his character was a bit predictable, but this movie was definitely a waste of time both to watch and make...no wonder it never got released theatrically!
