thomas vinterbergs "de storste helte" is yet another road movie without the most important element of a film: a good story. the characters are not very original and not particularly interesting. especially thomas bo larsen is a pain in the neck, playing the same role he has played in the past few years and which he repeated in "festen" - it seems as if he thinks acting = being angry and screaming at other people! the film doesn't make much too sense and isn't very funny either - although it tries hard to be "kooky" and "weird". if you're going to make a road movie, why not add something original to the genre?!
