dear mr ram gopal varma, i don't know in which capacity i am writing this letter to you. i am a never-say-he's-finished amitabh bachchan fan, having sat through his cock-chasing act in jaadugar. i also demand some important designation in the godfather fan club, having watched the coppola classic more times than you have delivered flops from your factory. and, of course, i have been a big admirer of yours, right from the time you had nagarjuna wrapping the cycle chain around his knuckles in shiva.<br /><br />when you announced sarkar and called it your take on godfather, all one wanted to know was the date the first look would be out, the sunday the promos would go on air, the friday the film would be released. it was sheer wish fulfillment at work knowing that you, and not someone hovering between the mustard fields of amritsar and the tulip gardens of amsterdam, had taken up the task of recreating the puzo pages on the bollywood big screen.<br /><br />your cast couldn't have been more you
