sorry, after watching the credits, i thought this would at least be a decent homage to retiring sf actors.<br /><br />boy was i wrong.<br /><br />the direction and story telling in this pos are terrible. i have never been so insulted by a production.<br /><br />i have great respect and love for many of the actors in this "film" but have to say they were conned.<br /><br />if you haven't seen this debacle yet, do yourself a favor and stay away. these are not only two hours you won't get back, but they will also ruin your respect for some actors you may once have enjoyed.
