fred williamson, one of the two or three top blaxploitation stars. cynthia rothrock, one of the two or three top american female action stars. imagine a film with these two together for the first time! now imagine the worst film that could possibly be made with these two together for the first time. welcome to "night vision". of course, this movie was made in 1997 and they were both past their prime, but that doesn't mean they didn't have what it takes anymore - they just needed the help of good writing and direction. they got neither here. rothrock does get to throw a couple of kicks near the end, but this film is so atrocious that you probably won't be awake to see them.
