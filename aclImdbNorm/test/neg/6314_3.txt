spoilers abound. you have been warned.<br /><br />i was thoroughly disappointed, this being my first street fighter movie i have seen (i dare not go near the 1994 joke yet). very little grabs your attention in street fighter zero (alpha) as opposed to most japanimation. the fights are hilariously done over board (shun versus zangief was a laugher) and the dramatization is far too moody especially toward the end when ryu has to control everything in his fight against his brother.<br /><br />the main street fighter, ryu, has been weakening to a far darker version inside of himself. frustrations in controlling this darkness are further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother! a shady street fighting tournament is held with more than just fighting on the promoter 's mind.<br /><br />what is with the artist 's drawing of feet? any anime drawn above the stomach is impressive. the story 's soft nature makes the street fighter genre far too intelligent, and places far more emphasis on a character (shun), that is not even a fighter in the video game! a character study on more than just the core stars of the original street fighter is completely ignored. how many times did you catch rolento? adon? guy? street fighter zero lacks the imagination of the video game.
