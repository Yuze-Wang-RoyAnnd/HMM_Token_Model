this show is perhaps one of the most boring, most unfunny shows i've ever seen. while the humour was subtle, and i'm all for the subtle humour; the jokes just weren't funny.<br /><br />the show is about two kiwis in their mid-thirties living in new york trying to start their music careers.<br /><br />i saw the one episode where brett leaves the other kiwi behind during a mugging. okay, the plot idea has potential; but i got the feeling that half the episode was just filler, and the other half was actually important to the story.<br /><br />what i mean is, they kept on explaining how the one who was left behind felt betrayed and had a lot of mistrust for the other guy. i've got one piece of advice for the writers: mention it once for the idiots who can't figure it out by the way he's acting, and move on.<br /><br />and i found the characters were annoying. the character who left the other behind, brett, came across as being overly innocent and naive, the one left behind walked around talking in this monotone and robotic voice.<br /><br />a third character, who was the band manager, was obviously incompetent, but he was the one character that i liked. he's also the one that earned the show a one-star rating.<br /><br />all in all, a show i have no intention of ever watching again.
