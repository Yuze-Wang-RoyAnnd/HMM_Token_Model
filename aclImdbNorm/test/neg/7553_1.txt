no wonder so many young people have attention deficit disorder. it seems that stage (dance) productions these days are all about how many cameras and camera angles a director/ editor can squeeze into a 1 hour show. is there a special emmy category for this feat? try counting them sometimes for something different to do with this, otherwise, completely unwatchable show. <br /><br />i tried to make out at least a few faces of some of the other dancers in the production. that was impossible. they didn't appear to have any faces, just blurs - it was just michael flatley's face, michael flatley's bare chest(nice sheen!), michael flatley's feet, and that patented flatley over-the-shoulder-come-hither look repeated infinity squared. since he was an executive producer of this cut and paste job i guess that was to be expected. one doesn't have to wonder too much as to who his target audience is. <br /><br />riverdance was a much better production, as it tried to present the show pretty much as one might see it from the audience, not the catwalk,side wings, or floor nail perspective. if i'm not mistaken,i believe sir michael has retired. thank god for small blessings.
