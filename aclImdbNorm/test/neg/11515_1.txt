i literally ran to watch it, expecting a film that will make me cry, or touch my heart.<br /><br />what i found was not heart-rending, but a lame exploitation of 1 strong human character.<br /><br />interwined between a pair of young lesbians and an obese man.<br /><br />in a setting that is substantially devoid of sound not to mention acting of the most common.<br /><br />it was not entirely bad, as i have seen worst - and i left the cinema $10 poorer but wiser - that a film well advertised is not the same as a film well-made.
