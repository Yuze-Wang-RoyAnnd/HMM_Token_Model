charles bronson has given the viewers lots of great moments on the screen. but this movie lacks everything that a thriller/action-movie should have. there are a few action scenes in the movie, but they're really crappy. and when the action scenes fail, does the story save the film? not at all, is my answer to that. the story is even worse than the action scenes. it's very straightforward and boring, and even though i'm a big movie fan, i almost fell asleep several times. i don't know how they came up with a failure like this. a low budget, maybe? regardless of that, it looked like all the actors had no interest in being in the movie at all. when that happens, the result is really bad.
