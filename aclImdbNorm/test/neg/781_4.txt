this is a flic that you can safely avoid. childish plot and poor acting from cameron (she really shouldn't take on these serious roles - they don't suit her)besides she looks most unglamorous, lets face it, shes' great in charlies angels and she was superb in there's something about mary... the pope wouldn't be a good president of the usa and vice versa, my point being that there are some actors/actresses who are suited to a particular type of character and cameron is most unsuited for this serious housewife type - there are a dozen other actress' would have done a far better job. the movie itself is rather unbelievable and juvenile in its plot (did i spell juvinile right??) i noticed a comment from another reviewer who has given the box a 10 rating, who was derisive in his comments on other reviewers who gave the movie a 1 or 2 rating and couldn't spell. i mean whats spelling got to do with a movie review? does he mean that persons who spell perfectly could appreciate this movie more that the ones who couldn't? c'mon 'professor.
