my review is divided into questions that you really should ask yourself: <br /><br />1. plants eating people have been done hundreds of times. it's been used by nintendo in everything from mario to zelda to metroid prime. it's been used in plenty of low-budget 50's movies, on par with the lowest of the godzilla franchise. and this brings it to a whole another level of cheese with plants that talk. i've known no one who walked out, but i know a lot of people who absolutely broke out in hysteric laughing during parts of this movie. i was one of them. doesn't the horror genre deserve something a little better than this pile of laughable crap? <br /><br />2. the characters easily could have been copy/pasted from hostel or wrong turn or wolf creek or any other movie with collage kids with bad luck. yet it's called "characterizing" when the movie takes hours of your time to tell you clich'es that hundreds of characters before have had? don't you ever wish a movie had characters that weren't just forgettable pieces of meat with legs? <br /><br />3. this was not gory. a guy cuts his skin off. oh, my! (not.) a guy gets his legs broken. oh my! gasp! (not.) i have shown movies like this to my mother who hates everything to do with horror because it makes her sick, and she said: "i've seen pg movies worse than that! why was it rated r?" so, why was it rated r? <br /><br />4. here's the only plot the movie/book has: collage kids drink, have sex, get naked, cruse, bleed, and eventually die. this is possibly the most typical example of a cheap, thoughtless horror movie, yet people call this "mature"? what the . . .? <br /><br />5. i do not think i have ever seen something less original sense i watched a beautiful mind. <br /><br />haven't you ever sat there and wished the horror genre, easily the most diverse genre out there, would do something . . . well, diverse? something truly original?<br /><br />i just wish more horror movies would have actual horror, not just cheap collage parties put on film with a few splatters of fake blood tossed around.<br /><br />1/10
