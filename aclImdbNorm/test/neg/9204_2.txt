a spaceship in some unspecified future where human beings are equipped for space travel and have laser guns for weapons, crash lands on a strange young planet where dinosaurs are coincidentally also evolved and only on this world, have not gone extinct...yet. the survivors of the crash, roughly ten bland characters wearing blue, white, and yellow suits, fight for survival against the alien prehistoric monsters.<br /><br />"planet of the dinosaurs" is a peculiar movie. like i said in my summary above, the stop-motion animated dinosaurs in the film are the only colorful actors. the models are crude, but effectively animated. and they are much more fascinating and intriguing than these characters portrayed by inexperienced actors and speaking lines from a script that must have been written overnight without a single revision. obviously, most of the budget was put into the dinosaurs, and although there is a fair share of them, there's not nearly enough to save us from our boredom. these human characters are only there to scream, run around, and mutter these poorly-written and verbose speeches about survival. and unfortunately, not nearly enough of them get eaten by the dinosaurs.<br /><br />overall, "planet of the dinosaurs" is not a film i plan on seeing again. some people will simply love it for being so cheap and so poorly made. sometimes, i enjoy movies like this. but this particular film is just too long, too boring, and very exhausting on the mind.
