i think trash really sucks. i watched it a couple of weeks ago and i haven't seen that kind of c**p at the cinema since female trouble by john waters and that was even worse. the dialogues, the acting; it really stank, it was so bad it made me want to leave the cinema and ask for my money back. but actually i am glad i saw it, because then i could tell my honest opinion on it. one should see this film, even though it stinks.
