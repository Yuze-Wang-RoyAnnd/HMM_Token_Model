i pretty much liked every character on this show from the start except reba herself. she comes off as an holier than thou type and quite frankly a big bully. and that stinks because she is in every scene and every episode. in the later seasons van becomes unlikeable too,like a spoof of his former self. and kyra walks around sneering and being miserable.the first 3 to 4 seasons are pretty good if you overlook reba. towards the end its pretty bleak.. in basically every episode barbara jean is walking around being dumb,reba is being mean to her,but poor ole barbara jean desperately wants reba to like her which results in barabara jean telling reba how awesome she is in every episode. i think it is pretty clear to see reba has self esteem issues and wants to be seen as this all forgiving saint. its really a shame too because other than her the show had such potential.
