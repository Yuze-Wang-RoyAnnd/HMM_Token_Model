this two and a half hour long film was shown recently at carnegie mellon university (cmu) at a 10 pm show. there was a scheduled 1 am show after that, but wondered if anyone was going to stay awake to see that until 3:30 am. the opening scene is of a man walking in a field, and it lasts four minutes of movie time. it is an ominous sign of what's to come: a good 144 minutes more of pretty much the same. there is a scene of a man and a woman against a wall, standing in the sun. it is repeated 15 times, with very sparse dialogue. occasionally, these very long slow sequences are interrupted by shocking stills, such as a close up of female genitalia, shown for one full minute of film time (audience crowd laughing in the last 20 seconds, as to say, "what's the message?"). the story resembles dostoyevsky's novel "the karamazov brothers", in which a cretin falls in love with a woman of easy morals. in one of the rare instants in which the crowd was laughing (more in desperation to try to justify having been there already a full two hours to see nothing happening) was when the statement by a british tourist that he couldn't see things clearly since the eurostar train was traveling at 180 miles an hour, was translated by the translator with automatic switch of units of measure from english system to metric system to "they couldn't see things clearly since the train was traveling at 300 kilometers per hour". what was amazing about this movie is that the quality of cinematography reveals that alot of money has been spent on it. this was no film kitchen 8-mm experiment. it was carefully planned, structured, acted, montaged. yet, i got so little out of it. some comments indictated on the excruciating detail, such as the minutae of a dandling key chain on a door just opened. okay, it was noted, but what was the purpose? some corageous people in the audience walked away after the first hour. the rest remained out of curiosity: there must be something happening at the end. there never was. and maybe that's what the film is about. all the movies at the theater are action-packed. this one wants to be different. there is nothing happening.
