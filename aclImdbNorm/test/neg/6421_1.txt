good lord! this movie needs to have a new classification on its cover "watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!". i am disappointed. i was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine. but this movie didn't do it. a reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming. it was disjointed and sometimes outright silly. we had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clich'es like "i just need you to hold me" in the totally wrong places and situations. thank you for allowing me to offload and sorry if i'd offended anybody but it was a waste of time and money.
