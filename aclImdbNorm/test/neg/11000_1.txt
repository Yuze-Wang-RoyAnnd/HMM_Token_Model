this is one of the most stupid and worthless movies ever. it really does not qualify for movie status. it is very cheap (apparently shot on videotape), horribly acted, and just plain rotten. i could not believe how cheap and inept this piece of crap was. it looked like a home video! i mean i believe a guy i know a few houses down must have dug out his video camera and made this crap in 2 or 3 hours. it is that bad. i noticed the name from whence this came
