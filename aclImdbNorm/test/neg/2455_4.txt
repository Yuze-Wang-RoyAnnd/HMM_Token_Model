from 1936-1939, peter lorre made a string of highly successful mr. moto films. while technically b-films, they were much better made than typical films of the genre. however, lorre tired of making these highly repetitive films and told friends he wanted out of the series. when it was canceled in 1939, lorre was thrilled but his plans of getting more complicated and satisfying roles did not materialize when he moved to columbia pictures. island of doomed men is one of these films and it's pretty obvious the studio isn't putting much effort into the movie, as i think the plot was written by penguins. talented penguins, perhaps...but still the movie made little sense at all.<br /><br />it begins with a guy agreeing to be an undercover agent for the government. he is to infiltrate an island in the us where something strange is amiss. now they easily could have just got a search warrant to do this. but, given that penguins were writing the film, the agent takes the rap for a murder he didn't commit and spends a year in prison for this. he apparently hopes that he'll be paroled to this island, as many parolees are sent there when they finish the term.<br /><br />there are some more serious problems with this idea. first, they only have him serve a year before getting paroled--but he was convicted of murder and he refused to divulge who he really was. they would never parole anyone in a case like this. second, what if he wasn't paroled to the island? he would have spent an entire year in jail for nothing! third, why not just have scuba divers or paratroopers or cops in boats come to the island?! talk about a contrived plot! <br /><br />once on the island, the agent discovers that evil peter lorre has set up his own private prison and staffed it with guys on parole as slave labor. what about the men having to report to their parole officers? this was never explained, but lorre was using them to mine for diamonds and they were treated abominably. now, another question i had was that if lorre was discovering huge diamonds there, he was a very wealthy man. so, why not just pay people to mine for the diamonds?! why set up your own version of devil's island and savagely beat and kill the men?! <br /><br />eventually, lorre gets what's his and the island's slaves are released. unfortunately, by then, i really didn't care. overall, watchable but rather dumb. lorre's career only took a turn for the better when he moved the following year to warner brothers. with films like island of doomed men, i could see why his stay at columbia was short.
