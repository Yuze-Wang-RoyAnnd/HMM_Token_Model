this is one of those inoffensive and mildly entertaining little movies that strive to make you to like them more. but like so many others, it's material isn't strong enough to successfully fill a couple of hours.<br /><br />the pitch is promising: three drag queens drive a bus through the outback from sydney to alice springs. they run into lots of trouble - with homophobic locals, with the engine, with their pasts.<br /><br />the real trouble is with the dialogue. the leads are fine (though pearce's continual campness becomes tiresome), but the one-liners and epithets feel forced where they should be casually thrown away. characters shouldn't laugh at their own gags.<br /><br />writer/director elliott also feels the need to pile on the pleasingly incongruous shots of flamboyant drag costumes against stark desert backgrounds like so much cheap make-up. for a movie about self-confidence and just being yourself, it all seems very insecure with itself.
