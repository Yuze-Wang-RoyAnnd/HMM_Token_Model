the concept of this movie is pretty compelling: zombie children climbing out of an abandoned mine to seek revenge for their deaths in the backwoods of pennsylvania. cool. the problem i had with the movie is the lack of creativity when dealing with the zombies. the makers could have really spiced this film up with some terror-like imagery a la "the ring" such as stop action, reverse camera walking or stuff like that. when the zombie children are strolling through the woods they look like a bunch of 9 year-olds walking to a playground in west philadelphia. instead of pick axes and shovels they could have easily been carrying baseball bats and gloves. why would i fear these little kids? anyone could just run away in a straight line to safety. also, who in their right mind would have stayed one night with their children in that creepy, run-down house? the moment i opened that front door and looked around i would have said, "mm-hmm. mm-hmm. son, go start the car. i'm going around back to pee on a bush and then we're out of here." totally unbelievable movie. don't waste your time.
