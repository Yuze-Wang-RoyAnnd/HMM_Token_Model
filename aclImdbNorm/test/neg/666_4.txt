the first official release of world wrestling entertainment's film division is a pretty basic horror/slasher movie called "see no evil" starring kane, one of their big men wrestlers known for having an intimidating presence, hard-hitting moves, and one of the most convoluted backstories in wrestling. and let's not pull any punches here; while this movie is promoted as the greatest horror movie of all time (mostly by wwe), it goes without saying that after having seen this movie, i can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all time.<br /><br />"see no evil" sees a bunch of juvenile delinquents sent to a hotel so they can clean up. of course, a monstrous murderer (played by kane) also happens to be living in this hotel and we all know where that goes. without giving away too much of the movie plot, this film has all the semblance and structure of an early-1980s slasher flick with most of the clich'es intact, but without any of the scares that those films accompany. and that's sort of the main problem with "see no evil". it tries so many of the tricks implied by its predecessors in the genre that it comes off as predictable; veteran horror fans will easily recognize some of the gimmicks ahead of time and even those who have only seen a few flicks should tell what happens next. it's too generic to be scary.<br /><br />the movie's gory, no doubt, but it's only there for the effect. the dark atmosphere instilled in the movie gives off that feel of terror initially, but as you get towards the end, it somehow feels out of place and gets tiresome quickly. the death scenes don't come off as gory and horrific as much as they do laughable, although some of them are pretty inventive.<br /><br />and the acting in this movie is pretty bad too, as the main characters aren't developed enough for us to care when they eventually do get axed. some can't even portray fear properly; they just scream and cry in a vain effort to emote. so when they die, it only adds to the comedy because you don't care enough about them that you simply consider them the equivalent of starfleet redshirts to the monster kane.<br /><br />as for kane, he simply portrayed his movie character the same way he portrays his wrestling character, only he uses axes and hooks instead of hellfire and brimstone. there's no doubt in my mind that kane can be a great fixture in the horror genre. he has the look and presence for it; he just needs better material (specifically a script that isn't written by someone who writes wrestling shows) to work with.<br /><br />now, despite what may seem like a harsh review, i actually enjoyed the film. it's one of those laughably bad movies that you can't help but sit down and enjoy. my main gripe with the film, again, is that it's simply an exercise in filming gory kills and doesn't have any frightening or shock moments. i enjoyed it, but i enjoyed because it was easy for me to laugh off some of what was supposed to be scary moments in the movie. if that happens because it was supposed to be that way, the movie would have been rated higher. but it didn't. it got laughs because it's a b-movie and it doesn't help that the director's previous experiences was porn flicks and music videos; not exactly overcomplicated things to direct anyway. nonetheless, i enjoyed it tremendously.<br /><br />if you don't mind a fun b-movie or funny horror film, i'd highly recommend "see no evil." if you are a true enthusiast of the genre, i'd wait until the dvd comes out before checking it out. everyone else should probably go watch something else.
