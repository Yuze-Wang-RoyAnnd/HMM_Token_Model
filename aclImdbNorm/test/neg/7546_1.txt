wow, this film was terrible. it is as simple as that. it is actually the first time that i walked out early, as far as i can remember. this turned out okay, though: i had a very nice chat with two most charming girls while we all waited for the rest to finally give up on that crap they called a "movie".<br /><br />where to start. bad acting, bad jokes. faecal humour, which i simply cannot stand. sorry, but snot, pee and scat are *not* funny. you have seen the title picture? that scene actually drags on for about 5 minutes, with the two "heroes" hitting and mutilating each other, which is supposed to be humorous all by itself. it is not.<br /><br />apart from body fluids, violence and cross-dressing, i do not remember much about this. at least not much good. i was really, really disappointed by this piece of garbage. or let us be honest here: given that i am actually a big fan of "british" (i.e., black) humour, i was angry.<br /><br />so, want my advice? three words: do not watch.
