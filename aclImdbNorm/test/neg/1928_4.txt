..that separate good, memorable movies from movies like this. its not entertaining, touching, funny, interesting and at times feels a little sub-human. the principals act like they are other-worldly, in the worse way, when they are supposed to be relating to each other and the audience. <br /><br />starts out conventionally enough. rich kid gets new car for graduation but the dean says he can't have the car until after the ceremony. goes joy-riding nonetheless, and stops in the diner on the wrong side of the tracks for a quick argument with the local yokels. wise-asses the waitress/girlfriend of the head yokel. shockingly, they play chicken until they accidentally burn down the diner they left three minutes earlier (aren't all diners five feet from the gas station?).<br /><br />they told they have to pay the price in court, so the only reason to get this 'fish out of water' to stay in town is to come up with the scenario that both boys have to assist in the rebuilding of the diner. worse than that, the rich kid in staying with the family of the un-rich kid..in the room above the attic. that 'room above the attic' has rescued many a person in need of a bed..<br /><br />rich kid inexplicably is treated well by the girlfriend, who never mentions to him that he nearly killed her. this does not bode well, of course, with her boyfriend, and is never fully explained. you don't know why sam (leelee sobieski) falls for kelley (chris klein), or why jasper (josh hartnett) allows it. <br /><br />chris klein is tolerable, leelee completely intolerable, and josh does not register much of an impression. the character with the most life is the judge that sentences kelley and jasper to help re-build the diner. she gets off at least one funny remark, which is more than anyone else does. everyone is so morose and humorless that you will feel a little sill if you even think of smiling while the movie is on. <br /><br />the ending is one way to end the piece, not the most original, but at least it was over. i don't enjoy trashing a movie that some little girl somewhere in the world might really love, but since i am not one, i have to. the nicest thing i can say about this movie is that its not mean-spirited, and although it fails to compel, its innocence and home-spun, corny dialogue comes from a nice place. 4/10.
