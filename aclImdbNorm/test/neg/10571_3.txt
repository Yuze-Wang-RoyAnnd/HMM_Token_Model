this movie is funny if you're the gentleman who was sitting about three rows behind me (repeating every punchline, laughing when there were no gags on-screen, and issuing a gravelly "haaaa" at every scene involving a computer or mobile device).<br /><br />for everyone else, it's a mean-spirited, bungled "comedy." the movie strictly follows the formula of the later "scary movie" films, as well as "epic movie" and "meet the spartans," though without the flood of heartless pop culture references that made the latter two so irritating. still, the lampooning of intellectual and peacemaking figures the world over makes it clear that the film knows its audience: people who envy brainpower. "superhero movie" is particularly and consistently nasty to stephen hawking, introducing him as a sex-starved druggie and using his disability as a vehicle for slapstick.<br /><br />the plot is based on "spider-man," with "batman begins" and "x-men" thrown in just to deliver some physical comedy. much of the movie is slapstick, but not in any invigorating or interesting way. the longest-running gag is a fart joke, and early on the scriptwriters seem to believe that having the main character get thrown in conspicuous piles of fake animal poo automatically enlivens an otherwise uninspired rehash of the spider bite scene from "spider-man." perhaps the only redeeming feature of this feature is the energy in it, notably absent in other recent parodies. the filmmakers act as though they're doing something new, and the audience can feel the influence in the way the actors bounce around the screen. an extremely abbreviated length (about an hour and fifteen minutes) and the zest of the presentation makes "superhero movie" tolerable rather than horrifying.
