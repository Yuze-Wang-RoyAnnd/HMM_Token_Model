i really wanted to like this film, especially after all the buzz i'd heard revolving around it. but, sadly, it just didn't work for me. paranoid park suffers from the same delusion lost in translation did--if you use very little dialogue, be heavy on the slow motion close ups and concentrate on pieces of fabric in the setting, then your story will magically come across as deep and thoughtful. <br /><br />much of the plot line, if you can find a plot, of this film is contrived. i wasn't impressed with the 'write it all down' confessional being the way the protagonist deals with the accident--so what are we supposed to believe? he grew up happily ever after and wrote a book about his experiences, thus was vindicated for that horrific incident?<br /><br />what is, i suspect, supposed to be a film that evokes empathy for a young man who is directionless and faced with an impossible moral quandary, instead creates a portrait of a future sociopathic personality. he has no connection to anyone around him, and by the end of the film has no real sense of what is right or wrong. he has no direction at home and feels nothing for his friends. what we have is a portrait of a non-person, a spirit that merely coasts through life as he weaves his way along on his skateboard. i don't feel for him at all, and honestly i wish he'd been caught. the entire film centres not necessarily on his feelings of guilt, but on how he is going to avoid punishment and/or accountability for a bad decision. he not only gets away with it, he finds a way to subtly rationalise it. quite a frightening, negative message, the suggestion being that so many of our youth are so disconnected from right and twrong that they simply make up the rules as they go along, serving themselves for good or ill. i find it an insulting treatsie on today's youth, and the pretentious arrogance of the film-maker drips thick with every plodding, overthought step and shifting eye.<br /><br />(he did murder the guard, but if you blink your eyes you miss it. whether it was an act of mercy or not is hard to say--it could be he was so mortified he lashed out with his skateboard. when he runs to the security guard's car, one of the wheels of his skateboard is stained with blood. )
