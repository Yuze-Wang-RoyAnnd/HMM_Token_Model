first, and foremost, i take issue to the title of this movie. 'chupacabra' is not a spanish word. the name to which they are referring is 'chupacabras'. i imagine they dropped the 's' because it sounds plural that way, but i assure you, it is singular in spanish.<br /><br />next, i thought this movie had been done years ago. it came off as one of those b horror flicks i watched when i was an early teenager at home when my stepdad was out of town. then it would have been kind of scary.<br /><br />let's talk about the special effects. the most important 'effect' is the costume used for the chupacabras. given that it is the main character, you would think some serious money would have been put into it, but that isn't so. the shape, color, and texture were all goofy like some stupid haunted house at disney world.<br /><br />there were times when the chupacabras was walking where no man could walk. his movement were jerky and strange at these times, but moving around on the floor looked like any normal man.<br /><br />another thing i take issue to is that there is no animal in the world that goes around slaughtering everything it sees with no regard to actually eating it. the chupacrabas would kill one, then the next, but it never seemed to actually eat the victim. you say, "it's just a movie," and i agree. but the idea is so far out there that it's stupid.<br /><br />what country is dr. pena from? he sounds sort of jamaincan/hawaiian/british/something-else, but i think he's supposed to be latino. the problem is, his accent is so bad that even a russian could tell he wasn't latino.<br /><br />the soldiers fired round after round at this thing, and weren't making a dent, yet the continued to fire. i'm no military man, but don't soldiers, especially the special tactical forces such as this, have to have some wit about them to perform their duties? wouldn't they figure out that it was a waste of time to shoot and try something new? they didn't. they just kept firing away while the chupacabras continued to slaughter, and not eat, them.<br /><br />did they have to kill the little dog? :) anyway, my vote was 3 for this flick, because it was bad. why did i watch the whole thing? i'm sure you've done the same on occasion, so don't give me an flack. ;)
