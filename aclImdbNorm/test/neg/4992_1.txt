this is the worst movie i've ever seen. boring, illogical, terrible. don't waste even a minute in your life to watch this crap! i hope the directors won't make any other movie because this movie bankrupts them. the movie seems to be created in one or two days with some friends of the directors (if we can use this word for these 2 guys). they use only camera in hand. many scenes are in darkness and nothing can be seen. lots of scenes (80% of the movie) are with conversation only. ! there are movies like vampire vs. zombies which you can laugh on but this one is simply bad, no point to making such movies. please, stop jason horton and shannon hubbel. don't make more movies!
