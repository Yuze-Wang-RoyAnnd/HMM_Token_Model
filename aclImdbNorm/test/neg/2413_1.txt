so i give it one star for true quality, but i'd give it an eight and a half for sheer enjoyability. an incredibly strange hybrid of sex comedy and vigilante thriller, "young warriors" is just the sort of bad movie you usually hope to find when poking around the video fringe, yet so rarely do. it starts off with about half an hour of wacky hi-jinx, sex jokes, and juvenile shenanigans (including an olive in the martini joke that has to be seen not to be believed). then the main character's younger sister gets gang raped by a bunch of swarthy bikers (an objectionable scene that keeps me from giving this a 10 for entertainment value - rape is not entertainment!), and the main character gets the rest of his sex crazed frat brothers to help him in a quest to clean up the city, find the responsible bikers, and kill anybody slightly criminal they run into along the way.<br /><br />it's hilarious, non-stop fun, apart from the very unpleasant rape scene, and is essential viewing to any serious bad movie fan. trust me - i've put my time in on these things, and this is one of the best. highlights include a wonderful visit to the library, a great flickering slo-mo shootout in a sleazy bar (with a shot of a guy blowing his own foot off that's pretty impressive), a couple of decent slumming actors (richard roundtree, ernest borgnine), a couple of semi-famous recognizable faces (lynda day george, scream queen linnea quigley), and a couple of relatives of famous people (chuck norris' brother mike, van patten clan member james). it even has one of those great "what have we become?" type morality lesson endings, although the turning point comes when the vigilante fratboys gun down a couple of kids robbing a store with a toy gun. i've always wondered why that was the catalyst that got the hero thinking; after all, whether they were kids and not hardened criminals, and whether they had a real gun or not, they were in fact still robbing a store, so as far as i can tell, it was just another job well done for our vigilante frat boys, right? wonderful stuff. highly recommended, just don't blame me when you enjoy it despite yourself.
