what is it with studios like paramount that have a proven hit film series on their hands, and figure it can screw around with the budget and formula? paramount spent less on this film than they did on tmp, which doesn't sound bad until you realize that there's a 10 gap between when the films were made. the $40 tmp cost to make would be equivalent to about $75 million in 1989. this film is the reason that shatner has never been given a fair chance to direct other films, as well. every time he turned around, the studio was slashing the budget and making demands regarding the storyline. the fact that this was the one storyline that roddenberry and shatner could agree upon for the most part made the freshman directorial task tough enough, but after all the machinations were done, all anyone ended up with was an uneven story and a load of badly executed special effects not worthy of the original series, much less a major motion picture. the most glaring examples: - all of the phaser effects were severely ashed out and fake-looking. - the shot of the enterprise going into the great barrier was so obviously a still-frame shot being zoomed away from. at least the popsicle stick that held the enterprise cut out up was successfully matted out. - god "chasing" kirk up the mountain... egads, they may as well have just cut in shots of godzilla climbing the volcano at the end of "godzilla 1985," and used thumbtacks to scratch the emulsion off of the film to make electric bolts come out of his eyes at the imperiled captain kirk.... yes, friends, i have a real problem with the look of that last scene, especially.<br /><br />thank goodness star trek vi was such a redeemer of a film...
