"curse of the forty-niner" doesn't really deserve a long and detailed review, so i'll just make some random observations about it:<br /><br />- cool opening credits.<br /><br />- no plot.<br /><br />- is there anyone who's ever seen a horror film before and can't guess, within the first 20 minutes, who will survive and who will not among this group of walking stereotypes?<br /><br />- hey, that newcomer (alexandra ford) is pretty hot!<br /><br />- richard lynch (made-up to look about 100 years old) and john phillip law have fun, tongue-in-cheek cameos.<br /><br />- karen black has a bigger role, but she's not fun - she's rather embarrassing.<br /><br />- martin kove is on-screen for about 40 seconds, but still got his name on the video cover. did they pay him for this appearance or was it the other way around? <br /><br />- i hate cheap computer-generated effects in horror films.<br /><br />*1/2 out of 4.
