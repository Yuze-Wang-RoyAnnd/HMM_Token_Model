"a scientist has developed a serum which grotesquely distorts the victim's hands and heads. the scientist decides to use his serum on a concert pianist to extort money from him for the cure as well as take the man's daughter for a wife," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis. j. carrol naish (as dr. igor markoff) plays "the monster maker" in the low budget bela lugosi mode.<br /><br />mr. naish's serum causes a real disorder, "acromegaly", which american heritage defines as, "a chronic disease of adults marked by enlargement of the bones of the extremities, face, and jaw that is caused by overactivity of the pituitary gland." ralph morgan (as anthony lawrence) plays the afflicted man with some dignity. pretty blonde wanda mckay (as patricia "pat" lawrence) is the daughter desired by mad scientist naish; in early scenes, ms. mckay and naish emote hilariously.<br /><br />watch for tala birell (as maxine) in a surprisingly good supporting performance; she plays the somewhat garbo-like, and long suffering, assistant to naish. ms. birell definitely steals the film; and, you've got to question dr. markoff's sanity in casting her aside. glenn strange (as steve) and a crazed gorilla (ray corrigan) add to the fun. the monster makeup (maurice seiderman) is very good.<br /><br />**** the monster maker (1944) sam newfield ~ j. carrol naish, ralph morgan, tala birell
