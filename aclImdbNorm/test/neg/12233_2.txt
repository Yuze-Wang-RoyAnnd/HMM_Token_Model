one would think that since this film has a bad rep that i would be exaggerating when i say i hated this film.but i'm am serious this movie was just so stupid and so unfunny, and such a waste of time.i mean after the first 30, i had a major headache and the smile i had on my face(that was mostly getting ready to laugh) was wearing off.when this film was over i was so glad and because i had good expectations that it would be funny i was extremely disappointed.the acting is not great, the comedy moments are lame and unfunny.hardly anything is good about this, because i laughed at like maybe 2 parts.overall this is so boring and i can't tell you how awful this is, i think this could be used as a suicide technique.i mean i don't think for some its even watchable.so my final words on this are, avoid at all costs.
