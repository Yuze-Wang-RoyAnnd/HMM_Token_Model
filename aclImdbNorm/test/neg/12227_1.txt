we arrived at the theater too late to see rendition, which was our intention, and 'the comebacks' was the only film that hadn't already started. i had an inkling of how bad a film it was after reading the short blurb at the ticket counter. the theater was empty when we arrived and only two other people entered before the film started.<br /><br />the screenwriters and director threw every imaginable sports clich'e at the audience without creating a single laugh, not one during the entire movie. think of all the football movies that have been made and the millions of dollars schools and fans spend each year on football and you realize how ripe it is to be parodied or lampooned. if you add texas to the mix,you ought to come up with the sports version of 'little miss sunshine', not a big yawn.<br /><br />the first film that came to mind as we exited the theater was 'can't stop the music' by comparison, this was 'can't stop the music' without bruce jenner, valerie perrine, or the village people.<br /><br />if the film had a single grace note, it was seeing matthew lawrence grown up.
