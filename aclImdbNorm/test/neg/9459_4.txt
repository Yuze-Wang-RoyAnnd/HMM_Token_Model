i own this movie. and it is terribly hard to find. it is a unique low budget little gore flick about a doctor seeking the perfect companion. it has the really humourous low budget feel to it, and the gore is suprisingly good for what appears to be a $500 budget. the director is claimed to be the master of gore. i wouldn't go that far, but maybe in his time he was. overall 6/10 on the gore chart.
