brainless film about two girls and some guys they meet in an airport getting on the wrong late night shuttle bus and ending up in a whole world of trouble. great twists and turns are totally, and i do mean totally wasted, in a film with a plot so incredibly stupid as to defy description. what is going on in a general sense is okay, i mean the idea of a guy kidnapping unattended girls for nefarious purposes is a good one. the problem is that the details are so beyond belief that i would be shocked if you don't turn off the film in utter disbelief. gee, a guy who is suppose to be taking you home doesn't go any of the ways you know, and you stay on the bus? it get worse from there, think of every bad choice and this film has the characters make it, even to the point where they could just walk away, but never do. whats annoying is that some of the twists and turns might have worked if there was something intelligent before it, but there is almost no intelligence anywhere in this film. okay, maybe there is, the end, the end is clever. the end is the sort of thing that should freak you out. it should be the "oh #$*@!!!!" moment and become a classic of horror cinema. instead it just lies there among the stupid ruins of a stupid movie. one of the most brainless films of the year.
