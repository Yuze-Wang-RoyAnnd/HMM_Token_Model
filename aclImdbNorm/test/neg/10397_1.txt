dante would of been mortified, if he knew that his masterpiece was being acted out puppets!!! also the actors who played the puppets are sell outs. due to the fact that playing a puppet is not acting it is just basically doing nothing. no one really will care who the puppet was. people only care who played a major role in like an actual movie. this is just annoying how you could mock such an amazing man and his belief, by this dumb little movie. this should be a crime and.... i cant believe you would ruin a book like that. i thought the movie was absolutely ridiculous and should be destroyed!!!! it totally ruins what your suppose to be getting from reading it. your just making it a big joke.
