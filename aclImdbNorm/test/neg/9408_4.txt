al pacino was once an actor capable of making a role work without resorting to constant use of profanity. in other words when he could act, he didn't have to talk like some street junkie. mcconaughey must have been impressed by pacino because he became a promoter of the "f" word also. this might be the kind of society that they actually live in, but most of us have the common decency to watch what we say in mixed company. i don't recall the exact words that a professor used in explaining the constant use of profanity, but it was something like this. "it shows a lack of intelligence, poor language skills and disrespect for all those that have to listen." maybe it is time that al takes some acting courses again to sharpen his talent. oh yes, the movie... probably the worse thing that mcconaughey has played in. hopefully his next role will be in the company of more talented people. rene russo as always was hot.
