lame is really the best way to describe this movie. it has a real poor script, uninteresting dialog and characters and it's lacking in basically everything else as well. <br /><br />there are too many characters and problem is that you don't care about any of them. what the movie is lacking is one good and clear main character. instead now the movie has a bit of everything, it has a bit of an hero, it has a bit of a love interest and it has a bit of villain. i wish it only had a bit less ghoulies though, fore they are just mostly very annoying in this movie.<br /><br />ghoulies are supposed to be devilish creatures, who murder for pleasure. in this movie however all they want to do is drink beer and watch naked college girls. besides, someone had the 'brilliant' idea to let the ghoulies be able to talk this time. this works out really poorly and annoying. the ghoulie-puppets had been definitely upgraded for this movie and they are more detailed looking and are able to do more, however at the same time they are way more fake looking than the ones from the previous ghoulies movies.<br /><br />it's obvious that the aim for this movie was more comedy than horror this time. the movie is like a lame '80's high-school comedy (even though this movie got released in 1991). it's humor is really the worst and most lame thing about the entire movie. it's so incredibly annoying and simply not funny at all.<br /><br />the story is not going anywhere with its story and the movie is just basically one big mess, that never seems to end. the ghoulies plot line seems basically to have nothing to do at all with the other plot lines of the movie, involving the human characters. the movie is not at all about the ghoulies terrorizing a college, with the humans trying to hunt them down and stop their rampage. no big surprise that this is brent olson's only written movie as of yet. he simply has no talent for it and i think that he has discovered this as well and has gone back to college himself instead.<br /><br />even when compared to the previous ghoulies movies; this movie is just simply terrible!<br /><br />2/10
