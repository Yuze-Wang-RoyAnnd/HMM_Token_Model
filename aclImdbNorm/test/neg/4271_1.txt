total crap.<br /><br />i was kind of excited to see this as it is the only film version i have seen of mansfield park. i suffered through the first four episodes but when it came to the proposal scene between henry and fanny i snapped and had to turn it off. whoever employs this sylvestra le touzel lady has got to be both blind and deaf cause the woman is the worst actress i've ever seen in my life. the whole thing is just bad, bad, bad. i don't know. i just don't know why people who write jane austen screenplays seem to be incapable of giving her work the respect it deserves.
