if it were possible, i would have given this sorry excuse for a movie a zero star. it was by far the worse i have ever seen. it was as if it were a home movie that some bored highschoolers decided to make as a joke. the "acting" was horrific. the "actors" didn't even react to the fact that they were being murdered.<br /><br />honestly, i bought this movie by mistake. the spanish title said jeepers creepers 3, so i thought hmm maybe it'll be ok. wrong. it was honestly the worst ever. i didn't get past 20 minutes of the stupid movie. i skipped through chapters and nothing interesting ever seemed to happen.<br /><br />the cameramen were also terrible. it was like a home movie. i would never recommend anyone to watch this. terrible terrible moronic movie.
