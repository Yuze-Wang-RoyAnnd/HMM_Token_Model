certainly not a bad little low budget film, this "bride of the gorilla", but nothing special, neither, and not memorable enough to be ranked among the meaningful sci-fi efforts of its time. director curt siodmak was an eminent scriptwriter during the 1930's and 1940's and delivered stories for some true genre classics ("i walked with a zombie", "the wolf man") but, as a director, he obviously lacked the required competences. "bride of the gorilla" is similar to the aforementioned "the wolf man" in story and atmosphere, but the film looks a lot more amateurish and pitiful. both handle about cursed men that turn into large animals at night, but the titular gorilla doesn't look half as threatening as the werewolf, even though the film got released a whole decade later. during a cheesy opening speech, actor lon chaney tries to convince us that the jungle is an ominous place and hiding many mysteries, but actually there's no real mystery in the plot. it's just handles about a plantation manager who's jealous at his older colleague for having such a beautiful young wife and he kills him. a native woman witnesses his crime and puts a spell on barney that causes him to transform into a hideously big gorilla at night... or maybe she just wants him to believe he's turning into a hideously big gorilla
