if i could give this movie less than a 1, i would certainly do that. i had read a review of this film in the la times and i found myself walking by the theater and remembered the review. my wife and i were game and we thought it can't be as bad as the critic said - you know critics. sure enough... give me a break with the awful acting, horrible camera work, poor use of the budget (that has been mentioned over and over again as an excuse). i've worked on films with smaller budgets that are 100 times better. it's the director and the producer that makes films work - they choose the teams. that's it. if they don't put it together and make it work...it simply won't. so, they didn't - and it doesn't. i don't think they can... i just had to take the time to write this review...though i'm sure the film crew doesn't appreciate this review - i hope i'm doing you all a favor with my wish for you to do well, but - in another career. good luck.
