i am giving this movie vampire assassins a "2" rating mainly because it had no sex or nudity. other than that, i am not sure why it was ever made. it was more like a training exercise in how to make a movie with a very limited budget. the characters derek and slovak were the best actors. they were followed closely by the "biker-dude" with the pleather pants and silver belt. he was ok too. most of the movie was filmed in some kind of distribution warehouse. if you got tired of watching the kung-fu kick boxing stunts, you can check out the packages of scott tissue, windex and other cleaning products. you will have a lot of time to do this, trust me. i almost started to make a list. the dialogue and kung-fu stunts were extremely slow. they talked slow, fought slow, etc. i don't know why. at least with the extra-slow delivery of the actors lines, you could hear everything very distinctly. i am trying hard to find good stuff to say about this movie. we watched it all the way to the end to see if got any better, but it didn't. we never could decide if the actors really knew martial arts or were just acting like they knew martial arts. you can watch yourself and decide. my favorite line was something like (vampire speaking:) "what are you looking at?" other man responding: "your bad dental work."
