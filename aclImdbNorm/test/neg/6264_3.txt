slasher sequel (fourth slumber part massacre film) concerns a group of nubile cheerleaders stranded in a mountainous cabin in the snow, being offed by a deranged killer. typical slasher elements for hardcore slasher fans, gore, wonderfully gratuitous female nudity, no plot. though it wears out its welcome eventually, even at its short length.<br /><br />original star brinke stevens makes a cameo, which only seems to be there for the sake of including her in the movie.
