the major flaw in this spanish slasher/shocker is within it's script. for the first half hour it's an okay effort, building some suspense and an atmosphere of fear and dread. we even get some nice killings too! then it goes completely downhill and turns into a whole catalog of "your basic slasher clich'es". i must admit that i was quite disappointed because the trailer promised so much more. the final thirty minutes consists of some killings and a lot of running around in an abandoned convent. it should have been so much better (although the final scenes in the flooded room is quite okay)!<br /><br />first of all, we have the dialog. it's awful most of the time (there was quite a few giggles in the audience here and there when i saw it) and merely adequate elsewhere. it is also barely audible during a lot of scenes, drowning under the pressure of sound effects and the soundtrack (however that might not be such a bad thing after all considering the stupid lines we have to listen to!). there is one line in the whole movie that makes a reference to the "i know what you did last summer"-movies, indicating that the film makers wrote it all as one big joke, but i doubt it.<br /><br />and the ending...well, some will hate it, others will dig it. for me, it was mostly a question of the former because the final twist comes from out of nowhere! if the audience had been given some clues to the girls mental status, i might have thought otherwise. it also throws all logic out of the window, because the murderer could never had been in place for some of the kills! but as an avid horror fan i have learned to live with these inconsistencies in spanish and italian movies.<br /><br />but all is not bad. the movie has a big budget appearance, mainly due to the excellent cinematography (the scenes from past times really shines here), tight editing and an atmospheric soundtrack. even though most of the actors are pretty bad, anita briem is an exception, making the most of what she has to work with. real screen presence!<br /><br />and, like i mentioned before, the killings are gory enough for the fans of such stuff and they are usually accompanied by very good special effects involving images of water (but the "water theme" tends to get tiresome in the end though).<br /><br />so, to end this review, it's a movie that is quite fun in a "so-bad-it's-good" kind of way and it's also pleasing to the eye. but don't expect too much because it doesn't deliver as you probably think it will, judging from trailer and plot descriptions.
