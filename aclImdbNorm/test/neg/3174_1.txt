this film is cringingly bad. you can tell that all the actors are embarrassed to be associated with such a truly terrible movie. there are obvious budget constraints but with a little thought and attention to detail the movie could have been so much better. for example: check out the scene where mickey first goes to the mortuary and is talking to his friend the pathologist whilst the murdered taxi driver is lying on the slab. you can actually see the corpse breathing! what, couldn't they afford to hire a half-decent extra that could hold his breath for a 2 minute scene?!
