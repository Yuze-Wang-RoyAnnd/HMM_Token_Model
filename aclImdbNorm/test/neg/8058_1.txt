this movie was unbelievably bad... it's gory but the violence is just too much to the point where it looks extremely fake and predictable. since everything is shown to you there is nothing left to the imagination. and the plot... what plot? there really isn't any! the pacing is unbelievably slow (despite the random acts of violence) and the screenplay must have been written by a deranged 12 year old kid who kills kittens for fun. so this movie was banned in 31 countries? i could see why... not because of the gore (boring and trite) but because it was a terrible movie. it should have been banned from existence. avoid this one like the plague. 1 out of 10
