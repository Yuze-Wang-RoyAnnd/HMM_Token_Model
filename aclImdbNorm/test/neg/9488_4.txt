one of the more prominent/popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. a red-shirt female falls for khan (instead of dropping dead - for a change) and then proceeds to betray kirk and the enterprise as if loyalty were a non-existent character trait on the ship. makes one wonder what kind of psychology tests this supposedly brilliant starfleet uses to test people when hiring. we have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in "wink of an eye", when a red-shirt male takes the enemy's side just because he falls in love! same as in ss. (however, in that episode the betrayal plays a tiny role in the overall plot.) this is very silly because it once again makes kirk's crew seem like a bunch of soft-headed, easy-to-impress morons, who - once they fall in love with the enemy - are capable of doing just about anything. the fact that mcgivers switches back to kirk's side doesn't ameliorate the illogic in any way. lord mcgiveth and the lord mctaketh...<br /><br />why is khan kept behind a regular door when they know he has superior strength? that's one of several st plot-devices that undermine kirk's intelligence. why does khan hold a knife against mccoy's throat? if khan is of such superior intelligence then one would expect him to be more wily with the way he carries himself. and what's with a sikh being played with a latino accent? montalban should have been provided with a vocal coach. i was half-expecting to hear "the plaaain! the plaaaain!" in the background at any moment. why the hell would kirk (or any ship captain) provide limitless use of the ship's library concerning the innermost technical details of the enterprise to anyone? is the starfleet an institution solely consisting of idiots? <br /><br />ss is a very cartoonish, silly episode, so no wonder trekkies love it. it doesn't have too many sci-fi elements in it, which is what trekkies hate the most. it also figures that the st franchise chose to revive this dull character for the second movie, that way pleasing rabid trekkies, who were so very disappointed with the first movie which - you guessed it - had far too much sci-fi for the average tiny trekkie brain.
