during university, our philosophy professor, mr.r, played us "roger & me" in its entirety. this was at a time when the obese misfit was still pretty much unknown; a charlatan-in-the-making, a soon-to-be-household-name who was still busy honing his fact-bending skills and still learning how to manipulate the easily impressed, the pathologically paranoid, the mentally ill, the sexually frustrated, the illiterate, the semi-literate, the clueless, and the laughably gullible among ye.<br /><br />as we finished viewing it, i thought: "yeah, it was somewhat entertaining - in a totally daft bugs bunny kind of way - but what an ultra-biased, anti-capitalist propaganda turkey that has no objectivity whatsoever this is; its sole purpose being to take cheap shots at people and ideas which the film's creator has pet-peeves for. this isn't a documentary by any stretch of the imagination." however, our beloved marxist professor was absolutely thrilled with r&m, and we ended up not only not criticizing any aspects of it, but mr.r actually spent the remainder of class praising its "qualities". just so we understand each other, the words "propaganda", "viewer manipulation", "left-wing extremist", or "selective fact presentation" never exited his perpetually smiling mouth... and just to remind you: this was supposed to be a philosophy class, not indoctrinate your students with your own political b.s. course.<br /><br />anyway, now i get to the really interesting aspect: this professor, mr.r, is now a highly successful screenwriter in hollywood. he has written several left-wing scripts with a-grade stars in them.<br /><br />the moral of the story: those are the kind of people for whom all doors are open in hollywood.<br /><br />michael moore is a talentless filmmaker (which he proved beyond a smidgen of a doubt with "canadian bacon"), but being a marxist liberal opens doors to just about anyone. tinseltown is teeming with rabid pro-chavez extremists, hence why political brainwashing through simplistic portrayals of reality has been part-and-parcel of the hollywood experience for many decades now.<br /><br />embrace this demagogue and you've betrayed your own brain forever.
