i'm not prone to ranting and my expectations were low to start with, but how did this seem like a good idea? just because you have a camera, some big ugly friends for actors, and delusions of talent, does not mean that you should go out and make a film. this should have been the cinematic equivalent of singing in the shower, i.e. it should never have seen the light of day. however, somehow this rubbish found a distributor to help it escape the confines of a 3 by 4 foot cubicle. it goes from bad to worse. talk about low budget, one torture scene consists of a guy getting a mug of coffee thrown over him while he's tied to a chair. evidently this is very painful because the big baby proceeds to scream in agony....maybe he ordered decaf!! the acting is worse than wooden (i could possibly watch a tree for 30 seconds before becoming completely bored, if you can look at this rubbish for that long you're a better man than i!) and the fight scenes would be at home on a kindergarten play yard. do not touch this movie, unless you enjoy pain (in which case you should try spilling lukewarm coffee over yourself). i'd like to say it's so bad it's good, but really this is just awful.
