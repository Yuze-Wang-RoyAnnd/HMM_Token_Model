my take: steven seagal is obviously too boring to be a lead in an action thriller, even a totally dull one. <br /><br />remember steven seagal? you don't? don't worry, there's not much to catch up on. after starring in admittedly enjoyable crowd-pleasing films like under siege and executive decision, seagal hits the low grounds of the bad movie abyss. now, he stars in low-budgeted b-level action vehicles, some of which are made-for-tv "movie of the week" entries that lost their way to the big screen. half past dead is among these, shall we say, dead action movies. a loud and lousy action film, sloppily directed and lazily written (and worse, badly acted). this is one of those bad movies that i don't need to watch until the ending to know it's bad. i didn't have the guts to have all my braincells die while wasting my time with this. it it this kind of bad films in which you realize, those other films you hate are not bad after all.<br /><br />the plot (and the locale) is completely lifted from a similar picture, michael bay's the rock, although similar may not be the word to describe it. both movies are summer movies, and not meant to be taken so seriously. but in comparison, even the rock (which isn't much in the writing department as much as the lights and sounds) has better characters, a more compelling plot, better action sequences and overall, a more entertaining atmosphere. although there are action scenes in half past dead, none of them are exciting. all of which are sometimes tedious and predictable.<br /><br />although predictability seemed to be a welcome asset in summer action films, predictability has never tasted more sour in ones that aren't fun, and half past dead is never really fun, a lot of times it's just a pain in the head (hearing the bad rap music repeat over and over again throughout this film makes me yearn for an aspirin every second i hear them). the acting is horrendously mediocre, the plot is derivative, with no compelling or appealing characters whatsoever. seagal's character, an undercover agent sent to alcatraz to stop a criminal mastermind (morris chestnut), a very boring villain, is nothing to get excited about. seagal's character is also provided with a sidekick (played by rap star ja rule) and a bunch of amigo inmates, and there's no chemistry going on here.<br /><br />if starring in a series of other forgotten action vehicles (what were those films again?) killed of seagal's career for good, half past dead is overkill. and audiences be warned: you're invited to feel the pain. advice: avoid it at all costs.<br /><br />rating: 0 out of 5.
