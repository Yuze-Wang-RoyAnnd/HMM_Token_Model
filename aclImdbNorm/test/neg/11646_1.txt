stay away from this movie! it is terrible in every way. bad acting, a thin recycled plot and the worst ending in film history. seldom do i watch a movie that makes my adrenaline pump from irritation, in fact the only other movie that immediately springs to mind is another "people in an aircraft in trouble" movie (airspeed). please, please don't watch this one as it is utterly and totally pathetic from beginning to end. helge iversen
