this movie was so frustrating. everything seemed energetic and i was totally prepared to have a good time. i at least thought i'd be able to stand it. but, i was wrong. first, the weird looping? it was like watching "america's funniest home videos". the damn parents. i hated them so much. the stereo-typical latino family? i need to speak with the person responsible for this. we need to have a talk. that little girl who was always hanging on someone? i just hated her and had to mention it. now, the final scene transcends, i must say. it's so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own. what crappy dancing. horrible and beautiful at once.
