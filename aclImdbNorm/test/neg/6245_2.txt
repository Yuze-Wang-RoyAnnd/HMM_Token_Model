on my continuing quest to find the worst movie of all time, my friends and i stumbled upon this little gem. it is hilarious through and through, especially if you don't know (like we didn't) that it's a semi-sequel to another horror series.<br /><br />i won't bother going into the plot except to mention that everyone complains about the horrible snowstorm that was coming (it was equivalent to the characters just screaming "foreshadowing!" at the camera and waving their arms), and, in some odd twist of fate, the snow storm ever occurs. budget problems, i guess.<br /><br />add that to a magical front door that is opened or closed depending on what scare effect the director wants to create and the electricity being cut off until the gym teacher decides to take a shower with lots of soap. i'll admit it; i had trouble breathing at points.<br /><br />the only actual decent part of this movie, as it turns out, was from the original slumber party massacre movie. it's so much funnier now that i know that.<br /><br />*spoiler* the end, where it is revealed that the slasher did it because her drunk friends stumbled in on her and a female friend making out and then the friend driving into a train or something is probably the funniest psycho killer origin ever, heightened by the fabulous use of blurring and stock footage. i'm glad all of the slasher's friends forgot the incident completely until a flashback was necessary. <br /><br />run, don't walk, to pick this up and see the hilarity. of course, the continuity editor should be given an award for all of this, if only they weren't stuck in that horrible snow storm...
