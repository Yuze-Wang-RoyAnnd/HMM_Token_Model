i can't believe i watched this whole movie. another "ishtar" in that i kept waiting for it to get better, which never happened. the sound is terrible, going from too low to hear the conversations, to blaring sound in seconds. the plot is absolutely implausible, the acting is mediocre, although keaton does his usual good job as a mental case, although being typecast in that role could certainly be considered a negative. the director knows absolutely nothing about hospitals, medications, science or anything of a technical nature. "sociopath"???? i wonder how they came up with that diagnosis? there are so many errors, goofs and things wrong with this movie that if one were to list them all it would possibly set some kind of record. demerol as a general anestetic? a motorcyclist on the freeway wearing a non dot/snell off-road helmet. san francisco??? paper walls move when tapped, helmets just appear out of thin air, guns point one direction but hit things in another, lighting appears and disappears and there is barely a scene in the move that doesn't contain some kind of error. my wife, who is an rn in an oncology unit finally left the room before the end of the movie so upset over all the medical errors. i gave it a 2 only because of keaton's acting, else it certainly would have gotten a 1.
