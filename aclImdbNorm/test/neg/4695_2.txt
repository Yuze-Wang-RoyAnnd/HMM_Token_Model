this flick, which is a.k.a. "life in the fast lane" is easily one of the least entertaining movies i've seen in a long time. i think it was made in mind of the sick, twisted and jaded l.a. women who represent about .00000001 of the population in the states. the characters are all one-dimensional, even the lead. after she stabs her boyfriend in the head with some scissors, a cheap laugh is attempted (and unsucceeds) by sticking a cork in the boyfriend's skull to stop the bleeding. oh, clever! patrick dempsey (whose movies are almost always a class act --sarcasm) plays this "devil" who changes her life - but from what we've seen, her life was this series of vignettes to begin with. no emotion, no laughs, no story. the only reason i give this a 2 is that jeffrey jones is ok as the priest and there is a bit of style (albiet zero substance) in the camerawork. otherwise, one of the 5 worst films i've seen. grade 2 out of 10 an f! i think that even the most drugged out junkie who would laugh at a toilet seat falling would dislike this film. i can't stress enough how much you should stay away.<br /><br />
