i enjoyed the first "toxic avenger," but the sequel just didn't work. there are some funny gags in the opening, involving members of the home for the blind, but past that point i was simply bored. the sequel is also filled with much quirky, low-brow humor. only this time it's not funny! much of the gags revolve around crusty japanese stereotypes. almost every japanese character seems to be chopping fish. does everyone in japan chop fish? the troma films are known for being more than a little irreverent, but if you're gonna use humor involving racial stereotypes, at least make it funny. i can't laugh if i'm handed the same crap i've seen a million times before! one thing i have to give credit for is the gratuitous nudity. there's even more gratuitous nudity than in the first. but altogether i was very disappointed, and the film ends with a tedious chase scene which had me huffing and puffing, dying for the movie to fade to black. at least there's one hilarious line from the film which had me bawling with laughter. after the villain says a line from shakespeare to one of the local citizens, the citizen (an elderly woman) responds by saying, "f**k you--that's from david mamet."<br /><br />my score: 3 (out of 10)
