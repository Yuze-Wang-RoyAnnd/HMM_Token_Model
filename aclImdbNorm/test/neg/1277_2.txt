i stopped this movie at 48 minutes and change... i don't know...maybe it's because i'm not swedish...or french(the cannes commenter)...or any of those other sleepy places from which the previous reviewers held forth... born and raised in ny. lived near san francisco for a quarter of a century. and now holland. i love a good independent film as much as the next movie enthusiast... but this, in a word, isn't funny. see? now that's funny...that you're thinking that i made a mistake. i said, 'in a word' but then said, 'isn't funny'... nope. no mistake. if this is your type of humor, i'd say you haven't really had much of a life... consider your appreciation of this film a symptom... and please don't ever write another review...i have a tendency to believe them when they're unanimous. even if there only were about 3 reviews before mine...i figured i might actually be able to save someone else the boredom...the anticipation of laughter that never materializes... i did smile once or twice, though... when i started the movie...and when i stopped it. that should be 10 lines.
