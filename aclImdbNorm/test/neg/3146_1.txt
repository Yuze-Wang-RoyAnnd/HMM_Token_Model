when i was a younger(oh about 2)i watched barney for the first time, and liked it. but, back then i didn't exactly have a brain, either. and now i look back and see what a horrible show "barney" really is: first of all, everything on that show is creepy. barney, the main character, is a horrendous 9-foot tall talking, purple dinosaur that teaches 13-year-olds about "imagination...."(*shudders*) b.j.(i know what your thinking about his name.)is a smaller yet creepier yellow dinosaur that is put in to be "supposudly" cool. but in fact, he is the exact opposite. after watching a few episodes with b.j. dumbly trudging in with his slightly turned back cap, and making a few no-so-funny jokes, i wanted to scream. baby bop-oh-oh-god!(*vomits*)oh-oh-oh-anyway baby bop is the worst idea of a character ever. she is a green triceratops(it's a dinosaur) that carries a yellow blanket. her remarks of "hee-hee-hee" and barney's praises cries of 'super-deeee-doooper", make it hard to sit through each episode, as the seventh graders learn about shapes and manners.<br /><br />and that, my friend, is what makes this show truly horrible.
