i was invited to view this film at a small art museum screening. i had no clue what to expect. i was initially optimistic in the opening credits to see judd nelson, bill paxton, wayne newton, james cann, rob lowe, and lara-flynn-boyle listed. however after some very disturbing grossed-out scenes (that did not add much to the story advancement), this film quickly became a weapon of torture. the gimmick of the vestigial growing arm storyline is never really developed. i patiently kept waiting for this film to cash-in. there was a small payoff in the end, but having to invest and sit through the the endless gross, crude, sexually-perverted, in-your-face screaming, unfunny gore cost too much for me (even for a free viewing). what were these established actors doing in this awful film? the art direction was very convincing and creepy. at the very minimum, it should only be a 75-minute film. this is a film that dick cheney and donald rumsfeld would embrace.
