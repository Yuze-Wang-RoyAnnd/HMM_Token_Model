imagine if you will: four teen students have an assignment to spend the night in a haunted house in st. francisville, louisiana to check for the existence of the paranormal. if you watch this in the dark and late at night; you possibly will have the hair on the back of your neck rise a couple of times. otherwise this mock documentary is a very lazy rip off of blair witch project. what is to be dialogue is very lame and the actors are pleasant looking enough, but seem to lack genuine personality. it seems to take forever before something real spooky even happens. this movie is excellent for 'sleep overs', when you have both eyes barely open and everyone is yakin' and snackin'.
