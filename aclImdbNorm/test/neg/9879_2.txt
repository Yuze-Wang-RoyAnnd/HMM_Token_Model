from the makers of underworld, we have, by far, the worst werewolf movie i have ever seen. it is basically a reconstructed version of underworld, yet lacking vampires (not a big deal), cool effects (a big deal), and generally just about everything that can possibly be done right to produce a decent film dealing with lycanthropy (the biggest deal of them all!). a twenty-something lycanthrope chocolate maker named vivian is currently residing in romania ever since her family was hunted down and executed in front of her years ago in america for being werewolves. there, she belongs to a small society (or pack) of werewolves and is apparently chosen to unwillingly wed the pack leader, gabriel, whose son - some toad with a british accent - takes it upon himself to hunt outside of the pack. they have apparently been discovered in other countries prior and want to remain settled in romania by avoiding negative attention, so of course, such activity is considered forbidden. vivian ends up falling in love with an american artist who is oblivious to her involvement with the group of blood-thirsty predators. when they end up discovering the secret relationship, things get messy when someone is killed and the human is forced to participate in a deadly tradition in which he is set loose in the woods and is hunted - giving the pack a chance to transform into their "wolfy" selves. all this really consists of is a big leap before they light up and land as a wolf. very cheezy effects. the entire movie is like a tamed down underworld with some drippy, romantic montages and very little action. watching this in the theater, i could not wait for it to end. a devastatingly boring disappointment. avoid!
