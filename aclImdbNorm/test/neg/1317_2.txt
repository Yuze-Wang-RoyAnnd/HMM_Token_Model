oh but this is woeful. one good actor after another turns in lamentable dialogue in half hearted fashion under what must have been incredibly pedestrian direction to consider it acceptable. i like robert carlyle and joanne whalley is one of my favourite actresses, tom courtney can act well when pushed and david suchet is a professional of the highest integrity but they all wallowed around like fish in a barrel of watery gin. i swear courtney was inebriated, on painkillers or both. <br /><br />was there a good performance in the whole thing? well yes, david hood as the junior underground engineer whose mate got washed away looked like he was taking the thing seriously and credit to him for that, it can't be easy when "all around are losing theirs" so to speak, or maybe his scenes came under the direction of the assistant director ( if there was one) i just don't know what these people were doing in a film that was this poor ( other than paying the bills, obviously) i can't begin to say how disappointed i am in them. you should be ashamed of yourselves! <br /><br />any positives other than david hood the third... yes the aerial shots of london largely submerged were very well done and the effects artists responsible deserved better than to have their fine work punctuated by such a shallow story,if you'll forgive the expression, as those few people that do see them will do so on a far smaller screen than would be to best advantage. <br /><br />what's going on here? why are british film makers trying to imitate such characterless, spectacle driven, tabloid level genres as the disaster movie and then doing it even worse than the americans. gritty realism, character integrity, the capture of real emotion in a way that makes you feel it and care... the family way, spring and port wine, get carter, the long good friday, trainspotting....don't get me wrong i like a bit of escapist hokum. the real "italian job" , the adventures of tom jones; but oh that it should come to this, there was more realistic drama in carry on camping.
