this film's a big bore. it has a plenty of predictable plots & endless sentiments from the start. it starts good with a classy number but seems lost midway.<br /><br />surya & jyothika's on screen chemistry works out really good & a good part by bhoomika. why include vadivelu in it? he disappears totally after a good half an hour!. santhanam proves his wit again by timing comedy.<br /><br />ar's tunes sure will last for sometime. but he could have done better. what ever be the drawbacks still it's worth watching once if you feel alone at home or looking for a good time-pass.
