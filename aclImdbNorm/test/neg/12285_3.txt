1st watched 8/7/2004 - 3 out of 10(dir-brett thompson): silly, juvenile-focused movie about three kids being zapped into their favorite cartoon with their parents experiment. the script left much to be desired in this hanna-barbara like rip-off of some saturday morning 'live-action with people in dinosaur costumes kids show' with some goofy cavemen hanging around. nothing really to admire about this and nothing much to be said either. i'm just amazed i found this at a blockbuster video store as bad as it was and the way the stores are ridding themselves of old vhs movies. i guess they couldn't even sell it, so back on the rental rack it went.
