i am an indian residing in the united states. why india continues, like a dumb animal, to emulate everything american is beyond me!! the main problems with the movie aren't so much the inane plot and dumb comedy. it is that this movie has a lot of sex, touching, women dressing like strumpets in the streets, and a lot of cursing that doesn't belong anywhere on t.v.<br /><br />to the producers and directors of this movie, i have this message: you continue to weaken our nation's strong family values by making this sort of junk. you continue to let young women think it's okay to have a feminist attitude and have no morals. you continue to make dance songs that belong in the lowest of adult clubs and bars. i am ashamed to be an indian after seeing movies like this.<br /><br />in 2003, the united states government suggested that the best way to destroy iran is to 'send miniskirts' there. there is no need to do that for india. we will destroy ourselves with rubbish like this.
