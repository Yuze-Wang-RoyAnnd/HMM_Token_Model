the role of buddy ackerman is no stretch for kevin spacey. he's played version of that character many times other, better films. this is fortunate because it gives his performance a certain resonance without which buddy would be as flat and incomplete as all of the other characters in this pointless little farce. the script leaves little time for plot or character development, resembling a porn flick in its rush to get to the "good stuff". the difference is that here the "good stuff" isn't people pleasuring each other but inflicting pain, making it appropriate viewing for young adults.<br /><br />of course there's nothing wrong with a porn flick if you want to watch people having sex, and i guess there's nothing wrong with "swimming with sharks" if you want to watch people undergoing physical, emotional, and psychological torture. but if you're looking for incisive satire, interesting characters, or anything else that even attempts to engage more than your basest passions, you should probably look elsewhere.
