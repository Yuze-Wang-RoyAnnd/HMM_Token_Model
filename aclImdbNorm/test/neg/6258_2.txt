this movie was one of those movies where it completely fooled me into thinking that it was a cheesy 80's slasher flick, based on the cover, but it wasn't. it was quite possibly one of the worst slasher films that i have ever seen. the picture on the cover did not match any part or scene in the movie; in fact it didn't involve a chainsaw. not even the tag line fit the movie. the film is about a group of cheerleaders and two potheads who escape to a desolate cabin, in the cold woods, for a weekend getaway. however, things get extra chilly when they start to get murdered by an unknown killer. at the same time, the local sheriff's department is hunting down a dangerous killer. i'll name the problems in a list.<br /><br />1. the acting. boy was it cheap and horribly bad. it felt unnatural and it seemed as thought it was very scripted. none of the actors seemed as though they tried to perform with good intentions and therefore they seemed silly and tired. there was bad acting by all the characters in the movie, so i won't point out specific people, but i wills say that the stoners did a horrible job, as well as the police and the cheerleaders, which is not a surprise.<br /><br />2. the plot. this story had set up a perfect storyline for good ol' fashion slasher flick, but instead they peppered it with plot-holes, useless and unnecessary scenes and an overall stupid back-story to the killer's intentions. there were major plot-holes including how the killer killed the last victim so quickly and yet still be there in the group of girls when it happened? the ex-con virtually served no purpose in the movie aside from being a useless plot device. there was random and unnecessary sex and nudity sprinkled throughout it, even for a b-movie or my taste it was a bit too much. as for the killer's intentions, lets just say it was stupid and it makes no sense as to why she / he is killing young girls. plus, there was also some very predictable kills that i saw coming about 30 miles away.<br /><br />3. the technical side. the lighting was okay, it certainly wasn't the worse lighting that i've seen in a movie, but there were points where it was supposed to be dark but it looked more like the afternoon. the house seemed darker with the lights on, then with the lights off. the camera work was average, it didn't have any good establishing shots or amazing pans or zooms, thought it did get the job done is building some suspense with it's framing.<br /><br />overall, this movie, in the sense of plot, character development and performance, was a huge disappointment and a waste of my time. what i thought would have been a great slasher flick turned out to be one of the worse movies that i have ever seen. the acting was really bad and wooden, there was hardly any sense in the plot and there was no emotion to this film. however, the technical aspect of this film saved it for me, because if the camera work or the lighting was bad, then i would have turned off the dvd player and popped in something else. i would recommend this movie to those who enjoy really cheesy b-movies as well as those who follow cult classics, because this movie certainly is. i would partially recommend this film for those who enjoy 80s slasher flicks. but for me, this movie was pitiful and utterly horrible.
