this movie was bad but it was so bad that it may reach cult status in the distant future. a sort of film-noir meets plan 9 from outer space. the story was, well, there wasn't actually a story. there is a place reserved for the ed woods and russ meyers of the world and this film proves it. "so bad it might be good" is the best way to describe it. i seriously doubt if this movie will be picked up by any legitimate distribution company therefore it is unlikely to see wide release.<br /><br />i will add that i expect to see more of actor ron carey. he made the best of what he had. the rest of the acting, if i can call it that, was quite forgettable. i have seen worse from big studios with vast budgets.
