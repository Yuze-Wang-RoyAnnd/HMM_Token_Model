this is the first time i'm entering a comment for a movie i haven't viewed till the credits. reason for this is simple...people need to be warned: this is one of the worst comedies of the new millennium. i usually stay away from a good deal of comedies that are in bad taste but i reckoned this to be watchable. a regrettable decision which was based on other ashton kutcher comedies that were (semi-) enjoyable such as a lot like love and guess who.<br /><br />where those two movies had their charms and laughs, this had none (and i mean none!!). the acting is horrible, especially the 'boss'. tara reid was no surprise, how dare she call herself an actress?! the premise is thin and the plot doesn't thicken at all. not a problem if you manage to keep it funny and/or sweet...but as you probably already guessed, this was not the cast at all! the script felt like it wasn't quite finished and i wouldn't even be baffled if the director did some rewrites while shooting. my dog could've written a more coherent script, seriously. and he's not exactly lassie either :-).<br /><br />stay away from this tripe even if you like silly goof-ball comedies at times (like i do). this low quality movie will not be enjoyed by many...<br /><br />i (almost) never give a one so therefore...a 2.
