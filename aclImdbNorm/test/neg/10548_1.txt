the toxic avenger... <br /><br />the idea of this movie is that a person that the common population would call this person a looser and then after being thrown into a barrel of toxic waste, mutated into a superhero that is completely disfigured sounded ok even for 1985. this movie is listed as a horror... i even have read of a cult following with this series.... <br /><br />now this movie even given when it was made was so bad that i couldn't stop watching... the acting is horrible even for an independent film that i think was to be the horror part of this movie...<br /><br />drug dealing, sumo, godzilla entrance.... i'm all for movies that promote anti-drugs... heck i even like godzilla and well sumo... i'm not into it but even still i think that the heights of sumo would love to give this movie the 1000 hand slap and ground salt into the eyes of the people that made this movie... <br /><br />personally i am almost ready to write to the film company that made this and ask them for the 87mins or so of my life back.<br /><br />to me 1 out of 10 is too high it's too bad that there isn't a 0 (zero) or even negative integers to place on a movie here.<br /><br />in other words this movie is j-u-n-k...... would rather watch paint dry and deal with explosive diarrhea then have to watch this movie ever again... i would be the first person that would use not only the packaging of this movie as kindling but i would be up for a good'ol movie and script burning.
