cute idea to have dionne warwick do the song vocals for this movie-adaptation of jacqueline susann's bestselling book (a la "valley of the dolls")...although it's really too bad this sudser doesn't have patty duke's neely o'hara to spike the story. "the love machine" is unrelievedly dull. even the final brawl (with an academy award as a fight prop!) can't save it. dyan cannon seems embalmed in her heavy pancake make-up and cumbersome fall (although her tiny, suntanned figure is a beauty to behold), john phillip law is a block of wood in the lead, david hemmings embarrassing in gay-mode as a flamboyant photographer. and where is robin stone walking to at the end? is he trekking out to the waterfront to pick up some sailors? after cannon has deflated his masculinity, it would be a safe bet. in that case, "love machine--the final episode" might've been a more interesting flick. certainly better than this yawn-inducing snooze-opera. *1/2 from ****
