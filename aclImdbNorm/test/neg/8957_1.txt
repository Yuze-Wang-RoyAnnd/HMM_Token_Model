this was a shockingly bad movie and i literally gasped the first time seeing the blue screen puppets. imagine the worst blue screen special effects you ever saw, make it somehow far worse, and then combine this with poorly made, rubber and play-doh puppets that look like something from a semi-retarded pre-school art class. then add some screeching, yngwie malmstein-esquire, melodic-metal guitar solos stuff that is way too loud and lasts way too long. the overall film is absolutely awful and makes "feeders" look like "rashomon." its one of the worst movies i've ever seen, with every quantifiable metric spiraling dismally downward, much like a waterlogged turd in the perpetual, slow whirlpool of a broken rest stop toilet. still, though, a film like "actium maximus" is not to be missed by the bad movie conesseuirs out there, even if only by looking up clips on youtube or someplace. this movie is a bit of an eye opener, if you can stomach the ride. i think this director may be mentally ill, though, which is a bit debasing. watching him discuss the project, you get the sense that he truly believes that he's created something wonderful. i guess he's the "star wars kid" of gonzo filmmakers. what a mess. :-)
