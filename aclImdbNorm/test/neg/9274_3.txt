the movie has a good story line, the action is good in some parts, but not all of them. some of the parts, i just felt like the bad guys wouldn't have dosed off yet, from my experience from taking martial arts. some are the actions are long, like always mostly for the boss, but for the least important ones, they were killed or dosed off with a few hits, but some where quite unrealistic or could have done a better job at.<br /><br />the least important actors or stunt people were the right picks for the movie, my girlfriend started to have a crush on them that she started to watch the movie more than she spends her time with me.<br /><br />the movie is good, that is all i can say.
