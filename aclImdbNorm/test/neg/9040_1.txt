the only reason i checked this film out was to see the "early" kim bassinger. that, and the fact that my tv guide said it was a "gripping suspense", and it was three-star rated. the rating must have come from the man who wrote this drivel because the only suspense in this movie was whether i would finish it or not. robert culp turns in what has to be the "disaster" of his career as a cop who is not even close to being believeable. at one point, everybody is a suspect, including a frail old woman. if you want to deliberately set out to watch a badly written, badly directed, badly acted movie...then go for it. it may make you appreciate fine films by comparison. i wish i had that hour and thirty six minutes back.
