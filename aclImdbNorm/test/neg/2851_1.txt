first i have to say that i really love udo kier and have always had respect for armand assante but nothing could save this train wreck of a movie. udo does not even appear till much later in the movie and the acting from everyone is just terrible. the script is all over the place, the dialog is wooden, the "action" is laughable and the plot could be summed up on a dirty cocktail napkin. i really wanted to find something redeeming in this movie but found myself holding my hands over my eyes, shaking my head and repeating over and over to myself, "oh udo.....why???....why?????..". if you are a fan of udo or armand, please don't watch this movie. it will only make you sad for them.
