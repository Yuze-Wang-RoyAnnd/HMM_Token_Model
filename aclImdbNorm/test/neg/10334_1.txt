but certainly a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time.<br /><br />i got this dvd cheap, with sandra bullock as headliner on the case. this is false advertising - she's on-screen for almost 10 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />on the other hand, there was no other selling point for this movie - the dialog was horrible, the editing was apparently done by someone who was strung out on quaaludes, the directing was ... well, let's just say that my 14-yo daughter could do better, but i hope she never sees such faint praise from me. it's possible that the family cat could have done better.<br /><br />sandra does a creditable job for a first film, in the short time she's on-screen - and that's the only redeeming quality of this film. stupid story, poorly written, and transferred to film as only a 7th-grade media class should be able to do.<br /><br />in short, this is dreck.
