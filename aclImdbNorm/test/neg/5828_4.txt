all in all, this is a movie for kids. we saw it tonight and my child loved it. at one point my kid's excitement was so great that sitting was impossible. however, i am a great fan of a.a. milne's books which are very subtle and hide a wry intelligence behind the childlike quality of its leading characters. this film was not subtle. it seems a shame that disney cannot see the benefit of making movies from more of the stories contained in those pages, although perhaps, it doesn't have the permission to use them. i found myself wishing the theater was replaying "winnie-the-pooh and tigger too", instead. the characters voices were very good. i was only really bothered by kanga. the music, however, was twice as loud in parts than the dialog, and incongruous to the film.<br /><br />as for the story, it was a bit preachy and militant in tone. overall, i was disappointed, but i would go again just to see the same excitement on my child's face.<br /><br />i liked lumpy's laugh....
