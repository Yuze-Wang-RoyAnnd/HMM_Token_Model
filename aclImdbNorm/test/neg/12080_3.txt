<br /><br />this film was produced and released as a successor to a ghastly - although fairly popular - slapstick californian beach comedy called hardbodies, but it has little or no connection with the earlier film and is better assessed completely in its own right. it is certainly better than hardbodies i, and is more closely related to films such as venus and summer lovers which were also filmed during summer in the greek islands. the combination of blissful beaches on blue bays with beautiful bare bosoms makes for seductive viewing, but (except for travelogues just designed to help plan your next holiday) even such films require an adequate story line if they are to hold a viewers attention for more than a very few minutes. venus was underpinned by the legend of the re-incarnation of the goddess, and summer lovers had the viability of a "menage a trois" as its theme. in my view both these films were much more successful than hardbodies ii which has a very tenuous story line and depends too much on simplistic semi-slapstick comedy. the use of slapstick quickly becomes tedious, it usually leads to a series of very short self contained cameo sequences that are hard to integrate into an ongoing story line. mel brooks achieved this brilliantly with silent movie, but few other films have succeeded in the same way, and hardbodies ii unfortunately does not. there is also the problem that the slapstick sequences do not co-habit happily with the idyllic and peaceful scenario in which the film is set. the final airport sequences were no doubt intended to provide a hilarious ending for this film but in my opinion they are an example of the worst type of overplayed slapstick pseudo-comedy. they are also grossly overlong, so i left the cinema with a bad taste left in my mouth. this is a film which could have been much more successful with a stronger story line and with most of its slapstick sequences very heavily pruned. as it was released it certainly does not warrant a viewers rating higher than 3.<br /><br />	there is little memorable in the acting, but the cast does its best within the limitations imposed by a meagre story line and poor direction - it is in these latter areas that the failure arises.<br /><br />
