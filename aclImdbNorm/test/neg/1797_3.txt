joseph conrad's novel, heart of darkness is a dark, profound, and lasting novel that portrays the futility and irony taking place in africa. if you are looking for a great book to read over the weekend this is not the book for you. conrad holds nothing back when describing 19th century imperialism, but the novel is meaningless without giving it the reflection and consideration it deserves. if i read this novel looking for a great adventure story i would say that i wasted my time, but looking at in the perspective of explaining the futility of 19th century civilization, i would say this is one of the most significant novels i have ever read. because of the fact that i read this novel in my english class, and we analyzed every page, i think i appreciated the book more than someone would who was just reading it for entertainment. i am not going to lie, this book was difficult and it challenges the reader to dig deep into this novel to find the true meaning. the movie on the other hand i found tiresome and boring. the movie, "heart of darkness" comes no where near giving the book justice. the movie left out many key parts that i consider important to get the true message of the story. if you are having difficulty understanding and visualizing the novel then the movie might be a good recourse but i would not recommend seeing the movie as an alternative to the novel or even a different perspective.
