my jaw fell so many times watching this flick, i have bruises. okay, granted, i really wasn't expecting the quality of, say, the others or even thirteen ghosts (the new one, which was just dreadful and is still head and shoulders above this insanity). someone else noted the thin characters...i wouldn't call them "thin". "thin" implies there might be something to them. how about almost non-existent? in no particular order we have: the girl who will scream; the american who will figure it all out; the macho guy who will just bull through everything until he gets killed: the wise black man who will die early; the extra guy who is there to die first; the extra woman who is there to play tough. that's it. that's your character list and that is what they are and what they remain from beginning to end. if they were "thin" they might, at least, change a little bit from beginning to end. but they don't. well, okay, the american guy decides he's going to stay with the fieldwork at the end and the screaming girl goes back to wherever she came from. that's the change. other than that, they all act according to their assigned roles and rarely betray any real emotion when they finally meet up with the menace.<br /><br />now, the producers get props for an original menace, i will say. i had understood the story was going to be "tremors" but with ants instead of giant worms. i give the writer credit: these are very cool, very scary ants and what they do with bones is excellent. (the first time the "bone snatcher" appear, i admit i jumped a few feet.)unfortunately, the very cool concept becomes alien in the desert very quickly. we get a lot of commentary on ants that may or may not be true, but we don't get much of the mythology on which the menace is based. and we get every monster movie clich'e ever made. people go into places they know they shouldn't and when they have no compelling reason to. moronic characters try to hinder our heroes and die for it. one character does double duty as "scientist who doesn't want to kill the monster but study it". a very cool gadget is introduced only so the american can tell everyone something about ants that, gee, i hope everyone knows anyway. then the gadget is broken. our heroes run out of the one thing that can keep the menace at bay. and then there is that final, annoying moment when we know the menace is still with us--and wonder exactly what and how the hey the hero or heroine came by it. it completely renders everything that went before as useless and false.<br /><br />three stars for the cool use of ants and bones. nothing at all for clich'es, clunky dialogue and dim bulb characters.
