i found this movie to be preachy and unrealistic. it tries to be a movie showing kids fighting against the system, but it doesn't even present a positive solution. i guess i didn't feel really for the kids. i totally can understand what their gripes were and i know how poor the state of schools are, but i found their solution and the way the outside dealt with it to be a big bunch of phooey. if this comes on tv, don't waste your time. watch short circuit again for the 235th time.
