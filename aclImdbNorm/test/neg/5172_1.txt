oh dear, just what we need another essex -cockney garbage effort chronicling the rise of the uk footy hooligan/ rave gangster who did of course follow west 'am (east londan/essex style). didn't anybody tell you that they won the world cap!? and then of course the inevitable decay into uk rave culture underworld. blah blah blah. why how and who would want to fund a film like this i do not know but lets pray that it was from private financiers (lets see ex drug dealers, merchant bankers -we all know what to call them, and the rest of the mockneys) rather than publicly funded means. hopefully with the recession we will not see the like of this again. if we do we will be calling the death knell for british films and of course we will all be able to blame britains number one mockney country gent wannabee gangster guy ritchie.
