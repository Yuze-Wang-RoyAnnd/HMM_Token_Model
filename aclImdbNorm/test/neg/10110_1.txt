this has got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen! the cast is an international one - australian-pretending-to-be-british, stage american and a character with an english name sporting an unrecognizable "european" accent. what passable efforts in acting from this motley crew are totally undermined by a plot and script of especial inanity. so short were the shoestrings of this film's budget and the overall production values are so low that it would have no trouble winning a cinematic limbo competition. in the last twenty or so years we have seen horror films and stalk'n slash thrillers of extraordinary (though not necessarily "high") quality which have been made on no budget at all. recent examples include the poorly made but totally scary "blair witch project" and of course - the most recent - that low-budget winner, saw, featuring practically unknown leads (gary elwes is just someone you don't remember even if you have seen him before). in darkhunters, it is shocking to find a known character actor, dominique pinon and hollywood has-been jeff fahey struggling valiantly to save the film. it is embarrassing to see the once handsome leading man (fahey) in corny makeup uttering bizarrely bad lines. i would have rated this film 0 out of 10 had that been possible!
