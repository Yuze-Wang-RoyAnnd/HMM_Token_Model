i cannot get over how awful this movie was. my eyes want to jump out of my head and my ears are gushing blood from the horrible awful one song soundtrack. there are four kids and dog and they run away from a hospital then get away with stealing two cars and a bus. no one gives them any punishment or anything to correct them. the acting is just so awful it sounds like an instruction video for social studies class. i cannot think of one thing that i like about this movie. nothing. even the kid that loses his dog made me want to vomit. he gets his dog back without the lady even seeing the dog run out the door. maybe the dog was trying to escape out of this movie. then there is some horse manure in the whole mix. it was torture watching this movie. then at the end the oldest boy says something like staying together isn't a crime and they all hug him and love him. stealing gas is a crime. stealing two cars and a bus is a crime and he should have went to juvenile hall or something. avoid this movie at all costs and especially if you want to keep your family together.
