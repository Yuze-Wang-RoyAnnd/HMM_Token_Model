this movie has no heart and no soul; it's an attempt to whomp up a cult film out of the leavings of other, better, directors, principally david lynch and tim burton. rifkin seems to think that if he overloads on a kind of rotted visual style and fills the street with crud and garbage, he's making a statement. but it's not a statement about anything -- except the director's shrill shriek of "hey look at me! i'm an artist, too." but he doesn't have the imagination of an artist, just a good memory for things that worked -- such as some of the actors trapped in this -- for other directors. all of this would be almost acceptable if this movie was not a turgid, boring chore to sit through.
