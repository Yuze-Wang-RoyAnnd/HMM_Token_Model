this has got to be the worst piece of crap i have ever seen. randy quaid funny as a supporting actor in the original, but not as the leading. too much eddie. the original is a classic. like the original, the supporting actor carried the show. ed asner was very funny. he is the eddie of christmas vaction 2! how come snots still looks the same after all those years and everyone else in the original looks 14 years older. after 15 minutes of watching this movie i don't believe i had even laughed yet. the island thing just didn't work. if it wasn't for the good looking south pacific female guide on the island the movie would have been a total loss. i sat on this review for a week and yes, i still think the movie should never have been made. lets hope there is not a third!<br /><br />shawn gearin
