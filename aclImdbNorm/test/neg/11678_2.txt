the movie uses random events of historical significance as its backdrop and willy-nilly criss-crosses the lives and time-lines of its 3 central characters. to what purpose, one may ask? the problem with this film is that the script becomes the 'story', not characters or their lives.<br /><br />it starts off with a bunch of rich, aimless college kids (and a couple of not-so-rich too) drawn into the naxalite movement. affair, rejection and separation follows. people go their own ways, seemingly. only till the heroine forces herself upon them. not once but twice. after a pause in the 'movement', the next hurdle for these 3 is the emergency imposed on the country by indira gandhi. lots of political figures roam around for no obvious reason. the sub-plots are too contrived and don't add up to make a logical whole.<br /><br />the movie tries to impose a false pace but never reaches a true rhythm. barely coherent at times, there is no maturation and growth whatsoever in the arcs of the 3 ex-college buddies. even after they are presumably married, engaged, settled or whatever, they are ever too eager to just ditch it all and head off to a village to have sex with the ex-lover or ex-flame. what fertile imagination the screen-writer possesses. so many 4-letter words are used without any rhyme or reason that its downright abusive!!<br /><br />chitrangda singh has a horrible american accent that she doesn't try to hide. its hideous hearing her mouth clich'e-ridden dialog like 'whats up? i didn't think you'd come' (this, after the hellish nightmare she's just been thru) or, in the beginning, 'i appreciate your concern but i can take care of myself'. yikes. what kind of clown wrote the dialogs for this? she invites her friend in to have a cup of 'south indian' (no less) coffee, wishes someone good morning and then is wished good night by someone else in the family. now whats up with that?!?<br /><br />the countless uncredited villagers and tribals are the best actors. the editing is really erratic with too many cuts. obviously trying hard to make a bold statement, sudhir misra screwed up big-time on this one.
