sure, the concept had already been done with alf and the charmings: thrust modern society onto one or more out-of-place characters. but i loved both shows and watched them religiously until they ended in 1990. when i learned about scorch, i was actually very hopeful for something new, as new tv in the 90's so far hadn't impressed me (but at least star trek: tng and the simpsons were still going).<br /><br />what i got was a big disappointment. the acting was awful, but considering the ridiculous dialogue and wholly unbelievable writing, i can't blame them too much for what they had to work with. there were a few humorous moments, but most of the deliberate jokes seemed forced in their delivery. the whole production work on the show seemed too low-budget for what was on tv at the time. in the 80's it would have fit right in.<br /><br />still, it was the first episode and had to introduce the characters and establish the entire premise of the series, so i gave it the benefit of the doubt. the second episode wasn't as bad, and i started to get my hopes back that once it got into its stride, the show would improve. sadly, my vcr ended up not recording the third episode aired, i never got to see it, and the series disappeared from the tv listings after that. all i have now are the first two episodes recorded off the air onto a vhs tape.
