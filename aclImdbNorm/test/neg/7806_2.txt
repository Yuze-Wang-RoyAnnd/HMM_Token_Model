this film is about the worst i have seen in a very long time. terence stamp's talent is totally wasted and just about the only thing that i enjoyed was hearing a favorite song of mine, "if i had a million dollars" by bnl, in the opening credits.<br /><br />ashton kutcher plays the main character, a nice guy who gets roped into house sitting for his boss. misadventures ensue. blah blah blah. if you have time to kill and having nothing better to do, then this is the movie for you. otherwise, watch something else.<br /><br />there are not necessarily any redeeming moments, but it is nice to see molly shannon and jeffrey tambor on the screen. they are always pleasures to watch though this film managed to dampen even these bright spots.
