this is a pretty simplistic romance. girl finds boy, girl loves boy, girl loses boy, girl finds boy. colleen moore is the outstanding ingredient in this recipe, delivering a wonderfully varied dramatic/romantic performance, well deserving of an oscar nom. equally fine are the aerial combat special effects.<br /><br />moore plays a french girl whose mother has turned over their field to a british aerial squadron during wwi. she is the "daughter of the regiment", loved as a little sister. into this mix comes a fill-in for a downed flyer, gary cooper. at first they hate each other, then they love each other, then the entire squadron is sent out on a suicide mission. cooper returns but crashes in the village and a red cross unit removes him. moore searches for him, is told at a hospital he is dead, then wanders the streets until he calls from a hospital window and they are reunited.<br /><br />it's a nice little romance, but hardly more than that. recommended for fans of ms. moore and mr. cooper
