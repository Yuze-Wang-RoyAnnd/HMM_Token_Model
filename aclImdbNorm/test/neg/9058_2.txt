armed and dangerous is not one of the greats of john candy. this film about a fired cop who ends up working for a small security system run by the mob is very weak and not very much a comedy. there are some moments that i did enjoy, like looking at candy in a pilot suit, but it doesn't seem to matter much. armed and dangerous is still a dangerously disappointing dud brought to us by the director of the equally dumb actioner commando. what a sad excuse for a comedy!<br /><br />1 out of 5
