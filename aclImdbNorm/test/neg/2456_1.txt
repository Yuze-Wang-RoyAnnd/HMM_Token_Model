greetings all,<br /><br />isn't it amazing the power that films have on you after the 1st viewing ?<br /><br />i was so delighted by the first viewing of this film, i couldn't stop talking about "flatliners" to all my friends for weeks - mind you i was a very impressionable 18 year old back then and my taste in films have become a little more conservative since then.<br /><br />then somehow i forgot about this film until i saw the dvd in my local department store and remembering how great it was i thought "right ! i'll pluck you off the shelf when they bring out the special edition".<br /><br />last week, i was overjoyed when my best friend invited me over to watch flatliners on dvd. the expectation was that i would love this film even more on 2nd viewing.. how wrong i was !<br /><br />verdict: after 11 years my view on this film had changed from a very scary 1st class movie to total junk which overplays on the religious and supernatural side of things ratherly superficially.<br /><br />i have never been a big fan of julia roberts' acting (excepting for erin brockeridge in which she deserved her oscar) i think the problem with this film definitely lies with the director and a so so mediocre script. i left this film feeling it had no real substance or potential, and just a couple of scarey cheap thrills which weren't very well done at all. not even the score by james-newtown howard, who i rather like as a film composer, could captivate and thrill me.<br /><br />in 1990 i would have given this film 9.5 / 10; but in 2001 i'd be lucky to give it 2 / 10 at best.<br /><br />
