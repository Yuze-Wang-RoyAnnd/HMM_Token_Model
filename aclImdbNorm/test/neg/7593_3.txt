strange things happen to americans will (greg evigan), maura (alexandra paul) and their young daughter aubrey (briana evigan, greg's real life daughter) when they move into a large, newly inherited house in ireland. crusty corpses are found in the cellar, a turkey squirts blood, furniture moves and the ghosts of a dead child and a cackling old lady show up to scare the little girl. paranormal investigators are eventually called in to banish the evil spirits, but maura becomes possessed anyway and chases everyone around with a meat cleaver.<br /><br />this film is full of cliches, but there's a standout performance from alexandra paul... too bad it doesn't belong in this movie (nor any other i can think of off hand)! she can barely keep a straight face and her over-emoting and hysterical screaming tantrums are a joy to behold. in any case, she's a lot more interesting to watch than anything else in this movie.<br /><br />score: 3 out of 10
