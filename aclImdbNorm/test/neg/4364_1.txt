i am sorry but this is the worst film i have ever seen in my life. i cannot believe that after making the first one in the series they were able to get a budget to make another. not that the budget could have been much - this is the least scary film i have ever watched and laughed all the way through to the end (actually i can't believe we watched it to the end) but i think it is because we couldn't quite believe it.
