very slow, dull, enigmatic film. maybe the kind of film jean-luc godard would have made had he been italian. certainly conveys how tedious, repetitious, joyless and empty a person's life can be, but i don't usually go to the cinema to find that out! the plot (such as it is) doesn't convince. why a gorgeous hotel receptionist (an exception to the dullness of the film) would be the slightest bit interested in a moody, chain-smoking, silent loner who speaks in 'deep' aphorisms baffles me. very difficult to feel any sympathy with the main character. one feels like shaking him by the throat and telling him to 'snap out of it!'. his brother is a much more human character. the ending is inconclusive and puzzling. everyone in the cinema (when i saw the film) went out muttering about how they nearly fell asleep. of course, it shouldn't have to be a hollywood bruce willis-style 'shhot-em-up' and 'crash-bang' fiesta, but a little bit of energy and action would have made it a lot more thrilling. one of the best italian films ever?! pleease...an art-house, curiosity at best.
