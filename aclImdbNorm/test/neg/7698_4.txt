these days, ridley scott is one of the top directors and producers and can command huge sums to helm movies--especially since he has films like alien, gladiator and blade runner to his credit. so from this partial list of his credits, it's obvious he's an amazing talent. however, if you watch this very early effort that he made while in film school, you'd probably have a hard time telling that he was destined for greatness. that's because although it has some nice camera-work and style, the film is hopelessly dull and uninvolving. however, considering that it wasn't meant for general release and it was only a training ground, then i am disposed to looking at it charitably--hence the score of 4.<br /><br />by the way, this film is part of the cinema 16: european shorts dvd. on this dvd are 16 shorts. most aren't great, though because it contains the man without a head, copy shop, rabbit and wasp, it's an amazing dvd for lovers of short films and well worth buying.
