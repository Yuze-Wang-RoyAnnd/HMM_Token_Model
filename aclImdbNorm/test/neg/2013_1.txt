imagine the worst thing that could ever possibly be conceived by human intellect. now imagine something infinitely darker - i mean, worse, than that. then multiply that by the quantity of the suckiness possessed by the star wars holiday special. this movie is by far worse than that.<br /><br />"dracula 3000: infinite darkness", starring such illustrious and reputable actors such as coolio and langley kirkwood (as the film's "horrifying antagonist", count orlock) is equatable to eating one's own feces exclusively for one's entire life, condensed into approximately one hour and twenty minutes. to be frank, there is no way to approach a review of this cinematic tragedy - riddled with communist propaganda, promotion of drug use, futuristic anachronisms, and quite possibly the worst special effects since the (original) "war of the worlds".<br /><br />the hammer and the sickle of the soviet union can be seen proudly displayed throughout the dingy sets they dare call a spaceship. lenin can be observed on several posters throughout the "film". and of course, religion has been abolished for two centuries by then. so they don't know who this "god" is, even though they have no reservations about using his name in vain. but of course, in the socialist republic of space (presided over by interstellar president baker), death-stick like drugs are legalized and quite common. yet handicap mobility seems even worse off than it is today (they don't even have a wheelchair ramp).<br /><br />racial tension still festers throughout the galaxy in quite a familiar/predictable fashion. we receive great commentary on ethnic division through lines such as "is dracula a brotha?", "us brothas gotta stick together", and "once you go black, you don't go back." speaking of the token black characters, one is played by coolio. playing a stereotypical stoner, coolio becomes possibly the most annoying and ridiculous vampire ever. oh wait, second most ridiculous vampire ever. that prized title goes to our friend count orlock, from planet transylvania, in the carpathian system. these two make quite a pair, between coolio's attempts to cripple a paraplegic, strange attempts at making high-pitched animal noises, a hairstyle 1004 years old, and gigantic stretches of completely worthless dialogue; and count orlock's twenty dollar generic halloween-style vampire costume, exploding coffins, or confusingly inane back story.<br /><br />one wonders if they did not simply give coolio the opportunity to get "as high as a kite in space without gravity", let him interact with the other "actors", and just went from there.<br /><br />count orlock's motivations are also somewhat in question. does he want "infinite darkness", as the film's subtitle would have you believe? does he want to eat the crew? or does he want *coolio* to "kill them all"? or does he desire to give handicapped people a chance in such an inhospitably future? it doesn't really matter, because none of this film's plot makes sense anyways.<br /><br />the highlight of this movie has to be it's ending. more for the fact that it means the movie is over than by any merit of the abrupt trainwreck of a climax they phone in before the credits. instead of facing count orlock off in some sort of duel (the closest we get is a shot of orlock flailing around at breakneck speeds in front of our protagonist, who dies shortly afterwards), our heroes beat him by cutting off his arm in an ordinary door. orlock then proceeds to collapse, screeching in pain at a totally mundane yet understandably painful injury. this is by far the most fun you'll get from this movie. watching a vampire's contorted face as he cries in pain will have you on the edge of your seat - with laughter. almost worth the four bucks for that alone. of course, right after that we're treated with one of the film's worst one-liners, the mandatory allusion to sex, and perhaps the most abrupt excuse for an ending *ever*. they're driving into the sun, and their ship literally just blows up before they even come remotely close to impact. i think they just outdid the wachowski bros. for the worst finale ever.<br /><br />i can only sleep at night because we know that a sequel is impossible. secure in this fact, we can safely say that this is the worst movie ever created, and one which will never be exceeded in low quality, lower budget, and lower-est acting talent.
