warning: this may contain spoilers!!<br /><br />first of all i watch a lot lifetime movies and realize they are just that....lifetime movies. some are great (really), some are good and some are bad. unfortunately this movie falls into the latter category. it actually started out with some potential....single, divorced hard working mom (who gets out of work at 2:00 am) cuts a guy off while driving home from work and let's just say he doesn't take it too well. the stalking begins immediately with phone call hang ups and escalates to her home being broken into and completely trashed. so she goes to her mother's for the night and the next morning her mother's car blows up. this seems to be just a pain in the butt for our heroine who deals with it by going underwear and jewelry shopping!!! so the police put her and her son in a local motel for safe keeping and what does mom do? she goes off to work leaving the kid all alone at night in a strange motel room and tells him to order a pizza!!! i couldn't believe it! then it really gets stupid! and the ending just made me angry because it was so ridiculous and typical. too bad because it seemed to have possibilities.
