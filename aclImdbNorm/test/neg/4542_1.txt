well, i like to watch bad horror b-movies, cause i think it's interesting to see stupidity and unability of creators to shoot seriously good movie. (i always compare this movies to - for example - some spielberg's works and again-and-again don't understand the huge difference in what i see.) i like ed wood's movies cause it's so inept it's very funny. but people!!! "the chilling" is not funny and is not even "interesting". it's extremely boring horror movie without anything what makes even bad movies watchable. there's no acting, no screenplay, no direction, no thrills and not even blood. it's extremely inept amateurish film. it's definitely the worst movie i had ever seen (and i had seen a lot of "worst movies" - believe me). i warned you !!! 1/10
