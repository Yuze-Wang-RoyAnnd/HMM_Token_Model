this movie was terrible. it is not something that people should have to pay to see. it looks like some christian group made it to convert people. i don't understand why it was released to theaters and not to tv.<br /><br />it started out like an old fashioned b movie sci-fi film from the 50s, but quickly changed. about 30 minutes into the movie the characters start talking about "god" and "do you believe in jesus?" it quickly moves into pure religion territory.<br /><br />i thought i was going to a sci-fi movie. the film has poor acting; bad camera angles and is amateurish.<br /><br />avoid it!
