you gotta be a fan of the little man but i found burlesque on carmen dull, unimaginative and totally not funny.<br /><br />chaplin is retelling the story of carmen and plays a big role himself as don jose. it's a story about men and the women they love, although it's unclear why one would love such a woman as carmen, as she is playing the men against each other.<br /><br />as i said i didn't think much of it. chaplin made dozens and dozens of better movies so you can leave this one on the shelve.<br /><br />oh and i'm curious what the difference is between this movie and the 1915 version... or is it just an imdb mistake?<br /><br />on the whole: 3/10.
