something strange is happening in loch ness. the water is crystal clear, nor cold. a giant robotic plastic monster emerges and kills scots! what is this movie?! first, i love reading stories about nessie, sea monsters in general. when i saw this for sale, i thought it was a cheap rip off of jaws. no. it was terrible! the story was pointless, acting was 100% garbage, the only up side was the cool mechanical nessie they used. it was full of inaccuracy, wrong locations, and bad everything. not worth your while, just leave it on the shelf (or garbage can) you found it on. on second note, this film was shot in cailifornia, not loch ness, a major diss to nessie fans.
