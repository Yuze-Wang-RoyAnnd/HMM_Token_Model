if i heard the male lead say "this is madness!" one more time i would have barfed. the film is one big cliche, with fake "grind him under your heel" attitudes. not one male in this movie has one redeeming quality; reminds me of soviet-era films with strongly politically-oriented messages. i couldn't even understand why there was attraction between the leads, nor could i wait for the ending.
