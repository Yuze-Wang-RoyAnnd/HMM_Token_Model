junior and his dad start a new life in a new town. it's the same life because junior hasn't changed one bit. he is still the same rotten brat as before only he's gotten bigger. this time he has a pal named trixie and she is only slightly worse. junior doesn't like his dad dating and messes up every opportunity that he has. then grandpa moves in and the dog comes along. i thought that the two of them would have made it a good movie but they didn't even become buddies until the end. this is a movie for the most immature people. it has diapers, farts, doggy do do, and toilet humor in it. only someone under the age of twelve would find this to be super hilarious. i hope when i have a son, he is exactly like junior.
