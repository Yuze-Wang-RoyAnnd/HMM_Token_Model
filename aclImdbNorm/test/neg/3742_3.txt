this film had a couple of funny parts,but for the most part, made me want to go ahead and change dvd's and watch "malibu's" instead,which i had in my own collection. at least i would know there was something funny coming up and give me something to look forward to.<br /><br />i was disappointed in this very low budget film. and i do not judge a movie by it's budget.it just lacked originality and was too predictable. i would not rent or even watch this film again, and i am usually a repeat offender of film. the actors were forgettable. the story was half thought out, and it left me with an insatiable urge to get my laugh on.i ended up watching jamie kennedy's white boy gone gangsta to have the comedy itch scratched.
