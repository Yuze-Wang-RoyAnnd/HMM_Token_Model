god bless randy quaid...his leachorous cousin eddie in vacation and christmas vacation hilariously stole the show. he even made the awful vegas vacation at least worth a look.<br /><br />i will say that he tries hard in this made for tv sequel, but that the script is so non funny that the movie never really gets anywhere. quaid and the rest of the returning vacation vets (including the orginal audrey, dana barron) are wasted here. even european vacation's eric idle cannot save the show in a brief cameo....<br /><br />pathetic and sad...actually painful to watch....christmas vacation 2 is the worst of the vacation franchise.
