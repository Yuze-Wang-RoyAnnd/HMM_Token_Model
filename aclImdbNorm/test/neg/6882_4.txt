i gotta admit it, i love horror films...especially 80s slasher films. hell, i even love cheese like sleepaway camp and night of the demons. but, i didn't think much of this movie. the death scenes weren't very well done, the cgi was terrible, and the acting was ho-hum. worst of all was the story which didn't make sense at all. i'd say save your money but chances are, if you want to see this movie...you're going to anyway. i didn't hate it...it's just not very good. overall, it's just another bland, lifeless horror film that lacks life (it's no surprise that this one was on the shelf at dimension for over a year after it was completed).
