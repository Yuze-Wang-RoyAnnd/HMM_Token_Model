well,<br /><br />first of all, as many reviewers have pointed out - this is a rip off of the martin cahill story - first represented by the bbc and by the john boorman film "the general" - which is a great film and far, far superior to this one.<br /><br />speaking as a native british person, the supporting cast to kevin spacey was really good in terms of british and irish acting talent, especially peter mullan - but it was totally wasted. the characters were c**p! and as for kevin spacey - didn't come across as a loveable rogue but as nothing really substantial or significant.<br /><br />not a lot to redeem this film. the best bits are the gags and tricks nicked from the other films it rips off. compare notes on this film and "the general" - i'd be interested to see what others think.<br /><br />
