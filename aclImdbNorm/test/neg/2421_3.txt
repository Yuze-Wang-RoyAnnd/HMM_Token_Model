i'm from australia and have watched with respect the extraordinary culture surrounding rugby union in new zealand. i can totally appreciate the comments made by kiwis in relation to this movie. it was a total insult to a race of people and their beloved sport.<br /><br />whoever was involved in the making of this atrocious movie should be made to formally apologize to anyone who had the misfortune of watching it. note: people do not kneel down and cry while slowly reciting the hakka. what a pitiful scene this was.<br /><br />are we supposed to feel some kind of sympathy for this idiot who nearly killed his girlfriend, who refused to listen to any advice from anyone with half a brain, then apparently saw the light? what a thoroughly dislikable character (with the visits to children's hospitals doing nothing to redeem his despicable personality).<br /><br />and why are people even making a movie about americans playing rugby? they barely even feature in the sport on the world stage, not so much as to even warrant an attempt at making a movie about it (yes, rugby's a 'world' sport, unlike gridiron and baseball)?
