star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning <br /><br />david (johnathon schaech) and tish (lori heuring) are a couple in budapest, on business commitments and staying at a luxury hotel. one night, they meet an attractive woman at a nightclub and invite her back to their place, where they end up in a threesome. all is well, until david receives some negatives in the mail and he and tish end up being blackmailed. but when some people involved in the deception are found murdered, things get messy and they are forced to enter the seedy underground world of pornography and hardcore bondage to track down the woman who may hold the key to everything.<br /><br />whereas the original film dealt with the concept of snuff films, this straight to dvd sequel deals with the more wholesome (!!!) theme of threesomes and sleazy sex. it plays like a porn film, a cheap piece of titillation with plenty of hot t/a action going on. if this sounds like your idea of a good film, you'll probably like it, but you'd probably be more at home in a porn shop than a video store.<br /><br />this tries to copy the original film's dark and voyeuristic feel, but while it does a pretty good job of this, it still can't hold up to that of the original's. it has an apathetic story, with a dodgy narrative flow. and compared to cage, schaech comes across as interminably wooden.<br /><br />better than i thought it'd be, i suppose, and better than your average one of these dvd direct sequels that seem to be coming out a lot these days, but really, haven't we seen enough? **
