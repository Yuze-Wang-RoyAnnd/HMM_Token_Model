"you can survive anything". anything except a dumb horror flick. the director couldn't even decide whether he wanted a demon or just a plain ol' backwoods serial killer. you can't have both. it's like michael moore trying to have his cake and eat it too (or in his case 1500 cakes) by making his particular charlatan brand of "docu-comedies": they're supposed to be oh-so hilarious and zany, and yet you're also meant to treat them as truth-based, earth-shattering, hard-hitting documentaries. some genres cannot be mixed.<br /><br />"anything can happen to anyone, any time, any place." (translation: this is the horror genre, so we can do any kind of nonsense we want.) this sounds not so much like something "wise" found on a paper of a chinese fortune cookie, but more like the credo of every bad horror film director. we get this baloney of a statement served to us early on, sort of as a preparation/justification of the absurd buffoonery to come.<br /><br />"my phone isn't working!" well, of course it isn't. there is a far greater chance that sean penn's brain starts working (after decades of catatonic apathy) than that a horror-film cell-phone does. the single most dreary and predictable horror clich'e of the past decade. why even say it? we know help will never come via a phone-call, so ye horror-making dimwits might as well just not even mention it. the last 50 horror films i saw use this plot device. it's becoming embarrassing.<br /><br />"you always have to expect the unexpected." the final twist was rather surprising, i'll give them that much... however, plenty of nonsense on the way there.<br /><br />check out the elaborate traps the heroine sets up with the speed of a drugged-up lab rat - in the cold, wet, and almost totally dark conditions. i just love horror-film realism...<br /><br />when a blood-thirsty demon starts trying to be funny (by "shshshing" his victims) then you know your horror-viewing pleasure is in doubt. the less said about the old geezer "cracking wise", the better... another stupid clich'e served by a tired, lazy, uninspired director.<br /><br />what are the odds of being attacked by your husband and then by an eye-hating demon - on the same day? "expect the unexpected". they might as well have squeezed in an event in which she survives a plane crash, and then another in which she encounters aliens who tried to anal-probe her...<br /><br />the fast-forward button needs a temple or a shrine built in its image.
