i love musicals, all of them, from joyous oklahoma, to poignant porgy and bess, to the touching romantic "damn yankees." and i know most of the songs, sometimes singing them spontaneously, with a crowd or humming them alone.<br /><br />in a "real" musical, as differentiated from this vaudeville show, every song is painstakingly crafted to fit the exact moment. it is an expression of sadness, regret, love, joy or exaltation--a natural extension where mere words fail. so, in guys and dolls, "my time of day" describes the adventurous life of sky masterson as it is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman. every song in this brilliant exemplar of the genre sets a mood, or develops a character, creating a phantasmagoria of place, turned absolutely believable by the self disclosing evocations of song.<br /><br />for this lover of the broadway musical, and their adaptations to the screen during the last half of the 20th century, mama mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel fun house distortion of the genre. there, the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate, often delightful, plot lines. while here, the songs, simply picked up from a collection, only interfered with the shaky premise of the film.<br /><br />perhaps most of those viewers who are making this film into a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of 20th century musicals. they have no idea of the magic performed by writer and lyricist that can turn a dance hall floozy into someone whom we know and love, as achieved in "sweet charity."<br /><br />let me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review. perhaps, another day, another mood, i could have gotten into it, and not have been so critical in this review.<br /><br />but i can't help but imagining what richard roger, oscar hammerstein, cole porter, irving berlin and so many others could have done even with with this silly premise. i think about it, while the memories of seeing this film is fresh, and i can not help but to mourn the great loss.
