this episode has just aired in the uk.<br /><br />what a disappointment. the heavy-handed touches of humour were ill-judged, childish and detracted from what could have been a pretty good storyline. i cannot believe that jerry bruckheimer allowed this episode to take place. i have seen every previous episode of this show, and even the episode where jack played his own older self was way ahead of this episode. the lesbian kiss was pathetic sensationalism.<br /><br />there was also no continuity from the previous episode. there was nothing in the storyline investigating martin's dangerous behaviour or possible drug addiction. there was similarly nothing explicitly written about jack's burgeoning relationship with ann. usually without a trace is pretty good at this sort of continuity.<br /><br />the next episode needs to be a considerable improvement.
