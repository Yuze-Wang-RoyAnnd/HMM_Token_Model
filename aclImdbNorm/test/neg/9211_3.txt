something not-so-great. "silence of the lambs" remains demme's only good film, and i'm of course including all the overrated, left-wing exercises in big-screen indulgence some of which i haven't seen - and never will.<br /><br />this is a light comedy that takes a thriller turn somewhere half-way. the first half is a little hard to sit through; it's neither funny nor particularly interesting. daniels plays an over-the-top dumb-as-dirt naive moron who is so gullible and trusting that it defies belief. his animated acting is often annoying, and barely funny. he actually lies to griffith at the outset and tells her that he is married, with children, when in fact he is divorced! in all the history of mankind and movies any man who is married and meets a woman he likes will lie - if he lies - and say that he isn't married. (later on, the not-at-all credible or believable rationale behind this was revealed: he wanted to "protect (himself)". what a load of crap...) the fact that his character makes all the wrong decisions and does all the dumb things in the movie made me actually look forward to liotta pounding on him when he caught up with him in the former's apartment.<br /><br />what then happens in daniels's apartment is the classic end-of-movie fight-to-the-death which the good guy - albeit the very dumb good guy - predictably wins. still, at least the last half-hour has some action, something going on, and daniels isn't given any more the opportunity to be animated. the film lacks credible characters (whether main or marginal), and the feel of it is too 80s which means the movie has a rather bland look; visually ugly. sayles yet again makes a cameo as a policeman. the film is also perhaps a bit too heavy on the coincidences side. griffith once again plays a soft-talking dumb-sounding bimbo, but, as usual, she is convincing because she is a soft-talking dumb-sounding bimbo. this was an earlier film, before her lip-enlargement and breast-enlargement surgery; compare the natural breasts she exposes in this film to the ready-to-explode balloons she briefly flashes years later in "nobody's fool".<br /><br />if you're interested in reading my "biographies" of griffith and other hollywood intellectuals, contact me by e-mail.
