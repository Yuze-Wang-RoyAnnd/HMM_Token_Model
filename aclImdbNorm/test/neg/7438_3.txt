this movie is a fine example of what happens when a studio wants to get a sequel to a fine movie out of the gates at all cost. only with this movie, it truly is a near miss. everything seems in place for robocop 2 to be a worthy followup to the groundbreaking first movie. the complete original cast (apart from the casualties, naturally) returns and gives it their best. too bad a hackneyed script and an incompetent director as good as neutralize their efforts.<br /><br />irvin kershner might have been the ideal go to guy for george lucas to direct the empire strikes back. for a pedestrian filmmaker like kershner there isn't much to ruin in lucas' charmless film series. a worthy successor to a classic like robocop would have needed either paul verhoeven to return, or a director with enough brass to give his own spin on it. kershner doesn't know how to give his own spin on anything (lucas hired him for that) and he's surely no verhoeven.<br /><br />so what we get here is a movie that goes through all the motions to replicate the first movie, but with none of the freshness, humor or daring the original had. kershner probably thought he could top verhoeven by adding more gore and gratuitous violence, but instead he reveals how much he was at work as a director for hire instead of a passionate filmmaker. and that's a shame, since everything was in place to make this another classic. as mentioned the actors give it their best, but phill tippet delivers some groundbreaking stop motion effects and there are some great ideas in the story by frank miller, who was born to write a robocop movie. if only the studio had hired a director who was competent enough to make all the potential come through.
