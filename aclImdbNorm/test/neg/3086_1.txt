one of the worst movies i've ever seen. yes, i know i'm not the target audience. target audience is females, either college age or middle aged or any aged i guess. i'm none of these so the makers don't mind if i don't like it. but that won't excuse the fact that the dialogue and the plot are horrible. the main character, phoebe, goes on a journey to europe to find out what happened to her sister, faith, who committed suicide. phoebe is an inane character that i hope no one identifies with. faith is also a character with very little believability. wolf is the only person who seems to be somewhat reasonable. as i said the dialogue is boring and uninteresting. the plot does completely stupid things at times. the absolute worst is that phoebe and faith's father is an artist but his paintings are completely dreadful. there is nothing new, interesting or refreshing in this movie. if your a guy, you will pray for the ending. if your a chick you might be able to sit through it but you will be unimpressed.
