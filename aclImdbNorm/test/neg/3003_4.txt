"what symbolism!" exclaimed a woman as we exited the theater after viewing the polish brother's paean to ingmar bergman. some symbolism is there all right. but not much. "northfork" adds up to some fine acting weakened by dreary cinematography that fails to make any coherent statement and a muddled story that irritates rather than enthralls.<br /><br />northfork is a town facing extinction after a new hydroelectric dam goes into operation. it's the early to middle 1950s and a squad of identically dressed state agents, all looking as if they had just answered a casting call for "the untouchables," have the job of relocating recalcitrant dwellers who fail to appreciate both their immediate peril as well as the proffered bounty for moving. an exciting anti-development movie is always a possibility but let's get real: rural electrification is one of the greatest advances in bringing decent living conditions and a boosted economy in american history. dams can be built without forced relocation? not in this country.<br /><br />but this film is less about the plight of homeowners than it is a fantastical creation of a dying young boy's escapist imagination. nick nolte is the priest who tends to the lad and much of what he says might have been interesting if the sound was clear enough to hear.<br /><br />alternating between the black-suited evacuation agents (working for "lakefront" land when the dam creates that valuable acreage) and a phantasmagorical collection of weirdos, the film develops neither theme coherently or even interestingly. <br /><br />the cinematography is poor. a washed out, subdued and depressive color permeates the whole film to little dramatic purpose. there is no reason for this vast terrain to be depicted so bleakly. indeed, a contrast between largely untouched natural beauty and the massive and grim solidity of the evolving dam and power plants would have been very effective.<br /><br />4/10.
