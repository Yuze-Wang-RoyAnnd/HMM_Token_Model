i caught a screening of this at the true/false documentary film festival in columbia, missouri, and i was pretty disappointed. i was expecting a cool documentary into the protest and activism surrounding the rnc, but what i got was a largely flawed, bad-acted, fictitious, conspiracy ridden badly woven tale. i'd heard of its neo-documentary technique, "blending both true and false" but i expected more along the lines of a fictitious storyline developed for a better personification and to create a sense of unity between real interviews, but it was more along the lines of a terrible made-for-conspiracy theory tv movie.<br /><br />the acting overall is terrible except for rossario, which is not surprising considering the director at the screening said most of the lead characters had no acting training, his excuse being that he wanted them to be real. heres a hint, real people can't act, but actors can usually act real.<br /><br />it would of been not so cornily offensive if it wasn't blatantly obvious about how keen he was to push this extremely radical conspiracy theory onto us throughout the whole movie, its especially hysterical when we get a scene where the director cameos and starts ranting on about ridiculously stupid theories and secret agendas. the movie also does a good job of laughably stereotyping every single role, it tries so hard to romanticize these street activists and stamp a big 'good' or 'evil' on every character.<br /><br />skip it, maybe find yourself a nice real documentary/
