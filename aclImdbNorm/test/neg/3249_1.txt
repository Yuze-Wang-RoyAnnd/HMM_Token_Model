this movie made me laugh so much. it was a bloody joke to tell you the truth. so unbelievable and the worst plot ever. the acting as well was bad. i don't how come so many popular bollywood actors and actresses took on to do this movie. the script must have been somewhat of a joke. the visual effects in this movie was excrutiatingly painful to watch. i believe that a kindergarten kid could have done a better job of the visual effect and a monkey could have done a better job of coming up with a plot.<br /><br />the plot has numerous attempts at copying major hollywood movies like the terminator but it fails miserably. i laughed my head off seeing this movie. a total disaster in indian cinema history!
