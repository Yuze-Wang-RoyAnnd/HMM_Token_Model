casper van dien... what can i say? i enjoy the guy! his movies bring a certain flair to them that is actually not brought on by the director or producer, but by him! recycled plots... check. rip-offs of better movies... check. wooden acting... check. it's not that van dien is a bad actor (he has been effective in hollywood gloss as starship troopers and sleepy hollow) he just really has not been offered a script worthy of his talents; and yes, he does have acting talent other than being eye-candy. this movie offers a slight hint of what van dien can offer but is bogged down by the production of it all. the script can be better developed (see oliver stone's u-turn). the directing can be better utilized (see robert rodriguez's from dusk til dawn). the dp could've made the desert more exotic (see russ meyer's faster pussycat faster kill!). this script is weak because this is something we have seen before many other times so the double/triple-crosses are expected. the direction is weak because it is not offering anything new and telegraphs many of the weak script moments. the cinematography at times paints a lovely autumn desert flavor to it, but at other times it doesn't take advantage of the scorching light and the beginning sequence is horrible in cornflower blue.<br /><br />now to the acting... van dien shows some grace and charisma to his jake. he neither gets too methodical nor too campy in his role. a nice balance especially since the rest of the cast seems too distracted as to how they should be acting in this film (bad script or bad direction... you make your opinion). the only other person worth mentioning is bryan brown's villain as it provides the only real credit for acting in this film... aspiring actors forget trying to learn how to act in green screen, try learning how to act in a horrendous script and take notes on bryan brown in this film. he adds extra depth to his role and is a nice counter part to van dien's character. jake always seem to either be one step ahead or control of any situation whether if it is out of his control. the femme fatale is weak (this is a desert noir after all) and is another nail in this film's coffin (you decide... script or direction). the rosalita character should've been thrusted forward in the movie instead of being pushed into the back ground later on to make room for the real femme fatale. so watch the film for van dien and brown; and for fun, try to skip a rock across the plot holes laced within the film.
