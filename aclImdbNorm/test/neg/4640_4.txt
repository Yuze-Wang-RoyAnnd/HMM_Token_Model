another day - this movie requires you to watch it another day to understand it. i thoroughly enjoy watching shannen doherty and i was quite interesting in seeing how well julian mcmahon and shannen appeared together following the roles they played in charmed. i can certainly praise the acting skills throughout the film, even the directing - but the plot...what happened? i am at a loss for words because i am still confused. i have to stay loyal to the actors who really did a good job considering the madness of the plot. i also have to recommend you watch it because despite the plot-madness i would still watch it over and over again.
