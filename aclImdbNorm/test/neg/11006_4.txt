director john madden, of shakespeare in love fame, gives us another pretty bad film in ethan frome. the plot centers around a new reverend coming into the town of starkfield where he learns the story of the local crippled man ethan frome's sick wife and one-time romantic tryst with the maid. adapted by richard nelson from pulitzer prize-winning author edith wharton's novel, this film isn't interesting in the least thanks to an abysmally weak script and poor direction that turns scenes that are supposed to be poignant into laughable schmaltz. still, there are other aspects apart of the film that work - the cinematography is well done, rachel portman contributes a lovely score, and while no one is at their best, liam neeson, joan allen, patricia arquette, and tate donovan work well in their roles. but overall, ethan frome is only marginally worthwhile and is easily forgotten.
