soon after this movie was released,salman khan was handed over a 6 year imprisonment.(read further to know why am i mentioning this.)<br /><br />and i heaved a sigh of relief.not that i was happy that he got jail for something which because he was a celeb but i was happy cus this meant no more salman khan movies,no more his histrionics and no more over hyped acting(read overacting).<br /><br />this movie made no sense whatsoever. <br /><br />the scene where the kid belonging to one of the family makes a rocket which was voice activated .according to the movie script it would chase anyone.but ultimately it finds only salman khan bare chested. well this is what happened.<br /><br />the rocked gets activated in another foolish way and you have to have an iq of .001 to believe that. then it chases salman khan ,who was on his water scooter and the chase continues unless he is done with all the possible stunts he could show to foolish audience. (in my regard all those people who have given this movie 5 and above ,unless they are paid to do that.)<br /><br />another of breath taking ,unbelievable scene was at the end when all the arrangements about the marriage is made and salman khan with govinda in disguise comes and stall the marriage by another of those highly unwanted songs .later on even though everything is done and ready a mere confession of govinda and katrina kaif to katrina's father and bingo . everything is fine and govinda marries kartina....<br /><br />this made me wonder if convincing was so easy why did not they do that and tortured us for so many hours and wasted my money.<br /><br />this movie is must avoid and don't even think it had any scene worth watching . the plot is way too disconnected with characters popping from no where and ultimately vanishing..for ex choota don...what a waste of characters.<br /><br />after this movie i took a pledge that i would not watch salman khan movies for the rest of my life unless it wins an oskar...(hahahah...which means i would never watch)
