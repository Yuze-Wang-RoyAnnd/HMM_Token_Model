pretty visuals and a lot of fights make not a good movie. and that is precisely what happened here.<br /><br />first off, let me admit, i am yet to play ffvii (i intend to order it soon). however, i did do research to familiarise myself with the characters and the story. however, not everyone has the luxury of time to research things like this, and advent children demands that knowledge of ffvii is required.<br /><br />in spite of incredible visuals, i can't say there is too much thats new. we've seen it in final fantasy: the spirits within, and apart from some better movement, i can't say they've done lots of super-daring stuff with this.<br /><br />the fight scenes - well, they are a bit of fun. still, how could we ever doubt the result of any of them. this one was boringly classic - there were three fights with the bad guys, following the standard procedure (the hero, cloud, gets smashed, then he almost gets there and gets smashed, and then finally wins). the reason i say it was boringly classic was that it is used a great deal, but in this case is poorly executed. i'll touch on that later.<br /><br />the english dub seemed fine to me, though i didn't watch it in japanese, so i shan't judge the japanese dub, but only the english one. i'll say this - i've heard plenty of better ones, even in my limited repertoire.<br /><br />and now, the plot. ummm... what plot? let me be frank, this movie is nought but a fan service, a chance to see the ffvii characters on the big screen with lovely eye candy. as i said earlier, the fights seem to just happen for no reason. the opening fight is never explained, kadaj seems to have neither ambition to destroy the world himself nor any real motivation to do anything nasty. cloud sits around moping for the entire film, and pretty much everyone else gets an obligatory cameo.<br /><br />really, ffvii was an ensemble piece. advent children is anything but. if they'd managed to give everyone some significant story role (star trek: first contact proved it was possible, i might add), then this could have been a lot better. naturally, that would have changed the plot too, which, lets be honest, is almost set to be better than the one we got.<br /><br />characters were also generally either unused or virtually forgotten. the members of avalanche (thats the group cloud worked with in ffvii, for those who don't know) get 2 scenes (3 in the case of vincent valentine, and some get even less). hell, the bad guys get more lines than these guys, and that is pretty bad.<br /><br />the music... well, i don't care if nobuo uematsu is god himself, he botched this film big time. advent one winged angel was the only decent piece. otherwise, he couldn't decide whether to be epic (and orchestral) or fun (with electric guitar). when he switched from one to the other, you felt it as though he'd taken a sledgehammer to your head.<br /><br />and that last point on whether this movie was epic or fun... it tried to be both, and failed miserably. honestly, you can't please everyone and do everything. the movie also tried to be deep (you can go epic and deep, or fun and deep, but all three is too much), but failed here too. the last scene, which is reminiscent of a baptismal ceremony, was thrown in there for what looks like the sake of it. you don't need to be a christian to just shake your head and cry there. that scene just didn't belong in the film (and nor did aerith's frequent appearances - she's dead jim!).<br /><br />given just how fantastic i've heard final fantasy vii to be, this movie is nothing short of a gigantic disappointment. because of the beautiful visuals, i give it a 2 out of 10.
