ever once in a while i run into a movie that is so embarrassingly bad i wonder why movies exist. this is one of them. this is a terrible attempt to parody the godfather with annoying cartoon sounds, and bad dialogue. eddie deezen is just plain annoying as tony, an annoying twit who upon his father, don (william hickey)'s request, takes over the family business. tony, as i said, is an annoying little twit. this makes the whole movie a complete mess. the movie is terribly daffy. it's too cartoonish. the main point i'm trying to make is that you can't make a parody of an acclaimed drama like the godfather with so much cartoonishness. it doesn't work that way. believe it or not, you have to take a parody of a dramatic movie seriously. if you don't take it seriously, it will feel too much like a parody. the thing about doing a parody is that you can't seem too much like you're doing a parody. you have to make it seem like you're taking the movie at least a little bit seriously. it also feels like they're just mocking woody allen, and that's what makes this movie absolutely terrible.
