being (somewhat) an independent filmmaker myself, i really understand what these guys were trying to do and it sounds like a good idea. on paper. on 16mm film, however, it's awful. i didn't realize the thing was made in the mid 90's because the film was so grainy and bad i would have sworn this was one of those 30 year old flicks where a porn producer tried to go mainstream. and the sound! ugh, i don't know what kind of mic they were using to record but it sounds like someone is walking over dead leaves throughout the entire thing. i guess i shouldn't judge too harshly, after all, how many feature films has my company put out? none, but i'd like to think that we'd at least have good picture and sound quality to go with our poor acting, writing, and directing. a+ for idea, f-- for execution.
