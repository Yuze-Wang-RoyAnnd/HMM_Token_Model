even by the standards of most b-movies, this movie is by far the worst i've ever seen. the graphics are so poor that a man in a monster suit looks more realistic. the ocean water effects are especially laughable, including the one scene where they board the mini-sub, and the "water" looks like its frozen in place. the problems with this film are so numerous that i'll just stop here with the details. needless to say, i kid you not when i say that even uwe toilet boll himself could do a better job. avoid this movie at all cost, there are other b grade movies out there that, despite being horrible, are at least a good way of passing the time by.
