the opening scene keeps me from rating at absolute zero. i wish the entire movie was as gritty and real as the intro.<br /><br />in order to enjoy some movies, a lot can be forgiven,(hand guns with 60 shots, hero's with super human powers, all women are gorgeous and half naked) but puuuuleeese this "assault on my intelligence 13" is so far fetched that i'm surprised the cast showed up for a second day of filming.<br /><br />firstly, how did these guys get to be cops? based on stupidity i guess. how do the main female characters justify being half naked in the middle of winter in detroit or wherever the heck they are. as a matter of fact no character reacts to the elements whatsoever in this movie. no windows, no electricity(which miraculously returns unexplained)during the storm of the century and they are all comfy as bugs in a rug. what technology exists which disables all cell phones, radios, and brain function. this must be the same power which causes maria bella to walk from her disabled car knee deep in snow with no coat and hardly any dress.
