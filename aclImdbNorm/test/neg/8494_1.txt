what the hell is this movie about? well, if i didn't know that "son of the mask" is categorized as comedy, i would never have a clue! a comedy? a tragedy, that's the right genre for this yet-another-so-called-sequel.<br /><br />yes i've watched "dumb and dumber" but i never believed somebody will ever make it's title real in hollywood. yes, you watch "son of the mask" and you think.. 5 minutes - dumb... 10 minutes - dumber... 15 - minutes dumbest... and then, after 16 minutes there is only one thing to say :/ i'm out of here...<br /><br />sorry, my nominee for comedy crap of the year 2005.
