a trio sit at a restaurant table and stare wordlessly into space. later, they lean on a rail and stare across the channel at england. a man works a hoe repetitively in his garden, only his head and upper torso visible on the screen. a man and a woman watch another man peeing against a stone wall. each of these silent shots lasts for roughly one full minute. absolutely no information is imparted that could not be given to us in about one quarter of the time. the editor must have been half asleep. i know i was.<br /><br />the movie open with a startling shot of the raw vagina of an obviously dead body. one's gorge rises. but then the policeman (schotte) exchanges a few words with a neighboring couple and begins to tag along after them and the case is forgotten for the next half hour while schotte and his friends trade unfunny insults with each other and with strangers. eventually the thread of the case is picked up again but proceeds slowly, almost aimlessly, following the stylistic pattern already established.<br /><br />sometimes in movies like this, the location shooting provides a kind of atmosphere that compensates for the dullness of the story, but not here. the houses of the french village are attached to one another in long rows. the house fronts abut the pavement directly, with no steps. the fronts show virtually no decoration and are pretty much indistinguishable. the flat farmlands are featureless. what might have been one of the more interesting episodes -- a visit to a stone fort on the coast -- bores the trio until they begin behaving like snots and are asked to leave.<br /><br />the acting is minimal. nobody seems particularly anxious to say anything. no jokes are made. nothing amusing happens. the policeman has a face almost as interesting as randy quaid's. the babe, a tall hefty blonde, looks like the kind of shot putter on steroids that the east germans used to field at the olympic games.<br /><br />i sat through more than an hour of it before giving it up. maybe i'll take a crack at it some other time. unless i've missed something or unless it turns into some deranged monty python routine towards the end, i don't think you'll get much out of renting it.
