this film is simply appalling, how the talent involved made this is beyond human belief.iguess they must have been boozing when they thought of this idea,i feel as if 2 hours of my life have been taken from me.harvey kietel will try and distance himself from this rubbish, it should have been a great crime movie but it develops into a gory mess of vampires.i would recommend this film to people who like to sleep through movies ,you wont miss a thing.the humour is set to appeal to the lowest common dominate, movies can uplift us and remind us that life is worth living, this film just depresses you.as deniro said in one movie the saddest thing in life is wasted talent this film is a perfect example of this statement.
