there was a time when the alien series was a success with even the third installment, alien 3, showing promise under the guild of a fresh and young david fincher. the first predator was a box office hit mainly due to its story, "in peak" star arnold schwarzenegger and director john mctiernan (die hard). the films alien, aliens, alien 3 and predator were all highly successful and created massive followings among general film fans and science fiction fans alike. arguably predator 2 and alien resurrection should have signaled the end for both franchises, but studios were undeterred and saw the opportunity to pander to the rumours among fans and combine the two. step in paul w.s anderson, alien vs predator, and now the brothers strauss (visual effects graduates, not even directors or writers). the problem was that by allowing such profound and revolutionary creations of the sci-fi genre to fall into the hands of firstly a mediocre director and now directorial newbie's has led to nothing more than profanity, epitomised by incompetence. upon witnessing alien vs predator requiem (avpr) die-hard fans will feel sick to their stomachs that this series could have got any worse.<br /><br />one example of the cinematic deterioration of this franchise is in the opening scene and is likely to cause nausea among fans. the film begins with an alien making its way onto the predator ship, spurting from the predators chest, growing in to a full grown predalien and bringing down the predator craft (which now seems to have far less predators on it than it did at the end of alien vs predator) and all this occurs with the ship still in earths atmosphere. once the ship has crashed avpr quickly resorts to cheap plot methods and basic narrative conventions, it makes no venture at utilizing any of the twists or subversions served up in the two original films. the wearisome plot progresses with tedious pace, punctuated only by the near rousing conflicts of alien and predator and when that runs the risk of boring us we are treated to either an alluring blonde in a bikini or rapid gunfire. avpr is plagued by an endless array of continuity errors and plot holes with little or no narrative elucidation i.e. members of the public outwitting an elite military unit or the predator not adhering to laws established in previous editions. this is a film that has a complete disregard for its predecessors, it breaks some of the most fundamental rules of a sequel and in doing so one gets the feeling that it is trying to set itself up as a stand alone feature. independently the film has no heart, no conviction and no soul and with reference to the other films lacks even the most basic continuity. this is exemplified by the over arching narrative of the film as it undermines the basic premise of the first alien. because if the species had been encountered before then those in the first alien film would have been more proficient and not so ill prepared when encountering them.<br /><br />on a cinematic note the film is close to being dire, i felt urged at some points to shine a torch at the screen, the lighting was so bad. through utilizing such gloomy and dark effects the audience may feel as though they are being cheated out of some the action
