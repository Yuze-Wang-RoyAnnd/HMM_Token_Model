the plot for a movie such of this is a giveaway. how can you go wrong with a gay plot line and all the colors and music of india - a story like this writes itself. i'll watch most anything, but this was unwatchable. the sad thing is, the white folks are the most colorful in the film. vanessa was a riot with a mouth like a sailor, and jack was great eye candy, but everyone else was so boring. saeed jeffrey, who was exceptional in my beautiful landrette, did what he could but the story was so boring. the saving grace was really the background music, which made it ok to laugh at the film, instead of with the film, or not at all. there are many other better gay movies, ethnic movies, just plain movies. i give a lot of low budget movies a pass, but this shouldn't have been made, or should have been made by someone else.
