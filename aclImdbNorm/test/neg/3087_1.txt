the films' producers are hoping that cameron diaz' name will help sell this picture. unfortunately, nothing can save what has already been captured on the screen. despite some beautifully shot european locations and some solid production design elements, the film fails mostly due to its awkward, unbelievable romance between brewster and eccleston. an unplesasant filmgoing experience.
