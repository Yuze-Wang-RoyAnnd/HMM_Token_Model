i thought sleeper cell was interesting, and exciting to watch, up until the last episode, when nothing happens, its f****** bs, you americans portray muslims as terrorists, and the americans as hero's, its the other way around, i hate it when every american tv show ends up predictable, i was hoping the bombs would go off in that stadium, but i knew it would'nt, it takes the joy out of watching it when you know that the good guys are going to save the day, yet again, americans are the biggest terrorists, g bush the leader of them all, he is to blame for 9/11, and i'm p***** off that you keep throwing these shows at us, which are all the f****** same! i've a good show about terrorism, its called " the whitehorse" and bush himself the cell leader, its the same with 24, how ever 24 was good, sleeper cell is a mock and should never make a season 2, its f***** joke! and so are you american producers.
