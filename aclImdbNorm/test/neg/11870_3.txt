i am from romania ... and for that i apologize if my english is not so good.<br /><br />i just finished watching this movie and i must say that i am extremely disappointed. i always liked wesley snipes's movies but this one is terrible. i regret that i spent over 3 hours downloading this film. there are a lot mistakes in the film. for example, the stadium in the film is not lia manoliu. the name of the stadium is ghencea. the name of the soccer team is called steaua bucuresti, not uli.the scoreboard of the stadium is not capable of showing graphical images: video replays, live images etc. it's a simple scoreboard that can only display letters and numbers. the uli(seaua) team's opponents are displayed on the scoreboard as din ( probably from dinamo bucuresti - who are steaua's main rivals in the romanian soccer championship). the images from the soccer match are from a match between steaua bucuresti and poli timisoara (my favorite team and my only love - look it up on the internet and you will see why). the police cars in the movie are not properly made. there isn't a single dark-blue police car in romania! they are all white! the "mistake list" can go on and on and on ... but i will stop here! in short terms this movie is horrible. it does not worth renting it, it does not worth buying a cinema ticket for it, it does not worth downloading it! i honestly feel sorry that wesley snipes played in this movie. a previous movie of his ... 7 seconds ... also filmed in romania ... was ok but this is terrible!
