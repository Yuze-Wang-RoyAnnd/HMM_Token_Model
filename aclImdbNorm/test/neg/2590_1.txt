i couldn't believe how bad this film was, and trust me, i was not expecting a masterpiece from a made-for-cable film. i taped it just because i liked jane seymour. i've seen her enough to know that she is certainly an accomplished actress, so i just don't know what happened here. the characters were shallow, the dialog stilted, the acting bad, and yes that includes seymour. it was nice seeing her play against type, but not in something this bad. i noticed that she carried a credit for executive producer, so she cannot escape blame for the sheer badness of this film. and oh, yeah, they had barry bostwick playing the male lead. 'nuff said.
