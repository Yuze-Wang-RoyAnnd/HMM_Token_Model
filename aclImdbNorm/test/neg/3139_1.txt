this film has to be one of the most boring films ever made. the only thing i liked is using argento-esquire lighting in most of the scenes. the music is awful and the pace is so slow that you can watch it at 2x the speed and even then it would be slow. the story doesn't exist. it doesn't even have any shocking scenes.<br /><br />it is classified (on this site at least) as a horror, but it's not. it's a sort of an art film exploring the dark side of the human nature. if you are into that kind of thing and can stand the slow pace, then watch it, but i'd rather recommend you something japanese (e.g. ichi the killer) i think that the only reason this film was never in theaters is a fear of audience committing collective suicide caused by the huge amount of boredom generated by this movie. these 80 minutes of it's length would've been better spent watching the paint dry.<br /><br />i gave it 1/10 simply because there is no 0 in the pull down menu
