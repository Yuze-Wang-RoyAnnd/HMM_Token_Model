did people expect "jurassic park 3" to be full of surprises? not one moment of it is worth it. many elements could easily scare people out of the movies...and it's not the dinos! tea leoni...i think she's a great actress, but i'm sorry to say that this time she reached the bottom line. i wonder if she happened to strain a vocal chord while shooting the movie....laura dern...she's ok, but why not be more noticeable in the movie, maybe exchange smart dialogs with sam neil. alessandro nivola - "have you ever heard of something called facial expression? fellings, emotions..."..he's got to work harder on that! sam neil, no big deal. the soundtrack...got to change that record, or you get tired of it. my applause goes to william h. macy, a talented actor who i've never seen playing a bad role....unfortunately he can't save the movie, nor can the well computer-created dinosaurs.
