spoiler with plot explanation: a poor family is being thrown in the middle of war between the evil guy (that pops out from nowhere, and no questions asked... ) that went wacko, and casper the friendly ghost trying to avenge his death. with every frame movie gets more and more predictable, a big disappointment. ending seams completely dumb, it has nothing to od with the movie itself, i think someone run out of ideas or just get to the point that movie is s**t this way or other, so it may as well have a stupid ending. waste of time, resources and money. actor play is very poor. if you think about the dialogs you may find out that family conflict is artificially enforced by poor communication between characters. some scenes seam random. in summary: boring, predictable, poor, pathetic. waste of time, and money.
