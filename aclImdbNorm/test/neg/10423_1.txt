i saw this film in the movie theater. i was taking classes at the second city chicago and of course the buzz of this movie was intense. it is a woodward film about one of second city's native sons.<br /><br />everyone knew about johns history. everyone knew how he died. some even knew that the lore did not make him out to be particularly friendly towards women in improv or comedy.<br /><br />but hey. the man led his life and he was loved intensely by the people who were in his world, and lore also states that he treated all of his close friends with love and respect.<br /><br />this movie. well. forget the idea of poor michael chilklis (who is a really great actor) being in a really astonishingly bad film, and really only relegated to doing an impersonation of the man.<br /><br />forget the idea that they could not get the rights to any of belushi's work...and all the snl scenes never happened that they portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />screw the idea that half of the historical information in the film did not even follow bob woodwards work. kinda saying "okay...we are about to mess with belushi...now lets go after woodward too..." they also decided to take the premise of it's a wonderful life and turn it into it's a horrible life on crack.<br /><br />is he a guardian angel or the devil? is the pinball machine the devil's assistant electronic device...how many different endings can you tack onto to a movie? it is one of those movies after it is over...you look at the person you are with and in stunned disbelief go "what the hell was that?!" in some circles this movie has become a kinda cult classic. but for good reason.<br /><br />a good cult classic you sit around the screen and make fun of (or throw out snappy one liners) to the screen. a cult film is never good. and most people would never watch them in any serious context.<br /><br />if you want to watch some classic bad late 80's fair stoned? rent wired. if you want to know about john belushi...you can get more information off of the walls of second city chicago than this movie.
