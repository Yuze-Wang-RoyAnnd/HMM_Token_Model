i only saw the first part of this and concluded that i wouldn't miss anything if i didn't watch the second episode. the cinematography was ok, but apart from this, the plot was just as commonorgarden and run-of-the-mill as any other war story. the actors and actresses play their characters without any passion, and the make up is really bad (heiner lauterbach with his white hair and kai wiesinger respectively, as if some dyed white hair could give them more dignity and common sense). i mean if you've watched more than two or three movies about wwii (as most of us have) then you'd only go to the trouble of seeing a third or fourth one if it promises some new insights or twists in the plot. but roland suso richter seems to afraid of doing so, you can almost smell his fear of not living up to the bourgeois and jejune expectations of the conservative zdf tv channel while watching this movie. millions of euros were spent to perpetuate boring and unimaginative german film-making. these millions of dollars could have been spent to make three or four independent movies, but no, let's give to some director who'll make a film that tells people that war can be explained by rational means. my advice: read joseph heller or kurt vonnegut instead. they'll tell you what war is like! or give me one million euros and i make a better film than this load of bs! and another thing: why is it that german movies only get to be nominated for the oscars when the movie deals with wwii or the holocaust? probably because that is the only thing german film-making is good at. and that should get us thinking, shouldn't it?
