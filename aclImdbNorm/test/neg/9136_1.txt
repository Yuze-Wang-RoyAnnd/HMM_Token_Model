please?! if this is about technology and what man does to kill others and ourselves, i think i missed his entire point. because i walked out feeling like reggio relied on cold-war-era footage of space exploration, and had nothing new to add to the dialogue about fears of technology. trails of 1 and 0, denoting technology and math and science -- done that. anyone out there see the matrix? and motion studies of people in motion? ever heard of edward muybridge? at least he uses exact clips of muybridge's photographs of human motion studies.<br /><br />this film was derivative, and the score is just enough philip glass to sound like everything he's done in the past 10 years... avoid this film at all costs!!
