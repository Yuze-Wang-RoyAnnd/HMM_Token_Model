wow...as a big fan of larry mcmurtry western tales and the lonesome dove series in particular, i was s-o-o-o looking forward to comanche moon. what a tremendous letdown. maybe my expectations were set too high because of the all around excellence of lonesome dove...the story, the characters, the cinematography, the music...it all worked.<br /><br />comanche moon by comparison comes across like a bad saturday night live skit. the characters are completely colorless, the dialogue is babble and the plot meanders mindlessly all over the place. it seems like the actors are all reading from teleprompters. i couldn't relate to any of the characters, good guys, bad guys, not even the incidental characters. david midthunder's performance stands out in particular. it looks like it was plucked out of an eighth grade middle school performance. i'm sorry, i'd like to find something positive to say about comanche moon, but i just can't do it. there's nothing there.
