spoilers ahead jeeeeeeeesussssssssss.... i have a saying: "insecticides kill insects and moronicides kill morons..." the "ghost" in this movie kills morons. several of the people who get killed in this movie are actually asking to get killed, by running into abandoned houses, going after ghosts, etc...<br /><br />on a strictly cinematic aspect, this movie sucks real bad. the three story lines are shown to be parallel and suddenly, we learn they are separated by at least a few days. it's a cheap shot...<br /><br />also, the "thrills" are so cheap, they are laughable. even "nightmare on elm street" didn't sink so low as to show someone being attacked by his own sweater... it's pathetic.<br /><br />save your money, stay home, and you won't have a grudge against the filmmakers..
