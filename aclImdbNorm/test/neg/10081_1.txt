when i went to see this i thought, i liked the first two and thought that they were very suspenseful so this one should be good also. wrong! there was no suspense and they don't explain about the new dinosaurs! when i was done watching this i had lost all respect for steven spielberg and michael crichton but then it turned out that it wasn't directed by spielberg or written by michael crichton! this movie was going through "the motions." i thought that this movie had absolutely no plot and i thought that no one should waste their money to see it.
