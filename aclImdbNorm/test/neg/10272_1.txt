put simply, this mini-series was terrible. let me count the ways. 1. absurd plotting. 2. over-acting. 3. scattershot approach to characters. 4. annoying narration. 5. inability to create viewer interest.<br /><br />this film can't even pass the "soap opera for dummies" test. i'm sorry i have not read this award-winning novel, so i am judging it only as a film, but it really stinks. imagine going to a party where they show you dozens of appetizers. you look at the wide variety and want to taste them, but suddenly they are withdrawn, and you wonder where they went. that's like this film, with way too many characters introduced and never drawn out. there are enough stories and characters in this film to create a 20 episode series, yet we are given less than four hours to digest it all.<br /><br />there are more facial expressions and reaction shots of ed harris than you'll find on 10,000 monkeys. the pace is extraordinarily slow. <br /><br />dennis farina and helen hunt are so far over-the-top that their characters are not believable. joanne woodward's character is one-dimensional. <br /><br />the persistent river metaphor becomes trite.<br /><br />and, probably the most absurd part of the film--the cat. this evil and vengeful cat who follows the hero around to scratch him and his seat covers--well, come on now---it's not even good stephen king!<br /><br />probably the most interesting character in the film, and one who is not drawn well, is john voss, the disturbed boy whose final act of desperation accounts for the only plot device that works in this film.<br /><br />just about everyone in this film is unbelievable.<br /><br />to sum up, there's little here to inspire. the drama is poor melodrama. it's just a terrible effort.
