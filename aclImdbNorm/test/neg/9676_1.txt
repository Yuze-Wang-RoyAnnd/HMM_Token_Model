nbc should be ashamed. i wouldn't allow my children to see this. i definitely would tell my church to stay away. this movie is proof as to why nbc has always been a 3rd rate network the producers, actors, and writers should get on their knees and beg god's forgiveness for making this work of fiction. there were no pirates. noah's wife didn't parade around on the deck of the ark. the ark had no deck. lot wasn't even born when this event took place. did anyone attached to this project try reading the bible? there were more than two animals of each type taken. read the story in genesis. how could anyone bring this to any screen, small or large!
