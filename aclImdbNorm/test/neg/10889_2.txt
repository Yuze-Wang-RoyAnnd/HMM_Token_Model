this movie is not a horror movie. there is nothing scary about it it's more of a torture flick. and it doesn't make sense to me, there is a few scene's with disappearing bodies. for instance he woman in the beginning of the movie. that get pulled away returns for a scene in the restroom with nicole and she and she completely disappears. then she kills the police officer to put him out of his misery and he disappears plus had to shoot him in the head twice to kill him i don't think so especially when you can see his head half blown off and didn't kill him? the at the end she sets the killer's truck on fire. that but he's not in it. he is standing behind her. then it cuts to the rest stop has been completely remodeled and some people are at the rest area and a new girl comes in and nicole in asking for help like the first girl totally no sense in this movie. save yourself some money and skip this movie.
