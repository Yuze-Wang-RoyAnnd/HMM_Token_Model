the film tells you to be aware and conscientious. it also destroys any and all things, the bible claims to be true. to people like me the first episode was interesting and the second was disastrous. it has been called "blasphemy", and it is, if you are a believer. it is sad to hear, that many people think of it as a good sequel to the bible. however, the film shows you a lot of things and subjects, that can be interpreted as a filmic version of the "revelation". some of us think, that such things are not to be abused. one good thing about the film is, that it strongly encourages ethical awareness and makes you consider your actions twice. the director just seems to forget, that some people act that way already solely based on the fact, that they believe and love as prescribed in the bible... why attempt to change that, unless you be the devil yourself?
