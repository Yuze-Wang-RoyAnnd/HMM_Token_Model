this is one of the worst movies, i've ever seen. not only, that it is a comedy, which isn't funny, but it's also very badly made with an over the top direction full of unnecessary split screens and other effects.<br /><br />the two "heroes" with their fantasy language are just annoying and it confused me quite a lot, that they touched each others genitals all the time. but the worst of all that nonsense is the cheap attempt to give that movie some appeal, by referring to german history and to show sensitive aspects of the "heroes", which finds its climax in showing how erkan and stefan cure a mentally ill woman with their "joyful" lifestyle (!). but i hadn't expect anything better by director michael "bully" herbig, who also made two not funny tv-shows, a not funny western movie and a nearly not funny sf-comedy movie. but erkan and stefan had been- just a little- better in some of their stand-up programs. for me the only good thing about the movie is alexandra neldel, who is very beautiful to me.
