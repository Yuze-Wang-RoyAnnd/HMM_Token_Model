historical movies always take liberties -- conversations are concocted where no one could actually know what was said, customs are adjusted to be comprehensible to modern audiences, etc. however, historical films about actual historical personages should make at least a minimal nod to history. this film does not. the only scene i actually remember is when our hero surprises an assassin who creeps into his chamber at night. he confronts the dangerous intruder with, "i don't remember sending for room service". the main entertainment value is in its badness; i recommended my local video story put it on the "turkeys" shelf.
