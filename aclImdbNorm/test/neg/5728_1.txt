i watched this movie, or part of it, in hope that it would be fun to laugh at how bad it was, but it soon became clear that this was just plain silly. for one you have the worst acting ever! the lead "actress" birgitte nielsen is terrible, uninspired and hardly even attractive. and she certainly do not look like the female warrior who could easily kick some veteran warrior kings butt, but she does. and whats with the feminist attitude, it's plain hypocrisy. for one her family was killed by a women, then she joins some warrior school or something so she can learn how to fight men. she then joins up with a fat servant and his child king, whose city was destroyed by gedren. those two characters are just plain stupid and destroys the little of atmosphere that the movie managed to create. after this i could not take any more of nielsen painful acting, and the stupid clich'es and lack of some real action.<br /><br />schwarzenegger as kalidor was the only part of this movie which actually made it remotely watchable. <br /><br />i liked the conan movie, but this is pure crap!
