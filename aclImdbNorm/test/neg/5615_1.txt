despite a great soundtrack and the presence of the ever amazing rappaport and woods, this is another one of those moronic comedies where new york throws itself at the hero in an effort by the writer and/or director to show what a zany place it is. yeah there's some other stuff in the movie that sucks too, but that's what's important. the trend for new york independent filmmakers seems to be "i don't need to be talented, i have new york!" okay, to be fair, the movie has its moments. the flashback bit about why the one guy is called wacky jack was pretty amusing. the script isn't a story or a plot, it's a bunch of not-good scenes tied to each other by featuring the same character.<br /><br />one of the worst things is that there's no motive behind what the characters do. uncle sam has the kid deliver the drugs, why? if its so important why didn't sam do it himself? then the lead character lies his ass off in scene after scene with absolutely nothing to gain from lying. the guy falls in love with a flight attendant with neither of them having any reason to fall in love. the characters are a bunch of pawns for the writer to move around to see if he can get anything zany to happen.<br /><br />if you're easily amused or like watching bad indie movies because they make you feel smarter than watching bad mainstream movies, watch this. if you want to see what a good light hearted crime movie looks like, watch takeshi kitano's "brother". "kicked in the head" is the perfect example of why so many people hate offbeat indie movies: a lot of them suck. and a note to the director: don't be afraid to excite, amuse, enlighten or entertain the audience now and then. being boring doesn't make you a better filmmaker than the ones who can interest me.
