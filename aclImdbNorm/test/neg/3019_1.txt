this is possibly the worst thing i've ever seen on television. first, i'm pretty sure it takes itself entirely seriously, and i tend to be pretty good at recognizing satire. second, it displays aristotelian levels of chauvinism; in one of the ads for it, one of the "playas" describes women in terms of "quality". third, every contestant i've seen on it (six, i think) was a dim-witted meathead of the variety likely to possess a facebook with "boning u" or "women" entered under "here for". to paraphrase roger ebert, this doesn't scrape the bottom of the barrel, nor deserve mention in the same sentence as barrels. the closest thing to a redeeming feature i've experienced with regards to key to the vip was having a female friend reassure me that the male cast were indeed the opposite of attractive, in both physical and mental terms.
