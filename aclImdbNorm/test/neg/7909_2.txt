i wholeheartedly agree with greg in ontario. i saw this movie today with a friend who actually went to the theatre manager afterwards and told him "that was possibly the worst movie i have ever seen." i have seen a lot of movies with this person, and he's pretty forgiving, so i was actually shocked. (the manager gave him a free pass!)<br /><br />i was offended by much of the humor in the film (yes, the baked potato scene was on the top of the list!). my friend and i are white and saw the film with a primarily black audience. for awhile i thought, maybe i just don't get this movie because i'm white. then i realized no one was laughing. the writing was bad; the direction was bad; the timing was almost non-existent.<br /><br />there were a few funny moments, there was just way too much time between them. even airplane two was funnier than this, and that's saying a lot.<br /><br />i was so dazzled by snoop dogg in starsky and hutch (as huggy bear) that i felt i was sure to enjoy this movie. nope.<br /><br />dl hughley was funny, as usual, but his role was rather small. tom arnold had a few funny moments as "the white guy", but most other attempts at humor fell far short of the mark.<br /><br />sadly, i was not able to award this film a rating with negative stars.
