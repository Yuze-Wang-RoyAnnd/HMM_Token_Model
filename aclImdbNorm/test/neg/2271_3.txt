usually when bbc releases a tv series one is used to a certain satisfaction guarantee. usually the tv series is splendid, even if the story is boring, you can trust the acting will make the it worth while. when i came across, persuasion, here at the local library, i was looking forward to an enjoyable evening, cause i read the story.<br /><br />i'm glad i read the story first, otherwise i would not think highly of it. further was i relieved to learn that the production date of this tv series was from 1971, since i thought, until that moment, that bbc had lost it. it is really bad, and should be used in acting schools as a horror movie.<br /><br />the only positive thought i have about this series that the people in this film are not likely to appear or be involved in any bbc or other product this century other than the young musgroves sisters, who apparently were taking their fist steps in acting, and doing remarkably well under the direction otherwise given.
