just an hour ago i finished watching this my friend. as a fans of dragonball we think that this movie is so bad that is good. we will say one thing : without a sixpack beers there is now way you can survive through this movie. this movie should be watched with a many dragonball fans to laugh their ass off. the best character in the movie is the lord horn, his makeup, his laugh, and behaviour crates the unforgettable experience. what we liked in this movie, was the fact that the island of turtle man was the same as in cartoon version. we believe that the only character similar to the one in the cartoon is the turtle man. he is also a sex maniac and kind of idiot too.
