this has to be one of those times you come across a movie with a neat cover, my first impression, sweet, full moon, crows, a scarecrow holding a scythe. ok my impression (i had watched scarecrow on tv a weeks ago) perfect, a nice slasher film to start the evening with. ................... wrong, absolutely wrong i think 5 mins in i was gonna take it out, but thought i wasted 3$ on this so ill finish it wheres the scarecrow, well im guessing its the legs of the fisher man wearing heavy duty rain boots. you see that every so often. i was watching this thinking.... ok when are those brats gonna run into this dude, at one point i thought they died. but no.... i mean frig, their still alive. i only chuckled at a few parts cause of how badly staged they were. one was the zoom in part at the start. the director/actor/writer says, "remember i had that feeling, well i have it again" and it was either a zoom in or zoom out, to hell i'm checking back. but i guess the scene was supposedly shocking, i mean whats more shocking is his wife had the same shocked look.... ok... she believed him??? im sorry but yeah.... i didn't know he was psychic until i read the movie box to make some sense out of what i witnessed. not only that, they used pictures to make you think this movie is at least clear. <br /><br />the other thing that made me laugh a bit was the, scream in the camera, to make it scary....... ok............... filming a girl close up screaming into the camera for 5 mins.......right..... i laughed cause of how pathetic it was these kids cannot act like the rest of the people in the movie.<br /><br />to top things off the scythe must have got lost or something.... cause seems the bad guy had just a stick. not even an ax, someone should axe the dam production film<br /><br />don't fall for the picture, this movie is a piece of sh*t. i watched the trailer and guess what it has<br /><br />girls where are you talk to me and corn
