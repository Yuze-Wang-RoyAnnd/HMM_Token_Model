an obvious cash-in on the *insert monster here* on a plane gimmick, flight of the living dead is about what you'd expect it to be. <br /><br />the film has little or no plot, which is what you'd expect from a film of this type. although, it is fun in parts, i must say. the zombie-action is particularly entertaining. once the film picks up, it never stops; the pacing is solid.<br /><br />the practical special effects are pretty good, but the cgi is terrible and distracting. <br /><br />the ending seems to leave the film open to a sequel. let's hope that doesn't come to fruition. <br /><br />if you're a die-hard fan of the zombie sub-genre of horror films, i'd recommend it to you; it's worth at least one watch. however, if you're just an avid fan of the genre, leave it on the shelf. <br /><br />3/10
