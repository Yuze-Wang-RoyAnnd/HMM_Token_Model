need i say more? the reason the good australian version of kath and kim was, as mentioned, good, was because of it's hilariously funny originality. the reason this new american-ised version is so terrible is because a lot of it is taken straight from the original. not to mention the unfaithfulness to the characters. kath is meant to be a dag. kim is meant to be fat. kel (or phil as they have dubbed him) is meant to be pathetic. brett (or craig) is meant to be a loser, not a person who acts like he's on heroin and finishes every sentence with 'dude'. thank god szubanski didn't sell her rights to sharon, she'd probably end up being a tall thin blonde who kim likes.<br /><br />kath and kim are mother and daughter. they are not meant to look 2 years apart. and they are not meant to giggle like school girls. this show is a disgrace to even share the same title as the australian version. america: get your own television shows.
