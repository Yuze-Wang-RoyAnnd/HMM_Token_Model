the reviewer in variety said this was "overwritten and overlong", and i kind of agree with it. it has some events that seem forced and unlikely, like when cal (crudup once again as the 'lost, vacant, and kind of dull' male) and julianne moore find a map of the us in kind of an unbelievable place. the story is one of those 1970's "guy must find meaning in his life" stories, and i found myself imagining jack nicholson in his prime playing the role of cal. the whole "hitting the road to find meaning in life" theme is still kind of interesting though. does it all really lead back to family? i wasn't so sure. the acting is okay, i particularly liked karen allen and james legross, who unfortunately only have supporting roles. i'd give it a 'five'.
