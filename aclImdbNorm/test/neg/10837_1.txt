possibly the worst movie i have ever seen. pathetic in almost every way.<br /><br />i threw the dvd straight in the bin - i didn't even think it was fair to give it to the local thrift shop.<br /><br />the effects are beyond a joke. the dam control room looks like cardboard. the water looks way out of scale with the backgrounds - nothing works.<br /><br />then there is the limp plot - about as much depth as a scooby doo cartoon.<br /><br />i couldn't wait for them all to drown.
