"wagons east" is widely known as john candy's last movie, as he died on the set. that's just what makes it so sad: not simply that candy suffered a fatal heart attack, but that it was on the set of such a crummy movie. seriously, i don't know what they were thinking when they came up with this piece of crap, but the flick has no redeeming qualities. it's as if they took every unused script for stupid westerns and just mixed them together and filmed it. no wonder john candy didn't want to make the movie; maybe his contractual participation was what did him in.<br /><br />anyway, the point is that candy did much better than this throughout his career. to be certain, he had already completed michael moore's "canadian bacon", in which the united states declares war on canada. just stick with that one and you can say that candy ended his career honorably. as for richard lewis - who previous had co-starred with candy in eugene levy's absurd but hilarious "once upon a crime" - he made up for this piece of crap by frequently guest appearing on "countdown with keith olbermann" in later years.
