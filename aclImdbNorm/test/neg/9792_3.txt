it's impossible to make a film based on such a book as the "brothers karamzov" by f.m. dostojevsky.<br /><br />richard brooks is a great director, but that film is on a very low level.<br /><br />the worst part of the film was the ending. well, let's think of the book. in the end we have the "guilty" dimitrij karamazov. afterwards they sent him to siberia. in the end, the famous epilogues of dostojevsky, the friends and family making a plan to save him. but that's it ... a nd now the film takes two steps more and shows us an illusion ending of the escape of dimitry and gruschenka(i think). just from the moral point i'm sure that dostojevsky would finish the book with an open end because one the one hand he is not guilty(smerdjakov is the real murderer) and so he have to be a free man. but on the other hand he goes to his father to kill him, so he has decided to commit the crime... that's a moral dilemma and so the following point is an open end...well, for real ,it's just not full open.<br /><br />william shatner as aljoscha karamazov... i'm sorry! --> no!!!<br /><br />the others characters playing in a good performance as we have to expect it from such great actors ... in front of course a superb performance of yul breynner as dimitrij. i think that there are not many actors who can play this part in a better way.<br /><br />but as i said in the beginning: this book is unadaptable. it never should be film in two hours that's impossible. i think that there are some 'longer films, so maybe they could do the right thing... but i just keep the opinion that this book can't be adapted.<br /><br />so - 3 points:<br /><br />a point for the great director richard brooks <br /><br />a point for a superb performance of yul brynner<br /><br />finally: a point for one of the greatest writers of all time: dostojevsky
