wow, kiss the bride wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good either. it sure was no "later day saints." the movie sags in the center...perhaps cutting out about 30 minutes would have made a more enjoyable film. but the film gets bogged down again and again by annoying subplots and throw away scenes - the whole gold outing sequence comes to mind.<br /><br />even though "kiss" was made for theatrical release, it looks and sounds more like a made for tv movie. every scene is lighted like a department store. so many characters are so throw away.<br /><br />and dear tori is actually a pleasant surprise. she steals every scene she appears in.<br /><br />one scene really annoyed me. it was the rehearsal dinner in this larger room with scores of tables - all decorated. but only 5 or 6 people in a room for 250! where did everyone go.<br /><br />gay cinema has sunk to a new low...but not as low as the horrible films being produced and shown on the here! channel.
