the story of the bride fair is an amusing and engaging one, and it is to the filmmaker's credit that he sets out to portray rural minnesotans with the same respect ordinarily reserved for coast-dwellers. it is weird, though, to find an independent movie, the brainchild of a single person, that is as unambitious and clich'e-ridden as a committee-brewed hollywood potboiler.<br /><br />the portrait of rural people is intended to be affectionate, i think, but these characters don't ring true to me--i have had quite a few meals in small-town diners, but never overheard a debate on the merits of different nineteenth-century english novelists. one might suggest that writer/director semans has no more experience with rural culture than the coen brothers, and considerably less satiric verve.
