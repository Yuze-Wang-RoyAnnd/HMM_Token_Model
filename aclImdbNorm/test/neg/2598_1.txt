i haven't seen a lot of episodes of "family guy" and it's a pretty safe bet that i won't be seeing too many in the future. some people say to compare this show to "the simpsons" is unfair. i absolutely think this show wouldn't exist if "the simpsons" hadn't come first and i absolutely think it wants so very much to be "the simpsons". i don't understand what's so funny about this show. in the episodes that i've watched, i've understood where they've wanted me to laugh, i understand that someone thinks a joke was just told but the joke isn't funny. i find the whole show to be lazy: the title, the "jokes", there is a complete lack of inspiration throughout.<br /><br />the best shows on television (cartoon or not) are created like this: a script is written, it goes through several rewrites, stuff that doesn't work is taken out, inspiration is sparked, good stuff is added, there are more rewrites and then it is filmed.<br /><br />i picture a "family guy" episode to be created like this: a script is written and it's filmed.
