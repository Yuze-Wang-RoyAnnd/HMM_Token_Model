i know when you buy a used (oops, excuse me, previously viewed)dvd for $5.99 you shouldn't have very high expectations, but even that was a steep price for this poor boxed disc.<br /><br />i will give the producers credit for providing a complex challenge for the viewer . . . to determine which is worst, the acting, the scripting, the camera work, the special effects . . . they all pretty much tie for just plain terrible. oh, it has the absolutely worst faked car crash ever used in a motion picture anywhere.<br /><br />now all this is pretty serious ridicule for a movie fan who proudly features 'police academy', 'naked gun', 'national lampoon's loaded weapon" and a host of other campy discs in his collection. but, at least those folks know that ones tongue should be planted firmly in ones cheek, the cast of pw, unfortunately use their tongues in an attempt to deliver inane dialogue. and, although it is almost beyond my belief, the movies characters seem to think they might actually be doing something of value. a back room pornographer would be ashamed to release this mess.<br /><br />oh . . . lucky me bought the worst video ever made at the same time . .."fraternity demon" . . . maybe the name should have given me a hint.
