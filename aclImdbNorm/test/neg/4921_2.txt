there isn't enough space to explain the many ways this movie is a disappointing mess. silly special effects and an incomprehensible plot are the least of this movie's problems. the film looks like it was conceived in the mid-eighties and just stewed until it could finally be made in the early nineties. the mullet-headed "hero," (complete with fashionable "miami vice" three-days shadow beard), the ham-fisted slams at ronald reagan, it would be funny if it didn't take itself so seriously. as it is, the movie is just pathetic. i actually feel sorry for the poor actresses who wasted their fine nude scenes in this awful movie.
