i can envision the writers of this story thinking up this script:<br /><br />1.let's make a serial killer movie like se7en, knight moves, copycat, and silence of the lambs. people like serial killer stuff. it'll sell... 2.the killer needs to adopt some sort of pattern. i know; he'll copy it out of a serial killer mystery novel. that hasn't been done yet, at least not exactly like that. 3.now, we need some kind of way to make this movie unique; of course, the good guy can be bedridden like in rear window. 4.lastly, we need a twist ending that will give this movie the success of the sixth sense and the usual suspects.<br /><br />okay, now that you know these things, you know the whole movie, so don't waste your money. one thing i really hate about moviemakers is that they take a perfectly good concept for movies and completely run them into the ground. i wrote better stories than this when i was in junior high. i just kept checking my watch every five minutes. when the twist ending finally came, i wasn't shocked, i just said, "oh. who cares?!" the characters are two-dimensional. they have your typical movie personalities. this movie is just proof that stealing the elements of other successful movies is no excuse for a bad script. i give this movie 1 out of 10. normally, it would earn at least 2 or 3, but i'm so sick of the unoriginality. when will they learn? 1/10
