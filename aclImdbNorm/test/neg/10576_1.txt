i took my 14 year old to see this movie. we left after 15 or 20 minutes. it was absolutely awful! this movie should be rated r at the least. i am not that strict with movies but, this was just too much. it was a waste of money. i thought it would contain some comedy and i knew the comedy would probably be crude but, this was way beyond crude. i was sitting there watching and reading (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me) and i could not believe how crudely sexual it was. i could not believe that it would be ok for a 13 year old to read and see this content. i don't understand how the rating system works.??
