the filmmakers neglected to connect the dots--that is, the sequence of events and choices that led from charlie wilson and the anti-soviet mujaheddin to al qaeda and osama bin laden and eventually to 9/11. the filmmakers of course neglect to tell us the back-story--why were the soviets in afghanistan?--but that omission pales in comparison to their failure to reveal that support for islamicist extremists in afghanistan in the name of rabid anti-communism ultimately strengthened the hand of anti-western forces and was a big contributing factor to the mess that we find ourselves in today (9/11, terrorist networks, a prolonged ground war in afghanistan, etc.). because these consequences are not spelled out, the movie leaves the viewer feeling sympathetic to mr. wilson (hey, check out his latest projects on the internet) instead of seeing him as an individual whose actions were contrary to the best interests of his country and the west as a whole.
