i am looking at all the good reviews about this film and i start thinking to myself... am i going crazy..? can't i see the beauty from a film like this..? am i just dumb enough to not understand the message this film is trying to point out? i don't know.. maybe one of those lizards entered in my head and ate all my brains as well. the film idea was going nowhere... i was sure it would have a foggy end, and of course... it did! nothing exceptional... not even the landscapes (i hopped that being placed in a mountain village at least the landscapes would be nice.. but no). just a lame story about a crazy teacher, and of course her crazy students... now all grown up, each of them.. with his/her own fixed ideas. and boy some of those ideas were stupid.. like the lizard story for example. at a moment i thought i was watching x files.. with the lizard entering in the ear and all. no.. from my point of view this movie is a waste of time (not to say money if u pay for the ticket) the only part that i did like was the acting of the young blue eye "german" kid... he played very well and convincing for his age... the rest... nothing! i read the previous review and i think the script writer and the director were both on drugs when they came up with those ideas. well considering that there are a lot of people that enjoyed this film... i think to myself again.. maybe i am the crazy one. advice.. don't waste your time with this!
