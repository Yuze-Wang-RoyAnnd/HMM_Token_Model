"the foreigner" is a tale of foreign intrigue with seagal at the center as a deep cover operative who has a package which everyone wants and are willing to kill to get. the flick is uninspired with less of the usual action stuff which put seagal on the movie map (fire fights, hand-to-hand combat, pyrotechnics, stunts, etc.) and more of a story which is convoluted, uninteresting, and full of meaningless filler. what action there is seems token and gratuitous while seagal, looking more and more like a pork chop, meanders through this insipid flick expressionless and bored while manifesting no improvement in acting ability. somewhere around "the glimmer man" or "fire down below" seagal flicks took a nose dive and "the foreigner" is just an continuation of that trend. nothing here worth watching except for the most die-hard seagal fans.
