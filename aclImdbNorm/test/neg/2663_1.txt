a friend gave me this movie because she liked it. i decided i would finally watch it. it was sooooooo long. i kept waiting for the suspense to happen but it never did. i kept waiting for something to happen after the opening scenes, and it never did. i stopped the movie and came back later. i actually forced myself to watch the rest of it hoping it would get better. it got worse. i kept asking myself, who are these people? do they have feelings? are they just robots? i'm glad i didn't pay to see it or pay to rent it. the end would have been better if dutch died from the gunshot wound. at least we would have gotten some emotion from the audience. or maybe not.
