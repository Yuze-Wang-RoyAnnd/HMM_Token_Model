my wife spotted this film on the aisle at a local video store. from the cover it looked like a science-fiction film, but upon turning it over my wife saw rebecca st. james was in the film, realized it was a christian movie, and suggested we watch it. we are conservative evangelicals but we also know that "christian" films have a poor reputation in the mainstream. nevertheless, we decided to give it a screening.<br /><br />to be fair, there were a few things i liked about the film. the musical score - much of which was orchestrated - was quite good. the cinematography was also pretty good considering it was a lower-budget movie.<br /><br />unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script. the film begins with an interesting premise - ufo abductions - but by midway through the feature the storyline veers wildly into an evangelistic crusade spearheaded by the movie's two main characters... which then veers wildly into a treatise on the rapture. at least the frank peretti-inspired "the visitation" (which was itself a deeply flawed film) had an endgame that tied together the movie's premise. "unidentified" ends nowhere even close to where it started, which is a huge letdown.<br /><br />as for the acting? the supporting acting ranges from decent to awful. (rebecca st. james plays a bit part and is passable.) for their part, a few of the main characters are manned capably enough. sadly, their talents are wasted on characters so one-dimensional in their personalities so as to be unbelievable. the "protagonists" are anything but; you know it's bad when two christian viewers find the most vocal christian character in the film to be the most annoying.<br /><br />a final note on the evangelistic tone of this movie, which will be of more interest to christian than non-christian readers. in a word, it is embarrassing. other christian films like carmen's "the champion" and peretti's "the hangman's curse" have managed to communicate a genuinely uncompromising portrait of the christian faith without sounding preachy or oppressive. this film, by contrast, is a sledgehammer that feels so heavy-handed and lacking in tact that a non-christian would have a hard time taking it seriously.<br /><br />i do believe that the filmmaker's heart is in the right place, and i applaud efforts to create good christian film. unfortunately, this is not one of them. if your church is looking for a screening of a good christian film, consider "mercy streets," the aforementioned "the champion," or (if you're pentecostal) robert duvall's provocative "the apostle." <br /><br />as for "unidentified?" rent it if you must, but screen it before you show it to a non-christian or a larger audience.
