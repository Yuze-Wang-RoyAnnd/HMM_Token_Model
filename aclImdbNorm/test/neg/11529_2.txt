well, i set out with a few friends to see this movie, we went an hour before the show started to get good seats. so as you can probably imagine we where exited to see this movie :). but that excitement soon turned to horror, this movie is a complete failure, it just try's to hard to be funny that its sad, the script is poorly written and relies to heavy on the actors to make up for it...<br /><br />the only good acting in the whole movie was from stefan c. schaefer who was great, the plot was weak and even the "funny" scenes felt forced and unnatural, considering that the main actors are some of iceland's best comedians it's well special...<br /><br />i would not recommend this movie to any one, because it try's to hard and never really delivers.
