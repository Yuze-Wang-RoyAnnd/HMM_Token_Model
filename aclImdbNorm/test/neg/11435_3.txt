i was told jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences. i guessed the film will be interesting.in fact isn't at all. not so much profound for a such subject. "eternity" never-ending life. experiences after death and "dejavu". the film is not as a comedy but isn't funny at all, at least not express yet. it's so naive. charming film but naive film. a must to avoid. the middle ages sequences seems coming directly from fairy tales and it's not the matter at all. eileen davidson is so charming and voight is doing his best. normal is a co producer and screenwriter of this movie. the film was launched straight on video so i discovered it on a video store. it's a pity 'cause i well know voight was seriously involved with spirituality and the film isn't so much profound about it.
