a college professor is working on creating zombies and, wouldn't you know it, things go horribly wrong. next thing you know, the whole campus is overrun. thank goodness there's a pair of uber-commandos trained for just such a situation. too bad they must be accompanied by a group of moron-commandos, lead by a rapper (he doesn't even bother trying to play a military guy, he just responds to his superiors as if he were rappin' wit' da homies in da hood). the high point of this part of the movie is the locker room scene. the male and female moron-commandos share the same locker room, and apparently military regulations require all females to wear black bras and panties. hey, if you can't make a good movie, at least you can have women in their underwear. my hat's off to the film makers.<br /><br />so, after much discussion of how well prepared these moron-commandos are for the job (bosnia, afghanistan, iraq), they all get killed off in fairly short order. their biggest downfall seems to be that it never occurs to them to turn any lights on. a typical encounter has them walking into a room and seeing someone at the far end. human or zombie? can't tell. flip on the lights? no, moron-commando protocol requires them to walk up to the person, making sure to hold their gun in such a way that it can be easily knocked out of their hand, and well, you know the drill. the demise of sergeant major sticky fingaz is especially fun - my favorite scene involving a rapper in any movie i've ever seen. luckily (and again, hats off to the filmmakers), the hottest babe among the moron-commandos manages to survive. her and the female uber-commando both wind up in tight t-shirts for the remainder of the movie. now this is how a military operation should be performed! there's a bunch of running around, punctuated my humorous stuff like the uber-commandos being unable to get through a simple ventilator grating (it obviously is a thin piece of aluminum that you could easily put your fist through). this necessitates a plan to rub zombie guts all over themselves, and even though we've seen nothing in the movie to indicate that zombies locate their prey by smell, they're good enough to immediately begin sniffing the zombie guts and let our heroes go.<br /><br />a few other funny bits - the paris hilton gag, the "can you hear me now?" gag, and the fact that although the zombies immediately bite secondary characters, main characters are able to fight their way through dozens of them without being nibbled on. another chuckle is provided by mr. fingaz, who can't seem to pronounce the word 'tourniquet' (toe-no-kit?).<br /><br />overall, it's somewhat amusing. could have used some more interesting characters, but for a sci-fi channel original, i was mildly impressed.
