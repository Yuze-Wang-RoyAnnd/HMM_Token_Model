this movie treads on very familiar ground -- the confusion of art and reality in the life of actors. it does not have anything particularly novel or interesting to say on this subject and is in fact rather dull. the final scene in particular is interminably tedious. seeing the audience crying at the "moving" acting they are seeing on the screen made me ask "who do they think they are kidding?"<br /><br />nevertheless there are some good performances and interesting scenes, particularly from some of the minor characters. ben gazzara plays an old and slightly touched actor, who gets a whole posse of policemen clapping his performance when they come to arrest him.<br /><br />christopher walken again plays an over-the-top wacko. remember his character "the continental" on saturday night live; an aging eurotrash satyr chasing a young woman around the furniture and trying to get her into bed? he does an identical turn in the film, chasing his young (male) prey around an antique table and plying him with champagne.<br /><br />overall this film was both enchanting and irritating, but mostly irritating.
