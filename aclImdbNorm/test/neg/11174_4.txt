well, i was hoping i'd heard wrong about this film as i'm a big fan of ruggero deodato and really didn't want to see him slip up; but unfortunately, this giallo-styled supernatural load of nonsense is just as bad as i'd been lead to believe it would be - and that's pretty terrible! the plot doesn't work at all, as the film attempts to blend murders and a supernatural theme through a telephone and it all feels very forced and silly. furthermore, the plot doesn't make much sense at all, and you have to ask yourself "what's the point" numerous times throughout the movie. the plot focuses on a young woman living in an apartment block and being terrorised by a telephone. the best thing about the movie is undoubtedly the presence of the beautiful english actress charlotte lewis, and unfortunately the good points pretty much stop there. there are a handful of deaths scenes, some of which are gory; but all of which are incredibly stupid, the one that sees someone get killed by coins sticks out especially in that respect. overall, i really can't recommend this to anyone; non-deodato fans are unlikely to impressed, and deodato fans are likely to find the film depressing. avoid!
