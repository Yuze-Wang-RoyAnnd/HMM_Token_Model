this movie is a laugh and a half. from the first scene, where we have an appearance of mel torme as a big, bad jaguar drivin' stud muffin gang leader(and that's a giggle-fest in itself), to the final image of mamie van doren, now a rehabilitated angelic teen strolling out of the prison(errr..loving girl's home run by iron fisted nuns), you can't stop shaking your head. the cast of this movie is a cheesy list from mel and mamie to the talentless paul anka(all i wanted through most of this movie was for him to just stop singing!) and the king of forty year old teens, dick contino. gloria talbot, playing a humorless teen girl with more than a few chops(judo, not acting) i last saw in the horrible misogynist 50's romp leech woman, with a hairstyle so bad it looked like a dead woodchuck that had been squashed by a mac truck.<br /><br />mamie is a bad, bad girl-she smokes, swears, runs wild, hits teachers, and runs around with gang leaders. she dumps her idiot jaguar driving boyfriend chip(who we see in the first scene trying to rape a blonde girl, before he falls off a cliff-nice guy), and proceeds to take up with dick contino instead. whether this is a step up for her is anybody's guess. mel shows up at a party she's at with her new beau, and accuses her of pushing the nasty chip off the cliff. while i'm sure that she would have liked to, she wasn't there. a stupid fight scene between contino and his gang and mel and his jazz freaks ensues, with some hilariously bad moves on both sides.<br /><br />mamie ends up being sent to girls town, a reform school..errr...loving home for erring girls..run by sister iron pants and her fellow sisters of correction. she annoys the nuns(and us) by scatting, tossing off sullen one-liners, and just generally showing how bad she is. she quickly runs into gloria talbot, playing one of the misbehaving girls, who gives her a chop sockey so that she knows her place. she meets a limp noodle of a girl who's obsessed with paul anka's character(why?). this little drip becomes her 'henchman'. <br /><br />there's a long bit of movie where nothing much happens, except st. paul of anka keeps showing up and proving how saintly he is. he sings way too much in this interval, until you want to smack him in his huge snozz to just make him be quiet! and mamie's little sister, played by princess of father know's best fame, calls her to tell her she's in trouble. turns out it was sis who went out with the chipster, and now mel's blackmailing her because he found out. the girls all break out to go save her, with a hysterical fight scene between the girls and mel and his boys. this is after a race between mel and dick that is just so stupid that it boggles the mind. the overage teenagers in this corny movie have a fabulous good time romping through what is basically a silly, badly written and morally preachy film that accomplishes none if its aims-unless its aim was to make you laugh out loud.
