i am ashamed of myself that i actually went to the theatre to watch this movie when it was first released. while i suppose its thinly veiled depiction of the aristotle onassis and jackie kennedy story is well enough done, it's a movie that should never have been made in the first place; hence, my low rating.<br /><br />the film chronicles the tale of a wealthy greek business shark called theo tomasis, who woos and wins the lovely young widow, liz cassidy, of a slain american president. sound familiar? yes, everything except the names.<br /><br />the cast is not to be faulted. anthony quinn plays the greek tycoon to perfection, and at least it's some consolation, having just read that ari himself requested quinn for the role. jacqueline bisset is of course beautiful and sophisticated in the part of (for all intents and purposes) jackie, and james franciscus has the all american good looks of the president.<br /><br />i haven't seen this movie since it came out, nor do i wish to see it again. i seem to recall a fair bit of bad language and some general crudeness. otherwise, i suppose it's a sensational and supposedly intimate glimpse into the jet setting lives of the rich and famous, frolicking aboard their yachts, beaches, pools etc. yes, the scenery of the greek islands is spectacular, the best part of the movie.<br /><br />of its type, it's okay, i suppose. there are no end of tv movies about the kennedys, which i confess to occasionally tuning in to, and not to my credit. this is basically just another. far better to allow aristotle and jacqueline kennedy onassis to rest in peace.
