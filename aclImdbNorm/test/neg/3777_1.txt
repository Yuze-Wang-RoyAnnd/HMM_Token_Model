the parallels between this film and "captain walrus" (an independant film shown at the team projection film festival in 1994) are so blindingly obvious that any praise for "sally marshall is not an alien" must be viewed with the knowledge that it is riding on the success of another work.<br /><br />in captain walrus, two young boys (geoff and roger, played by dean turner and brett allen respectively) examine the bizarre behaviour of their new neighbour britney (played by louise farley). as the two boys watch through their telescope, they observe the repeated visits of a man in uniform who they call captain walrus (played by peter sargent). however, the emphasis in captain walrus is on the pointless and somewhat power-hungry actions of the neighbour britney, and less on the friendship between the two boys.<br /><br />a critical success at the film festival, the plot of captain walrus has obviously been appropriated and rehashed in order to give the australian film community another notch on the belt with regards to children's product. although sally marshall is not an alien is a fine film, and a credit to its producers, its inauthenticity leaves something to be deserved.
