this is a relatively watchable movie (+1). after watching ukm: ultimate killing machine, this one looks good, in comparison. there are no obvious technical gaffes, although the vampiric teeth look odd.<br /><br />the story line makes no sense. let's see. an american gi fights vampires. comes back to the states and is rehabilitated for seeing... vampires. his commanding officer is the aunt of his ex-wife. who happens to be doing some research on the biodiversity of the south american area where the vampires are. huh! don't pile on too many coincidences. who cares about the head vampire? or, his daughter? or, any one in this film? the only originality in this is that most of the myths about vampires (allergic to crosses and garlic, can't come out in the day, etc.) are wrong. but, they can't be killed except by beheading or a wood wound in the heart. yeah, right. it's obvious they just didn't want to film a dark movie, since this is a made for tv film.<br /><br />it would have been nice for the viewer, if they had hired some actors. oh, they've got lynda carter (tv's wonder woman), and a big, black dude with a tremendously deep voice, who snarls appropriately in order to show off his vampire teeth prosthetics. but, otherwise, you would never know they had actually paid people to read these lines.<br /><br />there is more than enough fight scenes, and some vampire-biting-neck blood, but no real violence.
