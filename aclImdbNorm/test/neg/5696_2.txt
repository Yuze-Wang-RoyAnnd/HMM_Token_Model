so it's a space movie. but it's low budget. you ask, "what about the effects?" the effects are at times good, and at times really, really bad. i mean bad. and notice i started with the effects.<br /><br />there's a story here, but it's told in what i think is the wrong order. i don't mean a tarantino style wrong order. i mean, it's told in a completely nonsensical arrangement. most of it's about a mother (in the future, because you know, it's sci-fi) as told by her daughter, which is mostly exposition done in narrative from the daughter's perspective. only once you're through the first hour and hear paul darrow's voice as a computer do you realize how much more tolerable the constant narrative would have been if he'd read it. this narrative is so constant and inclusive, that the actors on screen hardly say a word for the first hour.<br /><br />there's also a lesson here for you up and coming filmmakers: if you're not doing 2001 and want to have some action (this one does), then please hire a good fight choreographer. otherwise, your fights will look like, well, what's in battlespace. and notice the title has the word "battle" in it. ugh.<br /><br />i think this might be the classic scenario of trying to make a movie based on nothing more than a concept. and some effects. my biggest surprise is seeing the imdb listing this film as costing $1.8 million. when you compare it to something like primer, which did better with a budget of a few thousand, you realize in low budget film-making, it's all about the story. i wasn't expecting much - but i was still disappointed. two out of ten stars.
