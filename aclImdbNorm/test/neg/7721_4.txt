"house of the dead 2: dead aim" (2005) is the sequel, though you really don't need to see the first "house of the dead" to get this film. that said, the production value is definitely here, with great zombie effects and it's edited quite nicely, with very effective sound design. however, that said, that's about all that's good here.<br /><br />the story and script are awful . . . there's blatant plot holes everywhere. it's also funny how the soldiers don't mind if they get blood on their faces (unlike in 28 days later where blood in any part of the body will infect you). also realistic how there's little order with the soldiers here unlike the usual us military discipline.<br /><br />a 4 out of 10.
