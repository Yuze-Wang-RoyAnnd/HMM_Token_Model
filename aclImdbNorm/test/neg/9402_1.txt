please do not go see this. i did have several laughs throughout this movie, but they were all due to unintentional comedy.<br /><br />there were only three characters in this movie, so it was amazing how bad the character development was. pacino played pacino again and was aggravating most of the time. the scenes in this movie seem like they were put together from 20 other bad movies by a really poor editor. there is no continuity and i found myself wondering why i didn't leave 15 minutes into this.<br /><br />i would suggest never seeing a movie directed by d.j. caruso. this really was awful.
