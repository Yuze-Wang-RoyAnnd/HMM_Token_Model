i hate it when people in the movie theater talk back to the screen. it's one of the main reasons why i stick to dvd's or videos . i saw the clearing on dvd but if i had seen it in the movies i would have had to stand up and scream " he's not dead yet , you moron ! "<br /><br />the clearing is another in a long list of horrible movies that feature mr.redford . legal eagles , havana , indecent proposal , up close and personal , sneakers , last castle , and spy game . if robert redford told me to invest in something i'd go the other way . <br /><br />but the worst possible thing you can do to an audience is this . say you're being kidnapped and your kidnapper has a gun . he's holding it on you for most of the movie . you turn the tables on him and start strangling him . whatever you do keep strangling him until he's dead ! don't just strangle him for ten seconds . stay with it ! ten minutes at least . but bob stops too soon , walks away and forgets about mr. kidnapper until ....... he gets up , finds the gun and holds it on our hero again . at this point i wanted mr. kidnapper to shoot robert redford . more than a few times . and i wanted to shoot him as well .
