i remember when this came out it was the first kung fu film ever seen around our way and we were all excited about seeing it for sure .although the action was mediocre at best it gave us our first taste of kung fu and our first taste of bad dubbing as well as bad film making or more precisely the way chinese people were making films at the time . they were admittedly inferior wlthout question but there was entertainment value here and that caught on for sure . the kung fu craze had begun and bruce lee and ''the chinese connection'' would soon follow either that or ''the chinese boxer'' with jimmy wang yu . in any case this film was chosen to lead the way .
