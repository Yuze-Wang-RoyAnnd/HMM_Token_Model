if anyone thinks this is a great sports movie it is probably the only sports movie they have ever seen. there are different aspects a sports movie can take. whether it be professional or college or high school. examples of sports movies i liked (and i haven't seen many) are jim thorpe: all american, all the right moves, any given sunday, eight men out, and rocky, among others. all of those movies had a little more than just plain sports. whether it was a mans ascent and then descent from greatness, or a man losing out on a dream by the actions of a vindictive coach, or the effect of money on professional sports. in hoosiers, there is not much content. it didn't even seem as though the movie had a beginning or an end. there was no character development, all of them were forced on us. i could sum up this movie, by quoting a very bad coach: "go out and try to score more points than the other guy."
