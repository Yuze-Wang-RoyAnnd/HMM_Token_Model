i saw a screening of this movie last night. i had high expectations going into it, but was definitely disappointed. within 5 minutes of the opening, williams is already campaigning for his presidency. and he becomes president in the first 40 minutes. so there goes all that aspect of the movie. the first half hour are hilarious. don't get me wrong, the movie has its moments. but after the first half hour, it takes a turn for the worst. it becomes less of a comedy, and more of a thriller/drama/love story...which is pointless. the movie goes nowhere and stands still for a good 30 minutes. there are laughs interspersed here and there, but the consistently funny part is in the beginning and only the beginning. at one point, the biggest cheer i heard in the audience is when a person in the crowd yelled 'boooo' during a very confusingly emotional scene. williams gives a great performance, right on par with his comedic style. walken also delivers a strong supporting role as only he can. i think the one character that goes underrated is lewis black. consistently vulgar and political, its funny to see him tone it down for a pg-13 rating. overall, i would not pay to see the movie. afterall, i saw it for free and even i was disappointed. the first half hour is solid, and its all downhill from there. not really fitting into a category, the movie realizes half way through that it should not have been anything more than a one-hour comedy central special. 4.5/10
