terry cunningham directs this sci-fi network original. all is not well in washington state and oregon; volcanic eruptions and earthquakes threaten to drop most of the pacific rim in the ocean. trying to keep the world from plunging in ecological havoc, a crack team of scientists led by dr. jake rollins(luke perry)take a massive earth drilling vehicle called "the mole" to chew its way to the earth's fiery core to avert impending doom. technical dialog doesn't really help or speed this movie along. the acting is lame, but then perry has always been laid back. you can only blame him for taking part. others in the cast: michael dorn, adam frost and michael teigen
