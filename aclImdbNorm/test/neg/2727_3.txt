it's times like these i truly wish i was a more avid reader of clive barker's literary repertoire, since very few things feel worse than not being able to fully comprehend a movie of this stunningly 'visual' caliber. based on the novella "cabal", the story of "nightbreed" involves a behemothic amount of lavish and bizarre creatures and settings in an underground society of demonic ghouls. a normal guy becomes linked to the strange world, called midian, through his dreams and his psychiatrist coerces him into believing he is responsible for a series of gruesome murders of families in recent months... thinking this to be true, he retreats to midian - located under a rural cemetery - where he is reluctantly accepted. the shrink, however, is right on homeboy's heals with a diabolical scheme to whip out the community of nightbreeds...<br /><br />wanting so much to love this movie, i was very let down in the long run. i have regretfully not read the story so barker's fantasy world and the purpose of it and all these monsters was horribly confusing and the premise was painfully uneven. i understand how the final cut was diced to hell and even barker show's moderate dislike for the overall product, but i just didn't "get" it. even if it is crucial to read the story, i feel like it should at least be translated to film in a way that it is still comprehensible for those unfamiliar with the literature. if "cabal" is as convoluted as this film than barker really milked a dead concept. couldn't help but feel a bit bored after a while, especially when things started getting increasingly ridiculous (somewhere around the jail scene i realized just how bored i was) - like a police department fearlessly going to war with midian like it happens every week! no one seems to think the idea of immortal monsters is a tad... strange. i did like the visual effects and all that crazy sh*t that went on in midian, especially that porcupine lady and that big headed sob... definitely an epic flick when you consider the massive quantity of effects and convincingly morbid decor. david cronenberg fills his position well as the loony shrink with his cool zipper-head potato sack mask, but we all wish he had done some behind-the-camera work to help save this heap... <br /><br />so, if you have a boner for clive barker material and fully grasp what exactly midian is, why they show the creatures during the opening title sequence (terrible idea!), and why these creatures reside there and how some punk kid shares a telekinetic link to it, you should probably check out "nightbreed". i'll look for "cabal" one of these days and hopefully gain some perspective... or maybe i'll just forget this travesty completely... until then, this is a poorly constructed and fairly tedious mess of a movie... watch "hellraiser" instead.
