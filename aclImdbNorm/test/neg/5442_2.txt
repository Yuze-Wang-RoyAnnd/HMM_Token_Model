a group of people goes deep into the jungle for various reasons, and finally find a lost city (where apparently king solomon's diamonds are) and a race of super-gorilla's... now, you know you're in trouble when you put fine actors like linney and curry in one movie that stars... a talking gorilla, and that is just the beginning. okay, what else...?<br /><br />for an action/adventure movie the film is... well, lacking just that. the first hour (!) of the movie they aren't even in the jungle, just trying to get there, with subplot after subplot (something about a local military regime, whatever), and when they finally do... it's just no fun anymore.<br /><br />the effects of the movie are only so-and-so (and really bad compared to the earlier jurassic park movie).<br /><br />now, the ending... the father not caring for the death of his son, but just interested in the diamonds? uh-huh... only in the movies folks, only in the movies.<br /><br />a complete waste of talent, this chricton (jurassic park, twister, er) adaptation. 2/10.
