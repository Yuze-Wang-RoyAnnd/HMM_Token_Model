roomies is the story of a guy who loses everything except his incredible girlfriend and an idea for a corn dog that he plans to patent and sell. immediately his uncle dies and leaves him a house and a car, and he gets some roommates in to help pay the rent and gets a job. then his girlfriend gets drunk and cheats on him, so he goes and writes a book about roommates and becomes famous.<br /><br />88 minutes. none of these details of the plot are explored in any detail, what you read above is more or less as interesting as the film will be. when his uncle dies there are some breasts on screen, one of the potential roommates he interviews is pretty funny for about 40 seconds. the ending is literally the worst i've ever seen. i want the other 87 minutes of my life back!<br /><br />i hadn't thought anyone could make a movie with so little merit: surely there are rules against this sort of thing getting to the public? the script can't be longer than twenty pages, and the budget must have been minuscule because the whole film has about 3 locations and a car. the only conceivable use for roomies, in my opinion, is if you're holding someone hostage and want to frustrate them beyond human thought. if so, get it on repeat and you'll have a ready made gibbering wreck within the day.<br /><br />one-and-a-half out of 10
