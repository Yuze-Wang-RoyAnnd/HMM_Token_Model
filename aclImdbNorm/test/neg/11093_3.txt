with all the potential for a good movie in its gorgeous settings, cast, and cinematography, this film's lacklustre script, leaden pace, and wooden performances produced only a major disappointment. with decent direction, editing, and musical score, this could have been a good movie, perhaps a dark version of blake edward's '10', instead of a weepy version of ron howard's 'splash'.
