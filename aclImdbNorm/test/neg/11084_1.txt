the movie goes something like this: run around, run around, someone killed, lots of freaking out and then one of the group yells to "pull it together" or "just calm down!" repeat this as many times as their are characters left. in between these things, you get to enjoy blank, black screen. these are not quick but rather several seconds long. i kept thinking what a waste of film every time it happened - yes, it does happen more than once if you can believe it.<br /><br />i notice other mentioned "blair witch: and it did remind me of that in the way the camera was bouncy. however, this movie takes that to the extreme. every single time the characters move the camera is bouncing. sometimes so much that you can't make heads or tales as to what you are looking at. that brings us to lighting. way too dark in some areas. i get that they are trying to make us feel like we are in a cave, but helllloo... i'm watching a movie here, it would be nice to be able to see.<br /><br />then there is the ending. i actually blurted out loud, "are you kidding me?!" (i was watching alone too). dumb, dumb. i think the ending was purely the effort of the people who made this disaster to shock us after so much time of boredom with a so called "twist". at this point of the movie you could have seen the "monster" picking his nose and it would be considered a "twist". truly horrible. you have been warned.
