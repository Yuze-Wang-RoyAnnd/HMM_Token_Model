i'll preface my review by stating that i am not a fan of the independent 'straight to video' genre that owes a great debt to the grindhouse films of the 60's. i don't own any, i've never rented any, so i might lack the appreciation for these tongue-in-cheek, low-budget stinkers that many other people have.<br /><br />i caught this movie on cinemax late one saturday evening with a lady friend. please don't ask me why i was watching cinemax late one saturday evening with a lady friend. we were bored with world championship poker. some atrociously bad acting courtesy of misty mundae (and i wish she wouldn't own up to being from illinois, as we actually turn out some very bright thespians here) caught our attention. now normally, the aim of some good soft-core porn would be to get you and your partner in the mood. some good sex, tongue in cheek humor, and who know what could happen? after about 15 minutes, and a scene where the title character seduces a mugging victim, my lady friend said 'if you want to watch the rest of this fine, i am going to bed so i don't have to. please turn the volume off.' here is what i gather from the plot: misty's character is a sexless nerd who gets bitten by a spider and turns into a super-sex kitten with super web slinging powers that don't come from her wrists. there is some sort of evil villainess involved, who didn't look particularly evil or sexy. spiderbabe saves the day, has sex, m.j. (who is male in this film) constantly gets propositioned by stereotypically bad gay bikers, and somehow the evil villainess gets pushed off a building to her death.<br /><br />what was good about this film? it ended.<br /><br />what was bad about it? acting to make a third grade pageant look like oscar winners, a script turned out by people who i picture to be drunken, college-aged sex perverts who wouldn't know what sex is if they took a class taught by dr. ruth, special effects that were about as special as someone jumping off a trampoline, humor about as funny as
