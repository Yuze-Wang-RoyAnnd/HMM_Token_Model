i always think it would be nice if you could somehow have a 'sneak preview' at some of the old movies that are re-released on dvd, before you purchase them. that way you could save yourself some time, money and a certain degree of aggro when you feel so utterly let down.<br /><br />"the buddy holly story" is such a movie.<br /><br />i do not wish to go into the characterizations, or the holes in the plot, or the messing around with historical facts that this movie encompasses, for i had already come to terms with them twenty years ago, when i first began watching it.<br /><br />i had recorded it on the old (monaural) beta machine back in the early 1980s, and liked it so much, that it became a regularly-played favourite. the best part, to my mind, was gary busey's performance as the young buddy, and his near-perfect vocals and guitar playing.<br /><br />i looked forward to the day when i could have it in ...stereo..., and that is where the disappointment comes in.<br /><br />this dvd version is (supposedly) re-mastered in both audio and video, according to the shell information, but i'm afraid it left me sadly let-down and glancing at my watch, wishing for it to end.<br /><br />the sound is murky, bordering on the unintelligible, and so unprofessionally mixed that it had me yearning for the crystal-clarity vocals of my old beta tape! <br /><br />despite what you think of the images, or the plot, or the characters, the real draw card here is the music......and if you can't hear the lead vocals because they are drowned out by the cymbals, or the backing harmonies, or other ambients, then there's not much left, is there? <br /><br />i'm going to convert my old beta version to (mono) dvd for subsequent viewings, and put this one where it belongs, out with the rubbish! <br /><br />"extinction is the rule, survival is the exception..."
