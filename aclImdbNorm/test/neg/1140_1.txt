i watched about the first 30 - 40 minutes of this movie on television the other night and can agree that this is by far the worst of the series. not any of it is funny, even randy quaid can't save this mess. eric idle wasn't funny in n.l. euro. vacation, and he's even worse here. the only funny scene is where they're at the airport and some guy dressed as santa walks by the camera yelling "did anybody lose this?" as he holds up a prosthetic leg...<br /><br />1/2 a star out of ****
