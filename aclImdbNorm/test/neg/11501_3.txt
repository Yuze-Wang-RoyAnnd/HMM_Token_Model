this is an alright show to watch, its not the best nor the worst. i've watched it for a long time and i don't like any of the new stuff. this show has changed into some teen trash and is living much differently. i dislike that crap..i have no iq why they completely changed the theme of this show. the first season was really enjoyable to watch and is was partly amusing. the 2nd season is just out of this world dumb. i seriously don't know why the writers/directors changed this show up. many more people liked the 1st season better than the 2nd and 3rd. i will only watch the first season of this show from now on, whenever i see a new episode, ill change the f*ckin channel...ya heard me! it gets a 3/10 because i somewhat enjoyed the 1st season but hated the 2nd and 3rd
