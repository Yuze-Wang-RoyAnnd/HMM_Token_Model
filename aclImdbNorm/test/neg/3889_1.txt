days of heaven is one of the most painfully boring and pointless films i have ever seen. in no way, shape, or form would i recommend it to anyone...unless you're trying to put your kids to sleep or, god forbid, give someone an aneurysm. if i could go back in time and do one thing, i would set fire to the reels before they were sent to theaters. why? days of heaven's plot is simple, but extremely vague. long sequences devoid of dialogue compose much of the film. the characters are too shallow and ridiculously stupid to relate with. the climax of the story does not touch you: by this time your brain has worked so hard to figure out the plot and the array of hidden metaphors that your ability to think is gone. the only things working are your eyes, and unfortunately, your ears, who must listen to the sound of linda, the little girl in the story, who talks like a man. i am now dumber for seeing this movie. don't let it happen to you.
