while this is horribly dated, i must insist...please, no remake! frankly, it just won't help, as there's nothing which could be added or changed, contemporarily, to make this cinematically better.<br /><br />the novel upon which this is based, was atmospheric, well written, truly spooky work, but on film, it just doesn't translate. most of king's written masterpieces fail to translate to film. i'm not sure why this is, but when you view this work, if you view it, you are likely to see just what i mean. <br /><br />the book? it's wonderful. it's not a masterpiece, but it's more than just entertaining. <br /><br />the movie? do something else. you can thank me later.<br /><br />it rates a 3.1/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
