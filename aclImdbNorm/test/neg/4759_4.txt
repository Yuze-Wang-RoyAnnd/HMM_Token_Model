a ridiculous comedy given an arms-flailing direction. i love one of the comments here: "couldn't be made today". well, neither could "the philadelphia story" without a car chase or two. nonetheless, does that mean the picture is worse for the wear for being old-fashioned? i don't think "susan slept here" was good for any generation and it should fester peacefully in the memories of debbie reynolds-buffs. there is no sparkle in this story of a screenwriter who latches onto a much-younger girl for 'script research'. dick powell makes his farewell screen appearance in what must have been an embarrassment to him. reynolds is pallid. produced by one harriet parsons--who gives her famous mother louella a number of inane plugs. *1/2 from ****
