i hate to comment on something i didn't finish, but if i spare one person what i sat through for almost an hour before turning it off in disgust, it will be worth it. <br /><br />i decided to watch this with an open mind, knowing it was on the bottom 100.<br /><br />bad idea. i usually love crude humor, or can at least tolerate it. i love so-called "black" comedies. i'm not easily offended, either. <br /><br />it started off okay and quickly went downhill. i laughed a few times (for example, when the main character got stuck in the airplane toilet), but that was it and didn't compensate for the strong disgust i felt.<br /><br />i didn't laugh when the dog got sucked into a jet engine. i usually can't see the humor in animals dying (except in animal house). i didn't laugh at much else of the nastiness, either. i turned it off after an incident involving a blind man and a baked potato that i don't care to repeat the details of, only that the wave of nausea still hasn't passed over me. <br /><br />simply put, it was smut-filled and simply not funny with barely any plot. this is one of the times when if you don't have something nice to say, you should get the word out.<br /><br />don't say i didn't warn you.
