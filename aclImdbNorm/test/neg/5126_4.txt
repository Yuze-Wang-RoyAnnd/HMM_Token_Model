when i first watched this movie, in the 80s, i loved it. i was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything. however, i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd, and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was. i mean, in a realistic world, she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory... the whole thing was quite pathetic. the character developments also lacked in depth. i think that this was, very much, a product of the 80s: the film does not hold up today!
