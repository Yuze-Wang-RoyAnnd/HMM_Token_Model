this was the biggest disappointment of a movie...:( sucks, cos i was really looking forward to it.<br /><br />all the twists were crap. they were all flashbacks!!! <br /><br />what makes a good heist movie is the believability of the the job. yes it has to be surprising so the audience is stunned, but if you walk away and go that's bulls#!t... what's the point? <br /><br />plus the main heist was a bag snatch anyway! you didn't get to see the team operating at it's full deceptive and brilliant potential. there was not even one good heist in this movie! they were all rubbish.. including that french idiot's break dancing crap to get through the lasers... it's easy to do that when they are composited in afterwards! plus that kind of stuff has already been done in at least one other movie.. and it was stupid then as well...<br /><br />also, there's no reason to have even half of the 12 or 11 in this movie! what difference do half of the cast really make to the outcome of this movie??? half the scenes don't even need to be there! <br /><br />the first one was classy. this was cheap! and it makes the whole team loose credibility. especially ocean himself for bowing down the bennett.
