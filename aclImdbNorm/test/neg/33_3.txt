sorry, but jacqueline hyde (get it??? - jack l and hyde - jekyll & hyde) has some of the worst acting this side of hardcore porn, not to mention a script apparently written by a first-grader with undiagnosed learning disabilities.<br /><br />jackie hyde inherits an old mansion by a grandfather she never knew she had. guess who? yes, an inventor of the special formula that slowly takes over one's body and mind - yes, that mr. hyde! <br /><br />despite some nice skin scenes, this film fails to register any feeling or emotion other than uncontrollable laughter.<br /><br />as much as poor jackie tries she just can't stay away from granddaddy's special formula and the result is an hour and half of wasted time.
