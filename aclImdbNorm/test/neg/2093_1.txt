i can't believe that anyone would green light this let alone voluntarily star in it. i will never be able to get that 90 mins of my life back.<br /><br />this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen. some films are so bad they're good. this has gone so far round again that's somehow it's so bad it's terrible. i was not exactly expecting much, it being a low budget, bandwagon jumping, rehash of a b movie, but it still came in way under my expectation levels. even tv movies have higher production values.<br /><br />there were (very) poor special effects, shocking dialogue, terrible acting and a completely unexplained plot. who cursed her and why, why did the 6 inch snakes turn into 15 foot snakes, has anyone ever heard of highly venomous garter snakes or pythons? 100 passengers? 3,000 snakes? so many promises, none delivered. <br /><br />some comments would have you believe that this film is worth watching for the last five minutes. it's not even worth a rental. stay in and watch a low budget tv movie, you'll enjoy it a lot more. <br /><br />why was this made? oh yes, to shamelessly cash in on the internet phenomenon that is soap. shame on you mallachi brothers, shame on you
