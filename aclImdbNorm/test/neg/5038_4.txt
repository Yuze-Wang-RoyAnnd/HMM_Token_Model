not only is the great rock n roll swindle thoroughly inaccurate, but when it comes down to it, not much about it is interesting or even entertaining. malcolm mclaren apparently squandered the majority of the sex pistols earnings on this waste of film, which makes it that much more obnoxious. the intention, from the beginning, was to create a monument to the "genius" of mclaren, who to this day takes full credit for creating punk music, creating the sex pistols, and at times even writing all the songs. viewers follow mclaren to various settings, where he tells his story to his sidekick, a female dwarf, and simply takes credit for one thing after another. one particularly irritating scene has mclaren in an abandoned airplane hangar, waiting for a plane, being hounded by reporters and giving them their "big story". the most entertaining elements of the film are the animated short pieces, however, even these reek of mclaren's overbearing self-importance.<br /><br />even as a farce, this film doesn't work. little about it is entertaining, except for steve jones, who is surprisingly decent as a pseudo-detective type person. 20 years later, julien temple, who wrote and directed this film, also directed the sex pistols documentary "the filth and the fury". while that movie is much better and more interesting than "swindle", it still is full of temple's "artistic flourishes" that just don't work, like interviewing band members in shadow, as if they are some kind of crime witness trying to hide their identity. an interesting bit of trivia: film critic roger ebert was one of the original scriptwriters for the movie "who killed bambi?", which eventually became "swindle".
