this movie is perfect for any aspiring screen writer, actor or director. by watching this movie you will see all the things that are wrong with the film industry as it is today. there are so many clich'es that it pained me to sit through this movie. nothing about it is original and every single line spoken has been ripped off from those clich'ed movies that we all saw in the 90's. although it does have a few cheap laughs, overall it is wrong wrong wrong. i was so immensely bored and the movie was so predictable and pathetic i actually noticed how much make-up was caked onto tara reid's face to hide those massive bags and wrinkles from her endless partying. seriously, she was wearing so much foundation you could literally scrape it off and refill an entire bottle of it.<br /><br />what shocked me though was that so many of the talented and popular cast would sign on for this piece of junk. and i do not know how i sat through that horrible screaming that ashton kutcher does, you know when he's like angry or something and he shouts his words in this annoying manner? ashton's horrifying "talking", tara's face being ten shades darker than her neck, a drugged up owl, a script that seemed like the work of a three-year-old...<br /><br />seriously, in my whole life there has been no movie that i have watched that i did not in someway enjoy no matter how bad it was. this deserves an award for being the first. bad bad bad... i don't think there is a single word in the english dictionary that can possibly describe this trashy movie. today i was trying to re-watch it but i had to turn it off like ten minutes in because i was about to cry from the overwhelming amount of clich'es.<br /><br />don't even bother to rent this at your blockbuster, it's not worth a cent, as a matter of fact i am willing to pay anyone out there considering to watch this movie so they can go do something decent with their lives.
