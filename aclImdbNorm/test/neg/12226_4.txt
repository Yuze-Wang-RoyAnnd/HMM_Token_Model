back in 2002 when matthew lawrence did the hot chick, i also saw drumline that day. drumline wins by default! if the comebcaks had been released in march (as planned) the same time tmnt was released, tmnt would've won by default! <br /><br />granted, matthew lawrence did a fine job portraying a quarterback. he didn't have to resort to uttering dirty words which is a plus. but when he started playing with his private parts as well as another football players and touching a girl's boob, those were the minuses.<br /><br />but the biggest minus that ticked me off is that every football player got to participate in the mock music video, except matthew lawrence (insert the price is right's losing horns)! another blown musical opportunity for him, just because he's shy about doing music.<br /><br />in the past, matt has disappointed me many times (super human samurai syber squad) where he came so close to having a musical moment, but ended up failing.<br /><br />sure, joey had a singing career with two albums to his belt and andrew's starting a music career of his own. but it's very rare to find a matt musical moment. the two that stand out would be on brotherly love where he played the guitar and sang "pigeon on your car" (art atrack), which he wrote by the way, and that romantic boy meets world moment when he sang "this dame" (as time goes by).<br /><br />matt, you've played jocks too long. why not make a musical comeback. you have a good voice and i miss your musical side.
