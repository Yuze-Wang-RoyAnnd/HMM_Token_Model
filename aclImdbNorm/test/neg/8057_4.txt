this film is about a young man's painful journey to discovering his sexuality.<br /><br />the film is raw and unpretentious. it does not rely on steamy sex scenes to attract the viewers. though the plot may seem incoherent and disconnected at times, and some events are not properly explained. i can understand it though, because this film is a collection of memories that are highly personal to the director. the subplot of about his sister and mother probably does not need to exist in the film, but i can certainly imagine that these are very important events in his life.<br /><br />the low budget of the film is clearly discernible. it is a pity that the sound effects are poorly done. the narration and some dialogs (particularly the scene in the classroom with the french teacher) have so much echo, which makes it hard to make out what is said. the ambient noise, notable traffic noise, is also captured throughout the film. when a scene cuts into another, the level of traffic noise changes.<br /><br />this film is probably not entertaining, but it certainly serves as an insightful diary of a young man's journey to embracing his sexuality.
