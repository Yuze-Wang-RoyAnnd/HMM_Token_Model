the sequel that no one asked for to the movie no one wanted. there are obviously too many flaws with this movie to name here, so i'll just concentrate on the acting. miles o'keefe would have been better suited to play the spritely asian sidekick thong, mainly because he would then have no dialogue. lisa foster delivers her lines displaying one emotion, dullness. charles borremel brings life to his part by pausing every five words. and finally the flamboyant, john saxon-type guy......no comment is needed.<br /><br />see "conan the barbarian" if you need to, but don't waste your time with this low-budget loser.
