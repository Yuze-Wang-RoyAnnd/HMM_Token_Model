what was wes thinking making this dribble? it does not jive well with any of his other work but then again he seemed to fall into a slight slump after making a a nightmare on elm street. this can be seen by his follow ups 1.invatation to hell 2.chiller 3.hills have eyes ii 4.deadly friend 5.serpant and the rainbow 6.shocker all of these films were either mediocre our crap it was not until people under the stairs that he gained his momentum back and started to kick butt again. chiller it'self has none of craven's regulars and none of his suspense. the only good scene in when the old man has a heart attack on the stairs after graveling for his job.
