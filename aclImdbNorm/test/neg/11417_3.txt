to put it simply, this was a pompous piece of canine poopie. overly stagey and everyone being the total melodramatic drama queen at every single moment. after a while, i was starting to wish that every character in the movie wasn't such a stuffed-up anal retentive.<br /><br />and, this movie has another one of those truly annoying things that has recently come into vogue and shouldn't have: all the scenes are in a sort of washed-out, blue-steel-greyishness. hmmm, the last time i checked, candles and torches are quite capable of putting a fairly wide spectrum of colors. in fact, the light they put out tends to be more in the warmish, yellowish-orange range of the spectrum. so where's all the blue-steel-grey light coming from?<br /><br />this movie has fancy sets and glitzy cgi fx, but it's still dreck. it's pathetic junk put out for today's movie-goers who are easily placated by pathetic junk.<br /><br />i very much enjoy vampires and werewolves as movie plot devices, but this was a total hack job.<br /><br />universal studios' 1941 "the wolfman" is infinitely superior to this even though its fx is pretty primitive compared to what could be done nowadays.<br /><br />i'm done with this franchise. the first movie was reasonably decent. the second still somewhat entertaining. but this one i couldn't even finish all the way to the end because it was so boring.
