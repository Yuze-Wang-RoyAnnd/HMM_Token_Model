if there's one thing i want to distinguish myself from all the other great reviewers here, it's that i am the queen of finding strange movies in thrift and dollar stores. that said, you can't possibly imagine how happy i was when i found this one. <br /><br />i can even remember that saturday morning when *every* station simulcast it, so you were stuck if you wanted to watch something else (then again, i guess that was the idea). as a kid, i didn't know if i liked the way all the different characters were stuck together (there are some crossovers that just do *not* work). but i guess the special had it's intended effect. don't do drugs because you will have nightmares about the muppets.<br /><br />now, if you watch this as an adult, on the other hand, you will be treated to the *strangest* anti-drug movie this side of "reefer madness". i think i'll just leave it at that before i get into trouble.
