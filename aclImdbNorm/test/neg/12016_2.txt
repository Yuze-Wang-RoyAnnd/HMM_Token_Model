seriously! you've just got to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it. it came out during the time period where everybody was trying to make family movies that everyone could enjoy (the little rascals; mr. nanny, etc.) yet it lacked any charisma or enthusiasm. every single character in the movie is driven by rage, with the exception of trixie's mother, who shows only aggravation and weariness, possibly at the tired clich'e's this movie enjoys. <br /><br />to put it simply, the biggest flaw in the film was not the acting, nor the filming, but most notably the writing. the lines we receive are reminiscent of disney classics, although this film lacks the whole-heartedness il' walt managed to pull off. junior's dad, (john ritter) makes you mad without even doing anything, simply because he allows junior to run around unsupervised, and only gives him a stern warning when he tapes a 200-pound behemoth to a chalk board. <br /><br />also, junior's grandfather is particularly excruciating. for those of you who saw the first one, found it nauseating, and thus, did not see the second one, "big ben healy" as he is referred to in this movie, is still a total douche. he basically barges into john ritter's house uninvited, settles himself in junior's room, even though he says that he hates junior, and basically does nothing to accelerate the film's speed, or to support the film in any way. rather, he ticks off the audience by being a lazy free loader.<br /><br />finally, we are introduced to a wide variety of new characters, such as the smug, obnoxious, trixie, who carries dynamite in her backpack, which she first lights, then hands, to junior, who simply stares wide eyed at. also, gilbert gottfried returns in this film, this time playing the obnoxious principal at junior's new elementary school. if gilbert gottfried ain't enough to get the point across, i will put it simply: this film reeks!<br /><br />2/10 stars, because the actor's convictions shine through the film, even though the script sucks.
