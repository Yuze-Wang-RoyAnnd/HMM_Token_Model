many people are standing in front of the house n some women are crying... men standing in close groups and speaking in hushed up tone... a couple of guys come in and they are discussing how sexy the daughter might look today... soon u will know someone in the house has died... the dead person's wife is worried about preparing food for so many people, her friend sitting beside her gives an idea of making the matters easy by preparing simple roti sabji... one of the dead person's son is speaking with someone over the mobile, daughter is busy with her makeup... her mother suggests her to wear salwar kameej, but the daughter is more interested in looking good when so many people will be visiting their house and hence prefers jeans and t shirt over salwar kameez... another son asks her mom to finish all the kriyas and also indicates to her that he should not be expected to come early from the office... then the camera slowly focuses on the dead person... the white cloth covering the face is displaced slightly due to the wind, revealing the face ... its anupam kher... suddenly alarm rings and he gets up from the bed... is it his dream or a flash back? u won't get an answer until the end of the movie...well, this is wat comedy is for the director dibakar banerjee!!!!! later u find out this scene has nothing to do with the actual movie and hence making everything obvious that the still described earlier was a dream. is this a film comedy? well it is supposed to belong to that category... but it actually does not!!! there is nothing that can be remotely associated with comedy in the movie!!! more over the director gives the message that no one will get justice from police!!! so everyone must cheat the cheats!!!! or forget about justice!!!! music by bapi-tutul & dhruv dhalla is ok... nothing much to tell about other sectors... bad script destroys everything... not even anupam kher's performance succeeds in making it at least a paisa vasool...
