persuaded by the 7.0 points in imdb, which is pretty good, i decided to watch this movie. however, i found this movie quiet boring (about 2 hours) and full of clich'es, a little girl getting multiple personalities after a childhood trauma etc. tamer karadagli is quiet funny in this movie, dialogs motions etc, you will have to see it, he is kinda the tough cop you see on american movies, perhaps copied too much. i would describe this movie as ordinary american thriller with a little bit of turkish touch, unfortunately yet again i'm convinced that comedies and dramas are the only genres worth watching in turkish cinema anyways i gave this movie a 4, its too boring and full of clich'es
