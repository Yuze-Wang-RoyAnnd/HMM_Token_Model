a boring movie about a miserable loser...that's factotum in a nutshell. matt dillon plays henry chinaski, alter ego of author charles bukowski upon whose novel the film is based. as we meet chinaski he may be a writer but he's certainly not a successful one. he floats through life, getting fired from one menial job after another and not caring a bit. the fact that he's always drunk may have something to do with his not caring. he meets a woman, jan, played by lili taylor and a relationship ensues. chinaski moves into jan's apartment and now instead of getting drunk by himself he can get drunk with somebody else. good times. eventually he's had enough of this relationship so chinaski strikes out on his own. unfortunately he still can't hold down a job so soon enough he's broke. at this point marisa tomei shows up and for some reason her character, laura, decides to rescue this miserable drunken loser whom she doesn't even know. we soon meet some of laura's acquaintances and the film veers off into a sort of bizarro world with this rather eclectic bunch. soon enough tomei and friends are out of the picture and once again we're left with chinaski and his drinking and his miserable little life. there's some more time spent with jan but mostly there's just time spent being a drunk, unemployable loser. and then the movie's over and not a moment too soon. 94 minutes of absolute monotony and it seems infinitely longer as the movie drags on. nothing happens. nothing ever happens. if you want to spend an hour and a half of your life watching matt dillon drink then this is the movie for you. if you're looking for a compelling story, well developed characters or any entertainment value whatsoever then you've come to the wrong place. dillon's performance actually isn't bad at all. too bad the movie which surrounds him is in fact rather bad.
