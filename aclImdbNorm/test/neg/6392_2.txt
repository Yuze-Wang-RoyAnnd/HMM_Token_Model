michael caine's character has problems. he's a plain, nearsighted, insecure man in his mid-40s. he's married but his wife doesn't seem to love him anymore. he has a poor relationship with his only daughter. but his most immediate problem is that a stunningly beautiful young woman, played by michelle johnson, is pursuing him too ardently, kissing him, groping him, and trying to initiate sex at every opportunity. what's the poor fellow to do? <br /><br />this movie should be taken out of the comedy section and placed under science fiction. only an intergalactic brain chip can explain the actions of michelle johnson's character. let's see - 3 billion men in the world - she can pretty much have her pick - she goes with an clumsy, aging loser. this goes beyond a middle-aged male fantasy into something so delusional, you just hope that everyone involved voluntarily submitted to therapy.<br /><br />there's not really anything funny here. there are some quick attempts at wit from caine, who often seems to playing hawkeye pierce more than a new character. joseph bologna is like fingernails on a chalkboard. michelle johnson is no actress - she has one crying scene that wouldn't pass muster in a high school play - but she is beautiful and she does take her clothes off. so buy the dvd, skip to scenes 4 and 9, and forget the rest.
