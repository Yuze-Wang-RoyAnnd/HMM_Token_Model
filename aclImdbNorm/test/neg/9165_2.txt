i went into this movie with semi-high expectations after loving the cartoon series in my childhood, and this nearly wrecked that love for me. jason lee, david seville in the film, is horrifying. i understand it can't be easy to act with cgi characters who aren't actually there, but i really found his performance atrocious, along with all the other non-animated characters. the chipmunks were adorable, yet sometimes blatantly obvious at moving the plot of the story along, and therefore did not tempt me to stay in the theater for longer than half an hour into the film. if you feel you must see this film, rent it, at the most. it is not worth eight bucks to see it in theaters, unless you'd like a good laugh at the horrible acting.
