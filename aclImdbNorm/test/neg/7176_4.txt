i'll admit that this isn't a great film. it practically screams "low-budget" yet oddly i still found myself liking the film because although it lacked quality it abounded with energy. it was like the little engine that could and a movie merged into one! <br /><br />the film takes place at a radio network and concerns some of their low-level employees--two page boys (one very pushy and brash and the other one a wuss) as well as a new receptionist. all three have visions of radio stardom but must for now content themselves with their lowly jobs.<br /><br />into this story appears a murder that seems somewhat out of the blue. i didn't know that this was a murder mystery film and was taken a bit by surprise. however, like most b-mysteries, the cops are lamebrains and it's up to our pushy hero (moran) to try to save the day. throughout all this, i had a hard time deciding if moran was obnoxious or endearing. i'm still not sure!! <br /><br />there is a moment in the film that is high on the 'cringe factor' and that is when the two pages try out for the roles of radio comedians. they show up in black-face and do a 3rd or 4th rate imitation of amos n' andy. apart from being very insensitive, it also wasn't funny. fortunately the producer of the show they were trying out for seemed to feel the same way.<br /><br />overall. it's easy to skip this film and i wouldn't blame you if you do. however, the weird and frenetic pace of the film actually seemed to make up for the artistic deficiencies of the film and i am glad i saw it. a good film? no. but one that is still worth a peek for fans of old bs.<br /><br />by the way, perhaps i just don't have very good taste, but i thought both female singing divas really had poor voices despite how everyone in the film is captivated by their warblings. listen for yourself and let me know what you think. i just couldn't believe either was allowed to sing on film--even if it was just for lowly monogram studios.
