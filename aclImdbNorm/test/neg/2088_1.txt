this film is bad, yes, but had the producers used a real kangaroo, it would have killed the actor it was boxing with. i am an australian and i have seen two seven foot tall male 'roos fighting each other, it is not a pretty sight as the object is for one or the other to kill it's opponent,(this is there way of securing the herd of females) and there are incidents where someone has boxed a kangaroo, and been injured or killed, so when you see a kangaroo on tv or film it is likely to be a female, or animated, as it is a good idea not to injure actors (they might be annoyed at losing the ability to breath). there is a strange idea that australian animals are cute and cuddly, that is false, many are dangerous (10 of the 12 most deadliest snakes live here)and most are just plain ugly (koalas are as soft as steal wool). so if you come to australia be carefull!!!
