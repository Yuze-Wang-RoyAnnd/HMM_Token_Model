you might think that a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting, but it's far from that. take the concept for example: the main character(s) have a big secret that they hide from they're peers. it's just like hannah montana and that's so raven. next, the acting is just average. selena gomez seems to be half asleep through many scenes. lastly, the jokes are either clich'e or boring. if they're not using they're colorful, yet strange dialog to make us "laugh", they are throwing various props around the room. i really wish this show would use more original and entertaining material. in conclusion, wisards of waverly place is a disappointment.
