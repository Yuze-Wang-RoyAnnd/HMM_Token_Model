i can't express enough just how bad this film was. first of all what a waste of some legendary stars although they are quite old and pretty unconvincing. fred astaire, well i guess he must have owed some one a big favor as this was his last film role. the script is a mess and the film seems terribly draggy. i imagine maybe if i saw this back when it came out (1981) i might have thought it was decent. however seeing so many actual good horror films, this was one of the worst. the only real convincing anything in this mess was the very young and lovely sort/of creepy alice krige. the main young character was trying to act the best he could but was utterly terrible. i wasn't sure how much of it was from his lack of skill or the lack of a comprehend-able script, but either way he was just plain bad. don't watch unless you want to see a bunch of old guys be somewhat scared.
