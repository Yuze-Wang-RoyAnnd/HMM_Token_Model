someone told me that pink flamingos was, in a word, "insane". now i'm doubting whether this guy actually ever saw it, because that isn't the way i would summarize it in one word. disgusting, absurd, um, more disgusting...would do it. every time you think it can't get any more filthy, it does. one of my particular "favorites" was when divine had her birthday party and when the cops came to bust it up, they were butchered and eaten by the guests. i admit that it's one of those movies where it's so grotesque you simply can't look away, but this is by no means a creative work of art. it's pure shock value.<br /><br />on the upside, it makes the jackass guys look like a bunch of pussies.
