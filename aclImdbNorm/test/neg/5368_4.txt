the atmosphere in this show is great. there's plenty of excellent buildup, but thats where this show fails. there's way to much build up for nothing. you will constantly see a creepy set up that makes it feel likes something really freaky is coming right out of the corner and then....nothing. over and over again nothing. you hear plenty of stories of people talking about freaky events but you see none. they show up at these peoples doors, talk about their deep and emotional pasts, set up lame equipment and find nothing! there is nothing on this show thats leads me to believe in anything paranormal. i laugh every time they need to exercise a "horrible spirit" that we as an audience have seen nothing of. they get rid of the spirit that never was and everything is put in a neat little package. a show that looked so freaky and had such great potential leads up to one thing...nothing!
