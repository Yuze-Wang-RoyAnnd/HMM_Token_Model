it's not plot driven, ok; it's not a character study, fine; there's no action, alright; there's no point, hmmm...<br /><br />maybe it's supposed to represent the boredom and absurdity of living in palistine and parts of israel these days in a state of violence, petty disagreements, deep rooted hostility, etc. but mostly it's long, long scenes of nothing happening - or things which look like they're dripping with meaning (a checkpoint tower crashing to the ground, an arafat balloon floating into jerusalem, a crouching tiger women deflecting bullets into a halo) but when you try to derive some meaning, there's no there there.<br /><br />bonus: you can watch this film in fast forward and it will make absolutely no difference except that it might be slightly less boring.
