recap: since the warrior queen gedren raised and slaughtered most of sonja's family, she has trained in the art of sword fighting. now, gedren has taken a very powerful talisman, that threatens to destroy the world if not destroyed, killing sonja's sister in the process. now sonja is out for revenge, and to save the world. along the way, she meets the very conan-like (but not conan, no!) kalidor, the child-prince tarn and his bodyguard falcon. at first sonja declines all help, but is later forced to accept it, and together they go to save the world.<br /><br />comments: when you watch a movie like this, and you think that it is the story that the is the best element in this movie, the movie is in big trouble. because 1) a movie like this should draw its strength upon good swordfights and effects, and 2) the story is really, really bad. it is simple, and uncomplicated and really offers nothing in way of character development or even suspense. it is predictable and boring, and the obvious couple, sonja and kalidor, has no chemistry at all. and the kid is just annoying. and most of the scenes is drawn out so long that they become boring. though the movie is not very long, it has not material enough to fill its time. and so back to point 1). the fighting is slow, uneventful and really bad. it clearly shows most fighters clearly blocking the opponents strokes far ahead of the opponent has even begun to strike. in my honest opinion, i believe most kids, fighting with sticks, creates more exciting fights playing knights than this movie did. all in all, this is a really bad spin-off, that should be avoided by all who liked the conan-movies.<br /><br />2/10
