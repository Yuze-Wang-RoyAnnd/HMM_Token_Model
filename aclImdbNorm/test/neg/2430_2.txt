first when does this storyline take place? it has to take place after the first movie because kuzco knows pacha and chicha has her third child but it can't take place after the second movie because doesn't kronk get a girlfriend or wife or something? you never see her in the show.<br /><br />also, why is kuzco going to school? the whole plot of the show is that kuzco is going to school so that he can be emperor. but wasn't he emperor before this? and who's emperor while he learning to be emperor? shouldn't that be yzma? or was yzma fired in this time line already? and if that true why is waiting for him to fail to become empresses? plus, you know in the first movie he said he was trained from birth to be an emperor by private tutors. so he should kinda know what he's doing.<br /><br />kronk. why is kronk a student? he's around 25 they stated that in the first movie. he's an adult going to high school. does everyone think he's a moron? i really like kronk but i think because of his age and because everyone know that he is working for yzma he should have been a teacher. being a home ec teacher would be right up his alley.<br /><br />malina, is very unlikable. she suppose to be kuzco's love interest/moral compass. but a lot of time, she comes off bossy and know it all. she commonly says thinks i like "i should be proud because i am pretty and smart". <br /><br />she has esp when it comes to kuzco and knows whenever he's in trouble, when he's cheating, or even when he sings the hot hot hottie song in his head even though she does cheer leading, school newspaper and keeps straight a+ in all of her classes. <br /><br />she seems more interested in using her prettiness to get kuzco to do the right thing and do well in school then dating him. in fact, she seems more motherly to kuzco then a love interest.<br /><br />yzma. as i bought up before yzma is trying to get kuzco to fail so she become empresses. not sure how that's suppose to work with being fired and all. yzma seems to be reliving the first movie in every episode. in almost every show that she appears in she turns kuzco into an animal in hopes of having him fail a class. (there are only 3 times that i can think of that that didn't happen.) the jokes about yzma being old aren't as clever in the show as they were the movie. and classic jokes about yzma are used to death in the show (like the "pull the level, krunk!", roller-coaster, and the lab). <br /><br />also, some other points that don't make sense in this series. the fact that whenever kuzco is assigned something everyone acts like this assignment will make him pass or fail the class but he seems to pass every assignment given to him. so why does one assignment matter so much?<br /><br />seriously, who is ruling the kingdom while this is going on? do they have a consul or a steward? you never see anyone ruling the kingdom unless kuzco has weaseled his powers back or yzma is empresses.<br /><br />why is kuzco going to a normal peasant school? shouldn't he learning about how to lead a country, what to do in case of war or something that will be useful to him in the future? i could see taking some normal classes on like farming (so he would know how to prepare the country for a famine or something like that) but knot tying? how is that helpful?<br /><br />now i know that someone is going to say "but it not suppose to make sense; it's suppose to be funny." then they should have more funny things in there. all the funny things about the show have been done already in the movie. also, if they notice some of these huge plot holes why don't they poke fun at them like in the movie? (for example, when yzma and kronk get to the secret lab before kuzco and pacha and yzma and kronk can't explain how they got their first.)<br /><br />there are some good points, it is nice to see some of the characters from the first movie in the series like bucky and monkey with the bug. pacha and his family are still very good characters with a good down earth feel. i feel that this series would be amusing for younger children. <br /><br />in conclusion, the series is not as good as the movie that it based on but it may good for younger children.
