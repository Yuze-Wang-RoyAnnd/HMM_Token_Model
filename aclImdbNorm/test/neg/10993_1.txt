one of the worst movie i have seen in 2009 so far: the story hesitates between a silly thriller or a dumb comedy.<br /><br />as nothings happens, the void is filled with long, boring dialogs that don't make any sense! <br /><br />the cast is famous but doesn't bring any emotions except to fast-forward the play! <br /><br />and it happens in a plush seaside hotel that looks really gloomy. in comparison, the one of the "shining" is funfair! <br /><br />nb: a lot of users think that it is located in the french riviera! they are wrong! it isn't the south of france (nice, cannes) but totally the opposite: cabourg & normandy, to be simple the beaches of the d-day! that's why the sea is as grey as the sky and there isn't sun!
