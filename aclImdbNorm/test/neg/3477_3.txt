this documentary attempts comedy, but never quite gets there for me. camp? ehn, maybe. the more apt word that everyone will agree on -- and have a hard time avoiding in any review -- is kitsch. it dripped kitsch. it was as if the film makers had worried their viewers would take the movie too seriously, and so they bent over backwards to insert kitsch and proclaim, "we're joking around here! see???"<br /><br />in short, i felt it was trying too hard. for example, the sock puppets that introduced each scene were (to me) annoying when i'm sure they were meant to be amusing -- or at least (ahem) kitsch-ey.<br /><br />do not, however, avoid this movie based on my complaints. just be ready to revel in kitsch rather than having it thrust at you unprepared. if you're interested in lighthearted fare, you could do far, far worse. at the very least, the facts surrounding the rise and fall of the bakers make this interesting and worth a view. at best, gaggles of like minded kitsch lovers will hoot and holler over choice bits throughout the film.
