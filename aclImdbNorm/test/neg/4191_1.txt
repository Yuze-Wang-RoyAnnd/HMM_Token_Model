only adding to the chorus of people who deemed this to be 'unredeemable' i will state the following without repeating the obvious flaws plainly stated by some of the other commentators: the "film" is shot on video (what type of camera i don't know) but the cameraman had it on autofocus(!) all the time, so that any slight movement makes it go in and out of focus. in many of the scenes the actors themselves go out of focus for their scenes. this alone screams "amateur".<br /><br />i also noticed that out in the 'middle of the cornfield', you can hear the sound of the gasoline generator that is powering the lights ... loudly.<br /><br />also what is with that single lighting source that follows (and many times 'leads' the actors) when they walk around. it looks like a newscaster with that 'on camera light' that follows the people around like a spotlight. there was no 'credit' for lighting design/dp and i know why. the 'filmmakers' saw no need to have someone who actually knew what they were doing lighting this picture (note i didn't say "film"). so be prepared for a single glaring spotlight as the sole source of 'cinematic lighting' for most of the movie. ughhh!!!<br /><br />this is probably the most technically inept production i've ever seen commercially released. i "bought" this title because i like bad cinema. usually it's so bad that you can laugh at it. this is just so bad that it's unwatchable. plan nine from outer space is "citizen kane" in comparison to this title.
