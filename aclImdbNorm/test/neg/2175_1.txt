this excruciatingly boring and unfunny movie made me think that chaplin was the real hitler, as only someone as evil as him could torture people with this tripe. i saw this movie remastered, which only made the suffering inflicted by this atrocity more severe. this movie is nothing but a pathetic, repetitive movie, which instead of inducing two hours of laughter, it induced two hours of suicidal urges. after the first 10 minutes of this, i began wishing that gas would start seeping from the speakers of the theatre.<br /><br />if i could give it a zero out of ten i would happily do so. avoid at all costs!
