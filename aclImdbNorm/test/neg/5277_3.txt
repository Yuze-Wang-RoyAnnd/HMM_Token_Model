this film is terribly bad. kevin spacey is a really great actor, he shines in la confidential, american beauty, usual suspects, 7 etc.. but this is truly rubbish, he came nowhere near a decent irish accent, maybe he should have practiced it with kate hudson while she was doing about adam. to irish people this film is laughable and even worse, its quite irritating for several scenes. i think the producers made this film hoping the target audience (non-europe)would had never seen or heard of the 'general' or martin cahill and be enthralled in an intriguing and entertaining story. total crud!!
