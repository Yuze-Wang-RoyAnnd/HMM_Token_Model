i didn't really know what to expect from "future-kill", but i certainly hoped it would be a little better than what i got. i knew the rating was bad and the reviews were unfavorable, but the subversive dvd-cover illustration looks beyond cool and i can't resist that. for a very long (too long, in fact) time, this film raised the impression of being an unofficial sequel to porky's with lame, vulgar and offensive fraternity pranks. five mega-dorks, one of them resembling an exact young clone of jim carrey, desperately want to become members of a frat house but their ultimate initiation might just be a tad bit far-fetched and dangerous. they are dropped in the city center with provocative marks painted on their faces, simultaneously with the outbreak of a violent gang war. it doesn't take too long before they are confronted with splatter, a seemingly half-man and half-machine warrior, who leads a gang of which i never really figured out who or what they were. were they a government experiment? cyborgs? terminator imitations from a distant future? does anyone care? "future-kill" is a bizarre amateur flick with a scenario that leaps from one subject onto the other without any form of logical connection or narrative. the plot borrows vital elements from great cinematic cult classics like "the warriors", "escape from new york" and "the terminator", but the end result is one gigantic sci-fi monstrosity. the costumes and special effects are quite pitiable and there's a truckload of cheap and gratuitous nudity. the acting is terrible, but i'm willing to blame the retarded dialogs instead of the cast members. one to avoid at all costs, in spite of really cool dvd-cover art. resist it!
