this is the second addition to frank baum's personally produced trilogy of oz films. it's essentially the same childishness as in the other two pictures, although i consider it preferable to the others because it's shorter. as in the other films, there are performers in animal costumes, an adult woman pretends to be a boy, and the characters and plot jump all over the place while the camera-work is static. this time, at the centre is a magic cloak that grants wishes, and the boy played by a woman is made a king.<br /><br />most of the special effects are witnessed at the beginning. fairies are represented by multiple-exposure photography. and, there's a man in the moon that looks just like those made by georges m'eli`es years before, most famously in 'le voyage dans la lune' (1902). m'eli`es' imaginative fantasies and creative trick effects made him the leading pioneer of early cinema, and the films he made around the turn of the century were far better and even technically more advanced than this trifling oz series.
