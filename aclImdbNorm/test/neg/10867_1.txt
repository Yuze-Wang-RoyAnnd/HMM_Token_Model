the worse film i have every seen. like the other honest reviewers, it is just an excuse for getting naked birds with their juggs out. don't get wrong, naked women isn't a bad thing but there is another film genre for that. <br /><br />boyfriends beware. i sold this to my girlfriend as a classic bike gang fest (due to reviews) to be greeted with every other scene full of naked women gyrating about the place. slap in the chops for me.<br /><br />what makes me laugh the most is all the dogey bike dives they went to in the film were full of models with the works cosmetically - what biker bars have these? they are usually slightly haggard with tattoos and far saggier juggs! completely unrealistic.the acting is terrible, loads of pointless swearing and a complete waste of time storyline.<br /><br />did anyone check out vinnie jones's attempt at an american accent? its as embarrassing as his football skills.<br /><br />avoid like the plague. the only reason you would watch this film is if you are a young lad who cant access p@rn and have nicked it from their parents movie collection for a few pervy kicks!
