well i will come clean and admit that i was forced as part of my history degree to watch this film, and then write a short film review as part of my grade.<br /><br />yet even if i had watched the film alone, at my own discretion i found it extremely boring and absurd. the style is dated beyond its years, and the acting is farcical. rather than use dialogue they instead exchange eye popping glances at each other, or sometimes into thin air. for me, such over the top acting does not convey any greater emotion, and after seeing an extreme close up ivan's face for the hundredth time i was praying for the film to end.<br /><br />the most disappointing though is how wrong ivan's character is. this man was nasty, his bodyguard's murderous thugs and his character cowardly. for me the film was nothing but a piece of stalin propaganda, inaccurate and dull.
