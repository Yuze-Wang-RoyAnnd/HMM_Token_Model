this is almost ed wood territory. yeah, that ridiculous wreck of a flying monster looks like a cross between a turkey buzzard and a bad day at the dentist's office. and that sound effect screech makes fingernails across a blackboard sound like mozart. and why the giant claw when the goofy critter gobbles its victims with a mechanical jaw. we get big close-ups of the ugly chicken foot, but nothing more. i guess the producers thought a more appropriately titled big mouth might suggest a jerry lewis comedy. and speaking of comedies, all that "anti-matter" gobbledy-gook is funnier than anything in a lewis movie. i guess the scripters were stuck for a reason why an ordinary duck hunter couldn't take care of a 1950's flying menace, so they concocted a real whopper-- anti-matter from another galaxy. yup, this fugitive from kfc is supposed to have flown in from another galaxy behind a shield of anti- matter as explained in excruciating detail by one of the film's resident geniuses. in this case, it's jeff morrow a pilot who i gather in his off-hours advises einstein on the secrets of the universe. <br /><br />unfortunately, it's also morrow who keeps the ridiculous proceedings out of the bad-movie hall of shame since he actually delivers his lines with a straight face. what's more, he even sounds as if he believes them. this is a movie acting triumph of the first order. to heck with the oscars, morrow deserves a combat medal for performing above and beyond the call of duty under the most extreme bad movie circumstances. watch leading lady corday, then you can gauge his fortitude under fire. she looks like she just woke up inside a bad dream and maybe if she stands stock-still, no one will notice her. i barely did. oh well, the first time i saw this drive-in disaster was through a beery haze in the back row of what's now a housing development. i should have learned my lesson and broken out another 12-pack this second time around.
