it was so boring! no plot whatsoever! basically a watered-down version of the lion king mixed in with animal farm. again, no plot at all. horrible! worst hour and a half of my life!oh my gosh! i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief! i maybe chuckled twice. all of the semi-funny parts are in the previews. i hate movies like that. yeah, the movie pretty much sucked. i don't know how it got such good ratings and reviews. there is no plot or storyline!! if you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out. awful. i don't think i've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much. it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if i'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.
