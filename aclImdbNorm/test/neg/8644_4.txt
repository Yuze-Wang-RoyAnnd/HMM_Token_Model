william petersen (that c.s.i guy) has a small uncredited role but it's the best part of the movie. his character comes across smart ass and tough, and it's a fun surprise to see him in this. he has a range that allows him to play just about anything. after his 5 minutes, it goes from looking cool to just nothing much. it leaves you hoping that his character will reappear in the movie but after 20 minutes you give up hope. the movie itself is pretty poor. worth a watch on tmn or a pick up at the library but not much more. too much of it reminds you of l.a confidential except that where that movie starts to get complicated upon itself, this one is so loose, it steers everywhere but where it should. 2 out of 5 stars
