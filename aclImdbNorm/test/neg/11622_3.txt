the plot outline of this movie is similar to the original. someone gets kidnapped, the prince is incest with saving her, odet turns into a swan, the turtle/frog/puffin first the "bad" magician as best they can, and in the end.... anyways, there is not much new here. with the exception of a lack of well known voice talent. sorry, no palance nor cleese and thus jean-bob was a disapointment.
