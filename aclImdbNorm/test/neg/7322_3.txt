this film makes about as much sense as an 'ozzie & harriet' or a 'father knows best' episode. an old copy of reader's digest (circa 1962) would provide more insight into modern life, or the relationship between a father and a daughter, than this weird concoction.<br /><br />i was surprised with diane keaton. she appears to sleepwalk through the film. (given the film's title, i realize that hers was a supporting role but even martin short managed a distinct, supporting character.)<br /><br />i can understand the attraction of an imaginary world created in a good romantic comedy. but this film is the prozac version of an imaginary world. i'm frightened to consider that anyone could enjoy it even as pure fantasy.
