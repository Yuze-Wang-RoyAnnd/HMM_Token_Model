this film, had it been done properly, has so much potential. parody films are always funny, and people tend to like them because they're light hearted, stupid and silly but fun. this film was funny in some parts, but it could have been a lot funnier. the acting itself was ok from all the actors, but...i wasn't satisfied. it seemed a tad empty, and my summary title says it all about the effects. proper green screens weren't used for this movie...backgrounds were added in after which just looked terrible. no wonder this film went straight to dvd lol. it wasn't all a total loss, it is funny and will give you a good laugh (at it, not with it most of the time).
