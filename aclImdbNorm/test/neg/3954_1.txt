bad, bad movie. when i saw the synopsis i was expecting something like ring only with video game instead of tape. nothing of the sorts happened. i'll admit idea is interesting and could be turned into a good movie but this is not it.<br /><br />first of all choosing real life person, countess bathory, is stupid move that adds absolutely nothing to the story. anybody even vaguely familiar with her story would begin to wonder why and how did this hungarian noblewoman end up in this movie. choosing a generic vengeful spirit would be much, much better.<br /><br />then there is whole you-die-in-real-life-as-you-die-in-the-game concept. as i said before interesting, ring-like story. but instead of developing it into good story line it sort of just flows along with no explanation given why did this game became such as it is, why it was created and so on. waste of good idea.<br /><br />and finally this movie doesn't even have gory of funny parts that can if not save at least make crappy horror movies watchable. death scenes are too quick and acting is too wooden to be funny.<br /><br />avoid if possible.
