well, the episode i just watched had the older "gastineau girl" whining about why people keep mentioning her husband (mr gastineau, a famous american football player apparently). she seems unwilling to accept that he's the only reason she isn't flipping burgers, she married someone famous and that's why she has cameras pointed at her.<br /><br />when challenged by an interviewer to explain what she actually does, she gave a wonderfully circular reason for why people should pay attention to her: "i work really hard on my reality tv show". then she said "i'm not a celebrity... i'm a personality."<br /><br />i'm not quite sure who this series is meant to appeal to, except people who've had all their intelligence removed. it's certainly no role model to anyone except gold-diggers as the two stars do nothing but spend money, and all it tells you about rich people is that they have no money problems.
