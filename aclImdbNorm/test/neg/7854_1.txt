i am a fan of good historical fiction, and was thrilled at the thought that someone would take a well written book series and film it. writing scripts is not like writing regular fiction, but when you have a book you are adapting, it would be nice to actually follow the plot line.<br /><br />the portrayals of the vespasians (the actual emperor, and his 2 sons titus and domitian) was horrid. they acted like a cookie cutter caligula, and were the 'bad guys' in this adaptation. there was a scene with titus dispensing justice as if he was caligula (from the movie of the same name.) the way the vespasianii are portrayed in the books mostly follow the reports of historians writing in that time period - they were fair, and sane, not tainted by the imperial claudian insanity.<br /><br />helena (the love interest of marcus didius falco) gives as her reason for divorcing pertinax (one of the traitors referenced in the title) was that he was a traitor, yet in the books it was because he ignored her and she felt that she would be better off marrying someone who valued her as a person.<br /><br />marcus in the movie gets a slave named justus, yet in the books he could barely afford his apartment, let alone afford a slave. there was certainly no romantic interlude between the nonexistent slave justus and a female gladiator...<br /><br />on the whole, if you want good cookie cutter roman stereotypes get caligula, if you want good roman from the classical history viewpoint, get i, claudius.
