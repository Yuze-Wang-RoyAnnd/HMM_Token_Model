i love comedies and i love independent films, but this was much too slow and the humor was extremely regional. i guess it would have been better if the main characters were likeable, but they were just typical gen-x slacker types, just like the people that have been causing trouble in high schools for forty years... i can understand high praise for a young indie film-maker when it is deserving, but this is an extremely average film.
