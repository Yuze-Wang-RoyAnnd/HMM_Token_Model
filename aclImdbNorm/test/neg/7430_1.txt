i really wanted to like this film. the second film in the series had this silly, drive in movie feel to it that was fun (of course, i was also drunk). i watched this film with the highest expectation of a similar experience of high cinematic hilarity, a-la- mystery science theater 3000. i was wrong!!!!! this movie is a god awful waste of film, and i liked the second one!!!! from the effeminate villain with the david bowie fright wig, to the tacky, obnoxious female villains with laughs that could strip the paint off a garage door, this whole thing was just a painful mess. i actually felt bad for sue price, because the material was beneath an actress of her stature (that pretty much says it all). an awful, awful film (that's not a recommendation).
