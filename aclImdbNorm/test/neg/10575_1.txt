this was the stupidest movie i have ever seen in my life. it is a complete waste of money and time. i went to see this movie with my friends and when the movie was over not a single person in the movie theater- not that there was a lot of people there to see this terrible movie- said "wow what a good movie." someone actually walked out! it was absolutely terrible! it was disgusting and i hated every minute of it. my friend was putting her head in my shoulder towards the end because after the scene with rick on the ceiling peeing, she had had enough. it was not funny at all. believe me i went with 11 other girls and not one of my friends liked it. it was ridiculous! i've seen many movies but this was absolutely the worst! i mean a scene in the movie is with an old man making out with a dead person in a coffin. i just can't make up these things.
