during the summer, the cue line for this attraction is really long, since it is a water ride. it's very well-themed, but a lot of the ride's artifacts seem to be out of order. overall, the ride is not worth it if you have to wait for almost 2 hrs. in line. the drop at the end is exciting, but the whole ride itself could have been better. creators for indiana jones could have prob. helped these hollywood designers. also, many times the ride breaks down and causes even longer waiting periods for others. it's also very unpleasing when they only have one raft departing dock open and not the two, like they are supposed to. during halloween horror nights, you ride in the dark, and it's exciting if it's your first time, but if it's not, then don't bother waiting in a four-hour line.
