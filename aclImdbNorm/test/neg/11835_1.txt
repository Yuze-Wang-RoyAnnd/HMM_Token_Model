why isn't this movie on the bottom 100? raptor is, without a doubt, the worst movie i have seen in all of my fifteen years of life. i have never before witnessed such a catastrophic mess as this. absolutely everything about it is awkward and cheaply done.<br /><br />nobody in the cast gives a somewhat decent performance. the dialogue is utterly incoherent and the humor is anything but humorous. corbin bernsen was the most painful part of the whole thing. i can't help cringe when i recall some of his lines, like "in or out? you're worse than a cat!" and "your lady friend isn't a very good poker player. she's just revealed her hand."<br /><br />the raptors are a joke. even i could make more realistic dinosaur effects than these filmmakers have shamelessly done. it is an insult to the actual velociraptors, or any dinosaur for that matter. not only that, but the killing scenes are too gruesome even for me. i don't seriously think these animals would rip their victim to shreds and throw pieces all over the ground just to make everything look gorier. besides, the blood and guts are all useless when you can see the deaths coming from miles and miles away.<br /><br />i am a big fan of jurassic park movies and of dinosaurs. maybe the filmmakers didn't anticipate anybody with a shred of intelligence or sense to disregard bad filmmaking to stumble upon this movie on hbo late at night, like i did. if i could say one thing to anybody involved in this film, i would have to quote dr. alan grant from the first jurassic park...<br /><br />"just try to show a little respect."
