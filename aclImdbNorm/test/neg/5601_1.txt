i don't honestly know what legal or illegal substance they - the writers - were on when the wrote this horrid piece of tripe!<br /><br />the cast - sucks the plot - sucks the editing - sucks the whole premise of the movie is that a girl with psychic/telekinetic powers comes across a lesbian vampire sorority, you just have to be totally out of your head to watch even 1 minute of this.<br /><br />the only reason i had to watch it - it was on the here! network as part of a two-picture purchase and the movie that came on after it was the real one that i wanted to see. i fast forwarded through the whole thing and was just amazed how stupid this movie was in double speed!<br /><br />do not rent, buy, or watch this movie....the vampires in the movie don't suck as much as the overall movie and production does!<br /><br />if you want a good lesbian vampire movie - the hunger with david bowie, susan sarandon & katharine deneuve - excellent movie to watch/own/rent in place of this piece of pure sh*t
