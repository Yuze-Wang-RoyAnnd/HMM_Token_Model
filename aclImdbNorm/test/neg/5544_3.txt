pumpkinhead was in itself a decent 80s horror flick. no classic by any means, but an enjoyable piece of fluff. why then, have we now been treated to a fourth film in this franchise is beyond me. as in previous sequels, there's nothing here to really connect the films except for the monster, the witch and ed harley (lance henriksen). this time out we follow the feud between the hatfields and the mccoys. part of the film is a romeo and juliet romance as a young mccoy boy and his hatfield lover decide to run away to be together. soon, however, they are torn apart and the boy's sister is killed. the boy escapes to the woods and gets the witch to resurrect pumpkinhead for some vengeance. the acting is passable at best, amateurish at the worst. the titular demon doesn't even really show up for almost forty minutes and when it does its a pale comparison between it and the original design. overall, blood feud fails to impress. it may be worth a watch once, but certainly not an addition to the collection.
