i remembered this awful movie i bought at camelot music store in the summer of 1989 when i was visiting my grandparents. it was a time when i had just discovered movies like re-animator, from beyond, the return of the living dead, and dawn of the dead. i was ready for all the horror/gore genre had to offer.... or so i thought! i was only about 12 years old at the time so i really don't remember it all that well. i remember a psycho running around with a corkscrew killing people, and a couple of cops (i think) who were riding in a car that wasn't actually moving, but being rocked side to side to look like it was... true cinemagic. i also remember it being the worst film i had ever seen up to that point and i promptly threw it in the garbage.<br /><br />something tonight made me think of that movie (i can't believe i actually remembered the name), so i jumped on imdb to see if it was listed. to my surprise... it was! and a full other 5 people have seen it.... amazing. even though i remember hating the film at the time i sort of wish i had kept it hidden away somewhere because i'd love to check it out again for a laugh (it would probably make a good drinking game movie). anyway, i'm glad i'm part of the elite few that's seen this little "treasure". i would love to pick it up somewhere for a couple of bucks.... but beware, this is not a recommendation... it is awful... it's just for nostalgia.
