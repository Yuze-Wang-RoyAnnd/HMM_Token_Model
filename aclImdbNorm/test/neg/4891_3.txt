looking and sounding like a cheap porno without the sex, this is the first in an impressive string of stinkers from producer (or in this case director) geoffrey reeve.<br /><br />and it's a doozy. laughable on just about every level.<br /><br />some government agents (i think) are "professionally murdered" in amsterdam and a considerably less-than-charismatic, block-of-wood interpol agent (who i assure you is not named louis salinger) is sent in to investigate by walking around a lot to ensure the tax-dodge financiers get their money's worth for the plane tickets to shoot on location.<br /><br />the wannabe-hard-hitting attitudes to drugs and depiction of prostitution must have looked laughably outdated even before the celluloid dried, but the script at least is very obliging in that it explains exactly what's happening regularly in horribly contrived direlogue ("were you followed? oh no of course not. no one outside washington even knows you're here!") yet despite this the plot somehow remains confusing. by the time a sinister vladimir putin lookalike priest (no less than kronsteen from from russia with love) swaggers up to his pulpit to deliver a sermon your brain will have switched off, which is unfortunate because you'll miss our hero - pinned to the ground during a fight - struggling to reach for a plank of wood only to later realise he is in fact sitting on a loaded pistol, and him shouting "you bastaaaard!" at his friend's murdered corpse, and the leather-bound, moustachioed go-go boys, the morris dancing and the hilarious torture sequence - all of which provide ample laughs. only the climactic boat chase impresses. it's an exciting, well-directed sequence that really has no place in this movie. such a glaring anomaly is explained when the credits roll - reeve had nothing to do with that sequence! thankfully everything goes back to business as usual for the ridiculous, spit-out-your-drink twist and warehouse shootout.<br /><br />unless such a wretched thing as a geoffrey reeve completist exists - and you're one of them - i wouldn't bother with this instantly forgettable nonsense.
