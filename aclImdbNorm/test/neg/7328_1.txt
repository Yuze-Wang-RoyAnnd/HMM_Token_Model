plot: none. script: a string of cliches. acting: not in evidence. special effects: title sequence kind of cool, but otherwise exceptionally poor. fright factor: crossing the road is scarier. cult factor: only the most desperate cult would latch onto this dog. can't you say anything positive: i did. the titles were kind of cool.<br /><br />(special bonus question ... your idea of hell: being at a party with people who voted this flop a 7.)
