i received this movie in a pack called "50 all-star movies" for $18 (45 cents each). many are good. this one was terrible. it was a hackneyed retread done 1000 times before and each time better. a crippled ex-jock is dared to coach a team made up of juvenile delinquents. they learn from him that they can make it if they play by the rules. i'm sure the kids and the locals were thrilled to be included in a "real tv movie", but i can't imagine what the folks that launched and produced this project figured they could bring to this already over beaten subject. i kept waiting to see that 'new twist' or 'new angle' but, honest, it doesn't come. avoid this movie. forget about the 45 cents, i want the 96 minutes of my life back.
