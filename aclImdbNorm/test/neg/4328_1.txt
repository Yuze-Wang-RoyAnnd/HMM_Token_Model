extremely boring..i don't care how many avant-garde bones you have in your body, this baby sucks...and don't go and see it because i mentioned that, save it for warhol's "empire", it's far more entertaining!! i have seen other duras films that were far better, so i am dumbfounded why this is considered a "masterpiece". as an art historian, i have had to consider radical works by marcel duchamp, chris burden, and damien hurst, and in these artist i can still see artistic intent , even quality, and an entertaining aspect in the rendering of their art. as for "india song" -it's not even soft-porn- anias nin was almost here - g-rated slide show of sex- and a voice-over that does not relate to the slide show / movie......pure crap and not even campy...sadly just a bore and a waste of 2 hours. to add insult to injury, the print i saw was faded and scratched to hell!!! (harvard film archive), if i want to see "entertaining boring" i watch bunuel!! yes "india song"- hold your head high to late modernism and be truly bored!! watch a 70's porn film with all the good parts cut out and turn the sound down, you'll get "india song" but with better cinematography and none of the annoying music or the screams of the vice consul!!!.
