i go to blockbuster, pick out a random movie, got this, and yeah.<br /><br />this... was a good sexual porno.. the quality kind of sucked, and it kind of gave me a damn headache. to me, this movie was good for its sexual things, but not as much for the horror and suspense. it was ... magical...<br /><br />the suspense.. not as good as i would have expected. i wanted to be at the edge of my seat hoping to jump up in fear, but instead i lay down on the couch and didn't see much.<br /><br />the quality.. not really good at all. i mean, if you pay close attention, during when the people are on the cold mountains, their barely wearing anything. it doesn't make much sense too.<br /><br />so if your looking for a crap, not really suspenseful, and a pretty much sexual movie, you've got this.
