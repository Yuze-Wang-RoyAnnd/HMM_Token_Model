this film follows a very similar storyboard to the warriors, only with less intensity and rather poor acting which is nothing to write home about.<br /><br />the story in general is not that bad, based around a small aussie gang who are trying to get out of the city when one of their members is framed for the rape of another gang's girl. they then have to fight their way through the streets whilst they are been hunted down by a number of rival gangs. on could assume that the writers have taken a page out of the warriors book and re-written it, but as mentioned above - with not nearly as much intensity.<br /><br />the acting as a whole is not very good in my opinion, and it's clearly obvious on many occasions that they are indeed acting... the fight scenes make up for this however but then the poor sound effects that go with them bring it back down.<br /><br />this film has nothing on once were warriors.<br /><br />low budget, alright story, poor acting, nothing to write home about.
