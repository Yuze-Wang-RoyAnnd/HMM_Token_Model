i loved all the other don knotts movies, but i never heard much about "how to frame a fig" and now i know why: i can't think of anyone who would find it enjoyable. this movie seems to appeal to 9 or 10 year olds, but even most of them would give this a thumbs down. at best there are brief moments of mild amusement, mostly from don knotts playing the same nervous, underdog persona that made him famous.<br /><br />after the movie finally finished i was curious if my teenager could pick up on this movie's fatal flaw. we were in complete agreement: the prentiss gates sidekick character was even dumber than the don knotts character.<br /><br />be happy that mr. limpet, reluctant astronaut, shakiest gun and mr. chicken movies are around to enjoy.
