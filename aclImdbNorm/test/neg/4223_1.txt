"the danish bladerunner" is boldly stated on the box. are you kidding me?! this film is a complete drag. when i'm thirsty and go for a soda in the kitchen, i usually pause the vcr, so i won't miss anything. not this time. i actually found myself looking long and hard in the fridge, just so i wouldn't have to go back. why the hell is there not one sciencefiction-scriptwriter out there who has the vaguest clue about how computers work? it's mindboggling. one of the premises of film, is that our hero (who's a hacker), has a little computerassistant to help him (the microsoft office paperclip finally caught on in the future). when he loses the assistant in the movie, he's helpless and can't get into any computers. he's a hacker! it's like saying, that you can't drive your car, if you don't have your lucky "driving-cap" on. i won't even go into the lightning-effect when he recieves electroshock...
