movies about u.f.o.'s are always a nice way to kill some time, so on a rainy sunday evening i picked up this flick, expecting what can be expected from a direct-to-dvd u.f.o. mystery.<br /><br />boy, was i wrong! at about halfway in the movie it becomes very apparent that the u.f.o. theme is just a deceptive way of attracting unsuspecting viewers to this christian propaganda. and this is not just a christan movie from an average christian. no, this is christianity of the extremist fundamentalist kind. the scary kind.<br /><br />in the end of this movie, the non-believing lead is tricked by their colleagues using a practical joke in thinking that the rapture has started (which is believed by christians to be the happening in the end of time where true believers are going to heaven and non-believers are left behind).<br /><br />when the joke is explained, it is suggested that it is always better to become a true believer, 'just in case we christians are right'. now that's a lamest excuse ever to become a christian if you ask me!<br /><br />this movie still tries to convert non-believers using scare tactics. "believe in god or you will go to hell!" is the message here. simple, but quite offensive, really. especially because this movie is being sold as something completely different.<br /><br />now let's assume you're a christian fundamentalist yourself and you're not likely to be offended by the themes in this movie, is this a good movie? i'm afraid it isn't. no actually i'm lying: i'm glad it isn't! the acting is horrible, the pacing is horrible, the plot is horrible, especially the ending is laughably bad. as soon as the movie starts, you immediately sense that this is going to be worse than you expected, and you will be right.<br /><br />in the first half hour, it seems to at least attempt to set up a passable u.f.o. mystery, but then suddenly they bring in this count dracula look-alike that starts babbling about the devil. at first you just think this dude is just a crazy maniac, but as it turns out, he actually represents the real views of the makers of this movie. as soon as you start realizing this, you know how this is going to end up. but actually it ends up worse.<br /><br />avoid.
