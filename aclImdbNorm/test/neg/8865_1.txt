now first let me say i love god awful movies. especially horror films mainly. i watched hundreds of movies on mystery science theater 3000 with no pain. but this is the absolute worst film on the planet!!! i had to turn it off it was so bad. it was unfunny and just plain unwatchable. give me 3 back to back viewings of manos the hands of fate or monster a-go-go over this any day. avoid this film like the plauge!! now excuse me while i go gouge out my eyes to cleanse them of the filth i had to watch to get a decent judgement for this film. only one decent gag in the part i watched was the hitmen now are an extermination pair for hitmen exterminators. even that wasn't to great of a gag.
