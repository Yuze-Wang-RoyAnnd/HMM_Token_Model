i was given this film by my uncle who had got it free with a dvd magazine. its easy to see why he was so keen to get rid of it. now i understand that this is a b movie and that it doesn't have the same size budget as bigger films but surely they could have spent their money in a better way than making this garbage. there are some fairly good performances, namely jack, beth and hawks, but others are ridiculously bad (assasin droid for example). this film also contains the worst fight scene i have ever seen. the amount of nudity in the film did make it seem more like a porn film than a sci-fi movie at times.<br /><br />in conclusion - awful film
