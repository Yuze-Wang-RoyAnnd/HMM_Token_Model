did you ever watch a really bad movie and get mad about it? even a movie you didn't have high expectations for? well i just rented the movie "dead line". this is the us video title for "interferencia". now i have seen a lot of bad movies, and watched a lot of "b" titles, but this is in another league all its own. it was put out on "the asylum" label, and anyone that rents a lot of direct to video horror films knows this label. when you rent one of there's you know what your getting. a lot of marginal acting low budget horror, but usually still pretty good. not this one. the acting by the three leads was beyond bad. even fast forwarding couldn't help. the tag line on the front of the box says"..in the tradition of depalma's body double. the nerve to compare this to that classic movie. the only true comment is "the screams you will hear are real". yea you will be the one screaming if you rent this.
