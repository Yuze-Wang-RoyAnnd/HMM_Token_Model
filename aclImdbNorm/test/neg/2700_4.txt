amnesiac women who remove their clothes at the drop of a hat (or a blouse?) are about the only stand-out points in a film that is otherwise slow and aimless. although the basic premise of the story offers a wealth of possibilities, they are never developed to any satisfying degree, and exposition is almost non-existent. a large proportion of the film is mere wanderings through the corridors of a multi-storied clinic/hospital. the overall effect is bleak and sterile, a la thx-1138.
