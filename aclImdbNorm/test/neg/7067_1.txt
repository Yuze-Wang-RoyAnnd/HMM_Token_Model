. . . and never, ever see it. now, i've been watching bad scifi movies for years. i love watching bad scifi movies. i think that was the only reason i could watch this movie the whole way through. i was toughened up by "nukie," "indian superman," and that awful "fantastic four" movie, just to name some examples. usually, i have to beat my head against the wall after i've seen a bad movie to make some of the pain go away. no, not with this one. with "tdb," i had to hit myself in the head with a shoe in the middle of the movie. temporary fix. i can't believe i wanted to see that. i cried. when it finished, i cried. it was horrible. it was worse than when i saw *shudders* wil wheaton in his underwear in "the curse," which, by the way, never watch either. aside from the fact that wesley crusher's in his tighty whiteys, it's just sooo bad. but this review is about "tdb." the worst part about it is that someone wrote this movie and said, "this deserves to go on film! it's great!" and wayne newton, rob lowe, and everyone else in the cast said, "oh, this is what i want on my film history!" i'll watch "indian superman" until the cows come home, but i am never going to see this steaming pile of dren again.
