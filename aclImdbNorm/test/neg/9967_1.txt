i got encouraged to watch this film because i've heard good word of it: it was supposed to be this thrilling true crime milestone, disturbing, shocking... all that jazz. well, i am disturbed because i spent money on it, and i am shocked that something so god-awful actually got released. that's about it.<br /><br />this is a supposed "new look" at charles manson's family of insane loser junkies and their murders. but if this is a "new look" then it's probably "new" as in "fresh and totally inept": just watching it gave me a headache and i had to give up trying to make any sense of it or even understand just what the director intended it to be.<br /><br />i suppose i should say something about the plot but fact is, it was so stupid and incoherent that i barely remember if there even was a plot at all. there was something about a "manson tape" delivered to a radio dj (or a tv producer?), then an hour of pointless random footage of "the family" in '69, then the polanski murders (looking like a bad school play) and finally some idiotic part about a bunch of skinheads getting drunk and beating the hell out of one another in an alley (i kid you not), and then it ended (thank god) (don't ask me to make any sense of that, i'm just recalling what i saw!) the performances were terrible, too. and how difficult is it to make a convincing "manson"? get a short skinny scrawny bloke, put a dirty wig and a shaggy beard on him. there's your manson. but this "manson" doesn't even look right. he just looks like, uh, a bloke in a cheap wig and a glued on santa beard painted black.<br /><br />or maybe that's what this film is actually about: manson's family didn't make any sense, so this film doesn't make any sense, either. it's symbolic! (yeah, right) i'm still so angry at spending money on this i stopped my normal lurking on this site and registered just to vote 1 for this film and post this warning that will hopefully prevent others from spending their money on this garbage. stay away from it, it's not even worth renting.<br /><br />ps. the recent us tv production "helter skelter" got bad reviews here but i saw it last month (i saw the 1976 original too) and let me tell you, compared to "manson family", that new helter skelter is brilliant and flawless. and i was disappointed in it! that's how bad "manson family" is: it makes a flawed and mostly disappointing tv movie look perfect.
