this relatively obscure hong kong "minorpiece" is the perfect desert island movie for video age peeping toms (at least its first half is). every set-up, every scene, every sequence is an excuse to look up a girl's skirt, stare down at her breasts, gaze at her bottom and leer at her tight crotch. what it's establishing is the lead character's perverted proclivities, of course(!)<br /><br />genre stalwart anthony wong is a marginally perverted married man who is plagued by erotic daydreams and outrageous fantasies. all involve scantily clad, sexy chinese ladies with nothing but sexual servitude on their minds.<br /><br />the plot is thickened by a homicidal subplot, voodoo doll skewering and a little rape and pillage.<br /><br />some of the sex scenes are fairly hot and the gore is liberal, but the supernatural elements introduced into the second half feel half-baked and the plot developments are ludicrous.<br /><br />clearly, producer of garish garbage wong jing was in a terrible hurry to get this into and out of theaters.<br /><br />the arty title sequence did not fool this jaded punter.
