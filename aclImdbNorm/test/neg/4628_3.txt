i had a very hard time sitting through this film. unless you really are very pro-adultery and like to hear people endlessly talking about their sexual exploits, i can't see how you could enjoy this film. geez--most of the main characters behaved like rutting weasels and their bragging about their many infidelities grew tiresome. about the only element of this i appreciated was the disgusting scene where the one character was urinating and blood was splattering everywhere because he'd picked up an std---big surprise!?! hmm.<br /><br />if you want a good film, watch the sequel, barbarian invasions. despite the general unlikable nature of many of the characters, the sequel is very involving and more realistic--well worth your time.
