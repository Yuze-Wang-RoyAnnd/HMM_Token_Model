"de dominee" is based on the life of a real dutch gangster,klaas bruinsma! in the movie he is called klaas donkers! i have my doubts that events presented in the movie have something to do with what really happened! but that doesn't really matter! because it failed to grab my attention! this movie bored the crap out of me! it lacks substance and style! the substance part could have been forgiven if the acting was any good and if the director tried to do something original! without the substance you at least have to bring some style or decent action! don't we need to be entertained? it would have helped if the director had seen more gangster movies! it is obvious that he didn't! otherwise he wouldn't have made this the way he did! this movie got a lot of publicity because of a little scandal surrounding klaas bruinsma and a member of the dutch royal family! this scandal has nothing to do with the movie what so ever! without it "de dominee" never would have been successful! i am sure of it!
