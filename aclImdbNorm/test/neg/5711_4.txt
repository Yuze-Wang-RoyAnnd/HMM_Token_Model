kim basinger and mickey rourke star in this controversial story of a wall street exec and an art gallery employee who hook up and begin a very experimental sexual relationship.while the acting by rourke and basinger is ok, the flim doesn't allow their characters to truly form. allegedly there was a lot of film left on the cutting room floor that delved deeper into the characters and the effects of the relationship on them - basinger's character considering suicide - that would have made the characters more involved for the viewer. as is it is a glossy, well produced, with mtv style editing piece of soft core voyeurism. 4 of 10
