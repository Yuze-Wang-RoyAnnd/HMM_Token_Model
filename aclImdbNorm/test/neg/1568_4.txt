george and mildred is a truly unfunny film. this attempt to translate the successful tv series to the big screen was a dismal failure, as is so often the case.<br /><br />the wit and clever one-liners from the tv shows have gone missing. the plot is a typical english farce of confused characters and mistaken identities, which is neither funny enough nor weird enough to provoke many decent laughs.<br /><br />die-hard george and mildred fans might want to see this final episode of the pair's output (mildred died of hepatitis before the film was released), but others should invest their time more wisely.
