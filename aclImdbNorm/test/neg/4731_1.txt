if you like me enjoy films with plots and convincing actors then alien vs predator- requiem is probably not the way to go. in summary, alien lands in typical american town, predator lands in american town, both have a bit of a fight, us government blows up town, some people get away.....i'm sorry i think i might have spoilt the ending. its easy to criticise someone who's being critical; people cry out, i bet you couldn't do any better! i bet i could ! having made this film,watched it and then turned to congratulate each other with a pat on the back and a job well done; there must surely have been the spectre of lunacy in the room.
