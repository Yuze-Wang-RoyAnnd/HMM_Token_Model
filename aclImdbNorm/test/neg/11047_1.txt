it seems that some viewers assume that the only thing which can make the viewer dislike this movie is the graphic violence. in fact violence, both disturbing and cartoonish, is the last of "oldboy"'s deep flaws. the characters are unidimensional, underdeveloped, primitive. the "intensity", an obsession and a goal in itself with this director, is served up with the cheapest of means. let's not confuse a mindless shot of adrenaline with artistic worth. by the end of the movie, it seems that all the cards were exhausted so the script becomes almost inadvertently funny in its efforts to find new levels of "horror", to continue to "shock" an audience which is already numbed by the plethora of dumb soap-opera "revelations" already served up in big bunches. it would be hard to imagine anybody even vaguely familiar with the masterpieces of the last fifty years of asian cinema being enthralled by this pompous piece of trash. imagine homer simpson hesitating in front of the cinema theater: "should i go in or should i buy five cones of ice-cream for the same money?" be smart, homer, go for the ice-cream.
