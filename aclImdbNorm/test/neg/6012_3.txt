terrible adaptation of heminway's low key love story. an american soldier (rock hudson) falls in love with a british nurse (jennifer jones) in italy during world war 1. what's wrong with this? virtually everything. hudson is way out of his depth here. he could be a good actor but not in this movie. jones is far too old for her role (she's 21 in the book--here she's 38...and looks it!). also her acting wavered between overdone and underdone! they took a simple low-key love story and blew it all out of proportion. the film is fatally long (a little over 150 minutes), self-indulgent and padded to a ridiculous degree. it seems producer david o. selznick thought he was doing "gone with the wind" again. some of the scenery is truly stunning (even on a small tv screen) but there's not enough of a story to match the images. <br /><br />spoiler!!! the ending where jones dies is supposed to be tragic but the bad acting and overblown theatrics had me fighting not to laugh! <br /><br />to make matters worse actor vittorio de sica overacts to a truly embarrassing degree. overblown, self-indulgent, badly cast and slow. pretty terrible. this was (understandably) a financial and critical bomb and ended selznick's career as a producer. you might want to tune in for some of the scenery at the end but it's really not worth it. i give this a 3.
