i'd never thought that i would be caught saying this: but i think "dog the bounty hunter" is more entertaining than this 90's era cop drama. walker is very melodramatic and actually set a standard of the genre of "high octane" cop shows such as csi, csi: miami, and so forth. i'm not saying all these shows are bad, but they aren't good either. i like the karate chop action that walker dispenses on the enemies of justice, and the diverse cast of characters as much as the science tech of the csi series. but there are some elements that i hate in a show like this. stereotypes/countertypes! that's right, stereotypes/countertypes! unfortunately, this is a show for the moderates of red state america who refuse to part with the old prejudices of yore especially when it comes to crime. for example, there was an episode in which a kid with psychic powers ventures into dallas where he encounters group of kids in goth/punk clothing and they start harassing him. now! this is exactly what middle america perceives the goth/punk culture. i mean come on, how often do people that dress like that rob and steal from people just minding there own business. whenever there are blacks and latinos in the plot it's always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood. okay! not everyone who's a minority is a desperate recruit of a gang surrounded by crime, drugs, poverty. again, this is what middle red state america sees of these people. finally, why is the trivette the bumbling sidekick, can't you make the sidekick an equal ass-kicker?
