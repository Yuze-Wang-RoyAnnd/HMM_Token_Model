a desperate attempt to make a "film-noir" sci-fi thriller, but the movie falls short. it has no believable plot, some of the key actors were a joke (not lars bom, he is cool!). i did like the "access restriction by bandwith maximizing" though. i finished it on principle, but went home with the feeling of having lost two hours of my life...
