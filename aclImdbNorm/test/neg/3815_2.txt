a terrible movie that is amateurish on almost every level - a boring and derivative screenplay filled with stereotyped characters played by embarrassed actors for a director lacking the most rudimentary understanding of his craft. the whole thing stinks. it plays like a slasher movie from the early eighties, down to the crappy score and ketchup sfx, but without the childhood nostalgia that is required to look fondly on such dross. one of the worst horror films i've ever seen - definitely the worst that received a mainstream theatrical release. i've never walked out of a film in my life - had i been unlucky enough to see 'hatchet' at the theater, it would have been a first. avoid at all costs.
