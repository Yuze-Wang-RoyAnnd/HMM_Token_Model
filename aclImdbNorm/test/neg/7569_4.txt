this is a family movie set in 1950's rural america about a boy whose uncle presses sheep killing charges against his dog drum, starting not only a family legal feud but community discord as their town begins to take sides.<br /><br />this is formula film that attempts to be very touching and sweet. its biggest weakness is that the only people who could really act were scott bakula (defense lawyer), ron perlman (father/drum's owner) and the dog. (john shuck and kathy garver, "sissy" from the original "family affair," as the uncle and his wife, were okay.) the children were not that good (basically they looked like they were acting) and that's a problem when the film really revolves around them (aaron fors, who plays the bully donny makes me think of what the actor russell crowe must have looked liked as a child, only with no talent but a lot of ham). <br /><br />favorite line (spoken by the prosecutor after scott bakula's defense closing trial speech): "we'll be lucky if they don't lynch us." <br /><br />favorite line spoken by ron perlman (after his son punches the bully): "now making him your friend, that will be the hard part."<br /><br />cute enough to rent/buy used.
