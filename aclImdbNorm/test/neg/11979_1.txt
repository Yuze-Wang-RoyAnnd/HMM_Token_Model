being a fan of the game and watching this film made me physically vomit!!<br /><br />it was an awful film, though the story was similar to the games plot. the whole super human soldiers thing. other than that jack carver, an all american man in the game, is played by a germen, unless thats some sort of twisted irony, that is what made me pull a middle finger at my tv screen the second it started. the fact that you can tell its filmed in a forest in the middle in what seemed like the middle of summer, this is uncalled for because the game is set in the tropical rain forest, whereas this looks like the director just looked out his window in the morning and went "thats a good forest."<br /><br />this is a note to all directors: if you ever plan to make a film based on a game/book play it, understand it and ask fans about it... don't just play it for an hour and assume you know it!!!
