saw this movie last night. i don't usually comment good or bad, as i think movies are like books in that there is something for everyone and everyone is different, tastes vary, yadda yadda. this movie was bad. by the end i thought, oh my, this is testing my patience. how many women really look and live like this when they hit "rock bottom" and if i could just borrow some cash from mum and carry out to live my fashion designing dreams - gosh, life would be great! i was out for a nice chick-date flick with my girl (my darling hubby likes watching movies together and i knew this wouldn't be his thing), something light and easy on the senses, but this was one bad movie. we are intelligent and interesting movie watchers and this movie wasn't that. annette benning is a great actress, she held her own. bad. bad.
