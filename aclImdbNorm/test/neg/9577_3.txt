this spanish-italian co-production tells an interesting and weird story about dr. bannister, a woman that not only has the best years behind her, but also has a scarred face that makes her look like a freak. but in madrid, a professor she knows has conducted some experiments on animals with a substance which regenerates cells. the experiments were successful, but the animals became aggressive. because the professor won't allow dr. bannister to be the first human guinea pig, she kills him and consumes the substance. she becomes a beautiful young woman, but also a vicious killer when it comes to keep her secret a secret.<br /><br />the plot of the film is great fun, but piero vivarelli had not enough skills and money to make a cool movie out of it. also, the film becomes boring after a good start and doesn't manage to regain a fast pace even though the film's running time doesn't exceed 83 minutes. and as the setting changes to swiss city geneva for the last third of the film, it sometimes even looks like a vacation movie as we see how beautiful geneva is (which it is indeed - but it doesn't help to push the plot forward...). so, with a more talented director, better actors and a bigger budget, "satanik" could have become an obscure italian classic. but, as it is, it's just a lacklustre and boring crime film that isn't really worth looking for. rating: 3 out of 10.
