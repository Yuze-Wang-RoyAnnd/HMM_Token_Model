this movie was a total yawnfest that took forever to get going, but never really did. it was simply boring to watch, so much in fact i could just never really get into it. this movie is not a horror movie by an stretch of the imagination, the cover of the videotape made it out to be one. instead it is a thriller type movie with a few elements of horror thrown in as to make the movie more interesting. of course, it does not help this movie at all. mostly all i remember is that this movie was kind of like a movie from the 1970's called "the deep". bunch of looking for treasure, rival groups that sort of thing. there are supernatural twists in it too, but to tell you the truth i was so bored when watching this movie that i kind of zoned out so i can not really tell you what the supernatural elements were. i kind of remember footprints on the bottom of the sea so maybe it was some sort of walking dead, or that may be me thinking of lucio fulcio's "zombie" movie instead as that one was a horror movie that was set in a tropical island and as outlandish as that one was it was a lot more entertaining than this movie. that day we learned a valuable lesson, never rent a movie based on its cover art.
