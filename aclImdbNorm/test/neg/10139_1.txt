reba is , without a doubt , one of the worst "comedy" series ever. i wonder how come there are people writing good comments on "reba" ... you watch "friends" , "married wtih children" , "fraizer" if you laugh at that , you can never laugh at the stupid jokes and the ridiculous accent of the singer who is trying to make her way in comedy and obviously having no chance whatsoever. the actors/actresses beside reba are ok so i feel bad for them stucking in a so-called comedy show with the least funnies person in the world (reba).to sum up , i suggest this tv show to see how low comedy can get and appreciate the ones that can make you laugh
