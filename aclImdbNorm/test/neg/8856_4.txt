well,this movie is really "plumped" haha get it? thats kinda like the attitude of this movie. the plot is just a copy of pulp fiction,okay thats acceptable,but to make this piece if "plump" (haha)! is really unbelievable.the storyline is so pathetic,and the whole thing only gathered a few laughs. it did try making a few jokes from various other movies,and it failed most of the times. i mean,i do have a sense of humor,but this isnt really the way to go to get a laugh. most of the supposedly "funny" moments are completely ironic. the film is quiet short running at around 75 minutes overall. they could have done a much funnier job,seeming they made fun of a blockbuster film,they were gambling,and hey! i think they lost!<br /><br />in overall plump fiction,is "plumpable" but you wont gather much at all!<br /><br />worth watching over and over again?: no once is enough,actually its more than enough!<br /><br />so is it worth the rent? ummm..as i said,its "plumpable",but you will only gather a few "plumps" from it!<br /><br />overall out of 10: a 4 out of 10!
