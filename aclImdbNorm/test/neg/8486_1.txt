this movie is a real shame, not just for the plot,the empty performance of the characters, it is for the lack of creativity from the director and all the crew, this is maybe one of the worst movies of all times,and it is hard to believe that is the sequel of one of the most famous movies of the 90's.<br /><br />i am a great fan of the mask, when i went to see this movie i was expecting to a movie with a good sense of humor, a movie with a acceptable plot, instead i saw a really bad copy of chuck jones and tex avery cartoons, the movie was not funny even for my 7 years old sister, so i wonder:what was wrong new line cinema???.was it trying to repeat the success of the first movie, or was it trying to create another masterpiece like the lord of the rings???.because if they did, they were completely out of their minds.
