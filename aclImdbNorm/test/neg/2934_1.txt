in & out made me want to vomit. i have never seen such a shameless film! it seriously wanted to say that being gay is something wonderful and joyous, but has no idea how to say it. to me this was not a comedy, unless cruel,sick jokes are something to laugh at when a victim falls for it.<br /><br /> from what i saw, this film had four (4) major flaws starting with (a) matt dillion's character as he announces to the world that is former teacher, howard brackett (kevin kline) is gay. never mind how unbelievable it is that matt dillion character won an oscar for what looked like a serious role on the edge of a crack-up. but why would he say such a thing? after all, this was never an issue with howard's students, his friends, family, nor his finace. nobody. so why would he say something like it when it wasn't true? more to the point, why doesn't the movie supply us with an answer as to why he said it? the reason is because there is no answer, and for the convenience of the plot none is provided. the second (b) flaw is with the fact the film seems to have forgotten what homosexuality is--the attraction and sexual relation to members of the same sex. in this movie, being gay is based on liking barbara streisand musicals and being passionate about literature. it's all based on stereotypes!<br /><br />both of these flaws are met up again at that must-be-seen-to-be-believed graduation ceremony. matt dillion finds out about the commotion going on in that small town and the film looks poised to let us know what made him say such a thing. when he arrives to the ceremony, he says nothing, and i wondered why in the world he then came there at all. he didn't solve anything. then when all of the audience stood to announce they were gay, i was so moved i wanted to throw up! those folks were standing up in defense of howard being gay by mocking all of those stereotypes. what the film forgot is that it was using those stereotypes to show why howard was gay. they filmmakers just shot themselves in the foot! but wait there's more!<br /><br />during the ceremony,(c) howard appeared to be on trial to lose is job as a teacher, because people believed that he would influence his students to be gay. what the film was trying to say is that homosexuals never recruit, and that he wouldn't influence his students. but did we not see tom selleck's character endlessly pressure howard over and over again, even to the point of kissing him unexpectedly, to come out of the closet when, in my mind, there was no closet to come out of? from that, the film clearly show that homosexual are capable of recruiting. the film, again, then shoots itself in the foot.<br /><br />and (d) when howard came out of the closet, did anyone not notice how the screenplay shut him up for the rest of the film? i counted only three lines he had afterwards: "yup!" to his parents, "hi there!" to a student, and "are you ready?" to tom selleck before the last vomitous scene. i might be low by one, but the point is he is not allowed to tell us what made him decide he was gay. i wanted to know what was in his head, because i never for once believed he was gay.<br /><br />as bonuses, the movie also includes several truly offensive scenes. one in which howard is asking a priest in confession for advice about what to do for a friend (him), who is engaged and has not yet had sex with his fiance. "does that make him gay?" he asks. the priest responsed "oh yes, he's definitely gay". uh-huh. or what about the scene when all the old ladies are gathered around telling howard's mother that she doesn't need to be sad about her son's deep, dark secret because, well...everyone has them. then one the ladies confessed that she's never seen "the bridges of madison county". funny? no! becuase the film shows that it is insensitive and has no idea how devestating it can be to family to have one of its members announced that he/she is gay. i know. i have several friends that are gay, and none of their families took it well at all. that was a poor way to diffuse the whole situation.<br /><br />the last straw for me was the last scene that gave they appearence that tom and kevin were getting married. the camera panned down very slowly to the front of the church when... it wasn't what you thought! i had been thoroughly disgusted by that point, and i never could forgive that sick joke. i have nothing against films about being gay or homosexuality. "philadelphia" and "longtime companion" were very honest and true in what they had to say. "in & out" is just screaming for political correctness, but has no idea of the corruption at its core. what i gathered from the film is that if you are 99% straight and 1% gay, meaning if you have the slightless doubt, you are definitely gay. it's like gayness is becoming a dominant trait in genetics. in reality if everyone told you over and over that you were worthless and stupid, you would eventually believe it too, wouldn't you? this is what happened to howard brackett about being gay. i left the theater sad and angry. angry the whole weekend, in fact. this was a seriously sick and cruel film, the worst of 1997.
