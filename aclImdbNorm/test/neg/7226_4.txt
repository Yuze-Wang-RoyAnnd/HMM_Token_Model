has some really good music and performances; kid creole and the coconuts, james white and the blacks, dna, tuxedo moon, the plastics, melle mel, vincent gallo, lydia lunch...etc, but aside from this there isn't much more to it. the dialog, especially the narration(by saul williams), is actually pretty good, but the performances are all pretty bland or outright bad, no matter how many hipsters are thrown in; debbie harry and jean micheal basquit(the latter being the leading role) both still don't have enough cultural cred to keep this film from being a novelty item. it goes for the a jack kerouac style roving spontaneity, but doesn't have the insight to keep it moving along, which is where the band performances come in. i guess its pretty balanced in that regard between great music and bad acting, and i did enjoy it, but i just expected more. though it does have a fairy tale ending.
