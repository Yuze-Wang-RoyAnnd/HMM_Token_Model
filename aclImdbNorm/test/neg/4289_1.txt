the only thing that makes this one watchable is corey's performance as the lunatic killer on the loose. what remains is a most impossible tale of revenge and matrimonial discord. during the walkie-talkie scenes i had the feeling that cotten was squeezing a sweet potato and not a communication device. another interesting thing about this one is that alan hale (the skipper from "gilligan's island") is not yet so fat, and he can still lower his arms below his waist. other than that there isn't much to recommend here.
