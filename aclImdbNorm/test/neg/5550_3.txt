say what you will about cinema's "wizard of gore," herschell gordon lewis, it must be conceded that from his first films (1963's trashy "blood feast" and 1964's crackerbarrel massacre "two thousand maniacs") to his last (1972's "the gore gore girls"), the man remained faithful to his muse, gleefully chopping up the bodies of young men and women for the delectation of the camera. in "gore gore," for example, someone has been mutilating the pasty-faced and pasty-clad strippers at the tops & bottoms club, and obnoxious ex-detective gentry is hired by a hotty cub reporter to assist on the case. the film features remarkably annoying and repetitive background music, terrible lighting, abysmal acting, repugnant characters, problematic sound and, of course, some of lewis' patented gross-out scenes. thus, one of the strippers has her face shoved into boiling oil; one has her head ripped open; another has her face ironed and her nippies cut off; and still another has her bum paddled with a meat tenderizer until her entire backside is covered with what appears to be buitoni tomato sauce. (i could be wrong here; it might have been ragu.) the film also throws out some fairly lame humor, although some of the lines are pretty funny. for example, we learn that the real name of slain stripper suzie creampuff was...ethel creampuff! a bottle of acid says "made in poland" on it (don't know why, but i thought this was funny). and some of strip club owner henny youngman's lines are, of course, amusing. still, this is not the movie to show to aunt ethel or sister agatha. it is one of the sickest you'll ever see, with only one surefire, crowd-pleasing moment--the title card at the film's conclusion that reads "we announce with pride: this movie is over"!
