i understand the draw and appeal to such a different type of movie and i am a huge admirer of movies with little dialog but all the same this one absolutely terrible. i've been to the scottish highlands and found the lack of scottish accents in the characters disappointing. this plot was strong enough in theory but the cheap sets and lack of a single realistic character kept this film from getting off the ground. i feel the use of silence to create atmosphere only works when you have actors who can exude some sort of presence without speaking and these actors certainly cant. if you want a silent movie that captures that presence try (le dernier combat). there have been very few movies that i couldn't even manage to finish and this was one of them. absolute dribble!
