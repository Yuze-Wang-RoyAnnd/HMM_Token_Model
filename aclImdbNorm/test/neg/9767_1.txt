this film wasn't good at all. i was able to catch it at a film festival and didn't appreciate the content i was forced to watch. it's a well shot film about family looking to reconnect after the death of the family's cornerstone (gabrielle union) dies. the film stars billy dee williams as gabrielle's union's brother. well, actually, gabrielle union portrayed the woman in her early years, which should help explain why the woman was billy dee williams older sister. this had to be billy dee william's worst performance in his career, ever. he looked as if he didn't remember his lines in a few scenes. he was an unlikable, hardly ever empathetic character, who fathered a daughter while married to a white woman whom he already had a daughter with as well. the two daughters are older now and while the daughter he had with the white woman (lucy) was trying to connect with him, his other daughter didn't want anything to do with him. billy dee's character was so pathetic that the only way they can get him to fly in from paris for his sister's funeral was by telling him that the funeral had already passed and his late sister left him with the responsibility of handling her paperwork. why they had to fool him? because he didn't like attending funerals. i know. you're asking, "but he didn't want to attend his own sister's funeral too?" yes! he claims he didn't like being around the forced feelings of emotions that is shared amongst the people paying their respects. he didn't want anything to do with that. now we're suppose to empathize with that a**hole? the rest of the performances in the film were flat with equally flat characters. the director and editor didn't care to consider the pacing of the film. the flashbacks were painful to watch. it was a bad film. however, it seems to be the favorite at black film festivals; a film that glorifies african-americans dependence on caucasians to find a love that they can settle down with, even if it is a healthy relationship. when lame love stories like this win best of festivals at the black film festivals, it makes me question the judgment of black people on film. in these same festivals, the only films that win awards are educational films about african american culture and black films directed by caucasian directors. i'm not saying that anything is wrong with a white person directing stories written for people of color. the problems with these films is that they never argue from both point of views, which are usually the films that actually speaks to the masses. these films are often one-sided forms of didacticism. these films fail at executing the powers of both sides of the argument that the film is revolved around. the writers and directors never compose the scenes and sequences that contradict your final statement with as much truth and energy as those that reinforce it. these films always slant the argument. what i am saying is, are the people running these black film festivals judging a film off of pure content, which to me means directing, acting, writing cinematography, editing, etc., or are they judging films off of strictly the message being delivered about african american culture? are we suppose to expect a film like constellation to have a shot in the world against films like "million dollar baby" and "sideways?" what happened to film being entertaining? when i mean entertainment, i mean the ritual of sitting in the dark, staring at the screen, investing tremendous concentration and energy into what one hopes will be satisfying, meaningful emotional experience. why can't these festivals appreciate films that get their messages across without preaching? why can't these black film festivals acknowledge films that are well told pieces of work that are brutally honest, telling the truth? "i believe we have no responsibility to cure social ills or renew faith in humanity, to uplift the spirits of society or even express our inner being. we have only one responsibility: to tell the truth."--robert mckee. now that's something i totally agree with. these same black film festivals put down "hustle and flo" as if it is that awful film stereotyping blacks. however, it's an honest film about a pimp with a dream. a pimp can't dream? i recall the last time i saw a real pimp he was a human being. and aren't they, pimps and prostitution a harsh reality in our society at large, not just in the black community but all over? the powers that be in "black hollywood" believe that films like this are making afro-americans look bad in the eyes of others, as if others don't know that there are pimps in the hood. the truth is, until african american people in film can accept the truth about themselves and dare to share it with the world, then our films will never have a chance in the world. this film was awful. the best thing was the cinematography and zoe.
