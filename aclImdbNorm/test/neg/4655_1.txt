a lassie movie which should have been "put to sleep".... forever. that's how i'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film. so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies i've seen. it isn't even an achievement as a "so-bad-it's-good" or "so-bad-it's-memorable" movie. the idea of lassie turning bad is intriguing but so little actually happens, and so slowly, that you feel your life slipping away while sitting there, watching the non-actors read their lines off cue cards waiting for their measly paychecks.<br /><br />it's an empty, hollow shell of a movie. seriously, it's not worth wasting your, or your kid's time on. unless you're both heavily medicated. that's all i have to say.<br /><br />avoid, avoid, avoid! it will drive you barking mad! hahahah, get it? barking! hahahahahahaha! <br /><br />sorry, i've had a rough week.
