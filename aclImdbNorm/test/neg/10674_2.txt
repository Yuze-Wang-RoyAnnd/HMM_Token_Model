well, some people might go to see this to watch a trashy rubber and pvc clad bisexual vampire assassin kicking some ass. if that's what you want, and you wear a cloak, file your teeth to points and think that the name lilith silver is cool, you'll see a fine film.<br /><br />if, like most people, an assassin dressed in gleaming, creaking rubber with huge cleavage, thick makeup and bad fangs makes you laugh, then this is one of the best comedies you'll see. i laughed so hard i nearly cried. ridiculous acting, dialogue and plotting help to make this a better spoof than dracula, dead and loving it could be...<br /><br />it tries to be cool and goth, and all it succeeds in doing is making each scene hilarious. even the tacked-on lesbian scene is funny (how *did* she get those boots off that quickly? they were laced up to *here*...)<br /><br />don't see it if you like good films. see it if you like terrible films and want to laugh until you fall over.... it isn't good, it's just bad.
