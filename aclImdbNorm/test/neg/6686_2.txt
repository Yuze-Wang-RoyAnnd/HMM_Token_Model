there was a lot of hype of this movie and the commercials made it seem like it would be great. sadly, like bring it on 2, bring it on 3 shamed glory of the original bring it on. there is shameless stereotyping throughout the film. the lines given to the actors were humiliating for all the races involved in the film. the performance of hayden panattiere was sub-par both in terms of acting and cheerleading. there were several scenes in which i literally cringed because i was embarrassed for the cast because the scene (lines, plot, etc) were just so stupid. my recommendation to the makers of any future bring it on films is that you should hire good cheerleaders and teach them to act because the "acting" of the cast was horrendous and their lack of cheerleading ability made them completely useless to the film. only great character: kirresha.
