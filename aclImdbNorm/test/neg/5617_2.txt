this is the type of late-night cable flick usually associated with andrew stevens or shannon tweed. though unlike most of tweed and stevens' t&a fueled vehicles, this is lethally dull!<br /><br />let's cut to the chase. the real reason for watching this non-thriller is to see shannon doherty's breasts. anyone who states otherwise is a liar! however, most of her steamy sex scenes appear to be all smoke and mirrors.<br /><br />notice that all the shots where her head and chest show at the same time are quick peek-a-boo flashes. the frames where the camera lingers on her nude body, there's little or no face attached or she's behind a dripping, wet shower door.<br /><br />all you boob-watchers out there know what that means - body double!<br /><br />i must admit though, that the finale where doherty is bound, blindfolded and menaced with a knife, provided a certain fetishistic thrill.<br /><br />if you find a vhs copy anywhere, buy it! as all involved are probably too embarrassed to ever let this come out on dvd!
