the plot involves a new, hipper franchise barbershop that is moving across the street from calvin's barbershop. so, he feels like he has to change and improve his shop by getting newer stuff and such. sounds real exciting huh. as for the rest of the film, a lot of it involves the same material from the first film. the people that work at calvin's stand around, talk loud, and mouth off to each other and the customers. once again cedric the entertainer was mildly funny, but it is more like he's doing a stand-up routine than anything to do with the movie. and calvin is faced with another moral issue involving taking a large sum of money. he's already shown that he will do the right thing in the end.<br /><br />final verdict: nothing new. i don't recommend it unless you thought the first barbershop was the best thing since sliced bread.
