the chupacabra, according to this mockumentary, is a mysterious<br /><br />creature that has been killing and eating hispanic goats in latin<br /><br />america and mexico for years. one has crossed the border into<br /><br />southern texas, and a cute, intrepid cryptozoologist (no, i did not<br /><br />make up that word) go to an isolated ranch to find one. her uncle<br /><br />was killed by the creature, and some grainy video footage of the<br /><br />monster exists. she takes a badass black guy with a gun and two<br /><br />cameramen (for easy-to-edit coverage), and they go ahuntin' for<br /><br />chupacabras. ten minutes into the film, they find it.<br /><br />the rest of the film has the team of documentarians getting<br /><br />attacked by the bloodthirsty monster, and stilted dialogue. at one<br /><br />point, the team runs into a couple of hottie witches who lead them<br /><br />to the chupacabra's nest...for $100. if only the fbi knew about how<br /><br />cheaply tex-mex witches could be bought as informants. whole<br /><br />decades of mythical beast reports could be cleared up with a<br /><br />blank check.<br /><br />in the end, after the bloody deaths of characters you don't give a<br /><br />goat's patoot about, a chupacabra is captured, killed, and<br /><br />autopsied. the only point of the autopsy scene is to highlight the<br /><br />makeup department's efforts in such a cheap film.<br /><br />the film is shot on video, just like "bwp," yet the cameraman<br /><br />characters never reload their tapes or recharge their camera<br /><br />batteries. the lead actress here is awful. the beauty of the<br /><br />average "bwp" was its use of improvisation during the production.<br /><br />here, all the lines are written, and are delivered like a poorly<br /><br />rehearsed christmas pageant.<br /><br />the film is tinged with racism, as well. the only african-american<br /><br />here is a loudmouthed gun nut. at one point, as the crew breaks<br /><br />into an abandoned house, they find a trio of illegal immigrants who<br /><br />comically ask them if they are from the ins. chortle, chortle.<br /><br />the monster itself is a guy in a rubber suit, and nothing more. for<br /><br />such a lumbering and awkward beast, he is able to sneak up on<br /><br />the cast pretty quietly, whether they have idiotically locked<br /><br />themselves in a giant cage as bait, or cannot seem to get their<br /><br />only vehicle started.<br /><br />the gore is gruesome, but when surrounded by this kind of<br /><br />stupidity, it loses all of its effectiveness. i do not know if this was<br /><br />shot before or after "bwp," but i can honestly say this is the worst<br /><br />film ever made in southern texas about a mythical beast. pray<br /><br />there are not any sequels, i will start a letter writing campaign to<br /><br />troma.<br /><br />this is rated (r) for strong physical violence, gun violence, strong<br /><br />gore, and profanity.<br /><br />
