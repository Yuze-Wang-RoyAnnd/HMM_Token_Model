i am very surprised to see the good ratings for this movie.<br /><br />i watched the film 9 years ago and i still remember how angry i felt to sit in the movie theatre and to look at this mess. i am a big fan of john boorman's work. i really like his movies. so i went to "beyond rangoon" with big expectations. but i felt like watching a dumb, cheap chuck norris jungle movie with all action scenes cut out. even the soundtrack was very annoying.<br /><br />i can't believe that john boorman was the director because this movie was so badly done. i think the burmese people deserve better films to illustrate their struggle.
