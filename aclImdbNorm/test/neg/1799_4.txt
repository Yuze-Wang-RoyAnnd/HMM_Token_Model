the movie 'heart of darkness', based on the 1899 book by joseph conrad is one with little to no detail and has an almost schizophrenic like plot line. if you have read the book then you know that little to none of the important "story making" scenes were put into the movie. in the book there is so much that is left up to the imagination and i feel that that is one of the part that make the book what is it. an example would be when marlow spent timeless hours and days, even months waiting for rivets and that entire scene was left out of the movie. again if you have read the book then you would know that this scene in the book is one that almost describes the main, theme of futility, best. finally i feel that the movie was too cut and dry. not enough though was put in to the original text and how that made the story what it is today.<br /><br />if you have not read the book, 'heart of darkness' (preferably, the norton critical edition) then don't waist your time in renting or buying the movie. however if you have read the book then i think that you will appreciate the book a lot more if you decide to watch the movie <br /><br />eric 2007
