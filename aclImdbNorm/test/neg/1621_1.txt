this movie was so bad it was funny! for awhile there i thought i was actually watching a parody of a bad movie (a la "for your consideration"). the "cliffhanger" scene at the end had me laughing until my insides hurt. the script was dreadful enough, but coupled with sean young's terrible acting -- especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail (complete with flashbacks) while dangling off a cliff -- makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching! in fact the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an ed wood movie. i still can't believe how this thing got made. first of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? how did star actors get attached? were they at low points in their careers? questions, questions.
