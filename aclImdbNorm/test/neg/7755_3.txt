this started out as a good sketch comedy. the first few shows were very good and i was looking forward to a long run. what was really funny was the mariah carey imitation and the take off on beverly hills 90210 featuring the hair fight. the delta burke vs william conrad heavy weight battle was also good. unfortunately the following shows went downhill relatively quickly. the writing became uninspired and oh so predictable as if the show had acquired a cult following in it's young tenure. nothing fresh was being offered and the recurring skits were boring. one example is the gun family (or whatever it was called) which became a weekly feature. this sketch was not all that funny to begin with let alone being a regular feature. an example of a quick promising start then a sudden fall.
