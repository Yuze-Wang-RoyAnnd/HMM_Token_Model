i've seen a few bad action movies in my days, but this one's just plain awful. i feel it's a waste of time to even write this but i'll make it short. why this movie suck? here are 10 reasons: 1. very amateurly directed and cut. 2. bad bad bad acting of the whole cast. 3. silly dialogs and too many clich'es. 4. too many plot holes, a lot of scenes don't add up. 5. bad photographing (and a lot of continuity issues). 6. ridiculously bad performance by the lead female actress. 7. unreliable action scenes (and not too good, either). 8. even for a snipes movie, he shows a big lack of acting materials. 9. outrageous accents (of all the cast). 10. last, but not least - too many implausible facts, such as a tournament of soccer in the u.s., cia needing to do background checks to get new information about their employees, a mattress that is explosion proof and so on. in essence - it's a waste of time, it's not funny, not entertaining, not even as a joke - don"t watch it!!! seriously, just don't.
