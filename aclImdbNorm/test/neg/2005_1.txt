this was by far the worst movie i have ever seen! me and my husband own over 600 dvds, most of which are sci-fi and horror b-movies that aren't top quality, but still entertaining. dracula 300 had absolutely no redeeming qualities at all! the writing was horrific, and the acting was even worse. it took us a 3 tries to get through the entire movie, because we could only tolerate it in 30 minute intervals. we thought surely it must get better...we were wrong. i would rather watch a corpse being embalmed than to have to sit through that again!!! when it ended me and my husband just looked at each other like "uh..is that it?" the ending seemed like there was supposed to be more, but they ran over their apparent $500.00 budget and were like "oh, crap...we are broke..end it now...quick..roll credits!"
