visually, this film is interesting. light is literally thrown in a way, together with cinematography and an alluring introduction before the titles, that had my hopes up at the start, but then - a b-movie is a b-movie is a b-movie, no matter how much spectacle is seen. this film surrounds the life of albert fish, one of the most well-known serial-killers in the world. active around the start of the 20th century, fish's life is hastily and blurry dealt with before before he started killing children at an old age. this film is based upon two tracks: fish's life and that of william f. king, lead investigator of the case. what saves this film from becoming a hallmark spectacle and debacle of the usual sort, whenever films about serial killers are concerned, is the direction, which is a double-edged sword; director scott l. flynn sheds focus enough upon the b-actors not to let their flaws shine through too much, but at the same times created a truly dull and stereotypical view of the american police through the king-angle. sure enough he dealt quite thoroughly with fish's meet with grace budd, the 10-year-old girl that he killed, even though i'm not really sure if her mother was the media-crazed person that flynn really tries to emphasise that she was. i miss more psychological diving into fish, not to mention the very little time which was spent on fish's post-capture. all in all, interesting for those who are into serial-killers, but mostly a let-down; however, if the director will make another film about another serial-killer, i'd definitely see it in hopes that holes were patched-up.
