i'm sorry but i can't agree that this was a good movie. yes, it looked good visually, but it's the story that drives the movie and i must say the story sucked big-time. how in the world did they manage to slip some of those plot-holes past the critics. better story and i would've gave it a higher vote but i was impossible to do that and still be able to live with myself. i have always been a fan of scary movies, and the previews really had me fooled. all the scary scenes were shown in the previews. and why did the family that got killed stay to haunt the house? why did the father come back again? why did he decide to kill in the first place? why were the kids the only ones to see the ghosts first? to many questions, not enough answers. if i could've gave it a zero, i would've.
