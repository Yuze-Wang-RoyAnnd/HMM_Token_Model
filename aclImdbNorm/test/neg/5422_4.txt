i bought this movie for a couple of dollars at a "clearance warehouse sale" one day when just looking around. the cover looked pretty good, (in colour), but the movie is b&w, (i wish they wouldn't try to trap us with coloured covers on b&w movies, but it's a common thing to look out for!).<br /><br />when i watched it i was pleasantly surprised. it turned out to be better than i expected. i was disappointed that it was a b&w, but the effects are pretty good, certainly better than, say, "invaders from mars" which has crappy effects, and it is great to see john banner in something else apart from hogan's heroes.<br /><br />overall, this movie isn't too bad for a b grade, and certainly worth the two dollars from a nostalgia point of view. it isn't my favourite sci-fi, but it's not my worst either. it's o.k.
