this is about as stupid as it gets.<br /><br />a classic case of two-dimensional characters who always act exactly contrary as to what a sane person would do in the same situation. it reminds me of a scene in "scary movie" where carmen electra flees from the killer. there are two signs, one marked "to safety", the other one "to sure death" (i am reciting from memory).<br /><br />and just like in scary movie, the characters always run into the direction marked "sure death". <br /><br />why oh why did the girl start the fire in the teller booth and hold the door shut ??? did she prefer to die in the fire instead being killed by the guy? why oh why, after cutting and overpowering the driver did they sit him in the seat and have him being watched by the wounded guy instead of plain shooting him or at the very least knocking him out? he was running over their friend and killing him a minute before, yet they have scruples ?? why oh why a hundred things more ... <br /><br />if this movie were a road, you could not drive a single yard because of the holes. everything is so far-fetched, it's starting to physically hurt at times.<br /><br />add mercilessly overplaying "actors" and a small budget to that and here's what you get. looking at the rating and the comments, i get the feeling those people have been watching an entirely different movie.<br /><br />the one thing missing really, is the infamous red toolbox from "while she was out" - a movie that is about similar in unrealistic plot and stupid behavior of the characters.
