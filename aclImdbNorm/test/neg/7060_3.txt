i like a lot of myrna loy movies. this film was produced before her character actor personality was developed. it would be an okay short film but seems to go on forever in it's complete form.<br /><br />myrna loy it seems is told what to do with her acting and does the job. that is about all you can say about her.<br /><br />her gypsy character is shoddy and the film has many flaws, such as the jewelry shop scene.<br /><br />this film will probably be interesting to myrna loy fans but even as such is something of a disappointment.
