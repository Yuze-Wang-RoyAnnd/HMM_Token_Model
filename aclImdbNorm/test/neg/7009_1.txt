i'm just throwing in this review to show that i'm not crazy -- i like a lot of wynorski's work -- deathstalker 2, chopping mall, against the law are fast-paced and highly enjoyable -- just to prove i'm not blind, i have to mention this, along with some shannon tweed "body chemistry 3 or 4 or something", are the lousy ones -- i've got nothing against drawn-out sex sequences, but julie strain's breasts are so unnatural looking you can't help but stare at them - which may be the desired effect but i didn't enjoy staring at them -- and several members of this cast seem depressed or disinterested -- the "erotic thriller" was the worst thing to happen to low-budget flicks ever, and thank god that their day has more-or-less done.
