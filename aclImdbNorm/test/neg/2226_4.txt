warner brothers social responsibility at its most ham-handed, with sermonizing every five minutes or so about how we're americans, we don't run from trouble, we face up to our responsibilities. it also suggests that if you're willing to perjure yourself to protect your family from clearly deadly gangsters, you're un-american. walter huston, looking bored, is the frustrated da, and the "average american family" includes such familiar faces as sally blane (looking a lot like her sister, loretta young) and dickie moore, as an allegedly adorable moppet. both are regularly crowded out of the frame by chic sale, only 47 then but playing an octogenarian civil war veteran, ponderously jumping and "amusingly" nipping at prohibition hooch and moralizing about how we're americans, dag nabbit. his st. vitus dance old-coot performance is tiresome schtick; it's like walter brennan based his entire career on it. william wellman directs efficiently and quickly, much like his earlier "public enemy," but he and the screenwriter neglect to show what happens to this family after the happy fadeout -- i.e., they'd probably be rubbed out by the mob.
