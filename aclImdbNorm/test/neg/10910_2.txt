certain filmmakers can do no wrong in the eyes of national critics, which is one reason you should never pay attention to them. this film is a perfect example. the critics like director eric rohmer.<br /><br />this movie is a boring soap opera about a woman and a teenager ("pauline") she's taking care of for the summer, and the relationships they have with a few men. it's talk, talk, talk and more talk. <br /><br />for those looking at the cover and hoping to be titillated, there are a few quick nude shots and a couple of swear words but otherwise this is a harmless french morality play. a friend of mine loaned me this tape. he thought he was getting some sexy french film, and was disappointed. i was just as disappointed because it also was so boring. <br /><br />how this gets such great reviews is almost unfathomable.
