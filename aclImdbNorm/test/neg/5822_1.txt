terrible direction from an awful script. even the dvd looked muddy and out of focus. laughable accents all over the map. unlike most of the other commenters i had no idea this was about boys in love in the mud, but that fact became immediately obvious from the opening scene and all the lovingly drawn-out shots of nude or scantily-clad young men, usually wet or glistening with sweat, looking longingly at each other.
