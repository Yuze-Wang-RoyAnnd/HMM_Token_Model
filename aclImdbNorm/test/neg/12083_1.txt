this movie had potential. if it had been handled differently. what it needed was a different director. that's certain. and perhaps a different leading lady. i just can't understand the minnie driver character - or at least how she played it. she was completely unbelievable. i cannot believe she would have liked her performance in this movie either. she was probably abandoned by the director or incapable of delivering what the director was trying to get her to do. i am writing this as i am still watching it. i'm thinking i would have hated to be in her shoes trying to 'act' something i didn't understand. well, we've just proceeded to the affair she begins with the son (i'm still watching). i'm now beginning to be profoundly embarrassed for everyone involved in this enterprise. if you enjoy watching movies that miss their mark in a big way, then watch this one.
