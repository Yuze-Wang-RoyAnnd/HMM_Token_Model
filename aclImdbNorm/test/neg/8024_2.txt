it's funny... one day before i have seen this movie i had been watching a documentary about leni riefenstahl, so comparison kind of came automatically... of course there isn't any :)<br /><br /> this movie is weak in every aspect... acting is not convincing (especially the one who plays simona...) and unnatural..., editing in confused and always leaves a taste of unfinished shot, music doesn't fit, the story doesn't flow, it gets boring and the movie comes out much longer as it is... oh, and the characters aren't very well shown, you actually can't tell much about the girls (except what you see)... the movie also tries to shock with explicit cursing (which is very laughable :)<br /><br />so... 2/10
