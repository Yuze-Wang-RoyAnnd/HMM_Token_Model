eaten alive is a little film that opens in new york city and the arctic where tribe men shoot snake venom at a few people,then a woman enters the police precinct who's trying to find her sister that has disappeared after 6 months sheila is from alabama,but her accent sucks,she is teamed up with an adventurer who seems to just want her money and seems to say it a lot throughout the film.they venture through the amazon only to find a community with people and they find the sister,they're confronted by a mad man who has probably seen one too many jim jones preaches.he will bring them to a better place,it could be heaven but no,mark and sheila find out later its actually a suicide cult.<br /><br />why do i call eaten alive a "little film"? ill tell you but when i watched it,i was floored through all the run ins with the cannibals,robert kerman has a different role than his professor in cannibal holocaust.he's a bit annoying,once we meet him at an arm wrestling match that looked like russian roulette we know hes one tough guy.plus the strong misogyny just makes you cringe and it looked like i saw it somewhere,oh the scenes of animals killing each other.but the whole film revolves on those scenes,its like were actually watching a images of nature with parts of a film but after watching this film i realized that most of the films scenes are taken from other cannibal films,even the demise of 2 of the characters,well..most of the film is.that's why i call this a little film,when i did found out that scenes were borrowed i felt like throwing the disc across the room,this isn't a film just a simple montage of sorts .
