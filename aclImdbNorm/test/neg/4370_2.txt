one day i thought to myself....what is the worst possible thing that could happen today? i answered my self with a simple," oh, it already happened. i rented killjoy/killjoy 2" on dvd. well, what is there to say? the budget was not large enough to rent a police uniform, the movie cuts out sex scenes and death scenes. there is one funny line that i can remember, and the acting is far worse than the first one. there seems to be no lighting on the "set" (the woods somewhere) and the killer clown known as killjoy (who makes leprechaun look like the exorcist)is less than spectacular. this time, he is not portrayed by angel vargas and is completely changed as a character from a crazy irritating clown to a different kind of crazy irritating clown that says "child" a lot. somewhere between freddy krueger and a blade of grass... lies this version of killjoy. somewhere between a pile of dirt and a pile of s---t lies killjoy 2. it's badness is underrated. this movie does not have any redeeming qualities, except the song at the very end over the credits... which at leas provides some enjoyment. killjoy 2 is not even really a movie, so much as an exercise in tension. killjoy 1 is at least good enough to be considered as the worst movie i have ever seen. minor spoiler######### let me describe one of the supernatural kill scenes. a girl is locked in a wood shed of some sort (maybe an outhouse?) when killjoy peers in through a hole. he has some small chattering teeth (like the ones you can buy at spencer's gifts) and he does something with them (maybe winds them up?!). then he holds them in his hands and says a terrible line (which can't be written on imdb). from what i gather of this scene (not from what is shown by the movie) the teeth went into the outhouse and killed the girl in some interesting, but unshown way, and then came back to killjoy. if i were those teeth i would have run. run far from killjoy so he could never ever get his hands on me again. killjoy 2 is hopefully the last killjoy we will have to endure. even as a fan of movies others would say are very bad, i think that this "film" could unify the human race and create world peace if it were promised that this film and anything reminding us of it would be destroyed. i give it 2/10 - simply because the creators succeeded at making the pictures move.
