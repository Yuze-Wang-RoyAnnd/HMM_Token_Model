i wanted to dog this movie, but somehow i can't find it in myself to do that.<br /><br />exhibiting a duality of fighting styles, it's li vs. li in a somewhat decent battle for supremacy.<br /><br />this is one of those movies where the story carries the performances. li's acting is extremely amateurish, hesitant, and stiff for most of this movie...right up to the very end. at first i tricked myself into believing he was just doing that for one of his two characters. you know, to show a difference in personalities. but it appeared to be inexperience or a lack of talent. it did get a bit better, more relaxed, toward the end. but that wasn't enough to save his performance. jet li's acting does improve as his career moves forward. i don't hate his acting. i just hated him in this.<br /><br />i also have to say that the effects were very "b" class effects. what effects there are.<br /><br />the story itself had great potential. it was uniquely creative, daring, and fresh. unfortunately, either the budget was not ample enough to accommodate better lighting, effects, film quality, and some acting lessons, or the director just did not care enough to bother with these little details. he also did not bother with the science in the science-fiction. a fact which was a great detractor to this film.<br /><br />the fight sequences were a bit one sided, as he seemed to give more to one character and little to the other. but all in all the story line made for a very enjoyable attempt.<br /><br />as enjoyable as this was, i couldn't help but think, all the way through, that this was just one of those movies that you can't help but watch it for what it should've been, rather than what it is.<br /><br />it rates a 6.0/10 on the "b" scale.<br /><br />that's a 4.2/10 (on the "a" scale) for having a good plot, from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
