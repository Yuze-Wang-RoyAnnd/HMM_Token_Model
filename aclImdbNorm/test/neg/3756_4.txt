of the four main players in here - john candy, jean kelly, amy madigan and macauley caulkin - the only one i've never heard about (at that time) was the one that annoyed the heck out of me and ruined the film. well, she must have done a decent job of acting to make me want to throw her and the vhs into the garbage pail. i am referring to kelly in the role of teenage brat, "tia russell." ironically, six years later she played a stunning and extremely likable role in the person of "rowena morgan" in "mr. holland's opus."<br /><br />candy, as usual, is fun to watch as "buck russell," or the title character, "uncle buck." few actors were better at playing a lovable, hapless slob than candy. i enjoyed his character in here, but i cannot watch that spoiled teen girl more than once. also, in the first few minutes of the film, the little boy "miles" (cauklin) says the word "g-damn." how bad is that, having a six-year-old kid saying the lord's name in vain on film? these hollywood people are such sickos. no wonder many of their child actors turn out to be mentally screwed up, caulkin being a case in point.
