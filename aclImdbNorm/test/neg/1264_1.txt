czech movie goers may have enjoyed and rated this film highly because it was czech, but i found it to be trite, tedious, moronic, boring, and insipid. again, i suspect "ramping" in order to increase sales of this dog of a film. amazon describes this film as being about a couple of fellows that refuse to grow up, but i will go one further--i think it is about two fellows that have entered a state of dementia and perform actions that make no sense to anyone. i have been told that one of the actors in the film committed suicide after the film, and i would believe it. when he saw his performance he probably realized what a gosh awful job he had done and realized that the only way to avoid terminal embarrassment was to make the "big exit", which i am sure was much more dramatic and a much better performance that he had done in "autumn spring." don't waste your time or money on this pathetic performance. it's nothing but a dog in a manger.
