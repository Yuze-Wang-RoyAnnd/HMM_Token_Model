i can't believe they even released such a movie. the only good acting came from the water in the movie. this has to be one of worst (if not the worst) movie i have ever seen.<br /><br />the only scary part of the movie is the bad acting, me giving this movie a 1 is me being to kind, this movie deserve a 0.<br /><br />the storyline, and if you can call it the plot of the movie, seems to have been written by an high school kid. ofcaurse you have to ask yourself if it may have been better with better actors in it.<br /><br />do yourself a favor, wait for it to show on tv. <br /><br />and even then watching it will be a wast of time.
