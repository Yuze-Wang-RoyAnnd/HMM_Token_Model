i fail to understand why you would give this film anything over 4... fair enough it does take me back to the 80s and to the 'good old days of horror comedy' but that genre has not got any better since then - it is still so 'lame low budget - low tech - bad acting - bad story line - not at all scary and not funny enough... in fact there is not much good i could say about it. the so called monsters are just hideously bad! i mean we have gone back in time to when they used to make the monsters out of plasticine and shoot the scenes fame by frame... i really fail to understand why someone would invest any money in order to make this script to a film - but i guess it might have been almost ok if it had been a bigger budget film.<br /><br />recommendation would be - please do not make the mistake of wasting your time on this unless if you wish to get tips for a bad halloween make up! personally i enjoy independent films and anything outside the box but this just did not do it for me in the least.
