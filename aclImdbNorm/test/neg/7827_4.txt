asia argento is a sexy beautiful woman who likes to run around naked which isn't a bad thing in it's self, but, when her character talks about all the guys she serviced, and to see her with michael madsen and an asian guy in the present tense of the movie, it made me feel like i needed a condom over my eyes to watch this movie, like a disease was going to rub off on me or something.<br /><br />the movie felt like it was going for a love triangle/drama/action/??? plot, it just seemed to go everywhere and nowhere at the same time. the acting was great, the plot, not so great. the director needs to at least pick a genre and practice, practice, practice, before trying to do something as complicated as this again, because they are not very good at it obviously.
