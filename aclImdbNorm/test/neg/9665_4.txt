we picked this up as a part of a brentwood set, under the title "the broken skull." shot directly onto video, with widely varying sound and lighting quality, this movie winds up with a hyperactive quality that may inspire the viewer to feelings of nervousness, confusion and irritability - and not in a good, "evil dead" kind of way.<br /><br />without going into spoilers, what appears at first to be a simple revenge ghost story becomes increasingly convoluted and bizarre. while there are some interesting ideas here, the overall effect is likely to leave you scratching your head and saying "hunh?"<br /><br />this is a very, very gory movie. the gore effects range all the way from full bloody head appliances to a silly video toaster effect that has to be freeze-framed to be (dis)believed. the "fangoria" level of gross-out effects in this film is really amazing and should likely please the gore-hounds while making anyone with a weak constitution feel a bit on the queasy side.<br /><br />the broken skull is also an extremely noisy movie. it features not only ambient noises (captured by mikes and not replaced in post), but there is a lot of shrieking. no, no, i mean a lot. a lot, a lot! characters scream, wail, howl and yell, chitter and laugh maniacally. turn down the volume if you value your eardrums and your nerves! but you can't fault the cast for their enthusiasm, they really eat up the scenery and sometimes the effect is rather entertaining. in particular, the actress playing a certain vietnamese immigrant delivers all of the above with a remarkable amount of gusto.<br /><br />in fact, very few of the actors were wooden. some of them may have overacted a bit (oh, just a wee smidgen!), but most of them are certainly fun to watch go off. the cast is ethnically diverse and kudos to the filmmakers for that. the two middle-aged white women, however, are two of the most spiteful, exasperated characters since the shopkeeper in the mst3k classic "the brute man." just watch them seethe at all the other characters, it's fun!<br /><br />in closing, the headcrusher may not become a horror icon on a par with jason voorhees, michael myers or freddy kruger (or even the leprechaun), but we can definitely say this ... this was a movie.
