i remember watching this movie on tv a few years back. it was so bad, i can only remember the scenes that just made me die laughing. the only plot summary i can give you (without any spoilers) is picture a home movie made by college kids who were high.<br /><br />(spoiler alert starts here...) when the movie starts, a guy's running, being chased by the "demon cop", when in fact, the man was really being chased by a halloween costume gone wrong. a car pops out of nowhere, hitting the guy who was running. it sends him flying over the top of it, and what does the driver do??? watches the man as he falls, gets back in his car and drives away. what kind of hair-brained dolt would do that? i would've at least asked if the guy was okay.<br /><br />then, some black guy stares the demon cop straight in the face, then, later tells reporters, "i didn't get a good look at him." my sisters and i, by then, were almost choking ourselves to death with laughter.<br /><br />then, there's some scene in an alley, where this girl with an afro, pulls a machine gun out of her teeny-weeny little purse. it couldn't have possibly fit!! i can hardly remember certain scenes. maybe it's because they were just that bad.<br /><br />cops in the film can't even jump a fence, and the acting is so wooden, it makes planks of wood look like better actors.<br /><br />all in all, this movie brings shame to hollywood, way more than any other flop could. you have to see it to believe its sappy cheesy plot, which it has none of, as far as i can tell.
