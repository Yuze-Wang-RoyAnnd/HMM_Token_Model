forgive me, but this work of director peter hall is horrendous. if you can't get to us with the plot, why not kill someone's cat or dog. that surely reaches the audiences. this viewer is tired of seeing animals sacrificed for the plot of a movie. and, believe me, i saw it coming before she opened the package. how predictable can you get. take a cute animal then kill it in a gruesome way. i have never been a fan of de mornay and this performance tells me why. overacted and somewhat stagnant in interpretation, i found her rather silly and definitely boring. i did like banderas, but felt bad that he had to play opposite de mornay. he has done much better in other films namely "philadelphia" where he had some honesty in his dialogue. in this chestnut he did his best to keep his character real. but the writers, green & rush, did a good job in preventing this with their trite storyline and insipid dialogue. please, let us not be subjected to this kind of entertainment. some of us aren't fooled by corny plots, bludgeoning animals and generally long winded dialogue. seeing her get away with it, made me furious.
