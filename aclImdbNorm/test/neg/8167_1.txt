it's hard to make a bad movie with the "underdog finally succeeds" sport theme, but this movie succeeds admirably. my mind boggles at how pointless and boring this film is.<br /><br />i guess the director couldn't decide whether this was about the runner or the coach. it ends up being about neither. ultimately, who cares? neither character has a likable personality. there is nothing in the movie to make you care about anyone. even the "bad guy" isn't really bad. (i think he's in two scenes, and seemingly is on some kind of barbituate. ) i think he asks her, once and politely, to leave the coach and train with him. then later he kinda' sorta' asks her to move in with him. that's it. conflict! tension! what will she do? !!<br /><br />-and what's with the depiction of running? has the director ever seen an actual marathon? christine's form is so incorrect it's absurd, as is the form of the supposed "champion" she competes with (a character with no lines. -maybe they could have hired, you know, an actual runner?)<br /><br />-and the speed the run at is beyond comprehension. were they running or speed walking? it's actually laughable. i can literally walk backwards faster then they were running in the big race. maybe it was too hard to move the cameras at real speed?<br /><br />another absurdity: (spoiler, i guess) at one point in the big race, the two women in the lead inexplicably fall, at the same time. what they fell on is a mystery. maybe they both just got exhausted and fell down? -and then they get up, but don't start running again for maybe 30 seconds. oh yeah, very realistic. this ridiculous event doesn't even add any tension, since the other runners are not close, and besides at this point you have been numbed into a state of catatonia.<br /><br />-i especially enjoyed how all four of her male teammates, highly trained athletes all, drop out of the big race due to charlie-horses, or pulled tendons, or something just as improbable. <br /><br />but who cares? this movie has almost no tension, no resolution, nothing. some woman runner with absolutely no personality is discovered by an old, boring coach with some past failure that is barely hinted at. they train a lot. she is not happy. they train some more. she wins da big race. woopie. <br /><br />my description is actually more interesting than the actual movie. i just saved you 90 minutes. avoid this one like the plague.
