boring, cliched and predictable. the only original bit was the brighton location for gangsters. it is certainly no "lock stock etc......." hannah was likeable in "sliding doors". in "circus" i developed no empathy with his character and couldn't give a toss what happened to either him or his girlfriend. although this movie was so cliched and predictable the ending was no surprise i was so uninterested i didn't even care why the movie was given the name "circus"....... booooring.......don't visit this big top.
