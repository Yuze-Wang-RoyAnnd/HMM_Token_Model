this is one of the worst pieces of cinema i have seen in some time. this is also my first review so you can tell i must hate this film at lot.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, i like my serious films. i don't like hollywood too much, i tend to like french, italian, offbeat us or anything that tries to communicate something sensible.<br /><br />but this was awful. why? 1. the plot (such as it was) was entirely unbelievable, even though the director seems to be hinging everything on a feeling of realism.<br /><br />2. the main character has nothing to recommend him. does he smoke for coolness or to show us his angst? for goodness sake this guy is meant to be an ex-dodgy mafia lawyer. are we meant to care more because that he is also one of the meanest unfriendly people you could ever meet? and he smokes...so he must have deep personal issues. pop psychology at it's best. in the final moments, i almost cheered as he gets buried in the cement. best place for him. and i thought that was about the only good scene. or maybe that was because it was so close the final credits.<br /><br />3. the entirely tired and unbelievable interest in the main character from the beautiful girl. she was there simply because beautiful girls always have odd sexual relationships with old, old men with a deep and meaningful personality (as demonstrated by smoking). happens all the time. in really bad films that is.<br /><br />4. the pace was so leaden. i like slow, i like careful. but this was just deathly.<br /><br />5-50 a bunch of other stuff that i really can't be bothered to write.<br /><br />awful.
