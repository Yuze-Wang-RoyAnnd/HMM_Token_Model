watching this movie really surprised me. i have never found myself to stop watching a movie in its entirety because 3 dollars to rent a movie is a good amount of money and darn it, i should at least watch the whole thing and get my moneys worth. i made it through about 30 minutes of this absolutely crappy movie when i thought to myself, i am now a little more dumber after watching this movie. i can't believe that the director and actors in this movie actually had that low of respect for themselves to allow this to be released! <br /><br />there's nothing i can say that hasn't been said by the other reviewers, but even in the worst of films there are usually one or two decent performances...not in this piece of pathetic garbage. i've seen better acting in high school plays. every, and i mean every 'actor' is bad beyond belief, and what's truly amazing is the uniformity of the badness...gosh, it must have been the director. where did they get these people?<br /><br />this is possibly one of the worst horror movies i have ever seen. although entertaining in places due to its laughable script and even weaker acting, and i use that term very loosely, it is unfortunate that this film was not consigned to b movie hell for all eternity. what could have been a good idea has been ruined by an ultra low budget, poor sound and effects and actors who probably earned their wings in children's television, and poor children's television at that. <br /><br />please, stay away from this movie. not even worth a minute of your time.
