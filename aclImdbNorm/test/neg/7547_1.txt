i have always been a fan of bottom, grabbing as many videos as i could find of the series here in the states. the chemistry between rik and ade is always genius, and the combination of smart writing and utterly stupid humor seems to work without fail. i thus sat down to watch this movie with great eagerness... and was utterly disappointed by the end.<br /><br />the first 3/4 of the movie can best be described as uninspired and poorly directed (sorry, ade!), but with some utterly brilliant moments. unfortunately, these laugh-out-loud moments make you realize how less-than-brilliant the rest of the movie is. the slapstick starts off funny but eventually becomes a bit boring, with only the perverted sex jokes to keep things humorous.<br /><br />the end of the movie (the 'green' scenes, for those of you who've seen it) was... perhaps the worst ending i've seen in the past decade. honestly. it was one joke repeated about thirty times, followed by an abrupt ending that made no sense (which didn't bother me) and wasn't funny (which did).<br /><br />to sum up, i was sorely disappointed by this movie. i shall cling to the few brilliant moments in it, to retain the fondest memories that i can... but i have to warn you, if you're about to overpay for your ntsc conversion tape from the local importer, don't. there are far better things to spend your money on.
