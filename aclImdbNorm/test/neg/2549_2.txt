mexican werewolf in texas is set in the small border town of furlough where anna (erika fay) lives, her best friend is rosie (martine hughes) & she has a mexican boyfriend named miguel (gabriel gutierrez) who are determined to track a beast down that has been terrorising the town, killing livestock & several residents including some of their friends. local mexican legends speak of the chupacabra, an evil creature from myth & legend. erm, i'm struggling now because not that much else actually happens...<br /><br />written & directed by scott maginnis i won't beat about the bush here & simply say that mexican werewolf in texas is awful, period. the script only ever mentions the word werewolf once & the rest of the time it's referred to a chupacabra, in fact i suspect this wasn't really conceived as a werewolf flick at all. the 'werewolf' creature looks mostly hairless & more like some vicious dog, there is no reference to anybody changing during the full moon & it actually attacks during the day on a couple of occasions, there is no transformation scene & at the end when it is killed it doesn't change back into anyone either. to be honest apart from the title there's nothing here to indicate a werewolf film at all & even then the title is just a rip-off of the highly popular an american werewolf in london (1981). this is the type of home made crap that i personally think is killing the horror genre, how long has it been since there was a true low budget horror classic like dawn of the dead (1978), the evil dead (1981), halloween (1978) or friday the 13th (1980) which were all made on shoe string budgets, maybe the blair witch project (1999) but that's it in recent years & crap like mexican werewolf in texas has absolutely no chance of ever being considered a classic. the character's are awful & things just happen around them, the dialogue is rubbish, the pacing is terrible, the story sucks & virtually sent me to sleep & as a whole this film is just crap, i'm sorry but i don't know how else to describe it.<br /><br />director maginnis does nothing to make this watchable, there's the annoying hand held camera type cinematography which could easily give someone a headache & quick 'blink & you'll miss something' editing which just annoys & irritates in equal measure. it's not scary, there's no nudity, there's no tension or atmosphere & the special effects are awful. the monster really does look poor & it's no wonder maginnis keeps it in the shadows or cuts his scenes so quickly you never get a good look at it. there's virtually no colour to the picture either, it's either almost pitch black or over saturated desert sand oranges which makes the thing an eye sore as well. the gore consists of some fake guts (blink & you'll miss them!), a few bloody wounds & a severed arm, big deal.<br /><br />with a supposed budget of about $300,000 i admit the budget was low but i simply refuse to accept that for making such a rubbish film, there are plenty of low budget horror flicks that make their meagre budgets go far. the whole thing has the look of a home movie, it has no style & is throughly bland & dull to look at. the acting sucks too although you probably already knew that.<br /><br />mexican werewolf in texas will probably con a few people into renting/buying/watching it because they might mistakenly think it's a sequel to john landis' classic which it most certainly isn't & it isn't even a proper werewolf flick either. don't be fooled this is awful & i'm fed up of having to waste time/money on home made amateur crap like this.
