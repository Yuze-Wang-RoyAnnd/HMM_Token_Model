that's pretty much all i can say about this flat and uninspired remake of the 1979 carol kane vehicle. camilla belle isn't much of an actress, and she brings no energy and vitality to the role of jill johnson, the babysitter harassed by an anonymous phone caller.<br /><br />but if you're looking for some great home architecture and interior design ideas, this movie provides more inspiration than anything you'll see on tlc or hgtv. jill spends nearly 90 minutes wandering through the house of the rich doctor and wife for whom she's providing her sitting services, searching for the origins of strange sounds and things that keep going "bump" in the night. as she lurks around corners and peers down hallways, we get to see a beautiful master bathroom with his and hers sinks that look like roman tubs, a huge kitchen with incredible back lit glass shelving, and the piece de resistance, a self-contained aviary and coy pond that feature a self-watering system.<br /><br />because the movie isn't compelling enough to draw us into jill's fear, we're distracted by the grandeur of the house, which isn't something you should be doing when you're watching a thriller. even as jill is pursued by the faceless maniac, we cringe because she's breaking valuables and messing up the coy pond, not because she's about to get murdered.<br /><br />the movie plods along as predictably as most teen slasher movies, and the ending is anything but original. by the time it was over, i just wanted to find out where the heck that house was and if it was real. never mind jill and the kids she was babysitting.<br /><br />2 stars - both for the house.
