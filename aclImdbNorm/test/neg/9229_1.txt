yep, it's me again! mr 'i sit through crap so you don't have to'.<br /><br />what do you think this is about? could it possibly be about a woman who call a sex line and arrange to meet bachelors in a secluded area? then her cross-dressing boyfriend comes along and slits their throat with razor, before they make off together with his cash? wow, what a guess! and if i tell you that the cop who is put on the case is forced to team up with a sexy assistant da to nail these suckers, what conclusion will you come to? do you reckon the sexy da will go undercover wearing a flimsy red dress to an attempt to meet the drag queen, but then end up being kidnapped and having to be rescued by the maverick officer? (who has already handed in his gun and badge) zing! you get 10 points!<br /><br />frankly, this film bored me to tears. why do people insist on making this kind of rubbish? its a waste of our time, their time and yet they still carry on regardless.. filming a movie that no-one gives an iota about. if it has any redeeming features, there's the fact that it has some of the prettiest ladies i've seen in a motion picture for a while. i hope they spent what meagre wages they earned on plenty of botox and colonic irrigation. they'd look great on the cover of vogue, or perched on the top of a car in a bikini. they should just leave acting to the professionals (like shannon tweed).<br /><br />talking about future careers, i ran into the director the other day. he sure does whip up a tasty chicken burger meal. i must say too, that the uniform really does suit him. i asked him about 'party line', and his eyes went to the floor before he mumbled something about extra fries. oh well, guess it didn't quite work out. never mind, they're letting him take over the drive-thru tomorrow!! hurray!! 1/10
