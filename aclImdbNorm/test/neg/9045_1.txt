umberto lenzi hits new lows with this recycled trash. janet agren plays a lady who is looking for her missing sister. it turns out the sister is part of a jim jones type religous cult in new guinea. she hires a scruffy guide played by robert kerman to help her get to the cult's compound located in the jungle. this is another (!) cannibal movie, and i probably would have liked it if not for lenzi padding this film out with scenes from his superior "the man from deep river." i mean every cannibal scene is directly lifted from this film, which i guess makes him about as credible as al adamson. i felt ripped off. ***spoiler*** 1/2 star and that's for the dildo scene.
