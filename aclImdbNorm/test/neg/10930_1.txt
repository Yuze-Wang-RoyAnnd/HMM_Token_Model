this film is by far the worst film i have ever seen in my life. a woman "the ex" pretends to be a number of people in order to gain access to her ex-husband. killing people for no- reason in baths to achieve her goal. the women i don't think ever went to acting college. she just spends the whole film making stupid expressions, and she looks like she is trying her absolute hardest to avoid looking into the camera. failing on most occasions. she makes friends with her ex husband's wife and son, she does this to use them against her husband. at first when you watch this film, you think that the "ex" wants to kill her ex-husband, maybe because he has treated her in a bad way. but in fact the women is obsessed with the man and wants him back. the two of them used to enjoy rough entertainment (using whips of course). my advice to the general public is do not buy this film, do not rent this film and do not watch it like i did (at 1.15am on fox)
