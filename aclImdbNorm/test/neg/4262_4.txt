amitabh and jiah khan, raised great expectations, by their press conferences, though it was quite easy for the critics, and the fans too, that after all, this much hyped, ram gopal verma factory product, is going to fall flat on it's face, in all the probabilities ! why, because jiah was so immature and childish, and bacchan, mixed up guilty, and unsure . they themselves didn't know, what the hell they were talking about, to the press, keeping up with the tag line, that some love stories are not to be understood, or some such rubbish ! why the title is nishabd ? ramu needs to refresh his knowledge of sanskrit, as vidhu vinod needs to study mahabharata, tagging in line, another glorious flop of the year, eklavya ! comparison with the sweet hearts, and lolit's is inevitable, as the so-called plot line is supposed to have inspired by them. but sadly, ramu has hardly made any serious effort, to delve deeply into the psyche of the aging, and the young ones. is lolly pop sucking the ultimate indicator of the innocence ? and contrary to that streak of childishness, the leg show at the dining table, with a vijay, that is bacchan in that role, bursting into squeals of shameless laughter incessantly after wards ? this girl, is in fact at her seductive game, luring poor vijay to think, she is in love with him. the legs,too are skinny enough, and that act of putting the water hose through the legs, is down right obscene. it's beyond any one's understanding, how can a girl , coming as a guest to some body's house, can be so brazen, brash, and over powering ? and why the hell that stupid wife, played by revathi, remarkably well, though scripted poorly, and characterized unrealistically, encourages her own husband, to dance with a sexily saying young girl ? that part of vijay, trying to gain some refreshers to his humdrum life is absolute bullshit. because, apparently it seems that he is happy as he is, with a well settled life, and a hobby to recreate. this reminds of blame it on rio, the older daddy, and his young love, superbly played by michael caine. bacchan looks terrible in close ups, and over all, where as kevin spacey and jeremy irons looked debonair and handsome, which is why the young chicks some times get attracted to older men, for their charming persona, compared to the vulnerability of young boys of their age. only good thing about this movie is those green , sprawling land scapes , winding roads, and pleasant cinematography. no substance, or even any sparkling show of emotions, drama , or even intriguing, stormy sex like in lolita, this shallow movie has no wonder, fallen flat on it's face, and had to be wound up from the screens during first weeks ! next time round, before mindlessly copying any such theme from hollywood, ramu should do his home work, and bacchan should think twice ! you can not fool all the people at all the times, mr. bacchan!
