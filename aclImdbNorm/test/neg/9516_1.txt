this movie was so frustrating to watch. the split screens don't allow you to get very involved in the emotions of the actors. i was constantly going back and forth watching all these tiny images that i found myself with wiplash by the end. this is basically a rip off of "the talented mr. ripley" and "timecode" i was very let down with this film makers attempt to be cool. i wish i had walked out like so many other people did.
