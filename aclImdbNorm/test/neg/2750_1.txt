this movie is everything but the true story of phoolan devi. director shekhar kapoor's claims are countered by the fact that he made the entire movie without even once meeting phoolan devi, on whose life this movie is supposed to be based! the excuse being that meeting the woman would have interfered with director's conception of the story! the film wastes the opportunity of sensitizing the society of the plight of low-caste women in the indian society and ends up as a stereotype portraying phoolan devi as an angry woman whose sole motivation is revenge. no wonder, this shekhar kapoor's film was successful in the west as it catered to their non-bollywood tastes!
