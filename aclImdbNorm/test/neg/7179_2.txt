this is without doubt the worst film in the hamilton saga and the worst actor to do carl hamilton.peter stormare just cant pull it off,with his psychotic looks and no style at all.he may be good to do killers and psychotic maniacs like in "fargo" or "8mm" but in this type of roles,he is just useless.<br /><br />lena olin's presence did no use for this film.she couldnt save it from being what it is:an americanized copy of big budget action movies like "goldeneye","die hard 3","broken arrow" etc.this film has nothing swedish in it but the actors.its clear that some norweagian upstart director with mctiernan as model director has made this.<br /><br />mark hamill's presence is only laughable. 2 out of 10
