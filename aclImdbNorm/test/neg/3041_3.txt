this is so overly clich'ed you'll want to switch it off after the first 45 minutes. the beginning is very interesting, with a fair going on and someone gets killed. this movie would have been better, set on this setting.<br /><br />so, jill johnson is a depressed sprinter with boyfriend issues. i don't see the point of adding her breakup with her boyfriend occurs in any of the events in the story.<br /><br />since jill has come home late, her father sends her to babysit for the mandrakis's in their glamorous home in a deserted lake. the kids are sleeping and the maid is cleaning, another empty house to the side for their son who's at college. ok.<br /><br />after about half an hour of her stalking around the house by herself, she gets a couple of hang ups. ooh, scary ones. to which her friend comes to the rescue, to come up with a couple of high school lines about 'love' and whatever. friend leaves and goes to her car. to which then, she drops her keys. uhhh...then the music! dumdumdum..! she fumbles to pick them up, and gets into her car. which of course, doesn't start. how clich'e'd is that..? so..she disappears =d jill, alone again. uh. (most of this movie is with her by herself, so there's not much dialog) so more hangups, she calls the police. who say they cant help her, but call back if she has any more problems.<br /><br />so then she suspects that her boyfriend is calling, or her boyfriends friends are calling. they have been but only once. like thats supposed to be scary much? oh, and did i mention? her friend just now comes on caller id and some creepy man voice comes on. she gets all freaked out and shyt.<br /><br />yeah, so skip that. she see's the light in the house of the mandrakis's son go on. so she runs through the woods with music as her companion and goes in. bleheh.<br /><br />ah its so boring i cant continue!!!!!!!!!
