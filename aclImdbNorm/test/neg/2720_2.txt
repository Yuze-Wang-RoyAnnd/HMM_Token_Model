i appear to be in the minority, but i thought "radio" was pretty awful. it seemed to contain almost every cliche in these types of "heartwarming" movies.<br /><br />the motivation for the characters falling in love with radio was never really explained. we were just supposed to accept that everyone was fond of radio except for a couple of bad apples.<br /><br />you could see almost all of th big moments in the story from 100 yards away. when the movie wanted you to go "awww" or pull out your tissue, i was rolling my eyes and wished i was watching "rudy" instead.<br /><br />there were some good performances by the cast. too bad they weren't given a better movie in wish to appear.
