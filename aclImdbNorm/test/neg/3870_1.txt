the great yul brynner, who won an 'oscar', and who has starred blockbusters such as 'the ten commandments' among lots of others, ended his remarkable career with cheap backlot movies such as this one, 'sartana', and such. regretable, indeed. one should take pity on seeing him making his very best to make this idiotic thing stand. gone were the days when he was surrounded by steve mcqueen, james coburn, charles bronson, eli wallach, in 'the magnificent seven', and walked around under the famous elmer bernstein soundtrack. it's difficult to make a living out of being an actor, sometimes.
