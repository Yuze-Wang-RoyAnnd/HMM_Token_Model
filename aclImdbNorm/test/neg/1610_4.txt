the storyline of "the stranger" mirrors somewhat the 1969 film "journey to the far side of the sun" (made by gerry & sylvia anderson of 'thunderbirds' and 'space: 1999' fame). a parallel-universe earth is the premise of both films. but there is a difference. where the world in "the stranger" features a totalitarian regime out to squash the freedom of the citizenry, "journey to the far side of the sun" merely showed a true mirror world where handwriting, roads, houses, machinery of every kind, and of course internal organs were all in reverse (or mirrored) order. so, the similarity of parallel earths is the only connection of both films.<br /><br />similarly, the tv series "land of the giants" came before both of those films, having run from 1968 to 1970. it featured a world that was nearly parallel to the earth with the exception that the planet was populated by giants 12 times the size of the humans who crash-landed there. the idea of a totalitarian government out to capture and contain the 'little people' was similar to the premise of "the stranger" more-so than the premise of "jttfsots". perhaps because of the similarly to "lotg", a series to "the stranger" was shelved. had it turned into a tv series it would have been a sci-fi version of "the fugitive," with star glenn corbett being chased by the baddies from week to week, hiding out in different locations, etc. btw, a stronger script could have helped this film along.
