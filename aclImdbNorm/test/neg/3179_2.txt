i like wes studi & especially adam beach, but whoa is this movie a load of pretentiousness. ponderously slow. overly cryptic to the point of obfuscation, not because the plot warrants it but because there is almost no plot. even less in the way of characterization. this is almost like one of those creaky old charlie chan mysteries (the cheaper monogram studio versions) with lots of red herrings & oddball characters (like the old ex-senator with the checkered past who is now a recluse) & loads of people getting killed over objets d'art that you wouldn't look twice at in the mall. great scenery, though. pretty hair on the redhead, too, although i never did figure out what she was doing in this at all. neither could my wife. sheesh, at least the old b-movies had the decency to be short.
