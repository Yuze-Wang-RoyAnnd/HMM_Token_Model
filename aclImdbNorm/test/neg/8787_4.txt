i'm an animator myself and an all around buff of the medium so when i saw this movie in a $5 bin i figured it was worth a shot to add to my collection. while i never regret having a new addition to my animation library this film was definitely disappointing.<br /><br />the premise has enough potential. a penguin named hubie finds the perfect pebble to give to the girl he loves as the penguin equivalent to an engagement ring but before he can give it to her, he's cast out by an evil rival and lost at sea. he then befriends another penguin who helps him find his way home. that set up isn't great but it's enough to set up what could be a fun adventure. unfortunately the duo's exploits never really amount to much and it all gets pretty repetitive. most of the situations they find themselves in are really uninspired and lacking in creativity...and the bonding the two of them under go is cheesy and forced.<br /><br />animation is good but not up to don bluth's usual standards. this is the guy that gave us the secret of nimh, land before time and an american tale, all of which had an attention to detail that often surpassed disney, the granddaddy of feature animation. this one doesn't amount to much beyond high end tv fair.<br /><br />the music is alright but pretty forgettable and the voice actors are all wasted talent...martin short is particularly wasted here as the lead character who in spite of being spoken of as a bumbler is practically a straight man through the whole film.<br /><br />in short the movie will probably appeal to very small kids but a good family film should appeal to all ages and unfortunately it doesn't got what it takes.
