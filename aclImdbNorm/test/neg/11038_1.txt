let me get this out of the way before i trash this film: i love park chan-wook's work as a director. while i disagree with the masses saying he's is the best director working in our time, i can't deny that he understands how to use a camera very effectively. i really liked one of his other films, sympathy for mr. vengeance. also, min-sik choi's acting was the only thing that allowed me to take this film seriously . . . for 1/5 of the runtime, that is.<br /><br />now the bad: the plot is simply the oldest clich'e used in cinema/literature. i'll never understand how critics can trash a hollywood blockbuster for being clich'e, then hail movies like oldboy which are just as unoriginal and clich'ed if not even more so. regardless, oldboy is flat-out one of the most generic, unoriginal movies ever conceived. *spoilers* man is held captive, man seeks revenge, man finds out he had sex with a family member, man's life is over. *end spoilers* simply put, this plot line has been used in everything from greek plays to modern melodramatic soap operas and countless movies/books in between. it is so melodramatic and unoriginal when the major reveal happens, i laughed out loud. does that mean i'm a desensitized freak without emotions as some reviews of this film say about people like me? no. what it means overdone plots make people laugh. the scary movie franchise proved that, and oldboy proved it as well. why can't people think of something that is truly disturbing instead of just spewing out tried clich'es masked with fancy camera-work and classical music? that brings up the issue of blood/gore. simply put, it isn't there. the director is too timid to even point the camera at the screen when something "gory" happens, as if we're watching a children's movie or something. maybe we were. anyway, i've heard oldboy called the "most brutal movie of all time" and "the most disturbing movie ever" but when i watched it i failed to see anything even remotely gory or disturbing. all the "gore" is off-screen, and even then the violence level is nothing you haven't seen in pg-13 movies like the dark knight or casino royale before. why this even got an r-rating confuses me, much less "the most brutal movie of all time". seriously, i've seen movies that just make oldboy look cute on every level when it comes to violence/gore.<br /><br />the other huge glaring, cheesy flaw is the main villain. the majority of his screen time he's showing his bare butt off for the audience in comedic american pie-style, but i'm supposed to think he's oh-so-evil? when he's wearing clothes, his hair is slicked back like a bad asian mix of the cheesiest james bond villain mixed with something out of austin powers. he talks like a brain-dead teenager recovering from an acid overdose, and his dialogue is so bad it had me laughing yet again. seriously, oldboy had me laughing more than any comedy this year . . .<br /><br />in the end, oldboy is for those of you who sip fine wine, have no sense of humor, and talk about how boring your lives are at dinner parties. it's for those people who are so stuck up in their own ego they forgot how unoriginal they are, and consequently forgot how unoriginal and boring the "films" (never "movies") they enjoy are.<br /><br />to those people all i can say is this: i like "films" and also like "movies". i like thoughtful dramas that actually say something about the human condition, and i also like pointless action movies that thrill me into a coma. but the thing is, for me to like both "films" and "movies", they have to be original. they have to be something i haven't seen so many times i lost count of the number of times the plot has been used. when something isn't original, it's expendable. if it does exactly what everyone else does, it's forgettable and boring. before you give oldboy yet another perfect rating because it "touched" you, maybe you should think about something: wouldn't a movie equally as touching, but at the same time original make you think more? i just wish someone other than me would understand this.<br /><br />overall: oldboy is forgettable and cheesy.<br /><br />1/10
