after the failure of "hellraiser iii: hell on earth," the chapter that served as a kind of 'death blow' to the franchise, another embarrassing cheapo cash-in did not come as a surprise. an abysmal attempt to explain every single mystery of pinhead and the puzzle box, covering literally centuries of history, in a film that runs under 90 minutes... on display is sub-par to wretched acting, sup-par to wretched b-movie special effects, and a ludicrous and insulting attempt at dark humour, while still attempting to keep the whole project completely serious. i'm wondering, how many freaking directors did this thing have? poor pinhead has so much screen time, that every bit of mystery and menace that this iconic character possessed, is completely lost. after an hour of hearing long-winded speeches and dramatic posturing, we simply want to tell the guy to shut up! mildly entertaining in spots, especially in the first segment, this mess begins to look and feel like a cheap, ugly made for tv splatter flick after a while, and ends in the most ridiculous way imaginable: pinhead, along with his pet cenobite dog, killing a bunch of idiots... in outer space! i'm sorry, but any true fan of the first two films in the series, that gave this abortion of a film more than 3 stars, should be ashamed. on a side note, the film that follows; "hellraiser: inferno" is actually a surprisingly intelligent, and stylishly-made film-noir piece, that brilliantly reinstates 'pinhead' as a master of illusion and cruelty, and brings back the concept of the inherent evil in human kind, that was the centerpiece of the original film, and the whole point of the story. for any serious horror fan, see hellraiser i & ii, skip the lousy iii & this one, and continue with 'inferno.' you won't miss a thing by skipping this garbage...
