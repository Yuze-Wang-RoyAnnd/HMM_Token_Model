i thought this would be a fun comedy with no sex or nudity in it. well, there's no sexual content but as for being a "fun comedy," i only remember laughing a total three times during "the green butchers." the hilarity is centered around cannibalism and mental retardation, which is just sick humor, in a bad way.<br /><br />i should have walked out of this film and i'm kicking myself because i didn't. in fact, i shouldn't have seen this movie in the first place. the only good that came out of this film was was the fact that bjarne and his brother finally made amends and put their ugly past behind them. i advise any well-meaning individual to steer clear of this gross-out flick.
