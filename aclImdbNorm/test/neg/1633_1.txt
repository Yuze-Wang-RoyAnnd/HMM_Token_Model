why was this movie made? are producers so easily fooled by sadists that they'll give them money to create torture methods such as this so called "film"? i love a bad movie as much as the next masochist, but "cave dwellers" is pushing it. it's seriously physically painful to watch. the plot is something about a dude name ator - a buffed-up numbnuts whom i will refer to as private snowball for the rest of this review - who has to fight invisible warriors and rescue a princess in order to beat the bad guy who needs to find a better hair stylist. i might have gotten the plot wrong since it's been a while since i watched this excrement, but really, do you care that much? oh yeah, private snowball also has a mute asian sidekick (who hasn't?). who's not funny.<br /><br />anyway, private snowball fights invisible people, visits some caves, all in the name of a good king so personality-free he makes al gore look like jim carrey. then private snowball builds a hang-glider (yes, i'm serious) and gets the girl. yippie-kee-yay. it's cheap, unintentionally silly, and mind-numbingly dull. why am i not surprised that the director ended up making porn?<br /><br />bottom line: avoid. ator will steal a part of your life and you will have no funny "so-bad-they're-good" catchphrases to take with you from the experience. bad ator! bad! aak! *gags*
