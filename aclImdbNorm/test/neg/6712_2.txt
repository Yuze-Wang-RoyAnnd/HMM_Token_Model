why on earth does five us keep repeating this one? the title actually says it all: the plot is as clear as a book read in a language you never heard of and that resembles to nothing.<br /><br />you'll see ninety minutes of changing locations, most of them will be blown up later on in the movie. right in the beginning you see a nice little farm typical for the berry, which is in the movie moved close to paris but then it does not survive the "transport" to the isle de france very well: it explodes 1 minute later. there are also two gangster who have no tongues, as if that would make sense in the world of sms and internet, let alone pencil and paper.<br /><br />it just goes on like that, nothing makes sense in this story. my only credit goes to the cameraman, the camera is excellent.
