i was so let down by this film. the tag line was something like 'the story of a girls sexual awakening'. you can only imagine how disappointed i was. i was seventeen at the time and i took my girlfriend to see it. i thought we were going to see a sexy movie that would leave my girlfriend gagging for it. sadly that was not the case. i guess we just weren't ready for a deep and meaningful movie that required an element of sophistication that we just didn't possess at the time. i'm not so sure i possess it now, and i have long since parted company with that particular girlfriend (pity really... my first love). we left the cinema half way through the film, my friend, who should have known better, stayed for the whole thing. i still got the required result with my girlfriend, the film just didn't help much. it would be interesting to see it again so that i can make a more informed critique, though i feel the experience has left me scarred for life.
