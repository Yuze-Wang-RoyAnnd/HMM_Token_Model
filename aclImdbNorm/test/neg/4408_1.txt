did i waste my time. this is very pretentious film. in the beginning you will think there's something going on but by the time some 30 minutes go by you realize nothing is happening. i waited for another 20 minutes and by then i was so frustrated that i started reading reviews on imdb and realized that the director has wasted precious time of so many people. <br /><br />unbelievably boring pointless film. stay away. so many good soundtracks. i will give one point for the police inspector joke because that worked for me. i laughed for a long time but otherwise a very bad film. stay away.1 on 10.
