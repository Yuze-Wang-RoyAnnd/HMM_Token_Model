why did they change the cute, rugrats television show we all know and love into a lame attempt to target teens? they don't have to do that. all ages watch the regular rugrats. when i heard about this, i thought, "hey. they made a tv series about the movie. except, they're really grown up as a teenager! this is going to be better." when i saw it, it was just as if i was watching as told by ginger, except they made it suck. great job.<br /><br />when in the rugrats series has tommy been a director? never. basically all the episodes in this attempted series is about tommy's love of directing. i don't like that. i rather watch plots that change every episode. not the same thing over and over. also, when did in the old series have each character have their own sides of the story? never. this series did that. i didn't like that everyone separated. i don't want to see angelica's side of the story. i hate her.<br /><br />i do not recommend this show if you like as told by ginger and the rugrats.
