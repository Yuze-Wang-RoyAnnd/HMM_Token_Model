for a series that was inspired by kolchak, it's ironic that the x files first attempt at a vampire episode should land squarely on it's ass. 3 has always puzzled me and - at the risk of sounding like the dreadful hans keller - i've often wondered if i'm missing the point. the story feels like a jigsaw that has pieces that don't match the box, and the result is you spending a cosy evening by the fire trying to match sky that is really sea. this incomplete feeling remains no matter how many times you revisit the episode and no matter how much attention you give it. i know that this review puts me in danger of being dragged to whitby by teenage vampires who'll drink my blood while listening to busted, but that's a risk i'm willing to take. i've always been a werewolf man myself.
