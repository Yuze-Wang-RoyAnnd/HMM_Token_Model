one of the worst movies i've seen this year. everything about the film screams "amateur". for a movie set in the 1800's, everybody speaks like it's the 1990's. the acting, particularly the people playing the white slave masters, is horrible. after about an hour into this movie, i walked out. what a waste of time and effort. for a much better film on this subject, see steven spielberg's far superior "amistad."
