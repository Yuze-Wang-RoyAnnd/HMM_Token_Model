hellraiser: bloodline is only a so-so film. i believe it's the fourth installment in the hellraiser series.<br /><br />i missed the beginning, and all i remember from there was some topless women and a box-shape thing on a computer screen. but, using my wit and intelligence, (and the info button) i soon found out that the villain (pinhead) was released from pandora's box, which, i believe is a gateway straight to hell.<br /><br />so, anyways, pinhead somehow comes out of the box and terrorizes the "toymaker's" family. and, that's about it. oh, and not to mention the random tortures of various people that cross his path. yawn.<br /><br />what mainly happens in this film is that pinhead captures the kid, and then unleashes the dog on his wife, and then kills a random person. then he husband comes along, blah, blah, blah. who cares? why it fails is because hellraiser: bloodline is too corny to be scary. look at pinhead's minion of creatures: a cheesy dog that looks like it's been turned inside out, two men whose heads and bodies are connected together, (siamese twins in a horror film?) and some person who is supposed to be a princess of some sort. (i haven't seen the previous films.) now look at the main villain. his name is pinhead. isn't that the name you call somebody when they're stupid? he has pins in his head and hooks coming out of his fingers, and he has blue skin. i suppose he would make a decent villain if he didn't have such a corny name, and a corny speech. somewhere in the film, two cops approach him and say "don't make us put some pain on you!" pinhead replies "pain? how dare you use that word! i am pain
