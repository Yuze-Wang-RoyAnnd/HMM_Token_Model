spoilers throughout:<br /><br />not good. the movie differed completely from the book(not that the book was exactly a classic but it really was very good.)<br /><br />i guess demi moore was ok. actually, i don't really remember to much about her performance one way or the other. however the big disappointment wasn't with ms. moore.<br /><br />why did whoever did the rewrite decide to suddenly make the millionaire have a heart? (i'm referring to him as "the millionaire" because he also had a different name in the movie then the book version-just another change.)<br /><br />people who didn't read the book obviously won't know anything's different but in the book version this guy is much more ruthless as well as complex overall. he is also fascinating. the fact that such a big change was made in the movie alters the whole plot. it was almost like seeing a completely different movie.<br /><br />i know many movies vary widely from the books. but i also thought redford's character was a bit of a wimp. this isn't redford's fault(he's a great actor and could have played ruthless well) but without those qualities he becomes just another dazzled man in love hence the story becomes just another clich'e love story involving 1 woman and 2 men. that wasn't really the point of the book.<br /><br />this could have been a lot better. even if i hadn't read the book version i wouldn't have liked this all that much, but changing so much around definitely takes it, for me, a few points down.
