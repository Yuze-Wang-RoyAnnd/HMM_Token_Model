i had a bad feeling when i saw the cheap title work. it only took a couple of scenes to confirm that this movie is a real stinker! the only enjoyment i got out of this was to laugh at the technical flaws (example - the background "car sounds" audio just disappears during the scene with danny and dog in dog's car). production shows a total lack of imagination (example - slow motion machine gun fire repeats many times). sandra bullock plays essentially a bit part, completely unnecessary to the plot. to say that this movie actually has a plot is doing more justice to the writing than it deserves. the antique computer hardware is kind of interesting. this film was released in 1982 (not 1987 as the imdb database indicates) and then current "high tech" was an amber screen on a 4.8 mhz ibm pc with floppy drives. maybe the pc was the real star of the movie... at least it was interesting.<br /><br />we got this on dvd for a couple of bucks in the bargain bin at walmart. as the other reviewer notes, we paid too much!
