i was all in awe of the film looking at the promos and went to watch it fdfs the film was horrible to say the least<br /><br />the first scene is good and till they go to london things are funny but slowly the pace slackens and they is nothing funny about it<br /><br />the manoj joshi subplot is funny at places but is unwanted and adds to the boredom<br /><br />the drugs part is funny especially the monologue of govinda<br /><br />the film goes on and on aimlessly just like a small kid has written it<br /><br />the interval brings a twist in the story but by then i lost hope<br /><br />the second half starts okay but the way things are handled makes a mockery the entire arbaaz- jackie angle is half baked also how come people don't identify them?<br /><br />the climax is quite funny though stupid<br /><br />priyadarshan is not at all in his elements, from this film he started doing craps and his films got bad and bad music is good, signal, tere bin stand out and afreen too camera-work is good<br /><br />akshay kumar has white in his stubble and looks old but he acts well though this role he has done many times yet thanks to his natural comedy acting things look bearable govinda looks out of shape, bad and his act except monologue is boring too surprising from govinda seems too much pressure on him to comeback and priyan fails to utilize him paresh is okay in parts but overall just repeat act manoj joshi is funny at places sharat saxena is okay shakti kapoor is great jackie shroff looks overweight and acts in his sleep arbaaz khan is bad lara dutta shrieks to glory but fails to act
