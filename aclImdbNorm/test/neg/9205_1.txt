now, i love bad, old skifee movies as much as most people. and i understand that a budget is a budget. that said, planet of the dinosaurs is as bad as a bad movie can get. the thing has no actors, and only one attractive female whom they kill off two minutes after swimming ashore. there are literally no redeeming qualities to be found in this pile of wasted celluloid. the only thing not wasted was paper...the screenplay must have been no more than four pages long. surely no one actually wrote dialogue this pointless. i'm constantly amazed that such movies ever got made, much less released. i'm only glad i didn't pay to see this waste of time. it's 75 minutes of my life i'll never get back.
