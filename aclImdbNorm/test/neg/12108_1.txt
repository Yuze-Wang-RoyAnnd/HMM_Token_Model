if you wish to have a truly traumatic experience, than this awful motion picture (if you may consider to call it that) is for you. a film worse than the postman,sizzle beach u.s.a, batman and robin, kazaam,fair game...well you get my point.this film directed by french television sensation patrick sebastien (jerry springer with an i.q of 25) can truly be considered the worst film ever made. i do hope that troma or someone in america would distribute it, so that the u.s.a can experience the french stench at it's worth.
