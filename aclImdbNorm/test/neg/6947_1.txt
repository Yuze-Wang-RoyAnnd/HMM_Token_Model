i could not believe it. this film was a total wast of time out of my life. the title is appropriate. love didn't beat the hell out of me, this film did. i kept watching and watching and waiting and waiting and hoping for something, anything to happen. and nothing ever happened! nothing!! terrence howard couldn't even save this lame piece of work called a film. it was dark, and confused and i didn't get who killed the girlfriend in the end. the tone and pacing of the film was supposed to be building to a dramatic climactic ending. this only served to confuse the audience because the movie just plodded along going no where. if you want pure torture, watch this film.
