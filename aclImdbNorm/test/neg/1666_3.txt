this is probably my least favorite episode. i lived in cape girardeau for quite some time. i can tell you there is no ocean or shrimp boats, fresh crab or scallops anywhere near missouri. cape girardeau is the only inland cape, it's on the mississippi river. it looked like the license plates were from mississippi, which may explain why there was so much racial tension. missouri and mississippi are 2 completely different states that don't touch one another. there are many roads in and out of town and none of them are route 6 or route 666. this whole inaccuracy was very distracting. also, cassie did not seem like someone who would want to hang around dean if she was well educated. i did not buy them as a couple and didn't enjoy the lengthy love scene. jo was more dean's style.
