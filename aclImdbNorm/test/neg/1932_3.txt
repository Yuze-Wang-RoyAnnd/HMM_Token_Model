this movie has more on its plate than a sumo wrestler and the result for the viewer is indigestion. there are some good performances, but the subplots are extraneous and largely unresolved.<br /><br />in addition, i found all the characters unlikeable, and if you can't identify with at least one character, there isn't much to get excited about. all in all, this is a classic example of trying to do too much with too little.
