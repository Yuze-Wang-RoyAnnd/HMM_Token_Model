leon errol handles his double role of uncle matt lindsay and lord basil epping superbly, but i have trouble liking the "mexican spitfire" series because they all are contrived to produce mistaken identities, and these are telegraphed way in advance. errol is funny as the stuffy lord epping, but i would have preferred a lot more wit and much less repetition. <br /><br />
