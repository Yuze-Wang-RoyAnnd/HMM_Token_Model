couple having financial trouble gets a box delivered to their door. if they push the button they get a million dollars but someone they don't know will die. do they push the button? <br /><br />this is an odd film based on a richard matheson short story has a few chills but mostly is a messy affair. the trouble is that there is so much going on it feels as though writer director richard kelly didn't know what sort of movie he was making. is this a straight out horror film with supernatural overtones? at times it seems like it with talk of moral choices, damnation and the afterlife. is it a science fiction film? possibly, there are lots of questions about that mars project. and what are the strange looks that people seem to have as if in some grand conspiracy? is this invasion of the body snatchers or a demonic take over film? don't know, maybe. and that's the problem there are lots of questions, most of them intriguing, but there are too many. little seems to have been explained and when we get to the end of the film things seem more to stop then to conclude (even in an open ended way). i'm all for making a film rich with themes and points but writer kelly fills his script with simply too many that director kelly can't handle, or does so in such away that each theme or plot thread gets its ten minutes of screen time and for those minutes it hold court before its cast off the next bit. it made me crazy. (i won't get into the two leads, cameron diaz and james marsden, who aren't very good or more likely don't know what to make of the material which is so ever shifting ) <br /><br />it's a heady mix that doesn't work (there are ultimately too many holes). i got to the end and suddenly realized i had no idea what i just saw. i really didn't like it, but its more in a this isn't good because it just misses sort of a way rather. i'd take a pass or wait for cable where its not going to cost you anything
