so much great chemistry between kristen scott-thomas and harrison ford, but every time the story about their relationship began to gather momentum the script cut away and dealt with some irrelevant sub-plot that did nothing to advance the story. indeed, the subplots had nothing to do with the story at all. they were like commercial breaks in which you watched a trailer for another movie. <br /><br />the writers (or someone who controlled the writers) obviously didn't trust themselves to write compellingly about relationships and the interior lives of their characters. they seemed to be uncomfortable unless they threw in some gun battles and bar fights. or perhaps they didn't trust the audience to pay attention to a story about a man and a woman trying to understand their relationship under difficult circumstances. after all, we all know how boring "casablanca" was. <br /><br />perhaps if the relationship between kay and dutch had been developed more and had been allowed to play out, the writers would have know how to end the story. this film is a disappointment for not doing more with its wonderful actors, who gave good performances but could have done more with a better script.
