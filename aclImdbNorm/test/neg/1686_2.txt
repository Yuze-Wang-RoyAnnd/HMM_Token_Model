i never really started watching the show until it was canceled and started showing re-runs. i actually enjoyed it for the first to third season. once i saw the fourth and fifth one i was beginning to get irate. the first problem was that they did that irrelevant, scenario of history repeating itself (jr having a kid like his parents did). the second had to be the one where they had everyone paired up with someone (ex: katie and franklin) . the third one was when they made jr even more idiotic than before which was beginning to be tedious and vexing to the point where i wanted to go into the t.v. and beat the stupidity out of him until he's unconscious . the fourth one had to be that zealous dork that clarie claimed as a boyfriend. the fifth one had to be katie, she was beginning to be too good for herself and was treated her "boyfriend" franklin like the pushover he was. the last but not least was noah gray-cabey!! franklin, franklin was just scary. it was like watching a terrible combination of urkle and tj henderson only more annoying!!! they seriously jumped the shark when came he to the show. there was little to no realism to his character and the way he laughed was a sign of obvious force showing that noah can't act. eveytime i saw that kid just made me want slap he silly. however, b.f.(before frank) this show was funny and very entertaining.
