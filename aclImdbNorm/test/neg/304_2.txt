i wasted enough time actually watching this chore of a movie, i don't want to waste more writing a big review. not once did i so much as crack a smile. all the jokes were boring, forced and lacked any kind of wit. i kept saying, "wheres the punchline?" almost every single character was an obnoxious stereotype and all the situations were clich'ed and half the time there wasn't even any kind of solution. things just happened to get to the next scene. for the life of me i can't understand how this got as many good reviews as it did. if you like clunky acting and poorly composed film making fat girls is the movie for you.
