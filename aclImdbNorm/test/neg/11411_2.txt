wow. i just saw demon wind a little while ago, and i don't think i'll ever be the same. it has the power to inspire nightmares, but for all the wrong reasons, actually.<br /><br />never before has humanity seen such a gratuitous change in make-up, for no damn reason. or, similarly, so much bad zombie (?) makeup that makes you hungry for those halloween green marshmallows.<br /><br />or so much naked old lady, for that matter. but then, there was "the shining."<br /><br />the plot here is so amateurish that it actually almost holds a little bit of charm, as does the dialog. the last shot of the film is just so silly that its beyond description. it's like some drunk college student got together with some pals and decided to throw bruce willis type dialog together with (i guess?) teenybopper dialog from some elm street film. the result is jarring, and it'd be truly funny if it was intended that way.<br /><br />ah, what the hey. i'll laugh anyway.<br /><br />hell, get together with your friends and watch this. but make absolutely sure you're drunk first. or, you may go insane. particularly if you're a college film student.<br /><br />cheers.
