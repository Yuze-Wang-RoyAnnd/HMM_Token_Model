meh, sums it all up for me really. boring story, bland dialogue, dull action scenes (how do you make something like a fight or a shootout boring? do you actually have to try to do that?), no real characters etc. just dull. snipes is a gifted actor and physical performer but none of this has come to the surface in any of his dtv work, when the opportunity is there to give the audience a much more superior product than they are used to. imagine a decent script with a few solid characters that you care about and some damn explosive action, fights, shootouts, etc. how can it be that hard to handle? my personal opinion is that the primary players in the productions simply do not care. there is no evidence of enthusiasm for what they are doing. look at snipes in the first 2 blades, passenger 57, rising sun, new jack city, demolition man etc? awesome, intense performances complemented by decent (if not always outstanding) scripts, good supporting casts and wicked action.<br /><br />none of that is evident in any of these releases so far which is a tremendous shame. the distributors slap wesley's face on the cover, knowing the audience will lap them up as they haven't realised yet that they haven't seen him in theatres for nearly 2 years.<br /><br />i'd love to see snipes work with somebody like isaac florentine who really knows how to make the most out of a dtv production, and work with alpha stunts who are simply some of the best action guys out there. together they would all make an awesome team and a snipes action vehicle we would all be proud of seeing.<br /><br />detonator sucks. it's not as bad as the marksman, which chews, but it still really sucks.
