the first review i saw of this on imdb says that vince vaughn is a much better actor than anthony perkins was in this role. makes me wonder if he saw the original. it's tough to review psycho if you don't have the perspective of how revolutionary the movie was in 1960. you have a heroine who isn't very likable and is killed not far into the movie and a villain who is creepy, but makes you feel for him. add to that some graphic violence and you have a blue print for some of the slasher films of the 80s and 90s.<br /><br />where does this film go wrong? let's start with casting. anne heche is fine as a vivian crane, but as norman bates, vince vaughn is all wrong. for one thing, he looks far too young. secondly, he has no idea how to play the roll. his nervous laugh reminds me of ron howard trying to play a tough guy on happy days. everything he does screams i did it! the original movie, even to those who know everything about it, still makes you feel uneasy about the influence of mother on norman, and turns her into a real separate character. how about the shower scene. when i finally saw the 1960 movie on a big screen, i was surprised at its power to scare the heck out of me. bernard herrman's score becomes incredibly shrill and loud and goes further toward scaring you than danny elfman's synth interpretations during the scene. this shower scene merely serves to show us anne heche's naked body and some nice color blood. which brings us to the choice to film in color. didn't work.<br /><br />there is something about remaking classic films that hardly ever seems to work. some may see this as a noble experiment, but honestly, if gus van sant had nothing to add to this film, he should have left it alone
