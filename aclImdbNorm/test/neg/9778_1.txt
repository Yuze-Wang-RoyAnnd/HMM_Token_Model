i wasted 5 dollars renting this complete piece of crap. dr. zack is the most unlovable lead character i have ever seen. the movie was full of every cliche you could ever think of and contained not a single ounce of originality. there was the typical sexism portrayed by rugged foreigners, all the guys had those 'too-proud to take advice' attitudes that are as stale as grandma's christmas fruitcake. the concept and deaths were really cool, but they lose all novelty once the monster is revealed. (read the spoiler at the end) nothing else is really revealed though, the ending is the biggest cop-out you've ever seen. i predicted everything before it happened, including who would die and how. the dialogue is lacking, and that's an understatement by far. there's mostly just random yelling, thoughtful staring, and chunky sentences. the actors are just god awful! i don't want to talk about this movie anymore, it's making me angry. i just wonder if the director even watched it when it was done.<br /><br />(spoiler alert!!!! save 5 dollars!) the monster is just a bunch of ants that "evolved" so now they need bones so they can move around, (nevermind the fact that this serves no evolutionary advantage whatsoever, and that the ants just killed whoever was available, though the movie acts like they kill out of necessity. this movie made me dumber.) the end consists of the lead idiot killing the mother ant (a big blob thing) which destroys all the other ants. pretty cliche eh? he almost wusses out at the end because of a sudden emotional attachment to the mother-thing that overcomes him. give me a break.
