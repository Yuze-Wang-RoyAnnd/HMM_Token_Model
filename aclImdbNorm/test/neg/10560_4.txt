as a professional poker dealer for over 25 years i found this movie very hard to watch. too unreal. it seems the producers of this movie either had done little or no research or just didn't care. the card tricks are something you never would see performed in a real poker game. common sense right? plus it was full of film cuts and such during the tricks. who couldn't do that? the cheating was amateur stuff. palming, marked cards, etc. would you sit in a high limit game where they use opened deck cards? would you sit in a game where the players push their chips into the middle of a pot (constantly), mixing them in then just verbalizing how much they bet? c'mon ! i gave it a 4 because the twists and turns might be interesting to some people but for those who know how to play the game it will be pretty painful. next time they should use real players and get some insight on how to do it right. ouch!!!
