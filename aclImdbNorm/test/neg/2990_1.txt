bad, ambient sound. lots of shuffling. loooong pointless scenes. eg: guy sees interesting woman in lobby. manages to stay there and watch her under the guise of waiting for the building supervisor to get a package. says nothing. stares creepily. more shuffling and other irritating ambient noise. wait. wait. wait. guy says nothing. woman looks frightened or at least slightly disturbed about it and rightly so. manager comes back with package. guy goes up to the apartment with the package.<br /><br />another example: the guy and his host sit around watching bad tv. more ambient noise and shuffling. wait wait wait wait. guy wanders off to bed. if you can stand to sit through any more of this movie, you get to watch them watch tv again later.<br /><br />if you want a story, any dialogue, entertainment, or a well crafted film, look elsewhere.
