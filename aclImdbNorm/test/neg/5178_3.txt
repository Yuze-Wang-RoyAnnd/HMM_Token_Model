this movie could have been great. it is not in my opinion. the storyline is fragmented, the editor appears not to be able to choose between a guy ritchie-style of storytelling and a more straightforward one. there is a great emphasis on excessive violence, including torture. too much so if you ask me. the characters are very shallow and stereo-typed, i would have liked to see more depth there. it is hard to identify with the main character. as a result the movie remains shallow as a whole.<br /><br />the movie says it gives the spectator an inside view of the british criminal underclass, more in particular the essex underclass. football-hooligans, steroids, cocaine, heroine and violence, lots and lots of violence. violence resulting from paranoia and fear in general. in this movie no-one seems to use his (or her) brain, we're looking at a bunch of animals in clothes. like i said, there is not much of a plot and the storytelling leaves a lot to be desired. <br /><br />if you're a male below 30, like gore and hardcore violence and think that's entertaining, than this is a movie for you. if you're looking for a movie portraying real people with a well developed storyline, suspense and depth, well... you can skip this one.
