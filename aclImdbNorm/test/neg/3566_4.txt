surprisingly kieslowski's this movie is disappointing to me because of the sometimes weird and sometimes clich'e script that also seems a work of a poor observation sometimes. there is an isolated young boy. he lives with one of his relatives, but he is lonely and every night watches a woman who lives across their building. it seems! that he wants her. he is one of the youths who are not good at communication with the opposite sex. however, he likes that woman, when the woman comes to his house with a man, tomek gets pain. then, we understand that kieslowski tells us a story about an isolated young boy who needs a female to flirt or who falls in love with a mature woman. he does not do something else, because may be he knows that it is his salvation. one day, he stops that woman, suddenly, he seems a shy boy, but proves that he is not, so he explains her almost everything. she lectures and refuses him. everything is so realistic like the other kieslowski films, no problem. the problems start when tomek visits her, the story of a lonely young boy who falls in love with a mature woman (but an unrequited love) turns into the story of a lonely young boy falls in love with a mature woman, at the beginnings the woman refuses, but after a short time, she starts to change her mind. this u-turn makes the movie clich'e firstly. the personality of tomek is weird? or a result of a poor observation? i disappointed with this character, this is my opinion and i will try to tell why. when he goes to her house, magda treats him very friendly. she asks what do you want from me? to kiss me? to make love with me? to go out with me? at this point, i remember the people who say she is a femme fatale. see? returning to the scene, tomek rejects all the proposals. why? because he is shy? i don't think so, but his communication is blunt, ok. after the leg scene at home, some events make the movie misses its aim. i think that the aim of the movie is (should have been according to the story) to show us there are some people who suffer from lack of endearment and to save from this situation is not easy owing to lack of communication and being aloof especially for men. i mean that at this point, what does the movie say? it is blurred and disappointing. it is seen that he is not hunger for love or a female or sex. then, what? and the suicide attempt scene support this weakness. so that he touches her legs, he wants to kill himself! by the way, as i mentioned before, some say magda is a femme fatale. totally not. she endeavors in order to make tomek happy. does she avoid having contact with him? no. does she insult him? no. does she amuse him? no. and does she deceive him? no. she has some troubles with her (ex) lover, so she is not o.k. however, she does not take revenge for it from tomek. she is not an angel, but not a femme fatale also.
