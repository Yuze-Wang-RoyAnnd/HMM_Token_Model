i'd give this film a 1/10. this film is devoid of common cinematic substance and concentrates way too much upon the current "skin trend" in bollywood movies. i'd definitely not recommend teenagers to watch this movie. what really makes me feel dejected is how could such an impressive banner like yash chopra films ever succumb to such an awful production? they have perhaps forgotten to keep in view that there is a larger audience than "adult" audience too, which when exposed to these sort of gross movies,may wreck their growing mind set and succumb to things devoid of sense and recognition.<br /><br />on the whole, films must not only be entertaining, but also must comprise of some sense as well. certainly, this film is an immense disappointment to yash chopra fans, especially me myself. i am really disappointed over the plot, acting and everything else. why can't people put in some substance that can be cherished after confronted with in the films, at least for once throughout the film? the point is clear. i'd like to put my opinion in short: "horrible - disappointment - lot of adult material - lack of sensible "substance" - lack of normal psyche - worthless - could grab a cornetto or a temptations chocolate instead"
