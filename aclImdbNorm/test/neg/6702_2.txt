i'm assuming the filmmakers heart was in the right place but, frankly, this movie is truly unconscionable. i was offended by the tone and the total cop out ending. you cannot take issues like this so lightly! without knowing the final caveat of the movie... we watch as a guy guns down his 9 month pregnant wife and two sons and are supposed to follow him for the next 2+ hours as he tries to establish a new life?? you cannot have sympathy for a character who does this. cannot! not to mention, we're given nothing until the last say 1/2 hour of this unnecessarily long movie, as to why this guy is suffering so much. no flashbacks, no sudden reactions to noise or movement - stuff that real vets are suffering from. all we know is he has a pain in the ass wife and can't financially take care of her and his 3 kids. there really didn't seem to be any research whatsoever into what current iraq vets are going through.<br /><br />additionally, the movie suffers tremendously from a heavy handed and totally inappropriate score. its a catastrophe. it is truly harmful to some actually good acting on the part of the male lead and at times joe morton. it foreshadows everything you're supposed to feel, and sometimes gives you the wrong clues entirely! again, this was a brutal thing this guy did, and so seeing him get a new job, meet a new blonde, struggle behind the counter making toast is not appropriate! and really, the ending? what a freakin cop out! how dare you.<br /><br />there are far richer films dealing with the affects of war on returning soldiers, please don't bother with this one.
