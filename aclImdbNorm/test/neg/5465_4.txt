book of revelations starts very well. daniel, an egomaniac dancer is kidnapped, abused and sexually raped by three masked women.<br /><br />after that, nothing else really happens. there is some hint of rediscovery but the movie gives nor explanation nor a real ending. daniel reactions after the abuse are very basic. he quits dancing, has sex with every women around and finally starting a relation with very simple and common woman.<br /><br />i have seen a good share of art-house movies but this has something missing in it.<br /><br />the main leads are fine; but some characters does not seems to be completely defined.
