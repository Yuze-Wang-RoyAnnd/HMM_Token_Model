woody allen (who i have to confess at the outset i have never been a big fan of) directed this quasi-documentary about the life of emmett ray (sean penn), a 1930's jazz guitarist whose star apparently shone for a while, then quickly faded. penn does a credible job in the role, portraying a complicated and somewhat neurotic man (not unlike allen himself, which perhaps explains why woody would be attracted to this project) who can't maintain relationships, and whose twin passions (aside from guitar playing) were shooting rats at the dump and watching trains.<br /><br />there isn't a great deal of consistency to the story. it's narrated in a sense by a series of modern-day jazz "experts" (one of whom is allen himself), who relate their various theories and interpretations of different events in ray's life. the end result is a wildly inconsistent account of the life of a fictional man who seems to have been given a fairly interesting life story by his creators, who probably should have done a better job with it. <br /><br />jazz fans and fans of woody allen will probably enjoy this. as for me? the best i can give it is a 3/10.
