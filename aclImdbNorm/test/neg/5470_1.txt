low budget junk about bloodthirsty cultists in greece headed by peter cushing. its up to priest donald pleasance to stop them. crown international released this crap in 1978, and it was "dog-of-the-week" on one of the episodes of sneak previews with gene siskel and roger ebert. i forget which of the two "dogged" it, but i see the point. crappy movie has the worst peter cushing and donald pleasance performances i've ever seen. there is a monster on the video box. no such beast exists in the movie. instead you get a statue, but at least its atonomically correct. (woo hoo!)<br /><br />the cultists look like the klu klux klowns...if a group could exist. skip it.
