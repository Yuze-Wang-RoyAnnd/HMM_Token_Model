why is it that in the '50s and '60s, italians made so of the best movies, and then during the '70s and '80s, made nothing but zombie and cannibal movies? probably because art films didn't make any money. , the cannibal movie, unlike the zombie movie, which was created by americans and `exploited' by italians, is a purely italian creation, designed as a mondo exploitation showcase, and to make as much money as possible (no artistic integrity getting in the way here). eaten alive came during the cannibal movie heyday. the director, umberto lenzi, hadn't even hit his stride yet; his genre classic, cannibal ferox, was still a year away.<br /><br />in plotting similar to (read: ripped off from) ruggero deodato's seminal cannibal classic, cannibal holocaust, a woman (janet agren) receives word from the police that they've received a 8mm film from her sister. she's gone missing in africa, and it's suspected that the tribal ritual depicted on the film may have something to do with it. mel ferrer, as a professor of somethingoranother, tells her that a man named jonas (ivan rassimov) has started a jonestown-like cult in new guinea, and that's where the sister is. the woman hires a guide (robert kerman) to take her through the jungle to find the cult and her sister. and, wouldn't you know it, the jungle is full of cannibals. <br /><br />one sentence should sum it up: if you've seen on cannibal movie, you've seen them all, mostly because these films steal shamelessly from each other (lenzi copied cannibal holocaust to make this film, and retooled this to make cannibal ferox; deodato copied parts of this for hit and run). and because they all share the same material, they all feature the same traits: awful photography, boring scenery, terrible dubbing, overacting, and exploitation, exploitation, exploitation. genre fans will have a ball since everyone in it is a genre veteran. rassimov and kerman have a scenery eating contest. agren exists solely to be naked, raped, or in peril. plenty o' gore for all the sickos out there. the cannibals, who do actually appear to be native cannibals, eat lunch met disguised as human flesh. and, in the grand tradition of cannibal movies, any live animal shown onscreen is usually killed shortly thereafter. overall, really not a good experience, but i'm sure there are psychopaths out there who find this excrement entertaining. i know i did.
