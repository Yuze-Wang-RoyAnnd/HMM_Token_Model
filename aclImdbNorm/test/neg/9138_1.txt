i've seen all 3 now. i just can't believe how bad naqoyqatsi is. not in comparison to the others, but simply on it's own merit, or lack of. <br /><br />i can't understand how the average rating for this movie is over 6 out of 10. i gave the first 2 movies 8 out of 10. they were thought provoking and beautifully done. i gave this movie a rating of 1. if a 0 or negative number was available, i would have given it that rating instead. what a total waste of time it was watching this movie. i thought after the first 30 minutes that i should turn it off, but then i figured that it was just a (very) slow starting movie. i thought the same thing after 45 minutes, then 1 hour, etc. then i realized that it wasn't going to get any better.<br /><br />it's very tedious to watch and without any redeeming qualities. don't take my word for it, watch it yourself. be sure to see the first two movies before this one. if you see this one first, i can just about guarantee that you'll never want to see the first two, but they are definitely much, much better than this "piece of work".<br /><br />the best part of the movie is when the credits role at the end. that's when your penance on this earth is complete and you can foregoe 89 minutes in purgatory, for the suffering that you've endured watching this "film". if god is truely merciful, he'll be more generous.
