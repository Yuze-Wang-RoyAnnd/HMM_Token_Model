for those that might send me nasty e-mails, shove it. there is a trend in hollywood where those that create overly-quirky movies are instantly impervious to criticism. garden state tends to be one of those movies. <br /><br />sure, zach braff, star of a rather overrated sitcom, surprises people with some talent behind the camera, but that doesn't warrant the kind of praise that a film like this has been receiving. the story is often times too thin and shallow to provide any real insight. people have compared this film to the graduate, but those type of people are the types that try to oversell independent cinema. indie films are subject to the same hit and miss mentality that typically hits the studio films, but people seemed to have forgotten that there are far more bad indie films than good ones. garden state isn't atrocious, but its isn't great.<br /><br />first off, the film is too quick, resulting in a rather fast reemergence of large into his former life. after ten years, people tend to act like he never left. where's the awkwardness? of course, the situation is always solved by a quick drug tasting scene (which i will say was portrayed rather accurately). the film seem to present a lot of emotional inequities, giving us the idea that the emotion will come up later in a more deeper and more well thought out way. however, it fails to deliver on those fronts, leaving us wondering why the journey to some of his decisions and moments were quickly resolved (like peter saarsgard's grave robbing tendencies). it wasn't completely abysmal, but maybe we should stop praising the film as something it isn't.
