this is a lame comedy.<br /><br />here's why: a man and wife sitcom. okay.<br /><br />the husband is a douche bag. the wife is the einstein.<br /><br />how original is that? <br /><br />jerry stiller is just the same guy on seinfeld.<br /><br />the gags are lame. no witty one-liners.<br /><br />i have had enough. stop this now.<br /><br />the last word: stupid. the destruction of the average white guy continues on abc. the worst part? kevin james is actually a funny comedian. he just isn't here. leah remini is great eye candy, but is unlikeable. wasted talent is the word. bad sitcom.
