its almost embarrassing to say i even saw this movie. i mean it doesn't take much to make a good zombie movie besides good special effects, lots of blood and gore, some scary moments and a decent plot. does house of the dead 2 do any of these things right? no, not one. of course, its not as bad as its predecessor, from uwe bowle and thats the only thing about this movie that scares me.<br /><br />the dialog in this movie is notorious, with such lines as "what do you do for a living?" in response "i kill zombies" and "i was never a disk jockey, i was a soldier." the special effects are embarrassing even for a made for tv movie, i mean seriously, the zombies all look like they have bloody lips are hyped up on crack. the army base in this movie, is a parking garage, with a desk and a open gated room. this movie is so low budget that they couldn't even get co-ed locker rooms. in fact it seems like this entire movie was filmed in a middle school.<br /><br />also, why is it that the all the female soldiers in this movie are models? and for that matter why is everyone in this movie so clueless at to what is going on that they simply just stand around letting the zombies kill them. heck one guy even trys to give food to the zombie.<br /><br />overall, this movie makes even the worst of scifi channel movies looks fantastic.
