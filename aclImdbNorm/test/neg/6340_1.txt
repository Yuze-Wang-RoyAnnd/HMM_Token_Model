it is sad to have to say that a film is truly awful and one tries to find ways around saying this. however, this is a dreadful film. gene hackman wastes time (and one suspects, many dollars) on re-playing his most famous, and oft recreated, role as "gene hackman". otherwise, television actors are given the chance to become film stars, and successfully, resist the temptation. patrick swayze has a minor part and went on to greater things, for which he must be eternally thankful.<br /><br />i watched this film, as a result of someone else's review and i felt that another point of view was merited. you may not agree with my review but now, at least, you have been warned.
