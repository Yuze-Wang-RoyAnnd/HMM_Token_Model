george segal lives with his elderly and senile mother. there are many jokes about her alzheimer's-like dementia and most of them aren't funny, though there were a few funny moments sprinkled in here and there (such as the nude running through the park scene and the old folks home). at first, segal tries to kill his mother because she's tough to live with and because he's a selfish guy. making the film sort of like a wiley coyote versus the roadrunner comedy where he tries again and again to kill this indestructible gal would have been a hoot--too bad this was not the overall tone of the film.<br /><br />i do applaud carl reiner's attempt to make a tasteless film that is intended to offend everyone. i have a special place in my heart for films like ed and his dead mother, eating raoul and happiness of the katakuris--all films about death that dare to offend. the problem here, though, is that where's poppa? has some funny moments, but it also has a lot of flat ones and the overall product is amazingly bland. plus topics such as homosexual rape, incest and the like are really difficult to make funny. i read in "the rough guide to cult movies" that it is considered a cult film, though i just can't see anyone wanting to see this more than once.
