for all the cast and crew who worked on this excuse for a movie, another payday in l.a. for any audience hoping for a fair return for the price of admission, a huge waste of time and money. the saddest aspect of this ugly exercise (to me) is that we are watching an extremely talented actor, pacino, seemingly playing a parody of himself. that's what remained with me as a total mystery. i can fully understand the need for movie industry people to work and thus make a living. what i fail to comprehend is an artist of al pacino's talent prostituting and embarrassing himself with this level of mindless junk. hopefully he'll choose projects of better value in the future...and for value, save your time and hard earned money. skip this!! let's send hollywood and al a message.
