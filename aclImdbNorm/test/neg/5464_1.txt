well it certainly stunned me - i can not believe that someone made another australian film that's even more boring than somersault. the story is implausible, the characters, with the exception of friels' and mailman's characters, are unlikeable and wooden, tom long possesses a vast array of facial expressions: happy and not happy, and the "sex scenes", which could have been very confronting and disturbingly erotic, would have been at home in a low-budget porno flick.<br /><br />this is the first movie i have seen in 30 years of cinema-going that has had me on the edge of my seat....ready to get up and leave.<br /><br />the best thing about this movie is the promotional poster.
