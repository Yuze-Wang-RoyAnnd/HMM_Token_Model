i am a big fan of deepa mehta's work, especially fire and earth 1947. unfortunately, this movie of hers lacks _all_ that is needed for a good film.<br /><br />the movie attempts to showcase the plight of the widows in india in the early 20th century and the new wave of ideas of their rehabilitation around the same time. shown with a child widow as a central character, although the plot too banal from an indian standpoint, it could still have been a very powerful movie. alas! the movie lacked both the sensitivity of fire and the intensity of emotion in earth 1947.<br /><br />even if one assumes that the story is a given, although there are hundreds of things i would have liked different in that as well, the movie making is especially unfortunate. everything is said. everything is shown straight. absence of sensitive implied sentences. absence of things left unsaid. i just couldn't believe that this was a deepa mehta film.<br /><br />there were some very standard hindi movie characters - like an old widow with her own vested interests, or a father who has double standards of the highest quality. can one not write a script without having these old-style standard indian movie characters?<br /><br />many people acclaimed deepa for making a movie and proving a point against hindu fundamentalists. well, i agree that she took a bold step, but should one not worry about the quality of movie, or is it being a controversial one an end in itself? its obvious, that if you start with a story as in water, you will end up feeling the pain of the widows in consideration --- it doesn't take an accomplished director to achieve that. and the movie had nothing more than that!! so where is deepa's contribution to the film?<br /><br />and talk about acting etc. - pathetic!!! lisa ray has a pretty face, an extremely pretty face - but thats where it ends. she can't speak hindi; she can't emote. john abraham is no better. most widows seem unnatural. the saving grace are seema biswas and the young girl. they are fabulous.<br /><br />and this was a period film - but the hindi dialogues suck big time. even there utterance is also as unnatural as it gets. no rustic accents!!! no local slangs. no nothing. the only thing right was probably the shooting locales. i thought that the set of the vidhwa-ashram was reasonably real. the overall blue tinge in the whole movie is also apt.<br /><br />but all and all, don't watch this movie. you _won't_ get anything. there is nothing in the story, or direction. if you have to watch it watch it for the little girl's acting.
