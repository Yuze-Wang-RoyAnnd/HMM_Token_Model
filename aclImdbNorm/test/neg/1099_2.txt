this starts off in pennsylvania in 1913. a bunch of kids are killed in a mine explosion purposely set off by the mine's owner. cut to 2006. recently widowed karen (lori heuring), her teenage daughter sarah (scout taylor-compton) and little girl emma (chloe moretz) move to a remote house located near that mine. what they don't know is the ghosts of the little kids haunt the woods and kill anyone who's around after dark.<br /><br />slow and boring "horror" movie. the premise is obvious and has been done to death already. also there are huge gaps in logic in the story. it's never made clear why these kids just kill anybody or why they eat the bodies afterwards (yes--it's shown). they're dead already--why do they need food? and why haven't they gotten the main villain in the story long before? he was around the area. why pick this time to attack him? also the characters aren't the least bit likable. sarah comes across the worst. it has a few saving graces. the location is beautiful and eerie at the same time, some of the killings were very bloody and brutal and the kids themselves looked spooky silently walking through the woods at night. but, all in all, i was bored and fighting to stay awake. you can skip this one.
