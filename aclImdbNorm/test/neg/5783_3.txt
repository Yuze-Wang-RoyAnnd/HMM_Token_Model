i'm a fan of good, plausible, action movies. and i'm a huge fan of the elite military units such as the navy seals. finally, i'm a huge fan of michael biehn. sadly none of those allowed me to really enjoy this movie at the time. i gave it another chance more recently when i bought the dvd. here's the problems with this movie in a quick list: 1. it's a poor mans top gun, for example including a virtual music video of the seal team playing golf with a soundtrack of "the boys are back in town", which concludes with charlie sheen doing an inane chase to get his towed car back.<br /><br />2. this is quite simply a charlie sheen movie, when sheen was trying to be famous before he started doing stuff like hot shots. reports i've heard indicate that sheen was a baby on the set and it affected the roles and direction the rest of the actors in the movie got.<br /><br />3. biehn is the head of the seal team yet sheen seldom obeys him. any seal showing the lack of discipline that sheen's character does, or who endangered the team as he does, wouldn't even have made it through buds training let alone gotten on a team.<br /><br />4. seals are cross trained on weapons. yet in one part of the movie a seal has to "figure out" how to use a u.s. stinger missile.<br /><br />there are a few good scenes in the movie. the assault entry at the beginning, bill paxton as "god", and some of the footage in what was supposed to be beirut at the time. overall though this movie is a loser.
