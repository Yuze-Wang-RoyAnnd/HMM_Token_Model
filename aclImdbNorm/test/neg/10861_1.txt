this is my first "awful" rating ever on imdb and i couldn't think of a more deserving film to honor it with. i hoped for entertaining trash and found trash of the saddest, dullest kind. i found a film which no one can possibly have cared a bit about, including its creator.<br /><br />"hell ride", directed, written by and starring larry "friend of qt" bishop, has a simple plot about a hidden treasure and a trio of keys, two bands of bikers and a gruesome murder in 1976 which has yet to be avenged. larry seems fiercely determined not to tell this story, focusing instead of putting his swaying, strangely grimacing main character into situations where he can fondle women who pretend to like it. he also has a dialog containing enough horrible fire puns/metaphors to put one off the word "fire" for life.<br /><br />dennis hopper escapes complete humiliation, others are not so lucky. sometimes they hit the road on their bikes, making one feel even more sorry for michael madsen, since his high handles seems to add insult to the injury of having to appear in this film. there is plenty of silicon-enhanced nudity, but fairly little action and no humor whatsoever, making one wonder just what kind of an audience they had in mind.<br /><br />my guess is that most people who watch this film, including fans of trashy 60s biker movies, will feel cheated. do yourself a favor and revisit the real stuff instead.
