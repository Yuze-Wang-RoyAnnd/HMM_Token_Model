the salena incident is set in arizona where six death row inmates are being transfered from the state prison for reasons never explained, while driving along the heavily armed prison bus gets a flat & the driver is forced to pull off the road. then two blonde birds turn up & after seducing the incompetent prison guards manage to get the better of them, the six prisoners are released but in a shoot-out their getaway car is damaged leaving them all stranded in the middle of the arizona desert. they decide to head to the nearest town, salena several miles away & take the cops with them as hostage. once they reach salena they find it odd that the place is completely deserted with not one single other person in sight. they soon discover that the entire town has been killed by flesh eating aliens & they are firmly placed on the menu...<br /><br />also known as alien invasion arizona in the us on dvd & apparently having the working title terror town this rubbishy low budget sci-fi horror flick was co-written, co-produced & directed by dustin rikert & has no real redeeming features at all, to be frank the salena incident is the sort of film which gives films a bad name. the film could roughly be divided into two parts, the opening forty or fifty odd minutes focuses on the prisoners in a thriller feeling opening, the guards & the escape although it's pretty poorly written & staged stuff. the dialogue between the two blonde birds & the prison guards is so bad it's unintentionally funny as the two fit birds chat up the two not so fit prison guards. funny stuff actually, unfortunately the salena incident is supposed to be a sci-fi horror film not a comedy. then once the escaped cons & their prison guard hostages arrive at salena it goes into sci-fi horror mode as the aliens turn up & start killing our clich'ed character's off which is good because they are annoying. look, the whole film sucks as it's badly written, thought out & made. i can't really be bothered to go into why but trust me the salena incident is awful on every level.<br /><br />as well as being just a bad, boring & stupid film the salena incident is also poorly made. the action set-piece scenes are awful, the aliens looks terrible & are never shown on screen at the same time as the human character's & as such it's sometimes difficult to tell what's happening. the special effects are poor too, the aliens look rubbish & the cgi computer effects are absolutely terrible as well. the editing is poor, the cinematography is poor, the sets are cheap & the whole thing is just an eyesore really. there's a bit of gore, there's some gunshot wounds, someone is ripped in half & a severed hand is seen.<br /><br />obviously shot on a low budget the salena incident has low production values & looks cheap from start to finish. filmed in superior in arizona. the acting is terrible from no-one i have ever heard of although the actress who plays the female doctor is pretty good looking.<br /><br />the salena incident is a rubbish sci-fi horror film that is terrible in just about every way, not worth 90 minutes of yours, mine or anyone else's time.
