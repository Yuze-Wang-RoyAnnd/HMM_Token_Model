joseph conrad's novel, heart of darkness, had a vivid sense of description that made this book astonishing. when reading this book i had every scene totally drawn out in my head and i knew what every character looked like. this book had many pieces and when i finished reading this book it seemed as the puzzle had been completed. after i finished reading heat of darkness, i watched the movie, which was a mistake. the movie cut out so many substantial parts. for example, in the novel marlow waited a very long time for the rivets to come for him to fix his boat. this was a big source of futility. in the movie that part was just left out. the movie added more parts that were useless and made no sense. for example, when kurtz was talking to marlow at the end of the book and kurtz snapped the monkey's neck and killed him. what purpose did that scene have, other than to make the audience feel sorry for the monkey? it's as if the script writer didn't even read the whole book and just put the parts that he read in the movie. if i had not read the novel before i had watched the movie i would have been thoroughly confused. the book was amazing and it is truly a classic in american literature, but the movie could have defiantly been nominated for the worst picture in the razzie awards.
