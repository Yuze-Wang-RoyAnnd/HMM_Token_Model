'r xmas is one of the only films i've seen where i can almost say that simply nothing happens.i felt as though i watched a drug dealing middle- class couple,with child,walk around,eat,smoke,converse(excuse me,swear)through most of the film.and i don't believe i'm missing the point.i think this film was well directed,well acted(although the husband's performance was rather wooden),and the constant feeling of impending doom around every corner certainly kept the viewer involved.but when the dust clears,your left with zero(just a boat-load of fade outs).i didn't want car chases,gun violence,beatings,etc.in fact,i'm sick of violence.but my goodness,let's at least get a bit deeper into all these characters(let's get to know each of these corrupt officers a little better-not just show glancing shots of them as street thugs).why was the dialogue so juvenile? everyone spoke as if they were in junior high.i believe even this side of our human race can say something other than fu_ _,sh_ _,etc.the pacing and the storyline of 'r xmas i found quite interesting,but the execution was plain and simple-empty.4/10
