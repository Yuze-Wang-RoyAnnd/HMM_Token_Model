i wish i would have read more reviews and more opinions about this movie before i rented it. a waste of money. a waste of time. very little dialog. the dialog was hard to understand in every way. the storyline and plot were both weak. the only thing that was nice at all was the cinematography.<br /><br />the characters were interesting. at the same time you will spend so much time trying to figure things out, because of the lack of dialog, that you will be rewinding the movie a lot. <br /><br />do not watch this movie. it was a mess and will leave you feeling like a mess.<br /><br />you will say, what the heck was that, when the movie ends?
