pinocchio's revenge is not a good movie. nor is it terrible.<br /><br />the acting was wooden at least on pinocchio's part.the puppet had all of 2 expressions.as did most of the actors,except strangely enough...the secondary characters...most of them were enjoyable over the top.<br /><br />the special effects in this are pretty "b" and as i said earlier the puppet really blew.<br /><br />the 2 best scenes in the movie are the knife through the hand...looked pretty good,i think they spent about a 1/3 of the budget on that...and the shower scene...wow...i think they must have spent the other 2/3rds of the budget on talking the actress who did that scene to do it.outstanding.<br /><br />seriously this is a slightly below average "b" horror puppet movie...rent chucky if you have a urge to see puppets kill.<br /><br />the story had a few interesting idea's, enough to keep me watching it to the end.
