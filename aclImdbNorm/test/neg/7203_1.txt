i rented this movie under the impression that it was "scarecrow 3:dark harvest", thinking it was a continuation in the scarecrow slayer series (another extremely laughable and all together awful series of movies). i wasn't disappointed though. it was just as awful, if not worse, than what i expected. i was laughing throughout the entire movie. every piece of bad acting, poorly shot and cut footage, and terrible special effects is what makes this movie worth renting.<br /><br />the special features include a pathetic view into the cast and crew's six months of filming.<br /><br />favorite line, "the sins of my forefathers! they've trickled down to this very moment of time!"
