well let's be fair. following up a cult classic like road house is no easy task. now subtract swayze from the equation and you get a monumental task. so with patrick not on board whose bonehead idea was it to proceed anyway and make this piece of garbage? i am going to blame the director who didn't even provide 5 minutes of decent footage throughout the entire film. i was actually shocked they got will patton (armaggedon) to jump on board. johnathon schaech did an ok job with the lead but the writing was atrocious. turning down his partner brunette bombshell (crystal mantecon) in the film's first 5 minutes made me want to eject it right there. but i stuck with the film hoping to catch a glimpse of that great cheesy humor that worked so well with the double duece. no such luck. the cover of the dvd is hilarious, they show these two stacked blondes who make one 10 second appearance in the film. costar ellen hollman actually puts in a decent performance as well. but again the effort is futile in a piece of garbage and disgrace such as this. has jake busey ever been cast in a decent film? could they not pull at least a few actors in from the first film for some kind of nostalgia treatment? even one of the old bouncers or two, or jeff healey for a performance would have been nice. take this film out of your queue immediately. -lostflix
