i have watched this movie on and off since it started playing about 1 hour ago, and i have to say, thats an hour of my life i wasted and will not be getting back, the acting is crap and the scripts need a serious look at, and whoever wrote them needs to be slapped, perhaps the tv will explode and put me out of my misery..... the only good thing about this movie is that for guys and girls it has some good eye candy in it, though, most of which i wish would disappear, as far as the movie is concerned, the special effects as sh*t, dante? who thinks a guy dressed in skin tight leather pants and half a leather jacket is scary, he looks more feminine than most of the women in this movie, the voice of dante is pathetic, nobody finds it threatening or scary at all..... please tv i beg you to blow up!!!!!!!!!!
