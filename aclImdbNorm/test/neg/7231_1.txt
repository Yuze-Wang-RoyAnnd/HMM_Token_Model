just finished watching this one after getting sick of getting ready for the michigan bar exam. i wanted something that was mindless and that i could just sit back and say, "what the hell were they thinking?" i was not disappointed in this undertaking, but had i been watching this one in a serious mood, i would have been irate. the company that made this thing just spliced cgi footage from the first octopus and added a little footage with a fake octopus that makes the one used in "bride of the monster" look like a masterpiece of special effect footage. since when does an octopus have fangs? the plot is that an nypd diver is investigating some murders/disappearances on the hudson river shortly before the fourth of july. he and his partner (who is soon to be transferred, or soon to be munched on by a fig bucking octopus) investigate in a rather inept manner (all the while believing that a huge octopus will kill people) and are occasionally accompanied by a female lackey from the mayor's office. of course on one believes that an octopus can get that big until the thing attacks the cop and the girl from the mayor's office. surprisingly, all hell doesn't break loose and only a few cops and a few more civilians are killed.<br /><br />really lame. don't bother with it.
