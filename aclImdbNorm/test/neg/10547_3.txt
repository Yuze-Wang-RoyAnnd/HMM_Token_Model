this is the worst of the toxie series by far. the acting in tokyo is horrible and you can understand them about half the time. the major problem with this film is all the sudden changes from the original. like there's a different girl friend of toxie's in this one or it might be the same character just with a different name and played by a different chick. why is this film made like a disney movie. after about fifteen minutes it starts getting good with the gore and all. there's 2 awesome killings then the movie goes straight to poop. after the films 20 minutes are up the film is bearly entertainment. h*ll it's bearly watchable. well unless your drunk then don't watch this film. you've been warned.
