despite a small handful of nicely executed scenes, this entry (the fourth) feels tired. toshiharu ikeda, who directed the superb mermaid legend and the seminal japanese splatter film, evil dead trap, shows little enthusiasm for the stale premise.<br /><br />a miscreant becomes obsessed with an outwardly conservative woman who reluctantly appeared in a porno photo shoot. predictable stalking, harassing, assault and rape ensues.<br /><br />the staple of roman porno is sex. and sex mixed with violence. both potentially exciting subjects, to be sure, but not when so little effort is made to make them fresh. a masturbation scene in which a woman forces pencils up her opening (via condom) is too little kink to late.<br /><br />the series' rain motif continues and the film's final scene brings relief.
