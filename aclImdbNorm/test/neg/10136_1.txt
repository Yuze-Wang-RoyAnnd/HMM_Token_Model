oh f*cking hell, where should i start... first of all; this show is just another stupid american non-funny so called comedy which has pathetic acting and very very poor humor. the american way of laughing-track business makes the whole thing even worse. how come i can hear laughter, yet there's nothing funny happening? pretty stupid, eh? this show is only for those american people who haven't ever heard that there are far more funnier, better and wittier comedies - not only in great brittain, but also in america (the simpsons for example). i simply can't understand what is so good about "reba" that it has lasted for long a while in television. it has nothing new to offer, it underestimates the (possible) viewers in so many ways and it simply isn't funny at all. i could have lived with the fact that there are so bad shows as "reba", but why the hell they had to run it here in finland. if i see few seconds of this horrible show the rest of the day is ruined for me. take my word and believe me - this show sucks ass even more than these kind of american "comedies" usually does. this is simply horrible. do yourself a favor; don't ever watch this peace of sh*t. <br /><br />well i leave the commenting for those who now this language better. thanks for your (possible) interest.
