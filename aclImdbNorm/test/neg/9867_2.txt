this is truly awful, the feeblest attempt at a comics adaptation ever committed to film. every possible thing about this movie that could be bad, is. music, acting, lighting, sets, "special" effects... about the only positives i can find are that sue looks cute in her blue tights and that the thing make-up is almost passable (face only). that's it. zip. don't bother tracking down that bootleg copy; it's really not worth your time. even the aborted "captain america" movie from the early 90's is far less excruciating than squirming in your seat while you try to endure this mess.
