i know my summary sounds very harsh, but this film has very limited appeal. the average joe out there would have a hard time sticking with this film. the entire film consists of animated loggers doing their jobs and dancing on floating logs. this is all done with very splashy and artsy colors and the film might be great to show to patrons in an art museum. however, unless you really love this sort of art or are a canadian who loves films about your native land, then this is probably going to be next to impossible to finish. i have a rather high tolerance for this sort of thing and even i had to force myself to watch after a couple minutes. i can respect the work that went into it, but it's just not compelling.
