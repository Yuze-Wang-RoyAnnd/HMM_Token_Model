first of all, i think the casting and acting were excellent. the problem is the story. there is basically no story here worth telling and thus basically no movie here. larry mcmurtry has done lonesome dove and i can't fault the original, though it probably didn't need sequels. he did hud with paul newman, which is one of my favorite movies. mellencamp is supposed to be a country singer, but the only song i hear him sing is an old buck owens song. the movie makes a big deal out of chicken farming. mellencamp's character has a good wife, and it's utterly stupid of him to stray from her. the incident with riding in the sliding cage is utterly stupid. maybe people do that for fun in some parts of the country, but i never heard of it.
