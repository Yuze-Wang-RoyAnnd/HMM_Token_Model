that welles said was that he's been in decline his whole career.<br /><br />there was an interesting story here. unfortunately, welles seemed completely incapable of telling it. instead, he was trying to tell a bunch of different stories, about elmyr, about clifford irving, about his pompous view of critics and experts, oh, yeah, and trying to jump start his current girlfriend's career by giving her unneeded screen time. (oja, honey, when they told you to sleep with the director, they didn't mean one washed up like a whale on a beach!) <br /><br />welles was probably trying to cash in with a bunch of footage of clifford irving as irving was becoming a household name with his role in the faked auto-biography of howard hughes. unfortunately, it means the subject of his film, elmyr, didn't get the time he deserved and he was probably the more interesting story.<br /><br />the great tragedy of orson welles was that he peaked early, and then spent the rest of his career sputtering, finally doing wine commercials and awful documentaries...
