i didn't have much high hopes for this one. before seeing it, the story yelled "stereotype" at me.<br /><br />i mean... come on! it's so stupid the plot line about the innocent android that realizes that the people who created him are immoral, then decides to change everything.<br /><br />i had to see it three times. the first two times i fell asleep because i was so incredibly bored by it. it's very rare that movies bore me so much i fall asleep during them. the third time i forced myself to watch it, simply to be able to warn people about it.<br /><br />i got the distinct impression that the people responsible for this mess had tried to take all the cool/neat things from other scifi/action movies, and put them together to make a kick-ass movie! they took the android/robot, lots of action, thin story, stereotype characters, and a big fight in the end and threw it together. unfortunately, the movie sucks. the acting is so wooden you could build a house out of it, the storyline/plot is absolutely laughable, the camerawork and editing is horrid, the direction is non-existent, and to top it all off, everything is so cliche and ridiculous that it just annoys the hell out of you.<br /><br />i was left with the feeling that i could've spent the time watching this one doing something much more creative, like trimming my fingernails, or watching the grass grow.
