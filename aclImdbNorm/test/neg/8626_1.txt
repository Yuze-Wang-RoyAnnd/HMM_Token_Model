i can't believe this movie has 6 stars on imdb. this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen that wasn't an episode of mystery science theater 3000. the plot is predictable. i couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters. the dialog is cheesy. several moments in the movie actually made me groan out loud (including kiefer southerland's crazy neighbor and the incredibly lame joke that ends the movie). jeff bridges' accent is goofy - i can't tell what country he's supposed to be from. it has to be one of the least thrilling thrillers i've ever seen as well...after sandra bullock's character disappears, absolutely nothing happens to advance the story for a good 45 minutes. i would give this movie a negative amount of stars if i could.
