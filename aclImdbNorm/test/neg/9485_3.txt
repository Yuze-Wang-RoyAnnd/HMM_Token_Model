i was once a big olsen fan. i received this movie when i was six and watched it almost nonstop until i was nine. then it lay on my shelf gathering dust until yesterday. i was left speechless.<br /><br />mary-kate and ashley play allie and mel, two twelve year olds who are sent to spend spring break in paris with their ambassador grandfather. along the way, they meet, as one might expect, two cute french boys who show them the more fun side to paris. i guess the two boys were okay, fake french accents aside. <br /><br />the plot is predictable and the humour is shallow and corny. mary-kate and ashley play two shallow girls with too much make up on their face. <br /><br />don't watch this movie if you're not into the olsen twins or family movies.
