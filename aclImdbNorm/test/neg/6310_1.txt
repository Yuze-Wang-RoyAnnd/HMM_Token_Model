i haven't seen this film in years, but the awful "taste" of quaid's performance still lingers on my tongue. some have commented on how quaid has jerry lee lewis "to a tee" but the fact is he only appears to have the most extreme stage jerry in mind. nobody acts that way all the time, and the performance comes off as hopelessly clownish, reducing lewis to a buffoonish caricature. the nuances of a man's life are lost in the rubble of sheer over-acting.<br /><br />the author of the book this is based on (nick tosches) is a good writer, who has written several fine musical bios (i particularly liked "dino" on dean martin); in the books tosches gives us a full human being, both separate from and involved in the "biz." quaid's acting seems to imply that jerry never acted like a human being. if people were like this, no one would bother to hang around them. as cartoons go, it is mildly amusing, but otherwise it is one of the most egregious, film-destroying performances i have had the "honor" of viewing. terrible...
