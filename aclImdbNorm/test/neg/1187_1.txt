this review took longer to write than i took to watch this film. it's just plain bad. the plot is terrible in comparison to the tv shows. it is flat, unfunny and boring.<br /><br />it is clear that the log ran out of ideas long before this film was green lit. viewers should read this as an example of not knowing when to stop.<br /><br />bad editing, bad music, bad acting. zero dynamism, zilch chemistry.<br /><br />a film that doesn't know what it is, made without any love to some mysterious end that leaves you depressed and feeling kind of angry that so much money was wasted.<br /><br />the log obviously were made an offer they couldn't refuse, or perhaps their egos have simply got the better of them. it's a bleak marketing push that perhaps would have been better when the log were fresher and more inspired.<br /><br />i however, did know when to stop, and did.<br /><br />please! someone try to convince me of this film's finer points!
