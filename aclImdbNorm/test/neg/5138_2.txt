forgettable pilot that never really explains why nostradamus is really important to the plot of this movie, but rob estes plays a a hunky cop who happens to be nostradamus for some reason and who battles time-travelling medieval monks that run around with guns and set people on fire to start the apocalypse. oh yeah, there's also a sexy fbi agent who happens to be a pyschic and is trying to get rob to believe everything before it's too late. too bad they couldn't predict a better plot. yawn.<br /><br />
