i really, really don't understand how that movie could get a rating bigger than 4 here on imdb. it's simply a huge mess, and i have to admit that i actually liked avp 1: close to no story, okay, i can live with that, but at least they got to the point pretty much at once. avp 2 does not. after the stupid premise has been presented there is well over half an hour of stupid and unfitting teenager clich'es, dumb as hell dialog and close to nothing else, except for a few alien scenes that feel like an excuse to have that first half of the movie and predator scenes that make you ask yourself whether those guys making the film even watched any other predator movie or just didn't care enough to be bothered.<br /><br />after that, that crap-fest finally gets to the point where the predator starts attacking the aliens, or at least pretends doing so. and boy, is that predator stupid, blind and deaf. it's awful. how he even managed to earn that stuff he has is beyond me. he misses with almost every shot, only notices aliens when they're right in his face or if it's absolutely necessary for the script, so that he can move where he has to be. he even gets caught on surprise by puny human teenagers and deputies all of the time. what's that guy supposed to be? after the first hour of that abomination i was more or less constantly shaking my head at every scene. close to no scene in this movie passes by without unbelievably stupid dialogs, stupid predator actions or stupid lack there-of or stupid actions from our "heroes".<br /><br />then, that thing finally ended. to my surprise not only me and my friends didn't know whether to laugh or to cry, but everybody i overheard leaving the room was half-crying, half-laughing about those 1 1/2 hours they just wasted.<br /><br />don't watch. never.
