so, you've seen the romero movies, yes? and you've seen jacob's ladder, right? and the later hellraiser movies? okay, now let's make a movie out of all three, only let's just jam everything together and make a whole big mess of it, sounds like a good idea?<br /><br />this movie is terrible. absolutely god-awful. yeah, it's an indie flick, who gives a crap? is that a pass to make filmic excrement? the film attempts to establish credibility by focusing on character interaction, that much is evident. unfortunately for the writers, they're not good at character interaction. this isn't night of the living dead; the characters are nonentities shouting their inane lines at each other in a vain attempt to be caught by the microphones on set. the dialogue is never interesting. for a movie that focuses so much on character interaction, you'd think the characters would have something more to say than "what are we going to do" "i don't know" "well we've got to do something" "well what are we going to do?" "i don't know." "we should leave." "let's just accept our fate." "no, we've got to leave." "well let's leave then." "no, maybe we should stay."<br /><br />this isn't exaggeration, there are exchanges in this film that reach that level of redundancy and inanity.<br /><br />the worst thing about this movie? half of it is a dream, and it really has zero purpose. nothing in the dream has any relevance to anything in the rest of the movie. the writers couldn't decide whether to make a zombie movie or a monster movie and so they just made both. it's patently ridiculous, the cheapest trick in the book, and it's maddeningly insulting, especially since i'm pretty sure they ripped off the idea from jacob's ladder, which handled the concept a hell of a lot more competently than these jokers could ever hope to do.<br /><br />and then there's the editing. years of watching mtv and playing horror-themed video games must have inspired the filmmakers, but it's surely a sad thing they didn't realize what made the choppy editing and obfuscation in those pieces of media effective in the first place. in this film, you will be confused often, and not in the good, david lynch way, but in the bad "wait i thought she just got killed, no? then who the hell was that? wait, who is that guy? where did he come from? how did they get here?" kind of way. it's constant and consistently bad.<br /><br />this movie is a laughable piece of trash and should only be sought out if you want to get trashed with a few friends and laugh at it.<br /><br />and as a final note: as for the "comedy" people in other reviews are talking about, it's all unintentional. there isn't a single intentional piece of comedy in this film. it's all supposed to be a big serious character study, because the filmmakers want to have credibility in their horror-concept. sadly, their pretensions don't match up to their ability.
