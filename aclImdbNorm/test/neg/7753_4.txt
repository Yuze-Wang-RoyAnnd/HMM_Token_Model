i bought the dvd to get julia ormond. well, i got that in spades. she was lovely in the romantic scenes; too bad bill paxton was flying on autopilot for the whole effort. i almost lost my lunch when he popped his big fat white behind out of his flight suit to shall we say 'engage' with julia.<br /><br />i realized julia was very proficient in french while watching her in 'sabrina'. i watched 'sabrina' with the french soundtrack to see if julia dubbed her own dialog. they used someone else. in any case, julia was chosen for this dutch film over a native french speaker with sufficient english to communicate with the american flier. perhaps they wanted at least one familiar name for the british/american market. to my unfamiliar eye, julia's features could pass for belgian.<br /><br />the whole film had an odd nature. it was a dutch film about belgium in world war 2. i would imagine that national pride would have required a theme of heroic dutch resistance to the german invaders. the belgians were much more passive during the occupation period than were the french or norwegians. the most savage fighting of all came in the balkans where tito's communist partisans gave the germans fits.<br /><br />i noted in another review that 'dbdumonteil' believed julia ormond to be an american instead of the actual british nationality. perhaps julia's acting skills were great enough to carry off that impression.<br /><br />after watching this film several times, it suddenly dawned on me how out of season, the film is. it is set on junuary 16, 1944 when the american plane crashes in belgian farm country. the trees look to be in mid-fall with lots of leaves and the weather is warm. people walk about in light clothing and the grass is still green. there is not the smallest trace of snow or ice. this must have been the mildest winter in belgium ever.<br /><br />the actual plot of the film was a mess. where to begin? for anyone interested in world war 2 history, the film came across as farce. the reconnaissance plane used was a huge 4-engine converted bomber. such aircraft did exist, but they would have required massive fighter escort to have any chance of survival. in reality, smaller and swifter aircraft were readily available and would have been far more suitable for the task. the vital code books in the film would never have been carried on the plane. the crew had no need of this information to complete their mission, while compromise of this information would have been a huge intelligence defeat. even given the premise of the film, the first items to be stripped from the aircraft would be the code books. they would have been on their way to berlin within 10 minutes of the arrival of german troops at the crash site.<br /><br />the daussois home, where 'major brice' took refuge was a farm where no one had the least interest in farming. food would have been very scarce in belgium at this time. the germans would have required substantial quantities of locally-produced food to support their forces. the family truck would have been expropriated long before the arrival of the american flier. there would not have been any fuel available to run it anyway.<br /><br />the plot twist where henri daussois turns in the american out of jealousy is pathetic. he would have had to reveal all he knew about the resistance in order to be allowed to live. he would have had to function as a double agent to frustrate any effective opposition. the woman with the secret radio would have never survived the war.<br /><br />'major brice' was caught in civilian clothing toward the end of the film. that made him a spy under the laws of war and liable for execution with no defense. he would not have meekly surrendered to face interrogation unhindered by the geneva convention. better to force them to kill him and spare his friends if possible.<br /><br />i have not read the novel upon which this film is based. if this film is a faithful adaption, it shows an abysmal lack of development in the novel. regardless of the novel, the screenwriters could easily have produced a superior script that would not waste this opportunity to deliver a much better film.
