there are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how i felt about this film so ill keep it short.<br /><br />"the grinch" i thought was marvellous - jim carrey is a truly talented, physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor (in my opinion). mike myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying. i used to like him very much in his "waynes world" and "so i married an axe murderer" days - but ive never been fond of austin powers and "the cat in the hat" has just finished me off. <br /><br />this film was horrible - the gags were horrible! inappropriate for children not only in adult content but in the fact that some of them were so dated they havent amused anyone for 50 years! the plot was messy, messy, messy! its a shame really because the children were very likeable as was "mom". they probably could have picked a better villain than alec baldwin - but he could have pulled it off if it weren't for myers ugly, revolting over-acted portrayal of the cat.<br /><br />i mean - did myers even glance at a script? was one written? the other actors seemed to have one - but the cat just seemed to be winging it!<br /><br />on the other hand i would like to mention that the sets and props were marvellous!!! but unfortunately they cant save this film.<br /><br />poor dr seuss - the man was a genius! dont ruin his reputation by adapting his work in a such a lazy, messy way!!!<br /><br />1/10
