i just finished reading forsyth's novel 'icon'. i thought it was one of the most in depth, detailed, and page-turning books i ever read, definitely in my top 10. i acquired a dvd version of the book starring mr. swayze. ok, let me first point out that to fit a decent adaptation of the novel into 2.5 hours film time would of been impossible, so i understand the teams reason to sway from the book version and differ. however, when i say "differ" what i really should say is "take the characters from the book, add a few, leave a few out, take away the book's plot, add a modern new plot, add frederick forsyth's name in there somewhere". im not saying this was a bad picture, far from it, some of the effects were top notch and the acting wasn't half bad. the story sucked and didn't rely on logic or reality. forsyth's novel was so good and real and altered the facts of reality instead of exaggerating them.. this could of been so much more if it had taken its time and been made into say a 10 part series. if you haven't read the book then expect a decent tv movie with a good acting cast, if you have read the book then try and forget it when watching this.
