this was a sordid and dreary mess. i needed a shower when it was over. it goes something like this- some socialites are murdered and a woman homicide detective is assigned to the case. she discovers that the victims belonged to an underground lesbian society, and she befriends an associate of the group who may have relevant information. since the detective is an attractive woman, of course she is horny and intrigued (which reveals much about hollywood and its psychosis about women). what's surprising is that none of this is very sexy or interesting, just depressing and yucky. ellen barkin gives a respectable performance as the lead detective, and julian sands provides unintentional laughs as a cross-dressing psychiatrist, which is why it escapes a one-star rating.
