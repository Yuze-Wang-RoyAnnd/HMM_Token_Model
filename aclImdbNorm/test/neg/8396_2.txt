i logged on here right after watching this movie, feeling that it was so awful that at least its reviews might be entertaining. but all you miscreants appear to kind of like it. and so, since i want the job done right...<br /><br />from the opening shot, the movie establishes its contempt for the audience's attention span by showing an entirely unremarkable picture of an irrelevant bridge for a long, long time. then it goes to some slow-motion skateboarding, which is at least a little bit cool, but then offsets that glimmer of excitement by overlaying the most repellent soundtrack song i've ever heard. some girl screeching in whispery french over what sounds like sheets of plywood banging together. whoever decided that needed to be there has never ridden a skateboard, i guarantee it. it seemed to be there to test the limits of the audience's patience.<br /><br />from there, the movie is about 50 per cent slow motion. you know what's worse than a gratuitous slow-motion shot? a gratuitous slow motion shot of *nothing happening.* here's a guy walking along a path. here's a guy sitting. here's a guy looking around. here's a guy looking at another guy. after a while i started watching the movie at double speed, bringing it back down whenever people appeared on screen engaging in actual dialog, which was rare. once, astonishingly, i slowed the movie to find out what a girl was saying, only to find that the camera was showing her talking, but the sound was another horrible, horrible song and her actual voice was not audible.<br /><br />this reminds me of some great advice i heard once about writing -- if you don't have anything to say, don't use fancy tricks to pretend as though you do. get back to work and think of something to say. all these camera tricks, like the slow motion and weird lighting and lenses and freaky music, is what the absence of content looks and sounds like. a lot of people have apparently bought it, and perceive emotional gravity and deep meaning, but i think they are projecting this onto a movie that did not do any of the work involved in creating it.
