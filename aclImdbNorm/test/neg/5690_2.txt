let me break down this film for you...<br /><br />the first fifteen minutes are a showcase for terrible special effects. i'm not one to nitpick about special effects, but what you've got to understand is that if you can't afford good special effects, you shouldn't anchor your film around special effects. starships fire blobs of color at each other, flaring into stock explosions, and careening past moons with polygon counts low enough to count with your fingers. you will have no idea what is happening. it will not make sense.<br /><br />the second act involves a woman walking in the desert. at this point you will be treated to drab scenery, and illogical, boring fight scenes. nobody speaks. nothing interesting happens. the protagonist's goals are unclear, and are not very compelling. this goes on for about 45 minutes.<br /><br />then in a five-minute montage, she sneaks into an enemy base, straps herself to a rocket, tries to destroy a doomsday weapon, fails, and dies.<br /><br />none of this has any bearing on the eventual direction of the film.<br /><br />in the last twenty minutes, basically the chick's memories get transferred to her daughter, who goes into stasis for a very large number of years, learning the secrets of mankind. after this, we see the first, and last five-minute segment of human interaction in the film, then the new heroine is forced to choose whether she wants to become part of the material that causes the big bang or not. you know. because when the universe is collapsing, you get to decide if you want to be a part of it.<br /><br />she chooses yes. but the memories of mankind survive in a capsule. maybe we won't make the same mistakes again, huh? if you like movies with characters, then this is not a good movie for you. the lead roles could have been fulfilled nicely by any old wind-up toy capable of staying right-side-up while walking through sand. all of the story is told through painfully dull narration.<br /><br />the film tries to seem deep by throwing together a whole bunch of undeveloped science-fiction ideas. there are enough concepts here to fuel a number of films, but as it stands, it's bloated with completely irrelevant details. two-thirds of this film could have been reduced to a 45-second montage. instead, the narrator fills in a novella's worth of backstory without ever giving us a reason to care what happens to the characters.<br /><br />there are good ideas in here, but nobody watches films to see ideas ineptly explained. people watched films to be entertained. this film does not entertain.
