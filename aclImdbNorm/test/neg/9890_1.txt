this movie is supposed to take place in milford nj. i know the house that it is based on as well as the person. as you see at the end of themovie, she was killed in the world trade center incident. i know that, because i was one of the police officers that helped with the identification of her remains. (she was the only one in our area lost). the nudity in the movie went a bit far. i am not a prude but the actors could have filmed the scene with the two woman without actually showing the whole thing. this movie is in poor taste and i cannot see how her family would give there blessing to it. this is an insult to the person whom it is based on.
