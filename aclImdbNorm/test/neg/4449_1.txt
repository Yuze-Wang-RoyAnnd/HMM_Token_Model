just to save you money and time i will go ahead and tell you that this movie is absolutely not worth the match and gas it would take to burn it. don't waste your time. as a matter-of-fact you would be better off forgetting you ever thought about watching it. i have seriously seen better b movies in a language that i can't understand. who ever gave permission for this to be made needs to be sewed. the only positive thing i can say for this movie is that with a new script and the right director and actors it could be a great story. let me break it down; a virgin gets pregnant by a demon, the baby while inside her womb wants to feed on people. they try to make up for the fact that this is possibly the worst movie ever made with cursing and pointless nudity. all in all totally not worth the dollar it took me to rent it.
