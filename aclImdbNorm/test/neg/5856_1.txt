this film is little more than an ersatz verhoeven. the filming is supposed to be tele-realistic, but is simply sickening. the parody disappears after about 15 minutes to be replaced by a story which seems to take itself seriously. the brechtian pauses for non-existent advert brakes are tedious, and even painful; undoubtedly there was no actual intention to render this film brechtian, it was just an accident which happened like that. if you want to see a parody of reality tv, watch celebrity deathmatch - it's funnier and wittier, and most importantly shorter. i have rarely felt so much pain whilst watching a film. to be avoided like a rabid rabbit.
