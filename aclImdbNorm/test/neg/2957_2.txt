this movie is way too long. i lost interest about one hour into the story. saratoga trunk tells the story of ingrid bergman, who is an the child of a prominent new orleans man and his mistress. after her mother dies in paris, bergman comes back to new orleans to scandalize her father's "legitimate" family and to blackmail them. she meets gary cooper, who is likewise seeking revenge against the railroad tycoons who cheated his father out of his land in texas. she draws him into her schemes, and the movie climaxes at a saratoga resort. long and boring, but worth watching if you are a bergman or cooper fan. the midget cupidon provides the only bright spot in this meandering story.
