after having problems in chicago, the solomon family moves to a remote north dakota farmhouse to start anew, but their attempts at an idyllic farming life is disrupted when their teen daughter jess (kristen stewart) and her 3-year-old brother ben start seeing and being attacked by supernatural beings who won't allow them to live in peace.<br /><br />the messengers starts off decently although it eventually becomes a generic horror film that's a lot more humorous than frightening. after reading the premise, i thought this could have been a decent movie since it sounded creepy and it held potential. unfortunately, the film didn't live up to its potential although i should have expected this since the trailer was awful. the screenplay was probably the worst part about it. it was full of silly sequences and bland dialog. the characters were not developed at all and most of them were acting like a bunch of idiots so it was hard to feel sympathy for them.<br /><br />the directors did a horrible job at building up suspense. they mainly relied on cheap scares like loud noises and random jumps. the music was really over the top and it just made it easier for the viewer to telegraph the next "scary" moment. i also didn't like how they pretty much just used one location for the whole movie. the house was the centerpiece of the story and that's where the majority of the filming took place so it got a little boring after awhile to see the same area. also, i didn't like the close-ups of the actors. during a conversation, the camera would continually jerk from character to another in the span of five seconds and it got really annoying. the directors did create a decent atmosphere and they do get some points for making their movie stylish. however, since we have come a long way in terms of style and effects, it's not really that hard to make your movie look nice especially if you are working on a hollywood film.<br /><br />the acting was atrocious and if this movie had been released in december, i'm sure it would have received several razzie nominations. kristen stewart showed some talent in panic room but you wouldn't be able to tell she has talent by watching her performance in the messengers. she was okay at acting scared and that's it. the rest of the time she was dry and unconvincing. penelope anne miller was just awful when it came to everything. it sounded like she was reading her lines and she had some of the worst facial expressions i have ever seen. dylan mcdermott was just very wooden and he showed almost no emotion. john corbett gave the best performance and he had a couple of good scenes. the twins who played ben were also decent and managed to out act many of the adult actors. overall, this lame horror film is not worth watching because of it's blandness and lazy film-making. rating 4/10
