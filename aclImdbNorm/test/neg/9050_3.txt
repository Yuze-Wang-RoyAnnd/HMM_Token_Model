largely forgettable tale in which mercenary kerman & employer agren travel into the jungle in search of agren's missing sister.<br /><br />despite its connection to the cannibal movie family, this film is more of an extreme version of rene cardona's "guyana - crime of the century". lenzi clearly aims to exploit the (at that time) topical jonestown massacre, by depicting a rogue, self righteous zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania (played with ruthless intensity by ivan rassimov) leading his motley crew flock into self inflicted oblivion. with sister in toe, kerman & agren attempt to stop the rot, but after several failed coups, they end up fleeing into the "green inferno", only to run afoul the locals and their notorious appetites.<br /><br />one in a string of excessive gore fests that emerged in the late seventies/early eighties, where every new addition seemed to engage in a one-upmanship contest with its predecessor, by attempting to contrive the most gory and graphic display ever brought to motion pictures. this inferior instalment employs all the motifs and gimmicks of the others, but with much less success.<br /><br />was it the so called "amazonian natives" who looked like they were bollywood rejects (this film was made on location in sri lanka), or the inept "decapitation" and "castration" scenes that seriously diminished the authenticity that was apparent in "cannibal holocaust"? you can decide. without spoiling the conclusion, it appeared as though lenzi put more emphasis in his shock and awe climax than in the basic requirement for a cohesive ending, where all loose ends are resolved. most unsatisfying.<br /><br />as with the others, where the extent of the graphic depictions of violence toward humans is limited (thankfully), the filmmakers have spared no extreme in inflicting the worst possible cruelty on hapless animals in their pursuit of the most sadistic shocks. unfortunately, the only thing shocking about this film is that it rates a mention among others of the ilk, that deal with the subject matter more convincingly.<br /><br />if there are any redeemable features at all, kerman is an affable if somewhat one-dimensional leading man, and his bevy of scantily clad co-stars (agren, lai and senatore) provide some visual respite from the relentless slayings.
