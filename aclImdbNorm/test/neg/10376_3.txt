formulaic to the max. neither title reflects the serial's actual content, "fighting nazis in morocco," (actually, the iverson ranch). the plot is just to fill in the lulls between fistfights. the packaging claims over 40 'fistic encounters' in 15 chapters. that's at least three a chapter! aside from seeing duncan renaldo cast as a spanish accented frenchman, watching how much furniture is overturned, smashed, thrown, burned or blown up is what this serial is really all about. when the protagonists start fighting, you can bet that everything in the room will be in it, too. so, kudos to the fight choreographer, who is the real star of this serial! <br /><br />two positive notes: the characters do sometimes lose their hats during the fights, and best of all, we have the girl side kick (often a journalist, as she is here) actually participating in the mayhem, mostly by shooting and killing the bad guys. yet to come is linda stirling killing the main villain in "manhunt of mystery island" (1945). on the negative side, there are just too many jump out of the way escapes-- before the slab falls, before the car goes over the cliff, before the speedboat explodes, before the building explodes, before the truck hits you, etc. etc.<br /><br />it is claimed that this serial partially 'inspired' george lucas to make the first indiana jones film, but that is more by implied concept than because of the actual story or the serial's development.<br /><br />rod cameron 'shines' as a moving rock, a role he played in all his films. other than watching all the furniture getting smashed, there's nothing really going on here, compared to other serials that have fewer fights, more story, better actors and more developed characters.<br /><br />i give it a 3 for all the furniture smashing.
