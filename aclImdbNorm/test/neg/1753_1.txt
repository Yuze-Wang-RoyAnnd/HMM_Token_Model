kidman and law lack the chemistry to make this sloppily directed, poorly written romance/melodrama work on any level other than grandiosity. kidman pouts and<br /><br />pines wistfully for her absent lover law. she's just met him when he's whisked off to do battle for the south in the civil war, and they've only exchanged about 5 sentences and one kiss, yet they're totally smitten. law's main direction throughout seems to be `look vacant and shell-shocked, but sensitive.' rene zellweger is about the only spark in this dreary script, but she plays it way too broad and over the top, like she was starring in `annie get your gun.' yee-hah boy howdy! something about her character felt more like it belonged in a monty python sketch - the one from `holy grail' where the peasants spend all their time wallowing in muck making mud pies for no reason. kidman is a smart enough actress to stay out of her way whenever she can. their scenes together are like a comic book hidden inside a victorian era novel.<br /><br />whenever the action bogs down into total tedium, which is frequently, all the writers do is shout `cue the simon legree-type villain!' and teague (ray winstone) comes galloping out of nowhere to do his unspeakably dastardly acts, like kill and torture innocent god-fearing townspeople in the name of loyalty to a fast-fading<br /><br />confederacy. all other times, he's missing in action, which is preposterous even in this cornball script. there is a plethora of other talented actors who give credible performances in small roles. these are the characters law meets as he does his johnny appleseed trek from the front lines, where he has deserted, to the hopefully loving embrace of kidman back in cold mountain. ultimately though, none of these characters matter. law has no time for them or their lives. each of these little mini-movies has the same tired theme: war is gol-durn heck, and turns otherwise decent christian folk into rabid animals.<br /><br />and the script is far too predictable, too heavy-handed. moreover, the pacing of the story is dreadfully slow. you spend the entire movie waiting for romeo and juliet's inevitable reunion, with kidman wringing her hands and sighing, law overcoming incredible odds and dodging bullets. and when it finally comes you just don't care anymore. you'll be looking at your watch wondering how much more of this clap you have to endure.<br /><br />i give it one star out of five for the battle scenes. there is a potent anti-war message here. the incredible lack of concern for the loss of life by the generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful stuff. but it's only about 15 minutes of this 150-minute dog.
