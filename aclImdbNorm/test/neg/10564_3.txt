ok, when i say "wow," i mean, "jesus, please help me." i have an old vhs copy that was printed before troma got a copy of the title. the movie is about an alien crash landing on earth to terrorize us with a gun that blasts people into oblivion. watch out!!! and by that, i mean watch out for those special effects. there is an amazing number of mistakes. the acting is terrible, but i'd say the only one putting forth any effort would be the sheriff. the film itself is really grainy and poorly lighted. in one particular scene, it is day outside and then the shot shows the night beast shooting his gun with night behind him. then it shows day again. *shakes head* i usually like low-budget horror films, but i had to force myself to finish it because i never watch a movie without finishing it. the only accomplishment this film achieved was an alien that wasn't stereotypical. so for that, and only for that... i give it a 3 out of 10.<br /><br />don't watch this movie if you've had a bad day. you'll be even more depressed at the failed attempt this movie makes.
