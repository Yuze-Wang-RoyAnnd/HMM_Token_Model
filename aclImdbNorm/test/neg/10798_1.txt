that got destroyed quickly by the poor quality acting, cinematography, numerous pointless scenes and a terrible villain. well let's see joe estevez is bad (as usual) but he isn't the only casting problem, writer vivian schilling is no great actress, in fact, well she sucks. her script isn't so bad, it's just bad directed. in fact if the direction had been better and if better actors had been cast, this could have been a really good film.<br /><br /> but alas, with all of these problems "soultaker" fails to be even kind of passable as a horror movie, plus the pacing is just awful too.<br /><br /> the mst crew had some fun with this one but it definitely wasn't one of their better efforts. 5 for that, nothing for the original.
