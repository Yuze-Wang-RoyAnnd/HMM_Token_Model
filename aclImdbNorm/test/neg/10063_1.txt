producers golan and globus should have been ashamed to release this piece of trash publicly. i know this is gonna sound cliched, but compared to this, the first "hercules" of 1983 looks like a mature and exciting epic! this "sequel" is moronic, cheap, unredeemable, childish, phony, inept and badly acted. a landmark in bad cinema, and one of the few, few movies i've seen that really deserve the lowest possible rating: no stars!
