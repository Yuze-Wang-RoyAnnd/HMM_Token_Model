unlike some of the reviews written here, i didn't hate this movie. it is a movie that could have been much better than it was. not oscar material, true, but much better than it was.<br /><br />i thought the plot had a good hook and through line. granted, this movie was badly written. and terribly directed and produced. i mean, how many irrelevant flashbacks can you have? why were we there? what exactly is the point of the opening sequence? it seems like the producer(s) watched american beauty a few too many times and thought 'i'll use that in an action movie!' i thought the movie wasn't that badly acted. wesley snipes did a credible job, he just ran afoul of some bad direction. and once this movie hit the production room, things just got worse. the main actress, i think, had the same problems. some of the other acting was suspect, yes, but it was a low-budget flick. again, i would say it is the director's job to pick that up and correct it.<br /><br />as an overall recommendation, i would agree with the first review i read that this movie is not worth seeing. or maybe it is worth seeing, if you are a film student and want to see what not to do.<br /><br />3/10, and that's giving it praise.
