this movie was dreadful. biblically very inaccurate. moses was 80 years old when he led the people out of egypt, the movie has him about forty. moses was about forty when he fled egypt, was gone for forty years, and was with them wandering for forty years. moses was 120 years old when he died, and was denied the privilege of crossing over to the promised land. i realize movies use a lot of "poetic license" as the biblical account isn't that long, but, if making a biblical movie they still need to reflect the facts known, and keep the general flavor of the main biblical character, this movie fails in this aspect, and in many others.even though the 1956 version has its problems as well, theatrically it was much better.
