"dungeon of harrow" had a lot of things that could've made this quite a good horror film. creepy mansion, a torture chamber, a paranoid host, a henchman, a ghoul in the dungeon, etc. but sadly to say this wasn't made very well.<br /><br />a writer and a skipper get shipwrecked on an island owned by a count in a castle, his slave, and a mute maid. the count becomes more and more suspicious that the two shipwrecked men are pirates (of all things) and gets more inclined to turn on them and subject them, and the mute maid who befriends them, to torture and imprisonment. sound not-bad right? <br /><br />well, not quite. i used to call this one of the worst movies i have ever seen, but now i hesitate. because it had so much potential it can't really be called "one of the worst." however, seeing all this potential go to waste is a really big hit against this film. all in all, it's not a very good movie.<br /><br />there is a very gothic-suspense scene when our hero is chained in the dungeon and is confronted by the insane and leprous rotting bride, adorned in a tattered wedding dress. this was both creepy and disturbing the first time i saw the horror unfold in this scene. man i wish this was a better movie! <br /><br />this movie had all the right stuff to make this a moody late-night chiller, but ultimately took all the wrong turns. i suggest someone remake this one.
