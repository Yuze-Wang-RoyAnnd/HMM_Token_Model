this movie is not worth a descend review, it just made me decide that i am not going to go see the next tarantino film. and i used to love tarantino's films.<br /><br />not artsy, not entertaining, not witty, not funny, nothing, just dull and stupid. if this movie would have been tarantinos first, it would have also been his last.<br /><br />tarantino has to get a grip on himself, otherwise his next movie is going to be 3 hours of meaningless, boring and uncool dialog. it seems like he has fallen in love with his dialog - and his love is blind.<br /><br />after you finish your popcorn's there's no reason to sit in a theater anymore.
