yep, this has got to be one of the lamest movies i've ever seen. it's utterly tasteless, has no style whatsoever, the story is so thin that you can watch television through it, and the whole film has so many holes you could drive an oil tanker through it.<br /><br />sure, i appreciate a good b-movie as much as most male white homo sapiens do. but this has got to be the worst i've seen. in fact it's so b that it lacks everything that makes a b-movie interesting.<br /><br />the whole movie is based around such charming artefacts as the characters beating the crap out of each other, various bodily functions and the complete lack of sanity of anything on-screen.<br /><br />it's not even funny. in fact it's quite the opposite. i found it even boring at times due to it's extreme predictability.<br /><br />i find nothing good to say about this movie. it was a waste of time watching it, and i hope others don't do the same mistake. if you also pay for it you should get a serious brainscan done.
