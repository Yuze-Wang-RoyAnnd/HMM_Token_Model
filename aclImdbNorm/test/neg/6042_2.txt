someone said that webs is a lot like an episode of sliders, and i have to agree. spoilers: i never liked the actors on sliders, and rarely have seen it except when nothing better was on. webs is the kind of movie to see if you have no other choices. read a book. webs has those kind of tv has-been actors that look like they are there as part of their probation or work release program. some low budget tv movies have actors that at least look enthusiastic. the actors in webs look like they were getting paid minimum wage and were working on a time-clock. they have that desperate, "the-paycheck-better-not-bounce" look. the queen spider looks great, except it is rarely seen, and there are no other spiders (and no webs). the queen spider bites people, and they become spider zombies, which means that they try to keep their eyes wide open when they are attacking the humans. the humans are all fighting among themselves over a number of different reasons, and they are not sympathetic. after meeting all the "humans" i would have recommended charm school for the characters. all that webs made me feel was apathy. i was numb to the characters, and hoped for some interesting gore and special effects. the gore was minimal, and the special effects were reserved for the ugly spider queen, who looked good. if webs had a bunch of spider creatures eating humans, it would have been more entertaining. apparently they could only budget "spider-zombies." webs is a sad entry into the field of spider oriented movies. it may qualify as the worst spider movie ever, because eight-legged freaks had great special effects.
