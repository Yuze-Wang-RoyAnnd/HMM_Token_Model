i happened to see a promo for this movie on spike channel last night, it was grouped with a patrick swazy rerun of another movie he made and thought swazy was in this sequel.....boy was i wrong....i see the screen writer also starred in it, and i'm thinking the budget was a bit tight. i am surprised to see will patton in the film he has far better credits to his name to be playing in a "c" movie like this. bussey jr was trying so hard to portray the image of his father(one of the best bad guy actors ever) that failed miserably the only redeeming qualities in the movie was the chicks,,,,,good looking and with lots of t&a just not worth the time or your hard earned dollar to rent it
