as a helpful warning for others, i believe "skeleton man" is actually worse than "raptor island." i have been using ri as an example of the worst original movie presented on the sci-fi channel, but sm is the most laughably incoherent and wretchedly designed movie i have yet seen. yes, i did watch almost the whole thing, coming into it about 35 minutes into it. it drew me in with its pure ineptitude. what was sci-fi thinking? once skeleton man and the surviving platoon leader (or whatever he was--i'm not good on military unit terminology) reached the chemical plant, the movie moved into a zone of impossible nonsense that was almost mesmerizing. i had the same idea as another viewer who wondered if more than one movie had someone been edited together to make one terrible whole.
