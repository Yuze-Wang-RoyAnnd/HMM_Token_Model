first things first, i am by no means a picky movie watcher. i'm not one of those people who gets movies just to pick apart the flaws and criticize, i, like most other people, watch to be entertained. i'll basically watch any type of movie of, no matter how bad anyone says it is (sometimes a movie's so terribly made and written that it invokes a sort of pity humor which i get a kick out of). with all that aside, lil pimp was simply pathetic. i saw it on tv and just didn't know what i was watching. it was too poorly written and cheesy to be an adult movie, and had way too much sex, innuendo and swearing to be a kid's movie, in fact, i doubt even kids would be amused by it. the humor (pretty generous even calling it that) was so pretentious and campy, i couldn't see how anyone with half a mind could even find it funny. the only thing that made me laugh was how people like bernie mac and ludicrous could put their name and time onto/into something so hurting. luda's character was such a cheap ploy for laughs, which fell extremely short of its goal. the plot didn't make any sense whatsoever, the storyline has got to be the worst sequence of events ever put together on screen. i could keep going on, but i want to see what people think of my reaction before i start discussing specific instances of pathetic scenes. all i have to say is it really has to make ya wonder how much time these writers spent on their knees trying ta get it made.<br /><br />j
