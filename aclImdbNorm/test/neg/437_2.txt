awip tries to be funny, scary, tense, and romantic ... and fails in every respect. the acting is average at best, but mostly stupid. the special effects are not enough to make up for the stupid plot devices, and the chemistry between *any* character is juvenile.<br /><br />if you don't want to be mad at yourself, don't pay money to see it.
