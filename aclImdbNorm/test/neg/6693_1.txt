from all the rave reviews, we couldn't wait to see this show. we love wacky humor and creative material, especially from australia and new zealand.<br /><br />i admit this may not be a fair review since we only saw the first 15 minutes. but we just couldn't bear any more misery - it was definitely the most boring and painful 15 minutes we've ever experienced watching a tv show - it felt like 15 hours. the songs may be (mildly) interesting by themselves, but inserted for an interminable 3 minutes each in the middle of a story scene just doesn't work.<br /><br />we're trying hard now to erase the memory. if you want some wonderful down-under humor in a delightful and engaging film, see "the dish" instead.
