this show is not in my opinion, good,then again i have not enjoyed any cartoon from disney channel. except for "the proud family" because that so is about a normal female teen this show is very similar to the way i feel about lilo and stich the series. it was a mistake turning the movie into a cartoon because the movie was excellent, the cartoon is terrible. disney channel was doing just fine before adding all these stupid cartoons such as dave the barbarian, brandy and mr. whiskers, lilo and stich the series, american dragon jake long,and where it all started: kim possible. the shows would have been better had they come to playhouse disney! as for this particular show kuzko will never get out of school just as dave the barbarian's parents will never return home, and as brandy and mr. whiskers will never get out of the jungle.
