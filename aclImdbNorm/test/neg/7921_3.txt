all dogs go to heaven was a quirky, funny movie; with good name talent who's voices lended an adult familiarity to a cartoon basicly for kids. it was just interesting enough to be likeable by adults aside from something good for the kids to watch.<br /><br />unfortunately adgth2 is a valueless sequel trying to make a bit of cash rideing on the coattails of the first. charlie sheen is a passable replacement for burt reynolds in this second movie and sheena easton's voice in a few of the movies lovely but forgettable songs makes her a worthwhile pick as a co-star for this. add dom deluise from the first movie and you'd think this would be a decent mix to make this sequel at least relatively decent compared to the first one.<br /><br />unfortunately even with the addition of other good voice actors such as bebe neuwirth in the horrible role of anabelle, this movie cannot be saved from the atrocious production values and animation skills (or lack thereof) present all over this movie. horrible editing, syncronization of the voices, and flat out spaces where characters mouths should be moving to dialouge but are not combine to make this movie look like a college interns animation project instead of the decent sequel it could have been.<br /><br />all in all i'd say unless you were a very big fan of the first movie i'd give this a very large pass.
