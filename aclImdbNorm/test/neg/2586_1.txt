i saw this film last night and came online specifically to see if others thought it was as awful as i did.<br /><br />granted, obviously some people see a lot in this film that i didn't, so if you're one of those people, fine - good luck to you. but i'm a patient person. i've enjoyed extremely long films before. but this was an exercise in torture for me.<br /><br />i honestly felt that this was one of those films with little to say, and that it was more about style than substance - however, the style, too, made me feel like tearing my hair out. pretty much anything interesting that happens during the course of the film happens off-screen. it's like a deliberate attempt to make a film entirely from outtakes - the bits that would usually be reserved for the deleted scenes section of a dvd, if they were shown to the public at all.<br /><br />you don't even get to find out, in the end, anything about the main character, francois. i had no sympathy for any of the characters in this film, except perhaps the violinist & his goat, and the old man who believes that octopuses live to 300 because they're really smart. seriously, i was excited when it cut to a shot of francois holding a gun to his head. i felt so ripped off when even his inevitable suicide turned out to be gut-wrenchingly boring.<br /><br />oh, and where was the editor? off smoking opium, too? i swear, i almost screamed every time i was subjected to an extended shot of absolutely nothing happening, except perhaps someone pacing backwards and forwards, and then finally there would be a very abrupt cut to the next scene, and it would be a year later, and we'd missed everything interesting that happened in the meantime, and everyone was still wearing the same bloody clothes....!?!?!???<br /><br />so, in conclusion, if you liked it - great. but this review is intended as an antidote to the fawning "you'll love this film if you love cinema" dross i've seen posted here and elsewhere. (see? i hated the film and i still included a sly winking reference to its content!)
