as i mentioned in other comments, i became a real big fan of david bradley ever since i saw him in "american ninja 3". the guy is great doing martial arts, has some kind of charisma and is a cool looking dude on screen. sadfully, he went to the dtv department ever since his debut and has remained as one of the king of tv movies until 2001 where he apparently stopped making movies. now, one thing is watching cyborg cop or hard justice which are crappy clich'ed movies but real fun to watch (coz they're entertainingly bad if that has any sort of meaning) but another thing is watching a tasteless piece of boredom like total reality. i mean, this and crisis are the two biggest pieces of horse-dung this guy ever did. i wouldn't recommend this not even to the biggest bradly hardcore fans. if i had known this and crisis were going to be so f*****g crap, i wouldn't have spent the 3 or 4 euros they cost me. total reality is just as boring as crisis although funnily, it starts promising. a group of military prisoners in the future are given a chance to stop some kind of disaster in the past (i'm sorry, i didn't really pay much attention to this atrociousness) and they only have 24 hours to get back or something like that. if they don't, they're stranded there forever. the poor director who oversaw this, "tries" some humorous (?) clich'es like the convicts arriving on earth and not knowing what a truck is for example (wow, hilarious...). the movie follows up with david bradley teaming up with some earth girl for the rest of the flick. this bored me so much that i had to force myself to watch it in like 3 or 4 installments to at least make use of the 4 or 5 euros it cost me. that's coz every time i tried, i fell asleep. and if you get a movie with david bradley with just one crappy 10-second fight scene in it, then that's the final touch which would contribute to you throwing it off a hundred foot cliff so as never to see it again. i wish i could meet the "director" of this pile of poo on the street and i swear to god i'd ask him back for mi 5 euros. i'd also love to meet david bradley to ask him why in god's name did he choose to star in this poor excuse for a movie. don't even bother with this film, i mean it from the bottom of my heart, not renting borrowing it and specially not buying it.
