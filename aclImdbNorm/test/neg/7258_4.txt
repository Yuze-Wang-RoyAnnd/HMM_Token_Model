the deadly mantis certainly won't scare any one, but as sci-fi programmers go it is better than most. a volcanic eruption at the south pole thaws out a giant, prehistoric preying mantis at the north pole. military men go missing. dr. ned (william hopper--hedda hopper's son and best known as paul drake on television's perry mason) is called in to i.d. the creature--but by this time the creature has eaten up several eskimo and is en route to the washington monument.<br /><br />about a third or more of the film consists of stock footage: old government educational films, military men in radar rooms, air planes--and would you believe eskimos putting out to sea? which explains, of course, why a tribe of eskimo is attacked in the movie. ("hey, guys! think we can work this in?") mix in some negligible special effects, some clunky dialogue, and some sexist attitudes and you're good to go. not as original as the monster that challenged the world, but fans of 1950s "big bug" schlock will enjoy it--and the kids will have a good time throwing popcorn at the screen.<br /><br />gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer
