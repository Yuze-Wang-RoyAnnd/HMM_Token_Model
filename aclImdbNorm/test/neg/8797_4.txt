there was a time in the us that everything was possible on film, so came the roughies, movies containing horror and explicit scene's. the best known are forced entry and waterpower, but of course those were made with a bit of budget. all shown on 42nd in ny, but hey, there were other grindhouses out there that showed no budget roughies. wet wilderness is an example of it. it circuited the underground scene after a while so copies were available but as seen on other reviews, some copies were abrupt cut at the end. but the version i watched was complete. well i would call this one more a porn one then a roughie, there is a serial killer around but he likes more to watch others have sex instead of killing them, when he kills it's done off screen. the acting is the worst i ever seen. and i guessed that the so called actors didn't like what they are doing, for example in the beginning when we have the lesbian scene watch one girl stop performing and pulls a pubic hair out of here mouth then continues doing what was happening, or when mother is riding the black man, the daughter is sitting in the grass annoyed by ants! but it is the storyline that made this one famous, incest and racism is what this made it famous. when there is blood watch the two girls sitting there waiting for a cue to act, god this is worse but still one to have if you are into sleaze and grindhouse. be sure that you have the full version.
