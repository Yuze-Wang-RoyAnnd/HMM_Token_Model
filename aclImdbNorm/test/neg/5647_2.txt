a pretty awful film, i'm amazed the likes of derek jacobi & vanessa redgrave agreed to be in it, it's like an overlong episode from a poor tv detective series. <br /><br />the biggest flaw has to be vinnie jones, he simply can't act, whoever had the bright idea of casting him as a leading man wants their head examining unless he put his own money into the project? he should stick to playing thugs, looking menacing & not speaking! <br /><br />also was central heating around in dickens times as there were three big radiators behind his desk??<br /><br />no wonder they gave this away free with a newspaper as no one would pay to see it.
