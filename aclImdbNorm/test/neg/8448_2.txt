this is just one of those films which cannot justify much of anything that happens. these people are going on a trek: the young girl wants to photograph animals. there really are no piranhas, but i guess the psychotic hunter guy is the real piranha. anyway, there are lots of animals and there is lots of driving. there is considerable anti-gun talk, but we all know where that is going. toward the end, there's lots of action and a rape thrown in. somebody must pay, and they do. it would have been nice to have a couple of piranhas to sort of fill the thing out. there were lots of monkeys. if you fast forward through the dull parts, you have a tight little five minutes.
