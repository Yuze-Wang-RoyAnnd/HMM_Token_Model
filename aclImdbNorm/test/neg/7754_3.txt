this story of ted brice, an american pilot who is the sole survivor of the crash of an allied reconnaissance plane in belgium in january of 1944, is pretty much of a mess. the title would lead you to think that it is principally a story about the belgian armed resistance groups, but that seems to be just a backdrop to prop up a silly love story between ted and claire, the woman who takes ted in. claire's husband henri is a committed resistance member, but it is claire who decides, in henri's absence and against his wishes, to give ted refuge.<br /><br />crucial plot details don't make sense. central to the story is the retrieval of the recorder on the downed plane that contains navigation codes and the positions of targets. but in the opening scene we see belgians looting the plane, resistance members among them. why did they not retrieve the valued items at that time instead of waiting for the nazis to come and guard the plane? and the whole affair of transferring ted out of the area was conducted using secret instructions and code words when the transaction could have just been a simple exchange. the ponderous music attempts, but fails, to lend some weight to this tepid undertaking.<br /><br />the most ludicrous part of the movie is how the love affair develops between ted and claire. at first claire is devoted to nursing ted back from near death and, when ted starts to recover, they become physically involved (while henri is conveniently away conducting resistance business). julie ormond does a passable job as claire, but she effects a french accent that i frequently found impossible to understand. her responses seemed a little weak at times - when informed of the hanging deaths of several town members she reacts as though she had just been told that the local grocery was out of peaches. as ted, bill paxton seems just to be reciting his lines; his performance is so uninspired that it's embarrassing. a true american pilot might evidence such a flat personality, but it does not make for convincing cinema. i did not sense any chemistry between these supposed lovers.<br /><br />the most idiotic thing is the way that ted and claire act like lovers on holiday. maybe sexual release from such heavy situations is understandable, but to appear totally oblivious of the gravity of the situation is hard to fathom. at first ted is consigned to an attic room and claire worries about his even coming into the house. but as things develop he not only comes into the house, he dances with claire to loud music, enters the adjoining barn to have a game of baseball with a local boy, and ultimately goes on a car trip with claire to a nearby town.<br /><br />the young boy seems to be most committed to his role, but he is undermined by the script. he has an uncanny ability to be at crucial events without being noticed. and when he delivers lines like:<br /><br />"have you ever seen someone get hanged. they look like the're dancing, but they can't find the floor." <br /><br />you feel that it is the screenwriter talking and not a thirteen year old boy.<br /><br />and oh, by the way, there are scenes to show that the nazis are pretty bad guys.<br /><br />comparing this film to the brilliant "ashes and diamonds" about the polish resistance, or the equally stellar "lacombe, lucien" about the french resistance, one realizes what a truly dismal affair it is.
