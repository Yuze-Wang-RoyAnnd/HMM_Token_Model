significant spoilers! <br /><br />this is a sick, disturbing movie... just like the sick, twisted director, jennifer chambers lynch who also wrote it. i don't even know why i gave this movie a rating of 2. it is not the fault of the actors for sure. the cast certainly portrayed their roles well. it is the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written which was the benchmark of a truly sick mind.<br /><br />i do know that i will never, ever watch another movie which has been written or directed by jennifer chambers lynch. she is a sick, twisted, foul-mouthed, foul-thinking deviant. she looks, speaks and sounds like some biker chick with her brain fried on drugs, who spent 20 years doing hard time. you can clearly see what kind of person she is by watching her on the dvd special features section of "surveillance: the watched are watching." you can see and hear her for yourself. she was every bit as bad as i had envisioned from the writing of this movie.<br /><br />i'm not shocked by bad language, although this director certainly talks like a sailor. this goes far beyond simple bad language; worse than any p0rn film. the level of implied sado-violence and perversion she incorporates into every character she writes are of the genre which is even illegal by p0rn standards. this perverse, disturbing thinking is clearly apparent in her own personality and things she says. another reviewer found the description i was seeking. this is a snuff film.<br /><br />be sure to listen to her narration on the deleted scenes and alternate ending. this director/writer is truly a sick person. i can't believe anyone would put her in charge of a movie, much less pay her for it. you can be assured that i will never, ever watch another movie she has been affiliated with. in the thousands of movies i have watched and collected, there are only a couple directors and writers which have merited this kind of boycott. she is offensive beyond anyone i have ever seen connected with filming a movie before. there have been some bad directors and writers, but none could compare to her sick, twisted mind.<br /><br />when i saw this movie, which was just one murder rampage after another. once it got past the hotel murder... then the sick cops shooting at and brutalizing drivers for kicks... the vacation family with the bad parents (who had no business being in the presence of children)... followed by the drug addicts.... the movie then proceeded to the (even more) twisted, deviant serial killers.<br /><br />as i saw the serial killers reveal themselves, i began to wonder what kind of truly sick mind wrote this movie. those were my actual thoughts as i watched this movie. i fully intended to find out what writer had such a sick mind... because that writer seriously needs to be committed for long-term psychiatric treatment. to my surprise, it turned out to be the director. when i saw and heard what she had to say on the dvd, i realized my assessment of the writer was right on the nose. on the dvd, she was indeed the sick, twisted person i had envisioned writing such a disturbing film.<br /><br />while the little girl, (stephanie) ryan simpkins, truly stole the show... i can't believe that her real-life parents would have tolerated this sick, foul-mouthed, director to be anywhere near their daughter.<br /><br />this movie is disturbing, sick, offensive, twisted and the director-writer needs some serious treatment in a mental facility.<br /><br />as far as the ending of the movie goes... the alternate ending, should have been the outcome of this horrific ordeal. there was no point and no benefit to the film or the story or the flow of the film by the death of the other character. i'm stunned that any studio actually distributed the movie. the trailer was completely misleading. the only reason the movie got the audience it did was due to the clever wordsmithing and creative depiction on the trailer. that trailer is not representative of the movie you will see.<br /><br />other than the child... every character in this movie was a sick, murderous, twisted, perverse, violent sex freak and their characters are mirrored the mind of the writer-director who created them. but if you watch it carefully, even the parents of the vacationing family; the sick cops taking pot shots; the serial killers posing in alternate roles; cops in the station; and even the station dispatcher... every single one of these character roles incorporated a sexually, twisted, violent pervert. i'm not too sure about some of the actors after watching them talk about the filming of the movie and the canadian town in the special features section of the dvd.<br /><br />this writer-director has such a personal mental deviation that no matter what she writes, every character role contains those same carbon copy stamps. the only character which did not have these deviant tendencies was the child. watch closely and you will see this in every character. then listen to the director-writer talk on the dvd special features section and you will understand what i'm telling you about her mental state and psychological issues. she wouldn't be tolerated in too many decent homes if she were not from a hollywood film making family.<br /><br />fortunately, jennifer chambers lynch does not have much of a filmography... less than a handful of things. since she carbon copies those disturbing traits in all of her character roles, i don't think we'll have to see many movies written or directed by her unless her dad, director david lynch helps her out. i'd recommend staying away from any movie she is involved with... and i'm not too sure her dad's films would be any better.<br /><br />do yourself a favor. avoid anything written or directed by jennifer chambers lynch.
