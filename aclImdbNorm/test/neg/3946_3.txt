this movie was not very good in my opinion. while not a complete waste of an hour and a half (luckily i didn't have to pay $ for it), it just wasn't very scary. there were parts where i jumped and a few minimally violent/gory scenes, but overall only someone easily frightened would consider this movie scary.<br /><br />the overall writing and acting were very weak. the characters never evolved or grew as people. even at the end, the lead guy, whatever his name was, didn't man up and had to be rescued from the fire at the last minute. the plot also had inconsistencies. the police officer who was killed was not murdered in the same way he died in the game. the girl october mentioned that in order to kill the evil demon lady you had to read something from the correct text. funny how they never bothered to do that and still managed to escape. the malcolm-in-the-middle kid died in the game but didn't die "in real life." also, making the game play by itself was very weak writing. it would have been okay for the brother's death, just to get them playing again. but you are supposed to play a video game and stay alive and 3 people die before you play again...why do you even need the game? if you like movies like the ring and thing its scary and fun, watch this movie. if you know someone like that you can watch it with at laugh at, do it. if you like "horror" movies that make you laugh out loud and you have the opportunity to watch this movie for free, do it. otherwise, stay far far away.
