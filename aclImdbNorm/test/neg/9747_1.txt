would it be too trite of me to create a review of just me saying the word "stupid" over and over again? probably.<br /><br />this is arguably the worst movie i've ever seen. seriously. there are better movies on mystery science theater 3000. i saw this movie for the first time at a friend's birthday party when it was still in theaters. even though it was actually *with friends* and at one of their *birthday parties,* i had to leave. i actually had to leave. i just excused myself and walked out. fortunately, some of the parents were doing the same thing, so i didn't look like a total jerk... anyway, this film is awful. there is nothing to like about it. it's painfully (as in actually causing physical pain) slow, and sickeningly (literally does induce vomiting) unfunny. you almost feel sorry for tom arnold, but then you don't because you remember he was actually in the movie. it really does pain me to even think about it.<br /><br />it was on tv a few months ago, and i decided i had to watch it all the way through, just once. i remembered then why i walked out in the first place, and felt guilty for boosting its ratings by even one viewer. the gags aren't funny, the characters arn't interesting. it's just a senseless mess of pratfalls and stupidity.<br /><br />there is a small crowd of then-eight-year-old kids who watched the movie when it came out and considered it "brilliant." if you think that having your face removed piece by pece with an ice cream scoop is brilliant, then by all means, go rent it. but if you have any dignity whatsoever avoid this big stupid mess altogether. score: 0/10 ... maybe a negative 1, actually.
