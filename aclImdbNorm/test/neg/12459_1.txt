it was so disjointed - it seemed to jump from place to place - and the "thief" was obvious. it was a poor man's (not to mention high school) "less than zero". i would pass on this movie as it has very little to add. so many issues are left unresolved, and that's okay - but the fact that it jumps around to the point where you wonder what's exactly going on is terrible. the voice-over is needed because the movie doesn't work on its own. avoid this movie, and watch something else about rich teen angst. i'm sure there are plenty of others to watch. don't waste your time on this.
