jon good's wife (simply one of the worst titles for a film ever), or the red right hand (another absolutely awful sounding title that means nothing & has no relevance to the film) under which i saw it, is set in 'salem, massachusettes 1978' (incidently the year i was born which was quite possibly the best thing to happen during those 365 days) where five old college friends meet up for a school reunion, gay-boy fagot roger mather (john kuntz, is that surname for real? just say it out loud...), martha alden (kim brockington), rebecca lawson (jenna stern) & her boyfriend jake stabler (john doe), alan hobbes (michael kevin walker) & his wife sandy (megan rawa) plus john good (marc ardito, why is the spelling of 'john' different in the title?) & his wife sara (abigail morgan). from the word go there is an uneasy tension in the air & when someone mentions their 'missing' friend calef (jason winther) lots of unpleasant memories come flooding back. then comes the phone calls, the mysterious nose-bleeds, hallucinations & guilt as the true horror of the events all those years ago finally comes to light...<br /><br />produced, executive produced & directed by kurt gioscia who also wrote the thing & kurt st. thomas who gets the art direction credit too & if that wasn't enough they both act in the film as well! personally i thought jon good's wife was awful, i mean she can't cook or anything! ha ha ha, only joking! seriously though i didn't think much of the film overall, for a start it's pretty slow going & the entire first 30 minutes is solid snooze material of the reunion consisting of lots of catching up with each other & dull character building exposition. the film never explains itself, what's with those weird nose-bleeds for god's sake, the mysterious phone calls, the almost inconsequential death of one of the group that might or might not be natural & what the hell was sara all about? she comes across as some nosey, sex crazed, dirty talking, shameless, bitter blackmailing know-it-all whore who apparently sleeps with just about every man she meets! some of the dialogue she spouts wouldn't be out of place in a porno & it just seems totally at odds with the rest of the film which plays out more like a drama than the horror/thriller it was supposedly meant to be. then there's the ending, if there's a worse way to end a film then to just leave literally everything hanging in the air with no closure whatsoever i have yet to see it. the whole thing was very predictable as well, i mean is anyone watching this not going to know that when they all mention their friend calef went 'missing' there wouldn't be more to it?<br /><br />directors gioscia & thomas make an infuriating film, on top of the predictability & annoying climax there is a retrospective narration by alan which i simply don't understand as he has no more or less significance than anyone else & at what point in time is he narrating from? the reasons behind this narration is never made clear or elaborated upon. there's no tension because the whole things so by-the-numbers.<br /><br />technically the film is ok but nothing special & some of the locations & clothes didn't look particularly authentic to me, this never convinced me it was taking place during the late 70's. the acting was alright & what about actor john kuntz last name? i suppose if his wife was standing next to him we could describe them as a couple of kuntz, right?!<br /><br />i really didn't think much of jon good's wife (a blow up doll would have been better! ha ha ha) & i'm not sure who it would appeal to. forget about any gore, horror, violence, scares, atmosphere or excitement, in fact forget about everything that would have made this film watchable because it ain't here. not recommended.
