first off, i would like to make it clear that i voluntarily subject myself to the viewing of terrible movies. i have seen what i thought were the worst of the worst. in my mind, movies could not get any worse than the likes of d.e.b.s., leprechaun 6: back 2 tha hood, and terror storm. until i saw this movie.<br /><br />the pirate movie, without any exaggeration, is the worst movie in the world. i was informed prior to watching that the movie was, indeed, awful, but i did not believe the allegations. believe me when i tell you that this movie is simply an abomination to film.<br /><br />it starts out with a 3 minute clip of a boat of pirates apparently in the middle of a battle with themselves. "the end" splashes across the screen. unfortunately, it is not the actual end of the movie. the movie is about an unpopular, awkwardly nerdy girl named mabel, who carries around a ghetto blaster and is attracted to ambiguously homosexual pirate boys. she drowns and has a overly drawn out hallucination in which she stars as a scantily dressed skank who falls in love with frederic, who happens to have just crawled out of the ocean. he might actually be homosexual. the pirate king has a ruby and diamond studded codpiece. it honks and squeaks when he squeezes it.<br /><br />there is singing in this movie. you might have the impression that this is a hilarious musical. it isn't. trust me. they are the worst songs that you've ever heard, and by the end of the first original tune you will be searching for objects to pierce your eardrums with.<br /><br />there are "references" to other movies in here. by references, of course, i mean "obvious rip-offs." the inclusion of indiana jones, inspector clouseau, and the lightsaber were, in fact, anti-hilarious.<br /><br />the dialogue is, in its better moments, painful to hear. the direction is flat out awful, and at one point you can see the stunt pad in the scene, which isn't very well hidden at all.<br /><br />in conclusion, if there is even the shadow of curiosity in your mind about this movie, get rid of it. there are times when people want to see how bad something really is, but this movie is not worth it. put it completely out of your mind and never think about it again. if you cherish your mental capacity then i beg of you, never ever watch this movie.
