if we really want to get serious and find osama bin laden, then we should take this stinker down to gitmo and force the detainees to watch it. they'll be singing within minutes. of course, i'm sure that making them watch this god-awful dreck violates the geneva convention in several ways. <br /><br />look, my 5 year old daughter isn't allowed to watch tv at home. so take her to her grandparents or cousins and she's a little tv zombie. she got up and walked away after about ten minutes. that's how bad this is. <br /><br />you know, when the person responsible for this garbage was a young writer, i bet he or she had dreams of the great american novel. now they have to look in the mirror every morning with the realization that they wrote what is possibly the worst hour of television in the history of the medium.<br /><br />and we wonder why the rest of the world hates us...
