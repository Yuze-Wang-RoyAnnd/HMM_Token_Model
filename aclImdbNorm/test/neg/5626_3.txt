let freedom ring was probably made with the best of intentions, but it sends out a curious mixed message in the final product.<br /><br />the folks at a western town where the railroad is coming through are overwhelmed by the arrival of immigrant railroad workers, working on the railroad being financed by robber baron edward arnold. there are a few ranchers and farmers whose land stands in the railroad's path and these folks are dealt with summarily by arnold's hired men. one man who won't give in is lionel barrymore whose son is coming home from harvard a lawyer and ready to take up the rancher's cause.<br /><br />only nelson eddy decides the best way to fight is to go zorro on the bad guys. but other than charles butterworth no one knows he's the wasp (a very interesting choice of names by the way). <br /><br />what arnold's done is used the tried and true methods of the political bosses of the east, getting the immigrants to vote. nelson's idea is simple, if the immigrants only knew the truth about what a bad guy arnold is, they'll vote with the original settlers and knock out the alien urban political machine in their midst. he kidnaps newspaper editor raymond walburn and takes him and the press to a mountain cave where some subversive newspapers are printed and distributed.<br /><br />the railroad workers are a real mixed bunch of immigrants, not the irish working west or the chinese working east as history has it. it's a real united nations working on arnold's railroad. the workers are kept in line by foreman victor mclaglen and nelson has the unenviable task of beating some sense into him like john wayne did in the quiet man.<br /><br />of all the films that starred jeanette and nelson and they certainly have come down in history as a duo, this was the worst of what they did at mgm. nelson is about to be hanged along with barrymore for crimes that are undefined at best, but certainly nothing worth being hung for. and virginia bruce who plays the nelson's girlfriend saves the day with a rendition of my country tis of thee that the immigrants join in with. in the face of a revolt by his paid for immigrant voters, arnold quite rationally packs up and leaves town to build his railroad somewhere else.<br /><br />i kid you not, that's the ending here. just what is the message, vote with the settlers and lose your jobs with arnold? but somehow you'll get by here? <br /><br />i do wonder some times if 20 years from after the incidents of this film take place and the town as settled into a sleepy backwater of the west while some towns where the railroad has come through that are now cities, that the good citizens of that town haven't rethought about what nelson eddy did. if they did they're probably running him out on a rail.<br /><br />nelson is of course in good voice and has a variety of concert and popular pieces to sing including a ballad to the immigrants written by sigmund romberg, where else but here. the song is a heartfelt tribute from an immigrant who did make good in his adopted country. too bad it didn't have a better venue.<br /><br />the almost platinum blonde virginia bruce i'm sure is dubbed here. and i'm sure jeanette macdonald was just as happy she wasn't accompanying nelson on this trip west.
