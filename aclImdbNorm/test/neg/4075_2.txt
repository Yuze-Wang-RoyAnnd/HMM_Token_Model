i gave this film a 2 mostly because it does actually have an ok cast but the film itself is just so (insert unusually rude word beginning with the sixth letter of the alphabet)-ing pointless that i felt bad that at the time i voted for it its lowest vote was a three.<br /><br />very predictable plot....two nare-do-well musicians have no money and plenty of money problems. however when a friend leaves a bag full of money (that belongs to drug dealers) in their care they of course spend it and then the "fun" begins.<br /><br />not an original idea in this whole film.
