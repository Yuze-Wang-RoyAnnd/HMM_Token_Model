when i first saw it 9 years ago, when i was 9. i thought it stunk. i'm 18 now and i still think it stinks. i mean geez no special effects or anything, it was boring and kinda anti-climatic. my cousin watched once and george takai (sulu) kept talking about how it was supposed to be so much better, but they kept cutting to the budget. it would have been a great episode, but it was a terrible movie.
