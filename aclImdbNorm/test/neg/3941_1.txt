honestly, i was a big fan on 'stay alive' trailer when it got released even some months before. i kept on telling my friend how this movie has a great story plot - and perhaps a good one. anyway - this movie is somewhat below my expectations.<br /><br />the plot has a great potential, but how the story unfolds, along with the acting , directing and bad cgi - this film is a disaster. the ghost doesn't make any sense, and including the killings - its all just too hurried, creating a sense of 'unrealistic' in the audience's mind.<br /><br />this film could be scary for some audiences - but fear in a sense of shock (due to the sound effect, etc) rather than enduring fear due to certain valid factors in the movie.<br /><br />you should re-consider watching this movie.
