snakes on a train starts as mexican couple brujo (a.j. castro) & alma (julia ruiz) cross the boarder into the us, they then illegally board a seventeen hour train to los angeles. however alma's family didn't approve of her & brujo's relationship & placed an ancient black magic curse on her that turns all her insides into snakes, ain't life a b*tch? as the snakes pour out of alma's mouth & slither away to other parts of the train they begin to infect the other passengers with the same unusual ailment...<br /><br />edited & directed by the mallachi brothers (although the imdb claims it's just one guy using a pseudonym, peter mervis) one has to say that i thought snakes on a train was crap, it's as simple as that really. it seems the entire film was set-up & made to cash in on the samuel l. jackson cult flick snakes on a plane (2006) by every horror fans least favourite production company the asylum who specialise in ripping-off big budget hollywood flicks & that style of money & film-making is no more evident than here with snakes on a train, making a film just because the title rhymes with a more successful film is not a good starting point. the script by eric forsberg is rubbish, for a start snakes on a plane was great fun whereas snakes on a train is a lot more serious & when you actually break it down & look at it this should have been much more light hearted. in fact it probably would have worked better as an scary movie (2000) type spoof. you know something, i am struggling to find one positive thing to say about snakes on a train it's that bad. for a start the character's are rubbish & it's impossible to emote with anyone, the story is downright awful & makes no sense (if people spew all those small snakes up where did the huge ones come from? why did alma turn into the giant snake at the end? why did bujo kill the train driver? how was he going to stop the train once it reached los angeles? where did that typhoon come from at the end?), it takes itself far too seriously, the first seventy odd minutes is so boring & uneventful i am surprised i stayed awake & it's just a very, very poor film on just about every level.<br /><br />director mervis only has a few train carriage car sets which all look pretty much alike so the film becomes very repetitive & dull to watch. there's barely any blood or gore, there are some snakes borrowing under a few peoples skin, someone gets shot & that's about it. the special effects are rubbish too, the giant cgi snake at the end is truly awful & the least said about it the better. it's not scary, there's zero atmosphere & it's a bit of a bore from start to finish. the real live snakes are a problem too, they are just so docile & nonthreatening. if you look at any scene featuring a real snake & an actor the snakes never make any move towards them or act aggressively & in fact always appear to want to slither away in the opposite direction.<br /><br />shot in california technically the film is obviously low budget & it show's, basically it looks cheap because it is. the acting isn't great not that the actor's are given any sort of material to work with.<br /><br />snakes on a train is rubbish, i am sorry but that's how i feel & i don't quite know how else to describe it. i really can't see what anyone would get out of watching snakes on a train, it really is that bad.
