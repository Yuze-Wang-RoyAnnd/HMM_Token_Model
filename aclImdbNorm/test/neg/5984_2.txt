it starts out looking like it may be going somewhere, then quickly leads the main characters into a three-ring circus of remarkable stupidity which permanently destroys any likability of the characters. i'm a huge collector of stoner movies, but this is something i would not consider a valid addition. bong water is trash from the very deepest regions of the dumpster, and i wouldn't be caught dead with this on my shelf. i'm actually convinced this movie was created by a partnership for a drug free america. if you're a jack black fan then i would say that you may think 5 minutes of the movies is ok because jack black continues his legacy of singing songs for retards. i really can't say enough bad things about this movie.
