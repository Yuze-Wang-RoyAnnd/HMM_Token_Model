now, i am going to do this without putting spoilers if i can. my cousin and i were renting movies the other weekend, and we stumbled across this, with the big freaking' scarecrow on the cover. it looked cool, so we rented it alongside kungfu hustle.<br /><br />wow... just... wow.<br /><br />to start off, the movie was horrible. now, the box art, opening scenes, and music was decent-to-well done, but the movie itself is horrendous. the acting is sub-par (sean, the lead, shows hardly any emotion and/or effort in his character), the scarecrows look nothing like the one on the cover (false advertising, perhaps?), and the camera shots and angles were that of a bad wrestling event.<br /><br />and trust me, i'm a wrestling fan. i know bad camera angles. and honestly, this is right up there with gigli and pootie tang. it's done so bad that it amuses me. it makes me laugh. so, somehow, this movie takes its place as a good comedy to me.<br /><br />but, to be fair, it does serve as a what to do and what not to do in movies, especially of the slasher genre. i recommend that people do watch this, just to get a good grasp of what to avoid.
