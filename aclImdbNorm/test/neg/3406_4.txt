let me preface by stating that i have lived in louisville, kentucky all of my life. i grew up about  1/2  mile from waverly. in the wintertime we would pull our sleds down maryman road and cross dixie highway to go sleigh riding on waverly hill. many times during the winter of 76-77 we would climb into the tunnel to warm ourselves. the place was still being run as a "geriatric center" at the time. we would go all the way through the tunnel up the hill to bang on what we thought was the "door to the morgue". i have to be honest. the only sensation we felt was that we were getting away with something we should not be doing. i would have to say we went up that tunnel over 50 times that winter. nothing stranger than teen-aged boys acting stupid ever happened. i love the fact that it is getting attention after all these years. one evening when i was young we looked out our front porch and it appeared that the entire hill was on fire. there was an older hospital on the hill that burned down. it burned for hours while the entire neighborhood sat outside and watched. the thing that gets lost about waverly is that many people survived tb there. let's face it
