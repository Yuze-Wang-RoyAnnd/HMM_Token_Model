my website (www.theflickguy.org) lists this pick as the worst movie of all time. here is an excerpt: <br /><br />"if i were strapped down to a chair and forced to watch this movie over and over again, i couldn't imagine hell being any worse. jim varney plays a three-handed crazy guy bent on destroying the world (apparently starting with cinema). now let's face it, no one expects a whole lot from a varney movie, but this agonizing drivel had me dry-heaving for 92 minutes. not a laugh. not one. this is not kamp or gitchy, this is not even mindless. it is evil. do not rent this, it may destroy your dvd player. do not even buy the vhs from a 29-cent clearance bin to use as a blank tape. it is the worst film of all time. period. i mean it. really."
