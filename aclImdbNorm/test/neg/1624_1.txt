i just read an extra long review on the front page of this movie on this site and he explained in full detail that this movie is only worth watching on the television show "mystery science theater 3000!!!!!" and yes, i do find that advice really helpful! i mean, a movie that tries to be this good and this exciting just really is not what that movie wants to be!!!!! so yes, do watch this movie as seen on that show and instead of giving this movie a single star out of ten stars, you can give this a ten out of ten stars! until then, my one star review is for the real, pure, untouched version of this movie only!!!!!! got that now?
