as a native of new orleans, i can state that almost everything in this movie, from the atrocious n'awlins dialect to the highly creative "manipulation" of crescent city geography, is horrible. this is another one of those big hollywood movies that decides to stereotype new orleans as: 1. a city full of french-sounding idiots 2. a city full of people who sound as if they've just returned from blanche dubois' summer home 3. a city of drunkards, where every day is mardi gras 4. a city of deep mystery, where almost everyone practices or is a victim of voodoo (i admit that maybe we are a city of drunkards; although every day is not mardi gras). "the big easy" is one of the worst films about new orleans. i wouldn't recommend it to anybody.
