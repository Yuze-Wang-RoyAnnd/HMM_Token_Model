with david arquette starring you would immediately think this to be a stupid movie. well, it is a stupid movie with a horrid script. but the f/x, namely the eight legged freaks, makes this flick a hoot to watch. a tribute, albeit on the silly side, to those great mutant creature features of the 50s. arquette and sheriff sam(kari wuhrer)summon help in fighting off the toxic waste induced giant spiders wreaking havoc on their tiny town in arizona. also in the cast are doug e. doug, rick overton, leon rippy and the charming scarlett johansson.
