jack frost 2. the worst "horror film" i have ever seen. why? 1)the premise is well beyond ridiculous 2) the damn thing doesn't even have legs to move on! 3) it escapes after being completely submerged in anti-freeze (first film) 4) get this...it travels all the way across an ocean of salt water to a tropical island to get revenge on the sheriff that did him in the first film. 5) "killer snowballs". i have yet to be drunk enough to see "ginger dead man" so as of the writing of this, jack frost 2 hold the distinction of being the stupidest "horror" film ever. even surpassing the inaneness of it's predecessor (if you can believe that!).
