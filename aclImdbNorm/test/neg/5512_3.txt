this movie is a desperate attempt to ride the skirtales of the success of the star wars movies. the film uses recycled footage from "battle beyond the sars" which is another roger corman sci-fi turd, but atleast this one is better than "battle beyond the stars" - there is no real acting in this film (but its a roger corman film-what did you expect)again the entire soundtrack was done on a keyboard/synthasizer, the sound effects are recycled from "battlestar galactica" - there are no special effects because they were recycled/rearranged space scenes from another movie, the costumes look like something right out of 1981 salvation army salvage. --ironicaly, the little boy in this film gives one helluva performance, and he'd resurface again to star in the sylvester stallone movie "over the top" - i give this movie 3 stars out of 10
