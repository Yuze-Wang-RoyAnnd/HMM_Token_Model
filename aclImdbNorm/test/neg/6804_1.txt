hadn't really heard too much about this movie so i went and saw it. i realized that this movie only appeals to someone who has not lived in the real world. and even those people would think this movie moved too slowly.<br /><br />when the movie opens up, you see nicole kidman going to a nudist camp. whoa. shock. that scene, the dialouge, were all great. and then the movie went downhill.<br /><br />while i respect the vision the filmmaker must have, this movie sucked. it was too slow, too predictable, and not moving enough. robert downey jr. is great, as usual, but this movie is not good enough to sit through. it tries to be shocking and abnormal but makes poor use of the talents of all the actors.<br /><br />don't waste your money, even the sex scenes were boring.
