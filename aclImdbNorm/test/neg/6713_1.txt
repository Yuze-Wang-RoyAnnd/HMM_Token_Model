i believe cockpuncher to be the best piece of work that has come out of the steven seagal factory in a long time. this movie was the first one i have seen since that fine film preview. my point? he is done. every movie is the same. maybe he will be good in machete because he won't be the star. we can only hope.<br /><br />p.s. thanks for speaking to ucsb when i went to college. it was an amazing speech. you really influenced some people out there.<br /><br />so i have to write ten lines about this movie? umm....i like the smoker guy who killed a bunch of fools. whenever anyone smells menthol's look out. because there could be a killer with a silenced glock (and another loud one) who wants to kill you.<br /><br />is that ten?
