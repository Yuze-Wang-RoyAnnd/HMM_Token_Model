mind-numbingly boring, utterly predictable and in the end simply laughable. that pretty much sums up the disaster that is indecent proposal. starting with a decent premise the whole thing just unravels and becomes a complete mess. basically the story boils down to the question, "would you let your wife sleep with another man for one million dollars?" here of course the answer is yes because otherwise we wouldn't have a movie. quite frankly, we'd have been better off if we didn't have a movie.<br /><br />our married (and financially troubled) couple are played by woody harrelson and demi moore. they go to vegas to get rich. yeah, that'll work. anyhow, a billionaire, played by robert redford, takes a liking to the wife and makes the million dollar offer. for one night with the wife he will give them financial security. the aftermath of that one night is what the movie is really all about. unfortunately nothing in that aftermath is the least bit entertaining. the script is so predictable you can say the characters' lines before they do. the performances leave much to be desired. harrelson would be better off sticking to comedies as this attempt at serious acting completely misses the mark. anguish is not something he seems capable of portraying. and it is quite safe to say that demi moore will never have to clear space in her home for any academy awards. why is she a movie star again? in a part that should be full of emotion she conveys none. only redford escapes mostly unscathed. he's appropriately slimy yet suave and clearly the best actor of the bunch. but he can't save this film. awful script, lousy acting, plodding pace, zero entertainment...indecent proposal is downright awful.
