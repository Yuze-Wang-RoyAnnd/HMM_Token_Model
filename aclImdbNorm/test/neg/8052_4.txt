i first watched kindred in 1987 along with another movie called devouring waves. i remember back then i hated them both and i have never really bothered to watch them again.<br /><br />however i have recently started a crusade to collect as many 80's horror titles in their original boxed form, that have been deleted for some time. i have got myself quite a proud collection with many more titles on my list!<br /><br />the kindred although i have not as yet got a copy is high priority as all the old movies i didn't like back then, i now own and have now re-watched and think they are brilliant and the bits i do remember of the kindred are now driving me to want to get hold of a copy a.s.a.p.<br /><br />hurray for the 80's and long live horror!
