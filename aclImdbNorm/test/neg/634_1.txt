*this review may contain spoilers... or maybe not. the warning is the same for all*<br /><br />dang it. just when i thought that scifi channel had used all of its ridiculous ideas for movies, they give us this. actually, the plot itself it's nothing we haven't seen in movies like snakes on a plane, deep blue sea, etc... that means, a monster/animal/menace of some kind is lurking in a close environment threatening a bunch of people. in this case, an alien in a train. wow.<br /><br />i must say that, when i first saw this thing on cable, i couldn't stop laughing. no scifi film had prepared me for this; it was so incredibly pathetic i couldn't believe it! the actors are all a bunch of stereotypical-genre characters. but since they're not so famous (to say the least), i wasn't expecting much of them. except diamond phillips. no comments there, but i think the guy was desperate to find a job. the problem was something called 'special effects', horrible even for scifi channel standards. that model/toy they made us believe it was a real train (not to mention the model/toy helicopter, bigger than a train's wagon), the meteor coming horizontally from space, the 'baby' alien (a sock puppet, and i ain't kiddin'), the regular aliens who looked pretty ugly... while they were static; when they started "moving", it was awful, the explosions (the terrorist blew up literally! and what about the exploding helicopter! just how many barrels of gas was that thing carrying?), the insane mathematics used (they couldn't even solve a school problem right!)... and i won't talk about that doomsday-like ending, by that time i didn't know if to keep laughing or to start crying. if i remember right, i did both.<br /><br />it's an ideal movie to have a good laugh, alone or with friends. but be warned; it's so ridiculous at so many levels... and you need a heck of a lot of suspension of disbelief...
