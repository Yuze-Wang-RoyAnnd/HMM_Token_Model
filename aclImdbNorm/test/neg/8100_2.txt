bela lugosi is a real enigma. in the early 1930s, he was on top of the world after appearing in dracula. yet, again and again, he made lousy decisions regarding his career. perhaps he had a bad agent, perhaps his drinking and drug use had a part in it or maybe he was just crazy. regardless, he ruined his reputation by appearing in pretty much any film--ranging from excellent horror films (such as the raven) to big-budget flicks (like ninotchka) to grade-z flicks for the cheapest and shoddiest of studios. interestingly enough, although he agreed to do this terrible film, he actually turned down the role that later went to boris karloff in frankenstein! as for this movie, it is a very silly an horridly produced wwii propaganda film that featured a dumb plot and wretched editing. lugosi spends much of the movie murdering saboteurs--not a bad thing at all. but at the end, we find out that he is himself a nazi plastic surgeon and all the american-looking men he killed were actually japanese!!!! the funniest part of this is during a flashback. you see lugosi talking to a group of japanese men before he changes them to american-like men. when the camera scans them, the men are clearly asian. but, on all the other non-close-up shots, they are all very western looking--many with bald heads!! they looked absolutely nothing like japanese men. i suspect the plot must have undergone a re-write and this might account for the obvious mistake. or, it could just be shoddy production values and editing. in fact, early in the film, they show a street scene in the city and all the cars (circa 1942) are old model t fords--obviously from stock footage!!! the bottom line is that the film is bad but also very dull. unlike plan 9 from outer space, it's hard to laugh at the ineptitude--just be put to sleep by it.
