negative numbers are not available to convey how bad this movie is! wooden acting coupled with a story line that has been rehashed dozens of times. everyone in this movie should attend overactors anonymous. you would think an original story could evolve from the general concept. young men at a prep school are tying to come to grips with the pearl harbor bombing. it does raise interesting questions, but the manner in which they are conveyed make it more of a joke. the typical characters were present including the zealous jock and nerd (glasses included). i could not have been more uninterested in the wooden dialog and clich'e characters. upon the completion of the movie, i had to throw the dvd in the trash. stay far away from this dud! you won't get the 90 minutes of your life back!
