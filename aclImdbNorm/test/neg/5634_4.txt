what a shame that some good talent was wasted. this is a tedious and overly self-conscious movie, that could tell its story in half the time. is that derek jacobi under that beard doing two roles? gosh, who would have guessed.<br /><br />the emotional payoff a the end was weak and unsatisfying. certainly not worth enduring the padded length of the movie for. i felt quite let down.<br /><br />the sound was dreadful. first, they used stock music. second, it was so loud during some of the dialog, that the words were hard to make out. only three sound crew, and a trainee? there were more people listed in the credits for either the accounting or the legal.<br /><br />some of the camera work was quite good though, and the actors did a good job with a mediocre script.<br /><br />not a good use of viewing time, at least for me.
