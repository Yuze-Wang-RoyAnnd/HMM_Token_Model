well, how to start? i saw the italian job for the first time some years ago and visiting a rental shop i couldn't quite remember why i had a bad feeling about it. now i do.<br /><br />after voting for the ratings for this film i saw the statistics. apparently this film appeals most to under 18 girls. no wonder. they didn't pay enough to charlize to flash and i guess some girls magazine has rated mark wahlbergs abs "awesome".<br /><br />other than that this film is completely predictable, the actors are mainly forever b-stars and even the good ones are being misused horribly, the film is filled with obvious product placement and imagine this: it even manages to repeat itself without doing a sequel! the first 15 minutes are the best part of the film and it's all downhill from there and once they figured this out they decided to use the finest hour again in the end repeating-to-detail their gold heist. all in all, lots of noise about nothing.<br /><br />i think charlize theron is good and ed norton could be more as he's been before. apart from donald sutherland's "look, i'm here too" appearing in the beginning i'd say this movie ought to have a "pass if you're above 18" all over it.
