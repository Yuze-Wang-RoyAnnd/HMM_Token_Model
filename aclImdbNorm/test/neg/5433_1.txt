if you can make it through this flick without laughing out loud at the screen, you are a better filmgoer than i.<br /><br />count the logic lapses, common-sense leaps, and credibility stretches... betcha need more than two hands!<br /><br />p.s.: if one more film uses a location that is clearly ucla, and claims that it is a different university (in this movie's case: berkeley), i'm going to lose it.
