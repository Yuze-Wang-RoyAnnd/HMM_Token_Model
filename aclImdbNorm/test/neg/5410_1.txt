my wife and i enjoy bad science fiction movies. some movies are so bad they are good. mansquito was one of those. that one was bad but it had some redeeming qualities. it makes you wonder how a self respecting actor approaches lines like "hey! mansquito!"<br /><br />this one is so bad it has now taken its place as our standard for bad. it isn't just a bad movie, it really stinks. there was the coed strike force, the "indian" that rode around in a black cloak and used a sword for crying out loud. he shot down a helicopter with an arrow!! <br /><br />we tried to laugh at this movie but there were no points at which it didn't rise above pitiful. we couldn't come up with any redeeming features except for one. those were the words "the end"<br /><br />there seemed to be no plot, no character development, and no point to the movie. someone in hollywood needs to be fired.
