(spoilers more than likely... nothing really important you couldn't have figured out yourselves) yeah, it's really weird. i rented it at a blockbuster for the reason it had absolutely no description of the movie on the back of the box, only a list of the bands that had songs in it. but after that, i had a dikens of a time finding it, even here on imdb. i kept confusing it with "night of the demons," but, you know, they're basically the same thing. <br /><br />the parts i loved most about this movie was the whole thing in the garage. that black gym guy was hilarious the way he screamed all the time. even when screaming wasn't really necessary, he'd let out a "listen up now!! block the door with cars!!!!" and so, they'd run cars head on into other cars. but, then he got balls and shafted by a zombie with a broom stick i believe it was. the other part that kinda caught my attention was the part with the crash outside the building with the guys that they girl didn't want to come over... to what significant aspect of the movie did that give us? what was it? why was it there? why did the movie end with a guy breaking the tv's in a studio? i saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen, but he was kinda far away. i mean, he could have just turned the tv off. yes, this movie was shot on a whim and yes, i hated it. good day...
