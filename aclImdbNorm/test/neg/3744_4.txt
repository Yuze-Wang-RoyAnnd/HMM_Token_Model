there's potential in there with "tell no-one". a curious and intriguing plot, and a french take on a very american story. but for me, the opportunities were not exercised here.<br /><br />although i liked aspects of this film, there were three prominent failings which pulled it right down to four out of ten.<br /><br />firstly, it's a silly, clich'ed murder mystery. a particularly contrived murder she wrote or bergerac. being french doesn't eliminate this problem - it's just silly and in french at the same time. it's full of implausible coincidences.<br /><br />secondly, the transition from the us to france seems to have failed chronically. this french doctor hanging out on "the streets" of a french city with his new "homies" and their blingin' suvs... and then there's the car chases...<br /><br />but thirdly and mostly, it's just too darn long. to me, a film needs a good reason to be significantly over 90 minutes, and over two hours takes some serious justification. this once didn't have it.
