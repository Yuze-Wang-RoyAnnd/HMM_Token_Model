i suggest if you have already seen the original american graffiti, do not see this movie. if you haven't seen the original, i still don't recommend this, but it will be a lot less painful to watch. the characters from the first film are great, and by the end you fell a connection to them. this movie sets out to show how bad their lives have become. it's a chore to watch!<br /><br />set on new year's eve in 1964, '65, '66 and '67, we have four stories about the characters from the first film. in '64, we have john milner (paul le mat) who is now a professional drag racer. he meets a foreign girl eva, and though his plot really goes nowhere, it's the best of the four. in 1965, we have toad (charles martin smith) who is stuck in vietnam, and more than anything, he wants out. he tries to find ways to hurt himself or do stupid things to get out. in '66, we have debbie (candy clark), the girl who toad picked up in the first movie. now she is a pot smoking hippie, and really i'm not sure what her plot was about. it was her going to a concert...not much of anything happened. finally, in 1967, steve bolander (ron howard) and laurie bolander (cindy williams) are having marriage problems that end in a anti-war rally and police action.<br /><br />none of these stories are very good. the script in some parts features very, very bad dialogue. these poor characters who i enjoyed so much in the first film, ended up where they are here...why? why was this sequel made? i guess if a sequel was made, it had to feature the vietnam war, and hippies and police action, but the real thing is that this movie shouldn't have been made.<br /><br />the direction was stylish, but it just amounts in a huge headache. each story has a different style. milner's is just a regular (depending on how you watch it) wide screen, and is filmed how the rest of the movie should be. toad's plot was shot in 16mm, and what it amounts to is a poor looking picture, which is the size of a small box in the middle of the screen. debbie's plot is shot in multi-screen. at one point there might have been one screen, but for the good majority, it's anywhere from two to twenty screens up at once. don't bother trying to follow the screens, since there's nothing going on anyways. steve and laurie's plot has the weirdest filming style. it's style really doesn't mean anything, and is dumb and pointless. instead of just a full widescreen, it's a condensed widescreen that looks like a full screen version of widescreen. though i don't like the others, at least i understand what they were going for, this one just doesn't make sense.<br /><br />the music is this movie's saving grace, not that it could save this! bob dylan, simon and grafunkel, stevie wonder, marvin gaye and dozens of others have nice songs featured here. they don't save the feature, they just make it a little better than it is. it's still bad! <br /><br />overall, this is a pointless sequel. any fan of the original should avoid this lackluster sequel! <br /><br />my rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 110 mins. pg for language, drug use and violence
