i have seen this movie and in all honestly was quite disappointed. and in my opinion this movie lacks heart. i frankly didn't care what happen to the characters by the end of the movie. <br /><br />there was so much there they could have done with the movie that they didn't because they were either so rapped up in trying to be obscure and make some deep comment on life, or trying so hard not to, that the characters and story were completely lost in all of it. i have seen another picture by this director and enjoyed it well enough. but i felt this film lack of the whimsy and heart of the other and i was left wondering what the point was, or if the point of the movie was that it had no point. honestly, while i didn't feel like tearing my hair out during the movie, i did remorse the lost time on the sad little film.<br /><br />i have no doubt that some people will love this movie, but frankly i didn't.
