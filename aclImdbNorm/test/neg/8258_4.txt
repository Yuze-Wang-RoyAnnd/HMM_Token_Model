in "red letters", coyote is at the vortex of as a college professor who writes to a female prison inmate and gets more than he bargained for. there are two reasons to watch this flick...kinski is one and piven the other although it's difficult for their sparks to shine in such a complete directorial disaster. everything is wrong with "red letters"...convoluted, lousy screenplay, camera, editing, and most of all acting which is subpar for coyote, etc. battersby has taken a story with potential and turned it into a seriously flawed and amateurish flick not worth the time.
