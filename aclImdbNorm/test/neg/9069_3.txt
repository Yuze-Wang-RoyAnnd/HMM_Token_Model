the 70s were without a doubt the golden age of "made-for-tv" horror. this is one of those that was probably churned out as an abc movie of the week. it's the old story of a house and/or ghost possessing one of the new owners. the movie has promise, but it's never realized. everything is rushed too much. tension and suspense need time to build and grow. and there's nothing new. we've seen it all before and one better.<br /><br />one final thought: i don't understand why robert wagner's character would fall for the long dead movie star when he's married to kate jackson for goodness sake!!!
