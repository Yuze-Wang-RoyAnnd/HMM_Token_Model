i was very disappointed in this film. the director has shown some talent in his other endeavors, but this just seemed to be filler. there may have been a deep meaning behind it, but it seems to me to be nothing but a director who has access to some toys.<br /><br />i would highly recommend his other works to people, but certainly not this one. as i watched it, i kept on thinking it would pick up after an initial slow period, but it never did. at the end of the movie i was neither entertained nor moved nor thought of things in a new way. i could only say to myself, "what was that?"<br /><br />there were a few really striking parts of the film, but not enough to warrant sitting through it again.
