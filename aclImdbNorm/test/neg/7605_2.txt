this sequel is quite awful to be honest. i'm a fan of kung-fu movies and this is by far the worst i've seen. bride with white hair 1 was actually quite good and this is a huge disappointment. bwwh 1 was brilliant in some ways with an unique odd-ball evil bad guy.<br /><br />the couple from the first movie played a small role in this movie. instead the movie revolves around a bunch of uninteresting characters trying to seek revenge on their fallen clans. but there's no antagonist in this movie so the revenge is mute.<br /><br />the worst part to this movie is the kung-fu or lack there of. they literally had a street style knife fight. the character at the end refused to fight because there was lack of choreography.
