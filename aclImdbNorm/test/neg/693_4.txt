wrestlemania 2 is the only wrestlemania|thank god| to be held at three different locations, and while it was an interesting idea, it didn't really work. there are only really two matches that really struck out, with the rest being decent, or most of them, pretty terrible. there are some entertaining celebrity's on hand, like susan saint james, ray charles and cathy crosby, but the experience was a waste of time for the most part. the british bulldgos vs the dream team match, is worth the price of admission itself, but you can honestly see that anywhere.<br /><br />matches.<br /><br />nassau coliseum.<br /><br />paul orndorff vs the magnificent muraco/w mr.fuji. for the time it had, and despite the crappy finish, this was surprisingly bearable stuff, with the crowd being really into it. crowd chants "bullsh*t" at the end. that being said it did nothing for either's career. match ends in a double count out with them fighting outside the ring<br /><br />2/5<br /><br />intercontinental championship match. randy savage|c| vs george "the animal" steele. not that great wrestling wise, but heavily entertaining due to the antics involved, and some great comedy from steele, besides savage can wrestle a potato and make it look interesting. savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes, for leverage.<br /><br />2 1/2 /5<br /><br />jake "the snake" roberts vs george wells. for a throwaway match, this was better than it should have been, but it's too short to make any impact what so ever. roberts wins with the ddt, pulling out the snake afterwords, which disgusts saint james.<br /><br />1 1/2 /5<br /><br />boxing match. mr.t/w the hati kid&joe frazier vs roddy piper/w lou duva&bob orton. a huge failure in my opinion. i was bored senseless throughout this, and while it may have been a marketing success, it certainly didn't succeed at entertaining me. lot of rowdy chants are noticeable as well. t wins by dq, when piper slams t.<br /><br />1/5<br /><br />rosemont horizon<br /><br />women's title match. fabulous moolah|c| vs velvet mcintyre. ends too quickly, before it even gets a chance to start, making a record for quick pin fall, as far as woman's matches are concerned. moolah wins when she takes advantage of velvet's missed splash from the top rope<br /><br />0/5<br /><br />corporal kirchner vs nikolai volkoff/w classy freddie blassie. big pop for the corporal. stupid match up, with boring offense from both involved, while being much too short to matter. corporal wins when he whacks volkoff with blassie's cane.<br /><br />1/5<br /><br />battle royal. william perry and andre get the biggest pops. this is pretty entertaining stuff, despite all the nfl talent involved. it's also noteworthy for bret hart's 1st ever wrestlemania appearance. andre wins when he chucks the hart foundation out.<br /><br />2 1/2 /5<br /><br />tag team titles. british bulldogs/w lou albano&ozzy osbourne vs the dream team/w johnny valiant|c|. absolutely tremendous match, that is one of the best wrestlemania matches of all time. you won't have time to catch your breath, with all the maneuvers on hand, and the excellent in ring psychology. this is pure wrestling at it's finest, you cannot call yourself a wrestling fan, if you dislike this match. bulldogs win when dynamite kid collide's heads with valentine<br /><br />4/5<br /><br />los angeles memorial sports arena<br /><br />ricky steamboat vs hercules hernandez. pretty decent match up here, with both men putting on solid performances. hercules is a nasty brute, with above average skills, and it contrasted well with steamboat's high-flying style. steamboat wins with a high-flying cross body off the top rope.<br /><br />2 1/2 /5<br /><br />adrian adonis vs uncle elmer. terrible match, with annoying comedy involved. the fans love uncle elmer, but i do not. adonis wins with a top rope maneuver.<br /><br />0/5<br /><br />the funk brothers vs tito santana&jyd. pretty solid match here, with a lot of memorable bumps taken from terry funk|the one through the table was something else for that time|. i would have to rate this as my 2nd favorite. funks win with help from jimmy hart's megaphone.<br /><br />3/5<br /><br />wwf championship. hulk hogan|c| vs king kong bundy. decent pop for hogan. one of the most over-hyped matches in wrestlemania history. hogan can't wrestle worth a lick, and bundy is not that great himself. the violence was brutal for the time, but hogan's superhero act is kind of annoying, and there are too many boring moments. hogan wins when he escapes before bundy.<br /><br />1/5<br /><br />bottom line. wrestlemania 2 is a failure in most aspects. die hard wrestling fans should see this once, but you really don't have too. there isn't enough here, to satisfy a true wrestling fan. vince blew it on this one. don't be fooled by the hype of the main event, it really is a boring affair, like most of the card. not recommended, and ranks as one of the worst wrestlemania's, outside of the brilliant tag title match.<br /><br />4/10
