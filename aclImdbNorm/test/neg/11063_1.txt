this must be one of the worse movies that i have ever seen. on a par with blair witch and just as annoying. the flashing helmet lights made things difficult to see and i think that epileptics should take heed as there are moments with strobing that makes this movie even more annoying. i think if they had been quieter they might have found a way out. then when you think the geek might come up trumps even he resorts to a nervous breakdown. oh and when is the guy who is having sex realise that when the girl says she can hear something. she can really hear something. one of these guys must have at least seen scream (where they draw your attention to such things) it is also a big let-down when a premise offers so much promise and then someone writes the script. so sorry folks i got this on weekly at the video shop and i would still like my money back.
