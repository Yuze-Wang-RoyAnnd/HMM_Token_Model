the peace and beauty of koyaanisqatsi was a powerful affirmation of the natural world. in naqoyqatsi, we are assaulted by images of the synthetic, the competitive, the violent, and the digital -- the destructive constructs of our culture.<br /><br />some liberties are taken with the images, with posterization, distressing, and much slow motion. the connections between the sequences are inscrutable, if there are any. naqoyqatsi is defined at the film's end, a missed opportunity to place the images in context.<br /><br />the film is difficult to watch, the quality of the archival footage uneven, and it's most redeeming qualities are its theme and the hypnotic score of philip glass.
