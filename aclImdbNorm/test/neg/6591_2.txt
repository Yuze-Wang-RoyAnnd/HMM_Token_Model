this movie was filmed in my hometown and i was acquainted with many of the "actors" in minor rolls. most of them were students at the local karate school and even at the time it was filmed we all knew what a stinker it was. it was interesting however to see it being made. most of the places it was filmed at no longer exist, such as the nightclub, the pizza shop, etc. the "world premiere" was held at the akron civic theatre and we all laughed hysterically at how inane it was. i personally believe it's the worst movie ever made but it brings back many fond memories for me. watch this movie with a word of advice...enjoy it for what it is..a very low budget, poorly made , karate flick.
