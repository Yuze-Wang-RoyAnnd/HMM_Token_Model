i was so looking forward to seeing this at the film festival in sydney. i left the theater, like many others, before the end credits because i couldn't sit through it any longer. it was badly shot, the sound sucks, and the acting was worse than an episode of the love boat. now i know why this film hasn't been able to find an american distribution company to release it in the united states. this screams of a low budget high school production.
