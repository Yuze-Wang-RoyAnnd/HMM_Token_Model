i was truly looking forward to this title. it sounded and looked fun. the idea of someone making a cheesy 50s monster movie could have been worth a few laughs, but instead this title only bores. first off, there is almost no froggg in the entire movie which is the biggest disappointment. i have to sit through 75+ minutes of lame drama and dialog to get a few glimpses of the froggg humping a bare breasted chick. why? on top of that the film lacks any sort of fun plot. i mean give me something thats a bit more interesting than just a bunch of talking heads. i wanted to see some hot chicks search for the creature in the swamp, i wanted to see some cuties dragged off to his lair in desperate need of rescue (creature from the black lagoon stuff), i wanted to see a few goofy action scenes of the froggg going on a killing spree, or it maybe escaping a silly trap. something exciting! geez, have fun with it, be creative! who wants to sit through endless and tiring dialog scenes in a creature flick? my advice to the filmmakers: keep going, your concepts are good, but your execution needs to be a lot more inspired. have some fun with the creature, put the humor in the action and most important...put more creature in a creature movie!!!
