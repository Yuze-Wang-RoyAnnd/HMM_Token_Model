alien express is one of the worst movies i've bothered to experience.<br /><br />the plot is predictable. the aliens look like rubber sock puppets. the effects would have been mediocre in the 70's, but are just atrocious by today's standards. couldn't they take a shot of a real train instead of using an obvious model?<br /><br />the acting isn't great but, really, the dialogue is the worst part. it gouges its way into your mind. "don't you die on me. not now." if you ever manage to suspend disbelief long enough to be absorbed into the movie, you'll rapidly be jolted painfully back to reality by the aliens, the model train, or the clich'ed dialogue.<br /><br />the only reason i didn't give this movie a "1" is that it doesn't deserve to be rated so badly that some poor suckers might watch it for the pleasure inherent in a truly bad film.
