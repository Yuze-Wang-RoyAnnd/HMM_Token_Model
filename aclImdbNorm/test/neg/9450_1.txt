dreamland started out moderately interesting but never went anywhere except tedium city. a low rent affair with no name actors and laughable effects, not recommended for any reason. the best thing that could be said is it looks like they really filmed it on location in the nevada desert. that's it, i can't think of one thing good besides that about this stinker. the finale is supposed to be some kind of revelation but falls flat like the rest. oh, i thought of one other good point about this cheese, it clocks in at just over an hour although it still wears out its welcome long before then. when the girl starts walking around in the desert at night it seems to last forever and just keeps getting worse from there. the attempts at horror aren't effective in the least. the story is an attempt at a twilight zone style feel but fails badly. check out "retroactive" for a good science fiction b-movie.
