imagine yourself trapped inside a museum of the dark middle ages and a resurrected vampire and his maniacal sidekick are chasing you. where is the absolute last place you want to hide? i'd say inside the uncanny virgin of nuremberg torture device, because there's a good risk you'll get brutally spiked to death. and yet, the elderly lady in this film stupidly runs into her spiked coffin. "the vampire's coffin" is a rather disappointing sequel, as director fernando m'endez doesn't re-create the gothic atmosphere of the 1957-original but puts the emphasis on comical situations and dialogs. no more ominous castles with eerie cobwebs and dark vaults, but confused doctors and clumsy assistants that provoke laughs instead of frights. the story opens inside count de lavud's final resting place, where an eminent doctor and a hired assistant steal the coffin in order to examine the corpse at a private clinic. naturally the wooden stake gets removed from his heart, and the vampire count comes to live again, immediately enslaving the petty thief to do his dirty work. the vampire has his eye on a beautiful female patient at the clinic, and it's up to dr. enrique sald'ivar to rescue her soul and to destroy the bloodsucker. "the vampire's coffin" uses a limited amount of locations and there's very little action. the whole film would actually be pretty boring if it weren't for a handful of memorable sequences and decent acting performances. the photography is amazing, though, with the sublime use of shadows and darkness. this is most notably during the scene in which count de lavud stalks a young woman through the deserted streets of little town at night. it's the only truly worthwhile scene of the whole film, the rest is fairly mediocre and d'ej`a-vu.
