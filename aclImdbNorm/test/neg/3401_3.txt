how is this a documentary? much more like a walking ghost tour one might take in any given southern city. quotes were generously dropped throughout without the first effort at identifying the source. george orwell was the most identified quoter. <br /><br />documents were referred to without ever being produced in any form. flat out fraudulent shots depicting period film stock were spliced aside historical film reels with no separation from reality and self-promotion. film reels which were entirely unrealistic and improbable for the time at hand were dropped in, as if trying to ape blair witch, hoping to drum up a spook house on what would otherwise simply be dead real estate. <br /><br />is this not in some way a great disrespect to actual victims of tb, a dance on their collective graves for the sake of commercialism? the line between actual footage and manufactured self-service is so thin; the drippings of doubt so insignificantly played down; the scientific boundaries so blatantly ignored... how could this possibly be listed in my tivo as documentary? <br /><br />it's a vacation promo, and at that it fully succeeds.<br /><br />hell, i'd visit the joint if i could locate it on google earth. not scary said a previous poster. not too serious either, says i. fascinating story. flimsy film-making.
