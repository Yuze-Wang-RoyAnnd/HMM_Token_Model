apparently the writer and director of this direct-to-dvd slasher movie is a fan of friday 13th and other summer camp slashers. this movie has everything - a group of teenagers who want to spend the weekend with fun, alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called "camp blood", the old man who warns them not to go there; and of course the crazy killer with the machete who keeps on slashing and hacking at the teenagers without any reason at all... the whole thing could have worked if it had been shot on 35 mm film with acceptable special effects. but instead the special effects are poorly done. the killer walks around as if he's out on a sunday afternoon stroll, and the only good things about this movie are the acting of the talented main actress and the sex scene at the beginning. other than that - dull and forgettable. jasper p. morgan
