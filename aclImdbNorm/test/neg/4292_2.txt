great actors, good filming, a potentially interesting plot, and what should have been good dialog. nothing else is good about this movie. perhaps the writer or director thought they could make a thought provoking film out of annoying characters who are as deep as a cup of coffee. <br /><br />within 10 minutes i disliked the portrayal of kim by caroleen feeney so much that it became a distraction. while kim is supposed to be an unsympathetic character, i am not sure i was supposed to want to commit acts of physical violence upon her. the first (of many) bizarre things that happen is that wes (david strathairn) goes from "i am missing $50.00" to "she stole 50$" in about 3 seconds. it was quite implausible, since she (kim) never had access to his wallet nor was she a master pickpocket-- there simply was no rational reason to suspect her. most people have lost/misplaced money and assume just that... we lost it. same goes for kim later. all very unrealistic behavior in what is supposed to be (i think) a look at real people. the character of kim was, at minimum, suffering from a bipolar disorder. wes had huge inadequacy issues, nancy was just boring, and matt was delusional (particularly about music). i actually turned this off about 2/3 of the way through. however, to write a valid comment, i forced myself to turn it back on hoping that something would come together in this movie. no, sorry, it was still bad. make it a point to miss this one.
