this film has some nice special effects, tearing apart the japanese archipelago to a degree that would humble godzilla. the two leads also put in above-par performances. apart from that, it is all a bit ropey in this understated disaster flick. the incongruities in the pacing are bizarre. at one point we have hokkaido sinking into the sea and pyroclastic snow falling on the rest of japan, while osaka is buried under an immense tsunami. yet elsewhere in the country, people are still strolling around sightseeing and licking ice-cream when another tsunami rolls in... kusanagi also manages to travel great distances without any hindrance, or even a crease in his cream shirt. other people turn up with burns, ripped clothes and mud-streaks on their faces. <br /><br />the japaneseness of the film is both touching and repugnant. kusanagi's sacrifice in his final evening with shibasaki is a touch of chivalry seldom seen in this genre these days. however, the ill-fated pms musings on the japanese psyche and the seduction of death, and the fact that japan is abandoned by everyone and has no friends in the last instance, hint at a darker paranoia that infects japanese concerns regarding their status in the world.<br /><br />sadly, the final sequence is a rip-off of armaggedon, edited with a cookie-cutter.<br /><br />finally, my own particular bug-bear - the heavy handed product placement for cigarettes. this time around, it is mad(-or-is-he?) scientist toyokawa who gets to be the poster boy for japan tobacco. at one point, he manages to light up 5000 meters below the ocean surface, in a miniature sub the size of a phone box. gimme a break.
