this film is strange, even for a silent movie. essentially, it follows the adventures about a engineer in post-revolutionary russia who daydreams about going to mars. in this movie, it seems like the producers know the communists have truly screwed up the country, but also seems to want to make it look like they've accomplished something good.<br /><br />then we get to the "martian" scenes, where everyone on mars wears goofy hats. they have a revolution after being inspired by the earth men, but are quickly betrayed by the queen who sides with them. except it's all a dream, or is it. (and given that the russian revolution eventually lead to the stalin dictatorship, it makes you wonder if it was all allegory.) <br /><br />now, i've seen good russian cinema. for instance, eisenstein's battleship potemkin is a good movie. this is just, well, silly.
