this is just the same old crap that is spewed from amateur idiots who have no clue how to make a movie--gee maybe that's why it is a straight-to-video wanna-be movie!<br /><br />i guess it is my fault for actually spending money to see it (one of the worst decisions i have ever made). what a waste. i usually like b movies, some of them are actually quite good--but this is just too ridiculous and stupid to even be funny.<br /><br />the losers that made this junk deserve to be put out of business for wasting everyone's time and money making a movie that obviously doesn't even deserve to be on film! these so-called movie makers have absolutely no talent!<br /><br />stupid plot, horrible acting (especially the drag queens--what sicko would actually find that sexy?!), lame writing (if there even was a script--seems like the kinda bull**** someone just made up on the spot)<br /><br />what is stunning about this movie is its utter lack of anything well-done at all.<br /><br />how much attention to detail would it take to insure that every frame of a film would be so far below any reasonable standards? i don't think it would be possible to make such a bad movie intentionally, and it is inconceivable that sheer bad luck could produce such consistently awful results.<br /><br />anyway, avoid this stink bomb at all costs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
