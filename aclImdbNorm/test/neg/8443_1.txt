i got seriously ripped off with this purchase. the other posters pretty well cover the failings of this poor poor film. my dvd that i purchased actually had the 1978 piranha poster art on the cover with the credits for that film on the front 'directed by joe dante', etc. i was really disappointed to find the wrong film on the disc. i am actually a fan of lots of bad movies. there is always something funny or at least amusing on most of them somewhere. not this film! i am actually going to spend the three dollars in gas money to return this two dollar dvd just for the principle of the thing. blatant false packaging here. easily the worst movie of all time. no redeeming factors at all. boring!!!not even worth checking out just to see how bad it is. seriously.
