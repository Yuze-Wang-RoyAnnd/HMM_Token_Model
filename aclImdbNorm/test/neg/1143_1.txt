i loved the original, i watch it every year. but the second is a piece of garbage and it never should have been made. the second could have worked if there was a different location. the son was not an original or didn't even act like one of eddie's kids. third was too smart for eddie which downplayed his father role. none of the other kids where in it. it just could of been a lot better. i don't know why they even tried to make this movie. there was no continuncy from the first movie. i will pretend that this one doesn't even exist. it is sad that the actors didn't even see that they where made fools of. a really bad movie. i just think that i wasted an hour or more on a bad movie and i really love all of the national lampoon films.
