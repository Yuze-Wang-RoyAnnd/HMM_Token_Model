sure, this flick set in eastern europe is filled with sexy, but it absolutely has nothing to do with the nicholas cage flick "8mm" an ambassador's daughter and her fianc'ee mix it up with a local woman in a threesome that ends up being taped. the tape is used for blackmail and the stakes get higher and higher as the couple try to work it out themselves instead of going to authorities.<br /><br />the sex comes and goes -- and would be the only reason for renting it, i suppose if you like this sorta thing -- and is quite gratuitous towards the middle when we cruise along the porn scene looking for the "other woman." i definitely question how it got into blockbuster even with a youth restricted sticker considering how just a hint over the edge of soft core it is. (oh that's right, it's the double standard. actual art-house flicks like "the dreamers" and "y tu mama tambien" get castrated r versions, but straight to dvd crap like this get the unrated banner proudly attached. whatever.) <br /><br />the acting is horrible, the plot is mind numbingly unoriginal, but really the worst offense is the idea that this is a sequel to 8mm. i'd give the flick a d for a grade and be nice, but considering they tried to trick me, it gets the f it frankly deserves.
