first, let me start off by saying this film sounded very interesting: a serial killer copycatting the works of edgar allan poe (who is one of my writers of all time). sounds cool, right? yeah, definitely not. probably the worst film i've ever seen. ever. and that's not an exaggeration. i've seen a lot of very, very bad movies. this one takes the cake. and i was even prepared for a bad movie before going into it.<br /><br />perhaps the writer should've studied some law enforcement procedure: if you have the name of the killer, his entire life's history, a criminal record, and his address, where is the first place you should look? hmm. . . possibly. . . his house? what?! no! that's a preposterous idea, anthony! how could you suggest something so obvious and level-headed rather than going to a bowling alley? *spoilers end* honestly, sometimes i can forgive a movie if the writing is good but the acting is bad, or vice versa. . . but this just had everything wrong with it you could possibly find.<br /><br />i think my biggest pet peeve was how the police/fbi acted.<br /><br />for example: black fbi agent: "okay, endangered female, just sit here in this car in an empty parking lot while i go inside and look around the potential crime scene where a serial killer is supposed to be. sound good to you?" moronic female fbi agent: "yeah, sounds a-okay to me. go right ahead. i'll be sure to not focus on my surroundings or at least check the perimeter." black fbi agent: "excellent, that's what i would do!" honestly, if you want to be in law enforcement, rent this movie so you can learn how not to act. . . or if you're a human and want to learn the same.<br /><br />0.5/10: a half-point just for getting a film produced and in stores. congrats.<br /><br />-ap3-
