i am a usually a very generous voter on imdb and don't bother commenting on movies i did not like, but this was just lame. i actually turned it off 15 minutes before finishing it, to watch "this is it" (because my gf wanted to... i just chose the lesser of two evils).<br /><br />if you want to watch this movie: picture this film as a collection of worse-than-average "horror"-stories, like "scary short-stories" that you find in an issue of "reader's digest" in the waiting room of your dentist's.<br /><br />i did not expect anything particular terrifying or funny, i am not the "i want to see blood!"-type of person, but this "movie" is neither "horror" nor "comedy" nor entertaining in any other way.<br /><br />it's probably more scary/funny and entertaining to look at the movie-poster of "you've got mail" for 90 minutes while drinking chamomile tea.<br /><br />conclusion: a "horror-comedy" for people between 4 and 7.
