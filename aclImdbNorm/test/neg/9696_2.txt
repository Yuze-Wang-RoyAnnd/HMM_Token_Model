i'll dispense with the obvious review of factual inaccuracies. they are too numerous to name. a much shorter list would be what they got right. 1. dude named noah. 2. ark with animals on it. <br /><br />if you want a much more accurate portrayal of noah's ark and the destruction of sodom, go rent "the bible" (1966). it depicts the story of creation through abraham attempting to sacrifice his son isaac. it's a much better movie, and it may be that the abomination called "noah's ark" (1999) drove you to seek just such a film. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060164/<br /><br />i really couldn't stomach watching the whole movie. from reading other comments, i can see that even the atheists found it grossly inaccurate. as a christian, it was intolerable to me. possibly the worst movie ever made. no real point to this movie either, except maybe to showcase their sub-par computer animation.<br /><br />was it a complete waste? maybe not. god can use evil to work good. <br /><br />romans 8:28 says, [28] and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god, to them who are the called according to his purpose.<br /><br />genesis 50 says, [20] but as for you, ye thought evil against me; but god meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.<br /><br />in the second example, joseph's brothers meant to kill him, but god turned their evil into a very great good. he may have done the same thing with this movie.<br /><br />people were so astonished by its lack of biblical foundation, that they probably broke out the dusty old bible and read the story for themselves. to find out about lot and sodom, they would have to go the whole way up to genesis 19 before god destroys sodom and gomorrah. by then, they have read almost half of genesis, so they might want to finish. the next book is exodus, which the movie "the ten commandments" was based on (and much more accurately). if they have seen that movie, then exodus becomes an easy read. so now they have read at least two whole books of the bible, just because they watched a pathetic movie about noah's ark. i'm sure this actually happened to someone out there.<br /><br />god works in mysterious ways.
