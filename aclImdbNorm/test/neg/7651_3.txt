when my parents rented this movie, i was expecting a very funny movie as randy quaid is very funny in comedy movies. however, this movie is not all that funny and it is somewhat boring too. you can see the surprise coming a mile away and it runs long for a movie that is supposedly only eighty one minutes long. so i can honestly say it is not a movie that is on my favorites list. it may work for some people, but it just did not work with me at all proving to be rather slow in the build-up with virtually nothing that amused me within the entire movie. randy quaid is wasted and the rest of the cast is a list of very bland actors and actresses. the premise of the movie had potential, as did the casting of quaid, but all of it just sputters and the inclusion of the horror element just seems very unnecessary. granted, the one dream sequence the kid had when he jumped on the bed and it suddenly became a whirlpool of blood was very nicely done and would have worked very well in a movie that was supposed to be pure horror, instead of one that lists comedy as its first genre.
