the subject matter was good, direction was ok. mohanlal was efficient in his role as a major. the acting of the supporting actors was amateurish at best. the casting director and director should be held responsible for this debacle. hawaldar jai was terrible, he stood out like a sore thumb with his poor histrionics. he did not look the part nor did he move like a soldier. there was a scene where a satellite feed was required of the skirmish with the militants and they were showing it from a camera angle. satellite is located hundred of miles in the sky so the only angle is from above.it was quite an embarrassing moment. audience these days are matured and they recognize when one is trying to pull wool over their eyes. the director is a major so the story could be out of his personal experiences. no problem there, but the movie is only as good as its actors and director. so if major ravi is going for any other projects he should pay more attention to the casting.
