utterly useless... having been there, done that with the subject matter i have to say this captures the clubbing atmosphere in absolutely no respect. it may have done so had the characters not just been mouthpieces for incredibly dire, unrealistic drivel. so many cringe-worthy scenes that would put the office to shame (not a compliment to this film). it also may have helped to have some semblance of a story, a point, a message, a commentary, anything. seriously, kevin & perry go large had more to say on the subject than this film (term used very loosely in this case). there should be minus numbers reserved for films like this. -10 (extra turd)
