my boyfriend and i decided to go see this movie after we heard on the radio that it was a good movie worth seeing, even up there with "cars". within the first ten minutes of the movie, i was horrified. for starters, the cows, which should be females, had male voices. then i realized they really are supposed to be guys. i put the transvestite cows aside for a bit and tried to keep watching the movie with an open mind, but it was just so corny i couldn't help but shake my head. i probably checked my phone about ten times to see if it was almost over. the plot was decent, if not predictable, but it took way to long to reach its point. i was having trouble sitting through it, and i'm 19. the children in the theater were actually getting up and running up and down the aisles. i felt like joining them. but my biggest problem with the movie was that it was loaded with drinking references, not to mention that the cows/bulls actually hot wired and stole a car, then drank and drive, broke into a boy's house to push him out of bed (he deserved it though), then ran away from the cops, whom the writers of the movie made look like terrible people. this isn't the kind of thing i would want my kid to be exposed to. there's way too much of that in the real world, if i wanted my child to watch guys drink and drive and lead cops on a chase, i'd pop them in front of the 10 o'clock news. children's movies are supposed to be an escape from reality, not an escape into ridiculousness. what happened to the good morals and happy endings that children's movies used to boast? that's why disney's old movies, like beauty and the beast, lady and the tramp, the little mermaid, etc. are classics. if you want your kids to see a great cartoon with basically the same plot as "barnyard", rent "the lion king". you can get a great story without the awful drinking and driving and grand theft auto references. the writers of "barnyard" were obviously trying to continue the great trend of making a children's movie that a parent could enjoy as well, but they did so in very bad taste. i would never take my kids to see this, and i suggest you save your money and watch something else.
