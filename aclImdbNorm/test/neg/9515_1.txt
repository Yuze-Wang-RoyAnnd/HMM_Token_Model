when i voted my "1" for this film i noticed that 75 people voted the same out of 146 total votes. that means that half the people that voted for this film feel it's truly terrible. i saw this not long ago at a film festival and i was really unimpressed by it's poor execution. the cinematography is unwatchable, the sound is bad, the story is cut and pasted from many other movies, and the acting is dreadful. this movie is basically a poor rip-off of three other films. no wonder this was never released in the usa.
