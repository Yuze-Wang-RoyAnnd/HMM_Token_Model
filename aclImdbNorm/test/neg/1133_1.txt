i was out-of-town, visiting an old friend. after dinner, talking, he expressed some reservations about his daughter's boy friend. she's 15, beautiful, smart, athletic, and the young man is also from an excellent family, nice, also athletic (if not as smart). i told him he might just be feeling the normal fatherly concerns; however, a few minutes later the young man arrived, with his dvd of this flick, which he had apparently been anxious for some time to share with the others. <br /><br />these folks have a bona fide home theater set-up, with a screen something in excess of 4 feet, and the two young folks preceded to view it, while the young swain proceeded to extol its virtues almost frame-by-frame.<br /><br />i saw enough in a few moments (and with some fascination in its awfulness) to endorse all of the most critical comments i've seen in scanning some here.<br /><br />i told my friend i wouldn't go so far as to disqualify the young suitor solely on the basis of his liking this opus -- but it certainly seems to warrant his bearing close watch.<br /><br />some flicks are so-bad-they're-good: the classic "plan 9 from outer space;" and, in my opinion, the wonderfully awful bruce jenner/village people work, "can't stop the music."<br /><br />however, this one remains firmly simply in the awful category.<br /><br />second/third/fourth "bananas" -- even the best of these (e.g. tim conway, don knotts, everybody with seinfeld) have great difficulty in carrying a later starring series (or, as here, film). and these were great supporting characters in their original situations.<br /><br />the "eddie" character, really at about the 5th- or 6th-banana level in the prior griswald movies, and never added a whole lot to these, in my opinion. randy quaid is a capable actor who has delivered some good performances. his contribution to the prior "vacation" pic's was average, at best. both he and the other cast members, many of whom have done some good work in the past, accomplished nothing for their efforts here, except to derive a few years' house payments or some ira contributions.<br /><br />this whole presentation --- story, performances (from lead to support) couldn't be worse.
