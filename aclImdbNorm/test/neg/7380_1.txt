if you would have asked me 1 month ago how this movie was i probably would have left most of this out, but i am a fan and as any fan i visit the movies sites often well when super troopers came out i visited that site after the release on dvd and was hooked yea it's a difficult site to stay on, but the good ones normally are like good families they stick together. what a story this company/comedy troop has.begging people to come and see there movies on street corners,universities, anywhere they can and all for free and after all that to develop a great fan base after a few years they crap on it and decide to close down there website that helped them and was created for the fans, but the worst thing about it....they didn't tell any of them. they just decided that they are better than us they want new fans not the fans that helped them get where they are....you know the same fans they begged years ago. still the smart crew they are they released the best movie with super troopers and got everyones attention and thank god for that because after that they have sucked with everything else. good for you guys way to go mainstream, just remember when you realize your material isn't that good and you have no new fans left you are the ones who crapped the original ones away. fans make you who you are not the other way around. never burn your bridges
