there is no "fun" poking fun at the desperate plight of illegal immigrants! or the desperate plight of head-shop owners, for that matter! that the richer-than-god brian glazer didn't see the irony of having the "heroes" do exactly what the villain does - rob honest, hardworking people of their life savings - doesn't surprise me! hell, how do you think he got to be richer than god?!<br /><br />in this alleged satire about greed, these mental midgets reveal their own hypocrisy: the mcmansions, the mctoys, the mcchildren, the mcillegals who are paid peanuts to take care of the mcmansions, the mctoys, and the mcchildren! but the main problem (aside from the revolting bigotry) is the premise: as the former executive of a now-infamous company, dick would be the big scalp for every corporate headhunter in the country! no soup kitchens for him! and, raking in high six-figures, you'd think he wouldn't be caught dead around a gore/lieberman poster!
