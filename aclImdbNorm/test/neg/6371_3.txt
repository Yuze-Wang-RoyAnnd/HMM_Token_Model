i am a fifth grade language arts teacher, and after we read this book (which the students loved), then we watched the movie. they laughed out loud! unfortunately, it's not a comedy! the acting was so awful, i felt like i was watching a bunch of kids in the neighborhood putting on a play. my students were mimicking the lines and making fun off and on the whole way through. i have to agree with them, at times, it was pretty bad. still, i would show it to students again, just for fun, and to compare the film with the book. we did a venn diagram (teachers know what that is) afterward, to show what was the same in both and what were the differences, so there is an educational value in showing it. i noticed that another adaptation is being filmed for 2005 so we can only hope the acting will be better!
