i initially tuned in to paranormal state because i (more or less) find the paranormal search genre to be interesting tv, if nothing else.<br /><br />i really enjoy ghost hunters because well over half of their investigations result in total debunking, and find most haunted to be hilarious with its use of mediums and frumpy british women with paris hilton day-glo eyes fainting from fear/demonic presences all shot in lovely night-vision green.<br /><br />paranormal state has none of this appeal. it feels like it was cobbled together from "leads" that ghost hunters rejected. the episodes ranged from trailer trash families and single mothers with emo adolescents sitting around and scaring themselves, to an "interview" with a 5 year old about the monster who lives in his room (the monster goes rawrrr, we are told). all of these people calling upon a college club to solve their problems. the whole show is about ryan and his partner, his enormous ego. he leads his troupe of doe-eyed coeds around, except when a case is deemed "too extreme" and orders them to remain at the hotel hahaha. better leave it to the pros, ie himself.<br /><br />the unwitting comedy of this show is all in how gullible the participants are. ryan spins his tales of being hunted, followed, etc by a demon that he first encountered when the catholic church recruited him to assist on a case. sorry, but the catholic church has people who can do that, they don't need the day-shift manager at quiznos to chip in his 2 cents.<br /><br />this show is awful, shame on a&e for bankrolling this silliness, trying to follow in the footsteps of some much better paranormal-themed shows. it's almost unintentionally funny, except that ryan is so arrogant and devoid of charisma that watching the show long enough to mock it isn't worth the trouble.
