for some reason i just didn't like it at all and felt embarrassed about how bad it was since i bought it and watched it with my family. all of us hated it with a passion. it's a nice enough kids' movie, maybe in the year it came out. however, think about it: an outdated kids' movie? what's the point? kids do not generally like to watch such old movies anyway, and i don't see what adults are supposed to get out of this movie at all.<br /><br />some kids' movies (like mary poppins or wizard of oz) can be enjoyed even now, but time bandits is totally outdated. for your reference, and i think applicable in this case, i also did not like dr strangelove or spinal tap at all. so, if you disagree with me on those similarly outdated movies, you might like time bandits.<br /><br />there is also a horrible case of overacting as i recall from the 'bad guys'. think of the two stupid 'bad pirates' in the pirates of the c. movies, except in time bandits they are not even remotely funny.<br /><br />anyway, i warned you, that's all i can do. people that rate this movie high must have liked it from many years ago. if you have not seen it before, then don't bother watching it now.
