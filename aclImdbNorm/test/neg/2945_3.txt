twins effect is a poor film in so many respects. the only good element is that it doesn't take itself seriously. other than that, this is not really a movie, but rather a merchandising tool for the film's two stars, popular pop idols in their native hong kong.<br /><br />the film itself is poorly constructed and acted. the direction offers up some silly martial arts, which is odd since the action director (and supposedly co-director) is donnie yen. like many hong kong films geared for the teen audience, the major fanbase of "actors" like the twins (the two girls who stars in this film) and ekin cheng, there is so much bad music to prod the audience into believing certain scenes are funny, clever, etc.<br /><br />the final conclusion: it's all for naught. even as a fan of hong kong movies, this is a poor film. not funny enough, not serious enough, and just generally too bubble gum fake for its own good.<br /><br />3 out of 10.<br /><br />(go to http://www.nixflix.com for a more in-depth review of this movie and other foreign films)
