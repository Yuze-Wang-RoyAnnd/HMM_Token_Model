a couple of teenagers have a little sex on the beach in the 1960s. that's all. they say they are fifteen while one of the actors is really twenty-five. maybe this movie was somewhat revolutionary in 1978 in its way of touching `taboo' topics but i can't imagine that at that time anything shown in esmiko limon was regarded as tabooish.<br /><br />shallow dialogues are mixed with disco music that is even shallower. the selection of songs doesn't involve anything but the very very well-known `classics' that are still heard on every second radio station today. the plot of american pie is not much different but it is at least a little bit funny. eskimo limon is dull, flat and not aesthetic. almost unbelievable that it had six sequels!
