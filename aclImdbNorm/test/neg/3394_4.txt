a female friend invited me to see this in the theaters.<br /><br />after half an hour we walked out, and went into the next multiplex (yeah, we broke the rules) in time to catch the beginning of against all odds.<br /><br />i remember too many apes dancing around saying, "oog, oog." very little about the characters or introduction to the story captured either one of us or was even memorable. it just dragged to the point of being painfully boring (and believe me, any excuse was good enough to spend time with this particular friend).<br /><br />the production values were excellent, good photography and lighting, but this was a major studio release, and we came to see a movie, not an art gallery. it seemed like ralph richardson and andie mcdowell were going to be wasted in such a poorly written film.<br /><br />perhaps if you make into the second hour, there is something worth seeing. i do not have so much patience with my time. 4 out of 10.
