normally, i wouldn't even stoop to viewing trash like this, but since role-playing is a dear hobby to me, and such was the subject of the film, i did. it was garbage in so many ways that i do not know where to begin. i would rather sit through the "plan 9 from outer space" marathon than watch another minute of this vomit. at least plan 9 didn't have an agenda. how the media could capitulate and irresponsibly represent extremist agenda as fact is beyond me. it is a scary time when a whole group of people can be unceremoniously trounced with no defense and no real facts presented. i know this commentary went more social, but it couldn't be helped, as this movie begged it. imagine a pro-nazi film being reviewed strictly on film merit. won't happen. as it sits, the people who made this film are facists themselves, and should perhaps move into a communist enclave where propagandizing is accepted.
