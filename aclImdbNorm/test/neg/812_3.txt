outside sweden you are not expected have seen this movie. happy you. the cast includes several actors that are important part of modern the swedish movie history. and still.. <br /><br />seems like peter dalle only had a an idea lasting for about 20 minutes. robert gustafson is totally misused in this movie, trying to copy a younger g"osta ekman. ekman, by the way, is the only actor fulfilling the expectations. <br /><br />credit that can be given is for the photo, splendid idea using black and white. music is ok.<br /><br />but over-all it's a waste of god actors and the time of the audience.
