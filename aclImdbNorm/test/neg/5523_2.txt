each year the company called nu produces couple of "action packed", "full of suspense" movies. this little nugget, called shadowcaster iii(until i visited this site i wasn't avare this is a whole trilogy), is a great example of the good job the company is doing. frank zagarino is as mean as always and does a great job as almost undestructable(?), schizophrenic(??) android. i won't waste any more words since i don't want to reveal the terrific plot and ruin you a couple of great laughs.<br /><br />rating 2/10 (revard for those hard working tehnicians. man, putting together this kind of rubbish must be nervewracking.)
