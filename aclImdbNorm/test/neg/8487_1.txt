well i had the chance to view this film the other day. i didn't know what to expect as i never saw the trailer and such... but what i did discover simply by watching the first 10 minutes is that this film is the worst i have ever had the misfortune to see.<br /><br />i wish i could give it this film a 0 rating. the first 10 minutes were bad but as soon as it goto the party scene i wanted to just enter a coma it was really poorly done. the actors didn't have any direction, there was no real story, i read some reviews that state its good if you have a little child to entertain for 90 minutes etc... but really why should we expose children to this type of film? its got poor humor, rude and crude comedy at best and focuses on poor special effects to fill 80% of its time. i am sure a few people in hollywood will be out on the streets after this film bombs.<br /><br />also how can 39 people give this movie a 10. i mean get real anyone that gives this movie a 10 either has some mental issue and or works for the film company. this movie should average at 1.5/10 instead of its current 2.3/10 due to the people that ranked it 10. truly sad.
