this movie had great production values, good lighting, costumes, set, cinematography and acting. but someone, somewhere, took the script, and replaced all the dialogue with grade-school level barely literate writing. i felt my iq dropping points any time any character spoke.<br /><br />did they do this on purpose? was this just an accident of brain dead studio executives? at this point, we don't know.<br /><br />all i know is, this movie was one great mistake from beginning to end. we don't even get to see how the squad became cops, so instead of any character development, we get what feels like a bad tv-movie leftover from the 60's. or whenever.<br /><br />find the screenwriters, beat them with a sock full of quarters. everyone else, nice work, but read your scripts next time.<br /><br />3/10
