this is absolutely the worst movie i have ever seen. i hope the real family and other portrayed characters have lawyers suing the hell out of vh1 for there portrayal. the acting is horrible, the writing is worse and the portrayal of characters is scary. its supposed to be a drama, but it was a comedy to me, you have no choice but to laugh at the bad acting. i usually like flex alexanders acting but this time he has completely missed the mark.<br /><br />you could argue he took this role for a couple of laughs himself, because it was so horrible. if you really want a dramatic movie for the night, do not choose this one. but if you are in for some laughs over bad acting and stupid writing, tune in. other than that, don't waste your time.
