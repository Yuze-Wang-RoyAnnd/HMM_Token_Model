first off, i am a huge fan of tolkien, and as one i will base most of my critic on his books.<br /><br />the movie is a standard adventure movie, well made with nifty special effects, nice sound track and fine acting. now if this movie was called something else than lord of the rings the reviews wouldn't be half this good as they are here.<br /><br />the problem of the movie is that it takes the basic story line from tolkiens books but then it goes and "hollywoods" everything it can, numerous scenes from the book are eighter missing or changed quite a lot, the characters are changed from the book also, a thing that i think should be punishable ! what the movie lacks is deep insight of the characters in it, i know that it is almost impossible to make a good film out of a good book, and it didn't work here eighter, mostly the motivation of the characters is left hazy at best.<br /><br />as a adventure movie it would rate 7+ / 10 as a adaptation of tolkien it rates 2 / 10<br /><br />i mean honestly, what on earth was arwen doing at rivendell ford ? and as for the comments that this movie "is the best ever" i can only say that eighter you are very young, or you havent seen good movies...<br /><br />peter jackson should have called this movie an adventure movie based on the lord of the rings.
