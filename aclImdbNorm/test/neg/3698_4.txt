this is the kind of movie that begs to be shown on tv at 3 or 4 in the morning, if at all.<br /><br />no doubt the film-makers responsible for "attack of the 50 foot woman" thought they were making a pertinent statement about women and philandering and the dangers of the demon rum, all wrapped up in a sci-fi allegory. <br /><br />or maybe it was a tax write-off.<br /><br />either way, "attack" proves best for the viewer under the following circumstances: a) extreme intoxication, b) seen on a double-bill with any of those jacqueline suzanne movies (maybe "once is not enough"?) or c) just a night when you feel insecure and the world around you is a little too perfect. pop in "attack" and you'll feel great, guaranteed!<br /><br />it's good for a laugh at the expense of the hokey script, the rubbery special fx and that four-eyed sheriff. and i think the last line should be engraved in a monument somewhere in washington d.c. - it's just that memorable.<br /><br />four stars for "attack of the 50 foot woman"; buy a copy, mail it to gloria steinem - she'll love you for it.
