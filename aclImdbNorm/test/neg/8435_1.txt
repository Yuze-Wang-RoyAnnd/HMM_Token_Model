this movie starts out as if it were a comedy. it almost appears that the actors are reading off of cue cards, especially in the airport sequence. william smith plays the role of "caribe," a hunter, who is quite twisted and deranged. smith seems to always play villains such as in "the ultimate warrior" (1975), and "the frisco kid" (1979) to name a few, although in this film the villainous role seems laughable. this is one of those films where senseless things take place only to fill up screen time, such as the girl chasing sequence at the beginning, and the long silly motorcycle race. i give this film 1/10. i would have liked to see this film on "mystery science theatre" it would have been hilarious.
