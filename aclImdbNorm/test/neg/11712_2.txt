i am not a fan of the original book but was expecting to see a better adaptation than the natalie portman movie, which i found awful. this version is even worse.<br /><br />first, there is very little of ms. gregory's book in this script. the whole subplot of george boleyn's sexuality is completely eliminated and in this version george is merely a flunky shuttling between his duty to the boleyn family and his duty to the king. i thought the title of the book referred to mary as the lesser-known of the boleyn sisters, but here it is used to refer to anne.<br /><br />second, the script has the characters periodically address the audience as if in confession. apparently this is intended to give a bit of back story and explain their motives, but it is amateurish in execution.<br /><br />on top of the bad script, the direction is stunningly bad. there are too many shots done with a circling camera which is none-too-steady at best and downright shaky at worst. several of the speeches are delivered tentatively, as if in a first rehearsal. the production values for henry's flamboyant court are minimal. the costumes vary: some are copies of historical portraits and others are from some costume designer's fevered imagination. and the king, the source of all power and favors, is often shown alone. no fawning courtiers, no servants in the background - where are all the people?? i am accustomed to hollywood turning history into fantasy, but i expected better from a bbc production. even based on a flawed book this production is bad.
