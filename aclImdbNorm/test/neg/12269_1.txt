i love watching australian movies but this steaming pile of crap was just plain embarrassing. the dvd cover looked promising but you know what they say, don't judge a dvd by it's cover. <br /><br />i also noticed that it won best actor for an award but the competition must have been really bad because the acting in this film is pathetic. it just seemed that the director thought he had enough talent to direct and act when he should really focus on one part of film-making and get it right before spreading himself too thin. the music was pretty ordinary. the story really didn't go anywhere. it was just a sequence of fights strung together with poor script and cheesy dialogue.<br /><br />i will say this to all aspiring filmmakers though. watch this film. it will give you hope that your film will win something at some festival.<br /><br />however, good on them for getting in there and having a go. hope they learned some lessons and their next venture is a little better.
