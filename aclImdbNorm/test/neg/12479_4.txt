there are certain horror directors for whom i've built up so much respect & admiration over the years, that they can't possibly disappoint me know matter what garbage to decide to put on film. lucio fulci is surely one of them, but damned, he's trying to disappoint me with his later efforts! you can easily afford yourself to skip most of the films fulci directed or produced during the late 80's and simply watch "cat in the brain" instead, because that one title gathers and repeats the best and absolute goriest footage of no less than seven other fulci-flicks, including the sickest murders sequences featuring in "when alice broke the mirror". as a whole, this movie definitely ranks among our director's weakest and most pointless achievements. the script is incoherent as hell, the basic premise is totally implausible and somewhat stupid and there's absolutely no suspense to enjoy. i love the title, but it's actually quite meaningless. there is a character named alice in the story, but it's only a supportive role and she certainly doesn't break any mirrors. i suppose she could break stuff simply using her voice, as she's an opera singer, but she doesn't. the plot revolves on a middle-aged and gambling-addicted playboy who spends his days seducing wealthy widows and killing them for their money. lester parson butchers the ladies (as well as unwelcome witnesses) in gruesome ways, makes steaks out of their juiciest body parts and feeds the remainders to his cat. there's also a silly psychological sub plot in which he thinks his own shadow is responsible for the murders instead of him. the difference between "when alice broke the mirror" and some of fulci's greatest horror films ("the beyond", "city of the living dead",
