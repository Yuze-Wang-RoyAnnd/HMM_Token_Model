the movie is being televised as i write.<br /><br />i simply forgot how horrible an experience i had watching it in the cinema.<br /><br />the whole idea of the movie is flawed. the fact that intelligent europeans and americans stranded in the desert forget all concept of morals and civilization within a couple of days is laughable. the madness of lord of the flies was longer in the making.<br /><br />details that annoy are plenty. one is the single african god-like character that mysteriously survives the horrible climate and have done so for ages without losing his mind and he seems to have no supply-problems either. ridiculous. so too is the rescue attempt from the tour guide, an indiana jones look-alike, whose rescue attempt ends in tragedy and death a 5 minute walk from the hut. then there's the choice of lear, imposed onto the group by a guru-like joke of an artist. he reminded me of my hippie high school art teacher.<br /><br />the worst thing though is levrings choice of lear. obviously is an intellectual brain-fart. how that ever was going to be an pass-time is never clear to me.<br /><br />positives are few and far between. it's a beautiful movie, but that's never important.<br /><br />high school intellectualism. weird for the sake of weird. it's a complete waste of time unless you like thrashing useless art movies.
