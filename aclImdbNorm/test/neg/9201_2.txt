i say ben johnson and my fellow canadians say, "ben johnson?!" - he was a goddam movie star guys, a cowboy, and by 1976 he was scraping by playing a sheriff in stupid made for tv disaster movies such as this, cashing in on the deadly swarms of killer bees that everyone apparently thought were coming to get us at the time. so there's these bees, and they kill some people by flying in their mouth and going after them underwater. eventually these idiots find the swarm and die and this woman is trapped in her car by the entire swarm. the cops are like, what do we do? uh, bees die when it's cold. so where could we make it cold? i know - the stadium in new orleans! so they drive this car and its attendant swarm of killer bees on and on through the streets of new orleans, with a bullhorn saying "get off the streets or you will be stung to death." and the future home of tens of thousands of flood victims with its broken toilets so becomes the narcotic doom of this particular buncha bees. i don't know which is the greater indignity on this great city...well i do, but this one sucks too. most appropriately viewed on an extremely faded-to-orange 16mm print, although betamax is a good alternative!
