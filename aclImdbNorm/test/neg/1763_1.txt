critics are falling over themselves within the weinstein's sphere of influence to praise this ugly, misguided and repellent adaptation of the lyrical novel on which it's based. minghella's ham-fisted direction of the egregiously gory and shrill overly-episodic odyssey is one of the many missteps of this "civil-war love story". are they kidding? after ms. kidman and mr. law meet cute with zero screen chemistry in a small north carolina town and steal a kiss before its off to war for jude and his photo souvenir of the girl he left behind, it's a two hour test to the kidneys as to whether he will survive a myriad of near-death experiences to reunite with his soulmate. who cares? philip s. hoffman's amateurish scene chewing in a disgusting and unfunny role pales to renee zelweger's appearance as a corn-fed dynamo who bursts miraculously upon the scene of kidman's lonely farm to save the day. rarely has a performance screamed of "look at me, i'm acting" smugness. her sheer deafening nerve wakes up the longuers for a couple of minutes until the bluster wears painfully thin. released by miramax strategically for oscar and golden globe (what a farce) consideration, the weinsteins apparently own, along with dick clark, the critical community and won 8 globe nominations for their overblown failure. the resultant crime is that awards have become meaningless and small, less powerful pr-driven films become obscure. cold mountain is a concept film and an empty, bitter waste of time. cold indeed!!!
