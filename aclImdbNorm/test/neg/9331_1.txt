tyrone power was cast in the lead as solomon. however, part-way through the film he died unexpectedly. the studio chose to cast yul brynner in the lead and re-shoot the scenes that power had done. in hindsight, considering how awful this film was, power was lucky--as this would have been a horrible way to end his lovely film career!!! <br /><br />of all the biblical epics i have seen, this one is by far the worst--and that's saying a lot because hollywood has made many dull biblical tales--so many you wonder if the creation of these films was an atheist conspiracy!! in fact, the film was so dull that it deservedly was included in harry medved's brilliant book "the fifty worst movies of all time". there are so many reasons to hate the film but the worst is how incredibly ponderous the whole thing was! sure, casting people with italian, eastern european, scottish and english accents to play egyptians and israelis was pretty bad--but at least this made the film oddly humorous. having bosomy gina lollobrigida playing the role of a woman reputed to have come from a place around ethiopia was also just awful, but at least she was beautiful even if she couldn't act. having an overweight and post-middle aged george sanders play such a young role was also pretty bad, but at least he had a pretty voice. creating an orgy scene that was choreographed and revoltingly dull was pretty bad, but at least you got to see in the credits a mention of a person as the "orgy choreographer"! no, the worse thing about this movie is that almost two and a half hours, it seemed like nine it was so poorly paced and insipid! considering that the only mention of this queen of sheba and solomon is only in a few measly verses in the old testament, it's amazing the film just went on and on and on. the greatest story ever told was a bit longer, but that movie was based on four gospels--not a dozen or so verses! <br /><br />the bottom line is that the film is wretched in practically every way (except for gina's cleavage). even for devoted christians and jews, this is a must-avoid film because it plays so fast and loose with the truth as well as injects an amazing amount of sex into a biblical film!!! terrible in almost every way, it is truly a blessing for tyrone power that he's not remembered for starring in this bloated turkey.
