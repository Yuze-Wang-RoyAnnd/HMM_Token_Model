the only reason for me for watching this little known irish film was the question could mike myers have played a normal, dramatic character. well, he could and his acting was pretty good but unfortunately that was probably the only good thing that i can say about this film. in the beginning film follows life of twelve years old orphan mickey who lives with his brother and sister with their somewhat eccentric grandma. despite some strong language it looks like a family film but after a while it becomes clearly that pete's meteor is a hardly suitable for young audience drama. and the worst is that it is a drama with so much ridiculous and even totally implausible plot. one preposterous story line turns into another and all the time there is no much sense in the events on screen. i suppose when a life drama needs a meteor or what is more something that looks like even more ridiculous spiritual content that's a really bad sign. the characters are not much better than a story. despite all his troubles young mickey by no means is not a likable character but it's clearly was somehow we were supposed to care about him and even feel strong sympathy to him. it doesn't work. the same thing with other characters. they are mostly as ridiculous as the story itself with the title character (although he wasn't the main character) as the only bright spot. towards the end of the movie i still had a strong hope that there is something behind of all that improbability and absurdity. unfortunately even if the writer of the story had such intentions (and i'm sure he had) in the film they are hidden and practically imperceptible under such a weird script. <br /><br />grade: 3 out of 10. those of you who are interested in seeing mike myers as a drama actor can watch pete's meteor for that reason but the rest of viewers most likely will be bitterly disappointed.
