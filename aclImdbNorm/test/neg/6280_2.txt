while it has been many decades since i last read mr. wells "war of the worlds", or "the time machine", or any other of his works, i believe that they were all set in london, or at least, in england. this grade "b" ("c"?) movie is set in the eastern part of the united states as was orson welles excellent radio adaptation 67 years ago. however, this film exhibits none of the quality of the narrative style of the mercury playhouse program. thomas howell's emoting would not be acceptable in most high school drama clubs. i was actually embarrassed for him. his rolling around in the grass on the hill crying "my family, my family" was almost laughable, as was his reaction to the death of his brother. of the three film versions of the story that i have seen, this was by far the worst, with gene barry's 1950's version the best. additionaally, this was the first time i ever saw a "machine monster" dripping sticky saliva such as did the creature in the "alien".
