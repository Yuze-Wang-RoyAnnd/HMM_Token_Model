ok, i would give this a 1, but i'm gonna give it a two because i laughed while watching this film...first of all, i can make a much better movie than this one...in a week...the special effects made this film look like a joke. one shouldn't make such films with horrible special effects because then people won't take it seriously. the acting and direction was also horrible. the screenplay had many plot holes and the whole film wasn't believable at all. this has to be the worst indian film ever. the songs were also bad. the acting was bad and artificial. need i say more. don't watch this movie unless you are curious to see how bad it is. that's why i watched it. i am going into film and i wanted to see how bad a bad film can get. trust me, i watched one of the worst films in history if not the worst film.
