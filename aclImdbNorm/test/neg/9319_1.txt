well, i remember when the studio sacked schrader and hired harlin to do reshoots to this film, they were quite right to do so.<br /><br />dominion: prequel to the exorcist is simply a bad movie, it's boring, really it is.<br /><br />it would be nice to think that the studio put aside a psychological masterpiece and that all those who in such big words condemned harlin's version and praised schraders, even if no one had ever seen it, would have been right.<br /><br />but they weren't.<br /><br />to put it in a nutshell : schrader has no idea what a horror film should be, and it shows in a big way.<br /><br />droll, boring, unintentionally funny in all the wrong places and bad supporting cast.<br /><br />save your cash and your nerves, don't see it.
