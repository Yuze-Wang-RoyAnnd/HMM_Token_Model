propaganda pro-american war effort film that came out in 1942 has the east side kids getting tough against any japanese they spot in their own neighborhood when they learn they're too young to enlist. ultimately they learn they were mistaken in their mistrust of some individuals but also happen to stumble across a spy ring they then set out to bust. the film is harmless enough in its fashion although some may well take offense given how innocent asians really did get singled out during the second world war. overall though, it's a pretty generic effort and both leo gorcey and huntz hall would have better moments, the best of which tend to come here when they ad-lib.
