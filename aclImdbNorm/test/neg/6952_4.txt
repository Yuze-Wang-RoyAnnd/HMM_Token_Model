not every movie with lesbian chicks and vampires, touching our favorite trash/cult genre is nice. unfortunately this movie lucks of originality and the performances do not come up with the trash standards. seem the creator's intention to make it cult it failed. trash movies are trash movies because it happens. you cant create in purpose this kind of films.i don't know if mr creepo is a legend (first time i heard his name) but if he is i wonder the reason...<br /><br />awful. even the lesbian scenes are pathetic so any fans of erotic x-ploitation films will not be satisfied, as there a thousands of movies better than barely legal lesbian vampires.
