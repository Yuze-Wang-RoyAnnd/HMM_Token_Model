you know, this is one of those "emperor's new clothes" films. it's like, so off the wall and strange that you're supposed to like it if you're really into film. well, i think that's a bunch of bologna. films like this which hide under the cloak of dada or surrealism make me nuts. some person has this bad dream, perhaps brought on by eating the aforementioned bologna right before going to bed, remembers most of it (unfortunately) and then puts it on film and we're all supposed to marvel at their creative genius. i have bizarre dreams too, sometimes, that make absolutely no sense but i don't feel the need to put them on film, expose everybody else to them and call it art. weirdness does not, in of itself, mean something is interesting. true dada or surrealistic expression has some intent and intellectual thought behind it. if other people don't get it, that doesn't make it profound, it just makes it incomprehensible. bizarreness for bizarreness sake, for me, is not good, let alone great, art. and comparing "tuvalu" to "delicatesen" is like comparing "the godfather i & ii" to "the godfather iii"---same genre, not in the same league.
