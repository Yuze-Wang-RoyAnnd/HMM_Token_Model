i don't think this can legally qualify as "film." the plot was so flimsy, the dialogue so shallow, and the lines so terrible that i couldn't believe that someone actually wrote the lines down, said, "holy sh*t! this is a masterpiece" and then actually pitched it to a producer. i, for one, am still dumbfounded and will forever remember this film as the mark of the degeneracy of intelligence in america -- that, and "crossroads," of course.
