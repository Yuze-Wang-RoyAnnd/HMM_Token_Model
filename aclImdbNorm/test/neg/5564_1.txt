i hate this movie!!!!!! i have never seen such utter, complete trash in my life!!! i live in france so it turned out that i was in the front line to watch this awful movie. at first, it seemed cool, kind of like something about a cursed forest that chomps people. unfortunately, it turned out it was something quite different: a good start with a girl that meets a guy and all that whatnot, then the girl gets threatening messages in the form of ravens shut up in her bathroom closet(ludicrous), from that bit and on, the movie starts to slide downhill very quickly with a lot of desperate thrashing in the process. the movie ends with sacrificial druids galore and ancient ugly, stinky creatures coming back from the past to kill a few people. many questions were rushing around my head by then: why the heck did they bring back that scummy monster? do druids look like maniacs dressed in bedsheets? why did they even bother making this movie?? the "climax" of the movie was so goofy i laughed all the way through it: the "awful" stinky monster does battle with the two young women(who appear to be expert kung fu masters) and the professor gets sliced in two or something. what surprised me was that the monster was so slow and ungainly in battle, wasn't it supposed to be a god of war or something? anyway, the movie in it's death throws was a pitiful sight. a brief condensation of the contents of this movie: kung fu mayhem+druid stones+mysterious murders "`a la thriller"+ancient prophecies+shabby ravens+old clumsy boneless war god+nutty professor=complete and utter, diseased, boneless, worm eaten, godforsaken, goddam, recycled, fake, wannabe, ludicrous sh*t!!!!!!!!! things i learned from this movie: -ancient war gods are lousy at kung fu. -all young women who study archeology at university in france are kung fu experts. -professors are so resistant they can survive being sliced in two by a saw-mass-whatchamacallit without any injuries.
