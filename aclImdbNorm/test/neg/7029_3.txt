this movie was awful! ashley rose orr, while a talented tap dancer, and singer (actually a little better than temple was in terms of the latter), is a terrible actress. she plays the character as the shirley that we saw on screen in her movies whether she's playing her onscreen or offscreen persona. so what we get is an overly cutesy, and wholly unrealistic (not to mention uninteresting) portrait. if one wants to see that side of her, one can just rent one of her movies. the only bright light here is connie britton's portrayal of gertrude temple. i don't think it was terribly realistic, but at least it was well acted. save yourself the trouble and rent the poor little rich girl.
