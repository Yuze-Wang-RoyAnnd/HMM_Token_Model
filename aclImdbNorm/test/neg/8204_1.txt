that distinction has to go to the dungeon of harrow. at least ed wood's misguided attempt at making a quality science fiction film had the dubious "star" power of bela lugusi, vampira, tor johnson, criswell and lyle talbot. the dungeon of harrow has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. what could have been an interesting and suspenseful plot about a marooned aristocrat on a leper colony, perhaps in the style of the island of dr. moreau or mysterious island, is trashed by the heavy dialog and mono tonal acting of amateurs whose lines sink like lead weights into a sea of stupidity. the "special effects", which took place in someone's bathtub, further doom this film to the dung heap. even the treatment of leprosy is something out of a victorian interpretation of the bible. the fact that leprosy can not be contracted from an individual in its last stages belies the plot line that the aristocrat fallon and his lady, cassandra contract the disease and end up as the original occupants of the castle de sade, doomed to insanity and inhuman cruelty. it is interesting to note that not one member of the cast made another film. no wonder, talent begets talent; lack of talent begets oblivion, which is where this film should find its deplorable end.
