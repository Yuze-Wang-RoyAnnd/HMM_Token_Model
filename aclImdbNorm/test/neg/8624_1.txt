this movie was so poorly acted. what was with jeff bridges accent, horrible and unbelievable. was it supposed to be french, scandinavian?the script was lame. to have the heroine trip over the grave of her boyfriend while running from the jeff bridges character...are you kidding me? how convenient that jeff brings his dirty shovel in the house after he disposes of bodies in his lawn. do these people just not believe in calling the cops? okay...i'll get into the car with you, why not? duh! why was bridge's daughter obsessed with making her dad have an affair, is her mother that evil or just plain dull? i did not see the original, it would be hard to make myself after seeing this movie.
