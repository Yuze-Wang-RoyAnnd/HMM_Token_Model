dark reality is a saw like movie that is slightly decrepit. while the plot and story are good, there is a little too much unnecessary nudity. while i feel the film was technically well done, the acting was spotty, it was just a little too dark for my mood while i was watching it. it basically says that there are a lot of missing people out there that will never be found and are perhaps being tortured by sick whackos. i feel that some information on the captors and their reasons for being so sick would have helped some. it came of as a snuff film, just made for the violent content. if you like to see women beaten, tortured, and killed then this is for you. if you're looking for something a little liter and more expressive and reasoned, skip this one.
