spoilers!!<br /><br />i hate this one, but it is better than the others after this, they just keep getting worse. i hope gibson has the smarts to stay out of the next one. a lot of the same with humor, ie the toilet, kids, etc. how much farther can we watch their relationship evolve. drugs, bad guys why south africa! i found that unbelievable, maybe south american, some country in the golden triangle would have made the script better. it seems the late 80' early 90's had the blond bad guys ie die hard, the mighty ducks play ice land gary busey in the last weapon, etc. hollywood repeats itself over. this one with a similar story has to go over the top. the attacking the police, the beach condo scene, and the fight at the end, and way over the top gibson's girlfriend killed by the copper attack were too much. like many part 2's, they get worse, and 3 or 4 in this series picks up speed downhill. 3/10
