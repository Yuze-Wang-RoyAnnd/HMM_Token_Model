just had the misfortune to see this truly awful film.<br /><br />think of that scene in magnolia at the end with the slow pan in on that woman. now, remove the pan, add breathing and unshaven men to the mix, and you have what the entire 2 and a half hours of humanity was<br /><br />the inspector is a true dolt, not even a dolt, just a dim witted, slow moving simpleton. how they ever solved a crime is beyond me.<br /><br />obligatory sex scenes are awful, and gratitious.<br /><br />eventual villain of the piece (he raped and killed an 11 year old girl) is signposted very early and no surprise unless your are similarly dimwitted.<br /><br />uninspiring camera work.<br /><br />the director was there saying that it is up to the audience to provide their own interpretation on the proceedings. i assume he also meant provide their own dialogue (there is bugger all - adding to its boredom level), inventive camera work (just static shots, totally stripping away the obvious beauty of the landscape the film is being shot in) and plot!<br /><br />truly awful.<br /><br />0 out of 10.
