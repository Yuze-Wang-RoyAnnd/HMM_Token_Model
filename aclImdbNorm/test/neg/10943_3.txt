this movie lacks in everything. except bobby deol, who in his own standards is mediocre, no one in this movie has come close to act in a single scene. kangana is complete fake in her acting.<br /><br />the great anupam kher has a guest appearance and is better in those 2 minutes than bobby in the whole movie. the music does'nt compliment the movie<br /><br />that well. the contrast in music between bobby and upen is not highlighted that well. great concept gone completely wrong. the movie does'nt have a proper ending. please don't waste your time as i did on this movie
