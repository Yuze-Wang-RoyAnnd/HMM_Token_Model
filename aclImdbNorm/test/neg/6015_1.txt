what's the point? hasn't this been done before, better? and again? why is werner herzog wasting his good talents and time with junk like this? shouldn't he be shooting a movie somewhere--i mean a real movie? <br /><br />it all felt fake from the beginning. werner herzog would never have sought to make a film about the loch ness myth--at least not on such a small scale surrounded by losers--so the plot was not believable from the beginning. the actors who are supposed to act like they're not acting were obviously acting. the story was not interesting, the "everyday people" requisite in every mockumentary were invisible, the personalities were stale, the jokes were not funny, the effects were unconvincing and the ending was nowhere to be seen.<br /><br />i just don't see the point. it's a fake movie about a fake movie. hah, hah. perhaps if those who thought up such a movie sought to make one that mocked people who really were out to find a real nessie, now that could have had some potential. but herzog is not a believer and never claimed to be. a mockumentary about the cryptozoologist crowd would have had so much more fuel.<br /><br />it was a miss.
