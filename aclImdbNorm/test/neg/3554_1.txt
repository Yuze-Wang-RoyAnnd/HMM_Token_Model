one of the most boring movies i've ever had to sit through, it's completely formulaic. just a cookie cutout of a movie, you could predict about every scene in the movie just from knowing the genre, as this movie adds nothing new. the dialogue is never funny, interesting, or intelligent. the acting is weak and the soundtrack is annoying - basically everything looks to have been done by an amatuer filmmaker. nothing fresh, memorable, or entertaining in this movie, combined with the fact that it is long gives it an easy thumbs down. sorry, fans.<br /><br />overall grade: f
