i liked most of this film. as other reviews mentioned it has a good cast, the plot is interesting enough. all in all it is fun to watch.<br /><br />but the ending, i feel, is completely botched, it left me bewildered. yes, you expect people crossing and double-crossing each other in this sort of movie, but quadruple-crossing? well, if it's justified by the plot then why not? <br /><br />but that's the bad part, there's completely no need for it. after a certain point it's all scheming with completely no meaning. (here comes the spoiler). after the airport scene enrico and his accomplices already have the money. i couldn't understand the need for the rest of the scam. is it all necessary just to rub federico's nose in the fact that he's been fooled? i don't buy it.<br /><br />so 6 out of 10 for 3/4 of the film and 2 out of 10 for the ending.
