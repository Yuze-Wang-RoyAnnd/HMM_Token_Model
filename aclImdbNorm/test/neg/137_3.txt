this is one of the more poorly made movies i've ever seen. one has to take anything by truffaut seriously; it's not just some b-movie cranked out by hacks.<br /><br />evidently truffaut couldn't decide whether he was making a noir or a sentimental chick flick. and neither could deneuve, whose dozen (?) character flip-flops are simply unbelievable -- not even badly acted; just not acted at all. among other things, how a woman as beautiful as deneuve could be a person such as julie/marion is simply beyond anyone's ability to suspend disbelief; the role absolutely demands someone not so beautiful. belmondo's acting also suffers although imho his character is not quite as unbelievable as deneuve's. the clich'e ending (which i won't describe) is unfortunately all too appropriate for this complete mistake.
