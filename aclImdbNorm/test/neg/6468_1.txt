i am really at a loss as to how anyone could give this movie a 10 (or even more than a 2!). it is full of bad lines, bad acting, bad slapstick, etc. i never thought i could see worse acting than the purposefully badly acted scenes at the beginning of uhf, but this was it. and just when you think it can't possibly get any worse, it does! over and over again! you actually could have watched this in a theater? it wasn't worth free on tv! my 4-year-old and 1-year-old liked it some, but they wanted to see the cat more and the cat was almost never on.
