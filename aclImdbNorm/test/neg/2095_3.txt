snakes on a train (2006, dir. the mallachi brothers) a zombie curse is placed upon a woman, which causes her to have living snakes inside her. brujo, who is looking after her, attempts to take her to los angeles on the train. after several confrontations on the train, brujo's collection of snakes manage to separate themselves from their owner and go on the hunt. whilst all this is happening, normal, everyday passengers are relaxing, what is unknown to them is that something deadly is heading their way, and that their is no were out.<br /><br />after watching the wonderfully fun 'snakes on a plane', i had to check this out. i knew it was going to be a rip-off and that the film will look cheap, but what i found was worst to watch. the whole curse plot was silly and should never have been included. the special effects aren't terrible but are not the best looking. i did not have a clue about the ending. it was silly to watch and pathetic. the acting was absolutely terrible, and looked bad. they just could not act to save their lives. if you want a great laugh, watch this, otherwise you should really avoid this.<br /><br />"we have a runaway train. i repeat. we have a runaway train." - conductor (stephen a.f. day)
