sitting in a big wing chair with a huge book in his lap, the one and only bela lugosi looks into the camera and, in a dreadful vocal delivery that sounds as if he were mocking a reading of shakespeare, intones sloooow-ly: "man's constant groping of things unknown, drawing from the endless reaches of time, brings to light many startling things; (snicker); startling?, because they seem new (lugosi's eyes now bulging, with raised eyebrows, and mouth sneering, he continues) but most are not new, the signs of the ages" (cue a visual of lightening, accompanied by the sound of thunder which then continues to rumble for an astonishing 86 seconds).<br /><br />and so begins what is arguably the worst film ever made. this "movie" almost defies description. told in semi-docudrama style with an unseen narrator explaining the plot ... such as it is ... the story revolves around the vicissitudes of a man named glen (ed wood, jr.) who cross-dresses; hence the reference to glenda. the film has no real structure. instead, it consists mostly of a random assortment of vignettes that may ... or may not ... relate to glen or to the cross-dressing motif. one long sequence consists of some unknown woman wriggling on a sofa, followed by a man whipping a woman in what we would today refer to as s&m.<br /><br />then, at odd moments bela reappears, for no apparent reason, and babbles more inane dialogue, like: "when he's wrong because he does right, and when he's right because he does wrong; pull the string, dance to that." huh?<br /><br />about twenty percent of the film's visuals consist of stock footage, accompanied by a vo that relates to the story motif but not the visuals. hence, we see stock footage of: bustling city streets, freeway traffic, a thunderous herd of buffalo, and a playground full of kids. but it gets worse. in a film about cross-dressing, we have 58 consecutive seconds of stock footage of a foundry furnace making hot steel, and 84 consecutive seconds of battle scenes from wwii.<br /><br />even the simplest items are botched. in one scene we see a newspaper headline that reads "man nabbed dressed as girl". underneath the headline, which has clearly been glued or pasted on, the article is about ... taxes. in one of my favorite scenes, an off-screen woman spouts out: "airplanes, why it's against the creator's will", in a voice that sounds like she's just inhaled helium.<br /><br />except for the performance of lyle talbot, the acting is uniformly horrendous. production design is cheap looking and drab; (but you gotta love that tacky wallpaper). the editing is sloppy. most of the background music is suitable only for 1950 style elevators. the b&w cinematography has way too much contrast. and the costumes look like something that came from a thrift store.<br /><br />this film is so bad it makes "plan 9 from outer space" look like "citizen kane", by comparison. i just don't know how one could make a film any worse than ed wood's "glen or glenda". but thankfully, it's got bela lugosi in it. every time he opened his mouth, and gazed into the camera with those big, bulging eyes, i about fell on the floor laughing.
