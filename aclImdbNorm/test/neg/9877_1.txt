i'm going to talk about this movie from two different perspectives here. first is from the view of if someone sees the movie and never read (and may not ever read) the book. the second is from someone who has.<br /><br />(movie without book) from a movie standpoint, it was an okay movie. nowhere near as good as either of the underworlds but much better than ultraviolet. and i'm not just talking plot line either. the visual effects were iffy in many of the parts, though the wolf transformation was very nice. the characters has very little development and vivian didn't even seem to truly care that her "love" was killing off what was left of her species. some of the other characters could have had more air-time, like the five. the plot was way to similar to underworld for my tastes.<br /><br />(movie with book) as many have stated, other than the title, character names and a few minor parts, the movie and the book are nothing alike. in the movie, gabriel was a lot older and was the father of rafe (thus astrid was once his mate). in the book, gab was about 24, never mated with anyone since wolves mate for life (astrid is trying to win his affection) and astrid was the mother of ulf, not rafe. another important thing is the location. the book took place in riverview, maryland. also, why they moved from west virginia is very different. the movie has it being vivian's fault and her entire family was killed due to it. in the book, the original leader of the five, named axel, killed a girl from their school. hunters tracked down the wolves and killed many of them (viv's father included), forcing them to move. also, viv's mom, esme was a major character.<br /><br />one thing from the book that would have made the movie better would have been the "bitch's dance". for those who don't know, it's the ordeal where all the bitches (females of the pack) fight to see who is the one to be the mate of the new leader (since earlier there was a fight for the males). vivian won it, trying to save her mother from astrid (who is a horrid evil woman in the book) and thus was supposed to mate with gab. there was no prophecy! anyway, if you've read the book and you liked the book, i highly suggest not seeing this film.
