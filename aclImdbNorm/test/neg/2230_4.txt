my take: typically routine and lazy straight to video attempt from disney. <br /><br />disney must have fallen in love with the family movie tradition that is the family dog. many movies have devoted themselves with stories that solely center themselves with man's best friend. disney themselves have made a handful. they also made a handful of those that are literally dogs. add this one to that bunch.<br /><br />i haven't seen the original for a very long time, so probably i'm not the right person to judge if this straight-to-video sequel fares any better. anyone above the age of seven aren't the right people to see it either. perhaps only the youngest of the young will want to see lady and the tramp ii: scamp's adventure, and even they would grow up and say it wasn't the best kind of family entertainment they have ever seen. i guess to be fair, i can say is that it warrants a rental, but that ain't much to say.<br /><br />this sequel pretty much picks up the parts left behind after the original oft-called classic. lady and tramp now have a litter of cute crocker spaniel pups... and one mischievous mongrel named scamp who is a chip off the old block. instead of the confines of home, scamp wishes to run off with the other junkyard dogs of town, unknown of his dad's own past as one of those mongrels of the streets. to capture the charms of the original, this one throws in the same poor dog/rich dog love story, in vice-versa. scamp falls for a one of the junkyard dogs named angel (and who wouldn't with a name like that and a voice that sounds like alyssa milano?). que replay of the famous spaghetti scene! other than the "cute" factor, there is nothing in store for any audience in this lazy straight-to-video effort. stick with the original.<br /><br />rating: ** out of 5.
