great music, but ain't these people pathetic?!? a true period piece of the trippy sixties, and it left me depressed. the director paints the wrong side of the jetset life and it stings as a hornets nest. if the culture of the time led people to do these things, it appears to me that it was all a journey of no discovery, only despair. i tried, really tried, to like this film, but these people aren't anywhere on my page. yes, it would be nice to see the world, go away for awhile, but i always plan to come back. drugs aren't the cause of these characters' downfalls, it's their lousy attitudes
