i'm currently slogging through gibbon's 'fall and decline of the roman empire , so i've had all things roman on my mind. i'm not very far into it yet, maybe two hundred plus pages, but it is amazing just how many of these roman emperors were killed. i believe i've read through maybe 15 emperors so far and only antonius, trajan, and hadrian haven't been killed or at least suspected of having been killed. i have also been fascinated by the mad excesses of many of these princes of rome. not the least practitioner of these was caligula. this brings me to reviewing this film. i'm thinking of the film on a historical basis as far as i understand it from gibbon's explanation of rome,as well as other research from some good web sites and some fiction novels dealings with the period.<br /><br />my point is i do not think that this film is what it is thought to be by many of it's proponents. i do not think the depravity shown with the sex and horrendous violence of this film qualify it as accurate. the general ideas of the film seem accurate. caligula is raised on an island ,exiled with his family and in content fear of being murdered by the increasingly mad, suspicious and strange emperor tiberius. he grows up paranoid and afraid and can never shake the cutesy nickname given him by his guards, little boots, this helps him grow up feeling abused and powerless. he is handed the empire after tiberius dies, the senate hoping he will steer away from the informer squads which brought death by whim of the former delusionally paranoid tyrant, and lead rome away from the madness that dictator had settled it into. caligula begins as a decent if hands-off emperor, but gets sick, almost dies, and comes back from the brink of feverous death a true monster. his perversities with his sisters do begin here, if not before. he does have macro killed and many others who were his originally supporters. the acts of madness seemed not to be the murders of caligula as much as his new thinking of himself as a living god. him seen talking to the statue of jupiter as an equal doomed him. his violent mad excesses would have doomed him anyway, and three years seems to have been quite a decent run for the successors of tiberius. well the film basically sticks to these lines while it manages to be coherent, which is not common through it's entirety, it does so while trying to shock the audience at all turns, in every single scene the film begs you to be disgusted by the depravity of ancient rome. the shocking scenes are what this film is built entirely upon and where it entirely fails. it is just too much to see successive rulers have man after man murdered, raped, tortured for no reason but fancy. the depictions of the violence are possibly, but not probably, accurate. murder certainly was the order of the day in imperial rome, torture beforehand was rote. but the director's visions of these deaths and the bored amusement of their protagonists, while the bystanders watch with nonchalance, i just don't see it having gone down exactly like that. the death machine, the beheader, is certainly something like you've never seen in movies, and something once seen you shall probably never forget, even as i, you wish you could. the wine drinking while the penis is roped off is the same, once you've seen this shame it is yours forever. these things strike me the director's and that porn magnate's fantasies. they sprung from their sick imaginations and not from any proved record.<br /><br />the acting is pretty good. i actually think mcdowell is the weakest link here. mirren is always something to behold, and here in her youthful years she is formidable and beautiful. the portrayals of nerva and tiberius are done very well by their respected actors. the film could have done so much better story telling, it is such a failure that way its just a whole other layer of what a shame this thing was. for example it could have given opinion on how and why caligula went mad, or shown that he was mad, paranoid before his illness and that fever then broke the mental restraint he had possessed previously. it could have shown the weakness of claudius and the miracle it was he survived caligula. it could have these and many other things but it stuck to it's sad nightmares.<br /><br />finally about the sex. it is porn. it shows these sex acts being done all over the palaces by many people. male on male, female on female, male on female. it is passionless, disgusting sex. sex that if your point is to get off on it, i seriously doubt you could. both tiberius and caligula may have been sex addicts, and orgies may have been common enough but the visions in this film seem to recall more a greek time than a roman. i don't think that kind of acceptance of homosexuality or orgies right out in the open were common until the the strange, depraved reign of elgabalus, and he was killed for it.<br /><br />this film should probably never be watched, if your curious about it , let it go. it is something, as i said earlier, if you do watch this you will unfortunately retain it's sick visions in your minds eye for years to come. i don't think its an accurate historical picture in particular, even if it is historical in whole.
