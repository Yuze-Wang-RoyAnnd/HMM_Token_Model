i ticked the "contains spoiler" box, in case i say anything that is a spoiler and don't realise i've said it until i re-read it after i've posted. so it's just in case.<br /><br />anyhow, back to reviewing this film.<br /><br />i saw this film on skymovies earlier on this afternoon, and by the description sky gives you (these people must be on acid) it sounded pretty good, but then when i actually got about 30 minutes into it, i was appalled. this film, in my opinion, has the worst scriptwriting and actors/actresses - ever. the young girl who falls in love with the boy from l.a after about 3 hours, is a really stupid, lame character, who has an annoying, whiney voice, and boff hair. -.-. then there's her lover, who's an idiot, and is also very whiney. actually, maybe they suit each other. then there's the boy's mum, who's with him on holiday, and surprise, surprise - she's a doctor, and - oh my god, wait, there's even more unsuspected surprises! a virus suddenly breaks out on the island and she knows all about viruses! =o. shock horror! yeah, right. lol. then there's this insane religious lad, who keeps going on about "'erbs" or something, and how the lord knows all. everyone on the island seems to love him, yet he's actually a stubborn, arrogant, steroid-pumped (you really need to watch this film just for the scene where he comes out of the sea after a swim, his head is like tiny, and his body is massive. it's hilarious) buffoon who's had way too much to drink.<br /><br />anyhow, after all these weirdo characters, including a stoned-looking taxi driver, the religious lad finally gives in to the doctor, and she takes a blood sample, and they get straight to work on finding the cure from that, because for some reason he's dramatically been saved, all down to "'erbs and god". and oh my god. yes, there's another surprise!! you'll never guess what!! just in the nick of time, with 11 minutes to go before everybody on the island drops dead in-fact, including her son and his girl, she finds the cure, and injects everybody, and it's all resolved!!! what a pathetic film. i mean, i knew it sounded an obvious ending from when i first started watching it, but i actually though it'd be good and have some sub-plot twists somewhere, but no-no, it was just boring and dry.<br /><br />don't watch this film. you'll end up like me - stunned for 3 hours and then demanding the hour and a half you spent of your life watching it back.
