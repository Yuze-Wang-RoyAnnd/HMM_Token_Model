i have no idea what these people were thinking when they made this film. no plot, very limited action, and what is with the 3rd person commentary throughout the film???? instead of running around the planet to shoot on all of these locations, they should have spent some money on script writing and actors. what acting there was, was lousy. this was 90 minutes of my life i will never be able to get back. i should bill the director for the cost of renting this film. to the director and the writers of this film....please quit now. this film should have a tag on the front of it saying beware of boredom. the only good thing i can say about this film, is the computer generation. it's ok as generation is. this movie should never have a sequel....ever.
