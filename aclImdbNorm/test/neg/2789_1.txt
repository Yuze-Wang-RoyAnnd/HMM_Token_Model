according to the budget information given on this web site dark harvest had an estimated budget of $130,000. where this money was spent i'm not exactly sure. let me see....costumes...no...location and sets...hmmm, think not....special f/x...not...acting lessons...ah, no. dark harvest tells the epic tale of a young man who inherits a family farm in the hills of west virginia. his girlfriend talks him into taking their friends up there to check the place out. once there our intrepid hero learns that his great grandfather used a unique method for getting his crops to grow and now it's revenge time. killer scarecrows out for revenge!!! ewww scary. well no, not really. we all know there have been some terrific movies made with very little money but this is not one of them. this film contains pretty much some of the worst acting and dialog i've ever seen. terrible clich'es with terrible delivery. all in all do not be fooled by the half way decent cover and avoid at all costs. i'd like to give the film makers at least a d- for trying but i'm afraid they didn't even do a good job with that. grade: f
