when i first saw this i thought it was a joke. all i could think was "you get the 8mm camera, i'll get my little brother's monster toys, we'll make a movie!" why would anyone in a modern time like 2001 make a sci-fi movie like this, it looks like it was made in the early 80's. with actors that are as wooden as a cigar store indian, a script that was written by the director's 4-year-old son, a camera that was stolen from a burning pawn shop, poverty-row special effects, and to top it off, a director that thought making this crap would make them famous. the end result wasn't spectacular, complete with scrappy dialogue and continuity. from venus must have been fun to make and i'm sure everyone involved had a blast with their silly little movie.<br /><br />a 2 out of 10 for a valiant, hopeless effort.<br /><br />
