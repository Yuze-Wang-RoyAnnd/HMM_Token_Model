abysmal pulp adventure exploitation in the jungle woman genre. lousy audio thankfully obscures the dumb dialog. and it's awfully talky for a movie about people who don't speak english. there's no adventure to be found here; it's a jungle adventure with cliffhangers and one wild animal attack that happens in flashback.<br /><br />three pale-face dopes wander the african wilderness and encounter warring man-hungry tribes of amazons. these wild women have advanced out of the stone age only so far as to invent makeup, shoes, and underarm hair removal technology. despite their desperation for "hus-bahnd," the ladies insist that they will fight the men and burn the weaker ones.<br /><br />the only thing of interest, as if there were any question, is the assortment of young women clad in animal skins cleverly designed like the bathing suits of 1951. plenty of wrestling and bad dancing mixed with stripless 1950s stripper moves. no nudity or appreciable violence. on the other hand, you may be humming the catchy native song for days.
