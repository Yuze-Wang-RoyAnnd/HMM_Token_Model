for me, it just didn't seem like gi joe at all. when i watched it as a kid, i just didn't care for it. in fact the part i liked best about this one was the opening credits. they change so many facts around and turn the story around as well. cobra commander is supposedly part of this stupid race of reptile people in antarctica or somewhere that is frozen. though i always thought he was a normal guy considering every time you saw his eyes in the series they were surrounded by normal colored flesh and not the blue his face was here. there is just too much crap in this one to try and make this a spectacular movie, but for me it just ruins what i watched the series for in the first place.
