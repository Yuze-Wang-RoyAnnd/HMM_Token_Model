this movie was recommended to me so we went to see it together. i wouldn't call it a movie, it's more like a combination of 10 different unfinished, illogical stories, which are not all that funny. there're several characters in the movie who looked important in the beginning, and they just disappeared from the story. he's just trying too hard to fit everything in 2 1/2 hours. i left the show without wondering what happened to this and that guy.<br /><br />i think this movie is just an extended version of "hitch", padded with a lot more characters and dancing.<br /><br />if this is the best movie that this couple has ever made, then i'm pretty sure i'm not interested in any of his previous ones.
