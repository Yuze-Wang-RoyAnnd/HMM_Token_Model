the ten steps has basically a reasonably good premise for a scary short but the execution is simply appalling. the dialogue is terrible and the acting is of the kind so regularly witnessed in irish short films. really really embarrassingly bad. the girl has to go down the 10 steps of the cellar to change the blown fuse. she telephones her father who is entertaining his boss at dinner. the mother, an "actress" with very questionable acting skills, answers the phone and in a loud scolding voice tells her not to be ringing as dad is 'trying to impress his boss'. the actress playing the boss's wife very successfully emulates the mother's poor acting when she tells them that their house is haunted. the rest of the film consists of the father coaxing his daughter down the stairs on the telephone. the ten steps employs the stock techniques in camera movement, lighting and music that one would expect in a below average horror film. poor.
