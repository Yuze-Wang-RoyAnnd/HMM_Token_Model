i read a lot of high hopes from readers of the book that this would be a faithful adaptation of nora roberts' story. not having read the book, i don't know if this adaptation was faithful but i do know it wasn't good. actually, the screenplay was the best part of the movie so kudos to nora roberts.<br /><br />i planned ahead and watched carolina moon because of claire forlani. i've never been sure if she's a good actress. she's been decent in some movies, average in others and really bad in this one. but, forlani wasn't alone. the performances were all over the place. oliver hudson was wooden and boring. josie davis was hammy. then, amidst all this b-rate acting, there's jacqueline bisset! she didn't have a lot to do other than portray bitterness but, even sleepwalking through that, she was miles ahead of the others.<br /><br />still, forlani remains one of the most breathtaking women in movies and i was not disappointed in that capacity here. i believe forlani can be more than eye-candy but, until she turns in a good performance in a good movie, she continues to excel at that. and, i'll continue to faithfully watch everything she participates in. fandom is fun that way.<br /><br />this movie though, carolina moon, was pretty bad. in addition to the bad acting (fake southern accents are really distracting) the direction was pedestrian. it wasn't horrible. it was just the boring made-for-tv caliber you're used to seeing on lifetime.<br /><br />if you're a fan of any of the stars you can probably enjoy carolina moon for that reason, as i did. if you're a fan of the book you might enjoy seeing the story on the screen, albeit in a lackluster form. otherwise, this movie is unremarkable.
