nickelodeon has gone down the toilet. they have kids saying things like "oh my god!" and "we're screwed"<br /><br />this show promotes hate for people who aren't good looking, or aren't in the in crowd. it say that sexual promiscuity is alright, by having girls slobbering over shirtless boys. not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt. the main characters basically shun anyone out of the ordinary. carly's friend sam, who may be a lesbian, beats the snot out of anybody that crosses her path, which says it's alright to be a b**ch. this show has so much negativity in it that nobody should watch it! i give it a 0 out of 10!!!
