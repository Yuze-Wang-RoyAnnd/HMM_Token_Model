as most of you, i've watch a lot of great movies; in between those we often either voluntarily or mistakenly also find those movies that are so pointless that we think of reasons as to why anyone would make it. this is exactly what i can say for dead man's bounty....<br /><br />the very least i can do is try to "warn" some of you. if you enjoy being entertained by a motion picture because of the story, acting and intensity than you might want to chose something else. now, it's not all bad.....in fact, if all you want is creative film editing, and unique angles along with original music ambient than you might think it's ok. as someone that values movie plots, acting and being entertained by a film, the truth is i thought this movie was so terrible beyond words. i could easily find a spot for it on my list of worst movies seen in a while. <br /><br />as for having val kilmer in this, the truth is he was casted probably as a favor to the director; as a fan of some of kilmer's films, i can't understand what his motive for this was. the movie seems part western part romance.........in the end, i'm sure most of you can agree with me that it simply is a rude waste of our time. in case you haven't seen this movie, my recommendation would be to avoid it completely.
