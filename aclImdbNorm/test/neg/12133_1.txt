heh...i'm surprised this movie still exists in any form, let alone it being available for rent! <br /><br />this flick is one of the many bad slasher flicks that exist only for the t&a and the cheap laughs. the story line crosses a bit of "texas chainsaw massacre" with a screwy mamma-centred back story reminiscent of "psycho", and a bit of the good old women-in-chains, tough-as-nail-ex-con broads tossed in for good measure - in other words, complete unoriginality wrapped up in half naked women spiced with a dash of utter idiocy! looking on as the director attempts to make the marsh land of quebec pass off as southern u.s. bayou land is sad, i tell ya! <br /><br />funny thing for me is, i was actually at the premier of this flick as, at the time, i was pals with ratchford, the film's "star". it was painful to watch on as jeremy sank into his seat whilst the flick unfolded its mangled wings.<br /><br />i'm happy to see that ratchford, after this sham of a first flick, has grown into one hell of an actor. he can be seen regularly on the canadian cop drama "blue murder", has appeared on "csi", not to mention his role in the classic clint eastwood film "unforgiven" - we forgive ya, jeremy! it was a rocky start, but you done good, man! <br /><br />~t.paul
