kudos to baxley's dp for making this look like a real movie, the first time that's happened in this series (with the notable exception of the f/x scenes). in moving closer to movie production values, however, it lost most of the entertainment value of the first two. they were very much in the 'so bad they're good' category of horrendous film entertainment. can an argument be made though that the 'believers' were simply trying to make a generic action film with praying in it? there are so many times in the film where they discard their own belief system as to be annoying. if everything that happens is according to god's will and they are simply his instruments, than the people who are infected with the virus have that happen as a part of his plan, right? apply that to every situation where someone of faith doesn't submit to god's will, and you get a fairly hypocritical little movie from the director of 'action jackson'.
