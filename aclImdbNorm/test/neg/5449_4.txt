congo is another multi-milion dollar adaptation of crichton's works. like jurassic park, the lost world, sphere, etc, the film raped the book of its true meaning and essence. i'll make this short and to the point. the scenery is beautiful. the actors, well it's the best they can do. the script? try congesting hundreds of pages into an hour and half movie. you get a mess in the end but how neat of a mess is what counts and congo falls somewhere below that. there were some silly moments, like why did the killer gorillas decide to jump into the lava? and amy, raised by humans, surrounded by humans, yet can intimidate dozens of killer apes around her? what sort of twist of common sense is that? which brings me to this. if there was an annoying character in every movie, amy ranks of one here. you see amy is this naive little female ape who can talk with a special backpack and harness strapped to her. neat idea, but it gets annoying after awhile hearing her talk. congo is worthwhile to see, and not deplorable, but certainly not a memorable film either.
