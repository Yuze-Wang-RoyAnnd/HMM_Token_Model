honestly i don't know why this show lasted as long as it did. ah well, humor is subjective eh? but yeah, this show is incredibly unfunny if you ask me. tim allen is annoying. jill is annoying. the boys are annoying. al is annoying. the neighbor is annoying. it's just more annoying then funny. the plots are all the same, tim makes jill mad and has to make things right again. and the latter seasons? less said about them the better, who the hell things cancer would be good for a damn sitcom? yeah, great idea jerks. so yeah, home improvement isn't a very good sitcom. i'd recommend you go watch news radio or seinfeld. if i had to give this show a rating i'd give it a 1/10 seeing as it never made me laugh once. ever. so yeah, it's still better then the nanny though.
