there was no need for this movie, plain and simple. the original, although hated by some, was something i found to be actually really entertaining, mainly because it was before jim carrey started to really lose his touch, and cameron diaz was, well, "smoooooookin!" 'nuff said. so why make a sequel/prequel thing? honestly? knowing that jim carrey wouldn't do it should've been clue enough that it didn't deserve to be created. but then they just make mistake after mistake. jamie kennedy. why is this man still allowed to breathe? the writing and story: terrible. why would i ever want to see a baby wearing the mask? moreover why would i want to see it fly? ever? how did someone think this was a good idea?! the acting is despicable, in fact nearly everything about this movie is. i'm trying to keep calm, or imdb probably won't let me post this. bottom line: don't watch this piece of trash. pick up the original, see how good cameron diaz looked and how jim carrey used to have a career, and laugh. don't waste even a second of your time on this.
