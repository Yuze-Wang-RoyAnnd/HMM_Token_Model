this film tried, but ultimately it was a waste of talent. it tried to hard to be "sexy." i'm not putting down the works of such actresses as ellen barkin and peta wilson (who will find something besides tv's "le femme nikita" worthy of her talents.) i just didn't find, even in ms. wilson's so-called near-seduction scene with mrs. barkin any real emotion, even though i know the thespians tried very hard to make the scene work. if the sexual elements of wilson's disturbed sex victim didn't touch our heart (which it didn't even by an ending it didn't deserve), neither did the murder element of the plot. perhaps it was the script or perhaps the direction, but i didn't feel for anyone in this movie, and without this feeling, a movie doesn't work for me. if you are interested in a movie about lesbianism, there are a least two films on either side of the specturum to check out: 1.) the gulity pleasure of "bound" which works well in a noir setting; and 2.) the more honest, and touching story of a lesbian growing up in hell's kitchen called "all over me." it's a well-defined indie from the mid-90's that handles that coming-of-age issue with feeling, not forced sexuality. both would be a better rental than "mercy" which has next to nothing.
