the idea for the movie wasn't too bad: a horror film shot in a corn maze on halloween. the bad part was the shoddy camera work, the ten million shots of puddles and corn, and the hour and a half long walk this guy took in the maze. oh, i'm sorry, the "maize." i picked up this movie because it reminded me of a corn maze near where i live, and i thought it was a cool idea for a movie. but taking everything into consideration, it seems that your average joe could take the same idea and run much further with it. bill cowell's acting wasn't too bad, in fact, i would say it was pretty good. but the lack of talent from his co-stars didn't help his efforts. here's to hoping his next movie will be easier to swallow.
