i agree with jessica, this movie is pretty bad. i'm surprised anyone took it seriously. characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys. the only merit here is that it's so lame it's funny. actually for me, there is the added benefit that it was shot in a state park not far from where i live, so seeing some local sights on the big screen is a hoot.<br /><br />the lead character is a off-duty cop, and makes a big point of lecturing a good guy that vigilante justice is not just a bad idea, it's against the law. imagine how long that lasts ...<br /><br />most of the movie's northern california characters are blown-dried hollywood cheese-balls, looking like they've never actually been in a fight. the story line is totally predictable. this film is ripe for a mst-3k lampooning. camp value only. i'm pretty forgiving of films in general, but seeing the old positive reviews i had to speak up. this is a dog. i give it a 3 out of 10, and then only for laughs.
