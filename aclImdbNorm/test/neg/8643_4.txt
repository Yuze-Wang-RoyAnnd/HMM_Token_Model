i rented this movie, because i noticed the cover in the video rental store. i saw nolte, connely, madsen, 40's time setting, and thought "hmm, can't be too bad." unfortunately, after watching it, my impression was "not too good".<br /><br />its kind of a chinatown ripoff, but the worst part is that other than nolte, the other members of the squad didn't get enough screen time. but its a decent movie to see once i guess. and melanie's role was small enough that she wasn't given a chance to be a nuisance.
