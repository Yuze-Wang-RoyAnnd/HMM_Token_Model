i was so "impressed" with tim kincaid's mutant hunt that i gave this one a try. it is the near future, post apocalypse of course. a wandering fighter named neo (no, not that neo!) joins a group of similar looking fighters to challenge the dark one and his underling valaria. along the way they encounter mutants, crazed females, sewer worms, a big spider leg and some clunky robots. oh my! <br /><br />sadly, robot holocaust is hardly up (or down) to hunt's level. clocking in at a painful 79 minutes (the box says 90), this is one cheap flick. the sets have all the elaborate design of a carnival haunted house and the costumes prove that in the near future everyone will dress like john travolta in the final dance number of staying alive. the atomic wasteland is a combination of rubble filled old buildings and central park. the dark one's headquarters is ominously named the power station and looks like, well, a power station. the acting is universally bad except for angelika jager as the evil valaria. jager is a whole 'nother level of bad. vit er sick cherman acczent, she gives a performance so amazingly bad that it becomes the sole reason to recommend this film. she also delivers the film's only nudity in the "pleasure chamber" section of the film. ed french again supplies the robot effects but they aren't nearly as slimy as his work in mutant hunt.
