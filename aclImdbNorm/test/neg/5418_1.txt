one of the worst movies i saw in the 90s. i'd often use it as a benchmark when viewing other films; "at least it wasn't as bad as caro diario." three absolutely pointless segments, all featuring the director playing himself -- and he's not that interesting. a whole segment about this hypochondriac going to the doctor. another that features him riding around the countryside on his scooter. for three interesting minutes and another fifteen torturous ones.<br /><br />the only redeeming factor was that the scooter scene was set to keith jarrett's 'koln concert'. prompted me to go home and rediscover that marvelous album. the best thing you can say about the director/actor/egotist is that he's got great taste in music.
