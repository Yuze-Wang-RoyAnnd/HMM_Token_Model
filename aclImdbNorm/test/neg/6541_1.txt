most films are crappy with high production values, this one is crappy without high production values. which sets it aside from the large pool of horrible movies. as bad as this film was i need to give due respect to kathryn aselton who, i believe if given the proper script, could probably turn in a pretty good performance. she plays emily the girlfriend to perennial doofus josh, who often refers to her as "dude" or "man" in a non-ironical tone.<br /><br />but heres the thing, emily is a semi-believable character which means rhett will soon need to be added to the cast, to counteract this almost believable character with a guy even more preposterous than josh. when we first meet rhett we learn that he is "deep" because he is videotaping a lizard which is proof that he sees the world "uniquely!" rhett then shows the tape to emily and in one of emily's few unbelievable moments she acts impressed by this amateur tape of a lizard, wow i believe is how she responds once again with no irony of sarcasm even mildly implied.<br /><br />from the opening scene you are given warning that the camera work will be crappy, we open on a shaky close up of josh as he attempts to win over the viewers by acting goofy! oh how care free this main protagonist is that he will act goofy! haha. this film could almost be a case study in just how bad films can be (and for that matter just how far bad films can get in the festival circuit, i mean by comparison of most circuit crap this film probably did appear pretty awesome).<br /><br />i believe sxsw gave this film some minor award (oh south by southwest, why do you encourage them, its only cruel). but here is where i hand this film a compliment, it is the best of the mumblecore movement. mind you all other mumblecore movies sucked beyond belief and generally included grotesque nudity and incomprehensibly bad acting, but still, its good to be the best of something.<br /><br />i haven't seen baghead yet, but it looks like maybe they have made a few strides forward, the preview at least made it appear tolerable, where as even the puffy chair preview couldn't really hide the fact that it was going to suck. i've gotten off topic here, anyways rhett is most likely not portrayed by a professional actor at all, much like josh most likely isn't an actual actor but rather the director (or brother of director, there's some mixed messages there). i think rhett was somebodies buddy and they said hey why don't you play this guy named rhett in the movie, the fact that rhett is the name of the actor and character probably means the actor and character are the same, unless i am mistaken, which i am not.<br /><br />if rhett shaved the raccoon off of his face you would probably say he was attractive. so anyways rhett, emily, and josh team up to bring the puffy chair to rhett and josh's dad. some stuff happens along the way, more bad acting, bad supporting actors, crappy camera work, an attempt at significance. this film wouldn't have been bad if it hadnt been so shamelessly pursuing profound self importance.<br /><br />the whole thing is amateurish, if you can view this movie without paying for it, like if its on tv or for rent at the library, then consider looking at it, just to see if you like this super cheap style of film-making. i like what the duplass' are doing the whole make a movie with nothing concept, but i wish they would make a movie that someone would want to see.
