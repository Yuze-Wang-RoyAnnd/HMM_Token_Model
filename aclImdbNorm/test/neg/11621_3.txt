i really enjoyed bg seasons 1-3 and really couldn't understand those who didn't like it. but i can't defend this nonsense. spoilers follow.<br /><br />the first problem is that the characters are now doing inexplicably stupid things on a regular basis: <br /><br />so if starbuck thinks she knows where earth is why not send her out in a raptor? would the admiral accept the resignation of his third most experienced officer? would the quorum elect their newest member, the non-elected adama junior? he has about three weeks political experience under his belt, and is the son of a man they distrust. would adama send gaeta and halo along with starbuck leaving himself short of senior officers? would adama put a man into having sex with cylon prisoners in charge of the fleet?<br /><br />i just don't buy any of this.<br /><br />secondly, while i accept there have been miracles and references to god up to the end of season 3, it's now all totally over the top. i started watching bg because i thought it was sci fi, not some biblical epic. i expected the characters to continue to behave reasonably intelligently, and wanted some satisfying explanations regarding some of the odder developments in the series. <br /><br />baltar was the best character in the show, but he now seems to be totally insane. not illogical considering what he's been through, but very unsatisfying.<br /><br />all the characters appear to be just puppets dancing to an unknown third party's behest (some godlike entity). this isn't good drama, it's annoying and a writing cop out. <br /><br />ok, so what are the good points? nice battle at the start of 4.1. some good dramatic scenes (well acted) when viewed in isolation. a good final scene, a nice cliffhanging curve ball of a development.<br /><br />but this isn't sci fi, it's turned into fantasy. i can't imagine how the writers can recover this one.
