any chance to see katharine hepburn in something i haven't seen or from her early movie career is a treat, and on that level the film is amusing, but she's horrible miscast as a hill billy. her famous new england enunciation slips through, making lines like, "i'd better rustle up some vittles" pretty ludicrous. she's so pretty and so young
