this is a student film and it's a piece of crap. i would use much stronger language to describe it but then the review wouldn't be posted and the world needs to know- beyond any possible reasonable doubt- this movie really sucks.<br /><br />there seems to be a different ruler used when measuring an already famous director's early work. like somehow it was genius that we were just too stupid to comprehend since he finally got it right now today. i'm not buying it. the early movie "bad taste" made by the lotr peter jackson's sucks and this "early work" from another famous director really sucks the same way too. these "early works" are representative of crappy everything, from budget to scripts to actors etc.. it all is bottom of the bucket trash. don't be fooled by the big name.<br /><br />if you like watching a handful of male 70's hippie burnouts pretend they could ever command a ship with the worst special effects you have ever seen- this is your movie.<br /><br />i can't f*37449ing believe this thing won a golden scroll award for best special effects. that is a joke right? or a joke award?<br /><br />if you want to watch what this movie wishes it was rent a season or three of red dwarf you smeghead.
