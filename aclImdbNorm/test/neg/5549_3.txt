low-budget schlockmeister herschell gordon lewis reaches a new low (even for him) with "the gore gore girls," a 'film' (snicker) that possesses all of his technical trademarks: badly-recorded sound, poor lighting, and ott gore. this would be tolerable, even a bit charming, if the film at least had an interesting plot ("blood feast," in all its ridiculous glory, is a fine example), but "girls" is a total snooze. completely unlikable pompous-ass private investigator abraham gentry (frank kress) is recruited by a newspaper reporter to find out who's been murdering out-of-shape strippers (you'll stop caring who the culprit is long before these two are wrapping up the case). as before, the appeal isn't the plot, but the creative methods of bloodletting (including a girl's fanny being tenderized with a wooden mallet) and the occasional flashes of then-risqu'e skin...but this just isn't enough to elevate the material above tedium.
