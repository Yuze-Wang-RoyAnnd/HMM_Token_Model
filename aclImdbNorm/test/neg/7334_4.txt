the fun that was present in the other 'movies' has all but disappeared with this third effort, which means the rubbishy production values show through more than ever. another 2-parter ('the chinese web') cobbled together, this one suffers from too much padding, not to mention weak spidey action taking place in such uninspired locations as a car park, apartment and printing press. nicholas hammond is as endearing as ever, struggling valiantly against the drab production and lame performances of the rest of the cast. the plot, in which peter and spidey help a chinese official defeat charge of corruption during world war ii by locating three marines who could testify as to his innocence, doesn't exactly scream 'comic book sprung to life', does it?
