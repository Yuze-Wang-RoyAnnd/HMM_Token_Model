this movie was probably one of the worst movies i've seen in a very long time. a friend of mine grabbed it off the shelf at the video rental store, and all but forced me to watch it, an action we both deeply regret. ehh... where to start? the writing, the acting, the quality? all of it, sucked. <br /><br />quite possibly some of the worst writing ever displayed in a movie. the dialog was worse than i thought it could ever be in the movies. blatant dialog, such as "how ya doing?"..."not that great, doc" (directly after an attempted exorcism of a man's daughter and then his wife's attempted suicide. of course he's not that great.) was, at some points, kind of funny. if not horribly written, planned out, and obvious. the general plot of the movie, the writing and the way it worked, horrible. it was like the writers could come up with nothing better to do then write a bunch of crappy dialog and throw in as many sex and nudity scenes as they randomly could. the only almost good sex scene (between the preacher and the tattooed & peirced girl) was filmed with such poor quality that it looked more like a cheap porno than a feature film. oh yeah, and they never actually got the deed done.<br /><br />the acting? horrible. x100. i think the only good actor was the short spanish guy who played miguel, del zamora. and his part was written horribly. the worst acting? arguably paul kappellas, whose acting combined with shitty music, a gun, and a half naked bluish white girl running around in the woods made the movie almost unbearable to sit through. he even screwed up his own death scene, one that should have been easy to nail. although, most everybody else's acting was horrible as well.<br /><br />the lack of characters also added to the overall suck level of the movie. there were just enough characters so that almost half of the characters died, that same amount of people became possessed at one point, and then the remaining characters couldn't be counted on one hand. like... 50 thumbs down.<br /><br />p.s. what is it with the climax of exorcism movies happening in a stable, anyways?
