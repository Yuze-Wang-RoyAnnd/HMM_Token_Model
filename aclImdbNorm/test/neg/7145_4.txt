there's nothing new in this movie. nothing you haven't thought about before, nothing you haven't heard before. the story of a gay man who is brutally murdered in a small town and the reaction of people can be broached in many ways, and this movie has chosen the most demagogic and slushy one. one of the biggest flaws in this movie is that it isn't neither a movie nor a documentary. the director has used the transcriptions of the original interviews and made the actors play them as if it was a movie. the result is weird. and finally, i read in previous comments that stated that people who don't like this movie are anti-gay. i'm pretty sure this comments come from people who consider themselves tolerant but don't tolerate that other people don't like this movie. this is a funny world.
