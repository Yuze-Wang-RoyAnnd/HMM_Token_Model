this is an oft-used line, but it really sums up this movie..."if this is the current state of gay cinema, then we're in real trouble". i saw this film at siff because of the high imdb rating (7.6) and if there was ever a case of vote stacking on imdb, then this is it. just watch the number fall over the release weeks of the film.<br /><br />easy plot...boy finds out his high school ex (boyfriend) is getting married to a female friend of theirs so he goes back to his old hometown (still carrying a 10 year old torch) to see what happened.<br /><br />first off, i liked "latter days", the director's last feature, despite its cookie cutter characters and plot contrivances, but you're supposed to become a better director with each subsequent release. i don't know how you get horrible supporting performances out of so many tv veterans (robert foxworth, joanna cassidy, tori spelling), but somehow he managed to. the writing was lifetime network quality (way back when they were really bad) and the situations were unbelievable and uncomfortably hard to watch. i kept reaching for a non-existent remote control to fast forward, but ultimately made myself stay to the end, hoping for a decent ending. ugh...no. even the gratuitous male nudity that popped up during the movie was so blatantly gratuitous that it seemed to be there to keep people in their seats. <br /><br />to be fair...the 2 leads, especially in the gratuitous nude scenes, were gorgeous. there was also a real sweetness between them during their rekindling friendship as they uncovered how they went separate ways. and the film looked great...good quality and color saturation for an independent film.<br /><br />how is it that network tv can give week after week of great, entertaining weekly episodes (like "ugly betty", "desp. housewives", etc.), but so many feature releases in similar genres can be as bad as this?
