i just happened to stumble to this film and checked imdb for more information: score 6,7, well... not so bad. genre: scifi...good i like scifi. so i got the movie and i was looking forward to have a relaxing sunday evening watching it. but but...no.<br /><br />as in summary, this isn't a movie at all. it is a religious advertisement, including: preatching about jesus, god, devil, end of the world etc. movie starts with a epic abduction story: driving at night, car stops, bright light and so on... well, actually that was the film. last of this ..ummm... frankly i don't know what to call it...was dialogue about end of the world and last judgement. quite a same stuff what these tv-preachers tell you, but they are "good" at it.<br /><br />honestly, if you wan't to see a scifi movie or something with ufos, please stay far away from this "thing". it has nothing to do with them. if you want to hear some cuckoo head's opinion what the bible has to say and what you should do. then go ahead and watch this "thing", but i still prefer going to the church at sunday.<br /><br />this is complete bull. (and evangelical christian propaganda, as another users said= well... i should have red another users comments before i got the movie. <br /><br />(27% of voters have rated this "thing" as 10. yeah, right. please, go somewhere else to do your propaganda)
