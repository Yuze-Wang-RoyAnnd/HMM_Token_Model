not only that the vhs and dvd cover(at least in europe)show a scene that has nothing to do with the actual plot of the movie, the acting is so bad, that the movie is crying out for being made fun of. if you have nothing to do, you are with some good friends and you want to have some laughs about a movie, that is supposed to be serious, watch tycus and peter onorati, a man who will teach you how to knock over bad guys with empty carton boxes! shame on dennis hopper, following travoltas example by starring in his very own "battlefield earth". for those who want to watch a good movie about the earth being destroyed by a terrible force, please do not choose tycus, but do yourselves a favor and watch "armageddon" for he 20th time!
