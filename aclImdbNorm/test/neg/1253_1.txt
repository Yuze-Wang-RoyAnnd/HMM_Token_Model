this movie is a shameful result of what happens when:<br /><br />a) it is written, directed and produced by an idiot. and/or b) it was rushed in production to satiate the poker/stu ungar craze. <br /><br />the story from beginning is uneven. vidmer spends too much time on ungar's childhood and not enough on some of the legendary tales -- such as counting cards, his blackjack escapades, the roll of money as id. he also leaves out mentions of other poker greats such as chip reese, brunson etc. the movie is a complete mess from beginning to end. <br /><br />if you want a more complete and accurate account, read the book one of a kind. if you thought the movie was good, read the book and change your mind.
