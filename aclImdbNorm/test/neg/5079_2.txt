i went to see this because of snipes / statham, but honestly, chaos is terrible. this movie has absolutely nothing going for it - it should not have been made.<br /><br />don't read this review if you don't want to read spoilers, cause i'm going to address a lot of plot-holes here.<br /><br />first of all - the opening scene. it's the great big event that made the two semi-lead characters (statham and snipes) turn crooked. but it's boring and mundane. only at the very end we get to see what really happened and by the time you won't care anymore. also - this whole event, where one bad guy and his hostage get killed is hardly big enough news to fill hundreds of newspaper articles, as referred to in the movie.<br /><br />then the bank job - it doesn't get off the ground for any second. the bank robber makes some un-needed references to chaos theory (which has nothing to do with the whole story, by the way). the way statham gets summoned is very 'die hard with a vengeance', but more boring. then the things that happen in the bank are strange and pointless. -what's with the safety deposit box. there seems to be some plot unfolding there, but then, it doesn't. -why go through the trouble of stringing up two people, when it leads to nothing? it involves a lot of preparation and it's used for nothing at all! -why doesn't the swat leader listen to the officer in charge when he tells them to stand down?<br /><br />and this is only the first 10 minutes. it keeps getting worse and worse. <br /><br />-the whole romantic / love interest story (with the 'he wasn't just a better cop, he was a better man' remark to finish it of) is painful to watch. it's just pointless -why would statham's character point out the change in camera position in the footage reviewed from the bank. this essentially leads to finding the 'virus' that will get him all the money. -why go through the trouble of forging some guys signature and killing him, but then not kill the guy that can identify you.<br /><br />i could go on for ages (really), but it's like this movie is... pointless. the whole script is a mess. the 'smart' references to chaos theory are really laughable and quite pathetic. the plot 'twists' can be seen from miles away and the lead characters seem to be making mistakes all the time. it is really painful to watch a movie like this, where the audience is taken for granted as dumb popcorn crunching people, of which the director hopes they won't see all the plot holes and the over-all ridiculous script. the 'explanation scene' at the end only adds to insult. it is really, really not a good movie. in any way.<br /><br />people who come to see an action film don't get what they come for. people who come to see a cop-buddy movie don't get it. people who come to see a smart thriller don't get that. in essence, everyone gets the same - a huge disappointment and a waste of time and money. do yourself a favor and skip this one.
