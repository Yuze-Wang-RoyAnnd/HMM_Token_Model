if this film were to be rated on a scale of 1 to 10, one would need to create a new rating system, as this one should not even qualify. the film's plot, (if you can call it that) revolves around charlie (stephen baldwin), an ex- special operatives agent who is being targeted by the brother of a man he killed while he was still working for the us gov't. if this sounds like an interesting scenario, please don't be fooled, as this film will not deliver that which its action-themed story suggests.<br /><br />comedian chris rock once said that when one sees an actor doing a bad film that it makes one want to send the actor $50, given that the actor must be desperate for money to be doing such poor quality work. after watching this film, you may want to send stephen baldwin $100. <br /><br />it appears that baldwin did not put any effort into his role in the film. in the film, baldwin is forced to run all over the city of los angeles in order to protect his "honeycomb" (wife) from being murdered by the brother of a man he previously killed. however, throughout the picture it appears that baldwin can barely pull off maintaining a light jog. his laid back performance succeeds in subtracting from any suspense that the film might have intended to portray. <br /><br />if you are the type of person who enjoys watching very bad films and laughing at their shortcomings, than this film is for you. however, if you are looking for a well made action thriller, it would be best to look somewhere else rather than renting this film.
