it purports to be the life of paul the apostle. it opens with him involved in a loin-cloth wrestling match with a priest. the pharisees were called that because they "separated" themselves from the hellenism being forced upon the jews by their gentile rulers. the point is that saul would never have been involved in greco-roman wrestling. period.<br /><br />then we have the two men (saul and the priest, reuben - a totally extra-biblical fictitious character) shown being washed down in the nude in a roman style bath house. again, the torah, which saul adhered to religiously, condemned in the strongest possible terms looking upon the nakedness of another man.<br /><br />reuben is shown being the one that pushes saul into destroying the church. again, the text of scripture doesn't matter, for their it is paul that says that he laid waste of the church and breathed out threatenings and slaughter against the church.<br /><br />the movie shows barnabas "sprinkling" paul - not baptizing (immersing) him, when the text of scripture says it was ananias that did it.<br /><br />their is no mention of mark or his turning back so the writers of the script are forced to have paul and barnabas argue over paul's desire to preach in rome as the basis of their separation.<br /><br />no silas on paul's second and third missions; no timothy... ever. no titus; no apollos... no, no, noooo!!! james is said to have "known jesus for a long time" rather than it saying, as the text of scripture does, that he is jesus' brother.<br /><br />why not just call the movie "frank, the fictitious apostle?!?!" at least that would be closer to the text of scripture.
