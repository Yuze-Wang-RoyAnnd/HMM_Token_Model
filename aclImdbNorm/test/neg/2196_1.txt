[ as a new resolution for this year 2005, i decide to write a comment for each movie i saw in theater (10%) or in dvd (90%). <br /><br />i must admit that dvd have revolutionized this habit. for instance, i can hear the true voice of the cast, which is an essential trait of the personality. in my country, non french movies are dubbed and we end up with aberrations: french voice is terrible, very far away of its original tone ! the same voice for different people or a same people with different voices !!!! <br /><br />and well, if everybody found my comments unuseful, well, in 2006, i will stop my reviews... ah,ah.... so, enjoy them now !!!! ]<br /><br />my summary means that the story, locations, cast is not very enjoyable...<br /><br />only....<br /><br />sandra bullock is there.. she is a talented actress, able to get the viewer to catch on the movie....<br /><br />it reminds of a feminine "the fugitive".... so if you look for a moment of escaping your life, watching this movie makes it worse because sandra's life is a mess....<br /><br />she got nothing left to hold on to, only her poor mother (who is alzheimer ill: again the touch for depression)....<br /><br />in fact, she has a sad life in the beginning of the movie, has a sadder life throughout it, to finally get back to it at the end.... what a happy ending !!!!<br /><br />maybe the writers wanted to make a point about a nerd's life....<br /><br />very far away from the best computer movie of all time: *wargames*
