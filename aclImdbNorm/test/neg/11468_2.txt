i was looking forward to this flick. being an old robert e howard fan, mainly from a conan stand-point. <br /><br />i was not expecting a great deal and thought they could not mess it up too much.... oh dear - how wrong was i....<br /><br />the main flaw was it was fairly dull. it needed to zip along with a nice helping of supernatural goings-on, sword-fights and the like.<br /><br />you got some gore, but everything else was just pretty life-less. the middle section just seemed to involve 40 minutes in a muddy forest with slow plodding horse-drawn carts and even slower dialogue and character development!<br /><br />on the plus side = costumes and effects were fine, but not enough to keep your interest.<br /><br />i think it would have been better to tone down the gore, up the tempo, and go for a 12a rating. as a ten year old boy, i may have liked this movie. probably about the age i was first reading the conan stories funny enough. perhaps that says a lot about my anticipation of the film?<br /><br />or....... go really "art-house" with tone, direction, etc. but that's fairly high-risk as far as box office is concerned.<br /><br />oh well.... perhaps the next conan movie will make up for it?
