i've just been at the cinema in down town prague watching this film. <br /><br />not due to the poster i found very holywood old-fashioned heroic<br /><br />style. not due to the high level starring which remind me that most<br /><br />of those high starring french films are usually pathetic. but just<br /><br />because there are not so many films in my french mother tongue in a<br /><br />city like prague. and because i love adjani, depardieu and rappenau's<br /><br />cyrano. then i decided to write up this small comment because i think<br /><br />i really don't agree with the comment main stream on this film on imdb.<br /><br />i was not disappointed. the film just look like the poster. the<br /><br />characters are just as stupid as they look like. for a while i<br /><br />thought adjani would be like a caricature -- just a funny character<br /><br />you can laugh at. no she is not! for example when she decides to tell<br /><br />depardieu she is the one who murdered the fat one she killed at the<br /><br />beginning of the film then come the violins in a big fat pathetic<br /><br />music which should make you cry and realize adajani's character is a<br /><br />deeper person as she looks like. maybe this was humor at the 10th<br /><br />level but i am sorry my sense of humor is not that high! if i want to<br /><br />see some funny french film on the wwii i watch once again la grande<br /><br />vadrouille! it is definitively more fun! i have also read on imdb<br /><br />that lemoine is making a great performance in this film. i have to<br /><br />say i have never seen a so bad acting! (well i have never seen any ed<br /><br />wood's film). nevertheless the film is good filmed with a lot of good<br /><br />(very costly) scenes like the one with the pantheon in the morning<br /><br />when the german army arrives at paris or when the refugees settle down<br /><br />on a bridge in bordeaux. i think rappeneau is a good filmmaker but<br /><br />that he does better with a good script. it was easy with cyrano. he<br /><br />had not to write the dialogs!<br /><br />i give 1/10.
