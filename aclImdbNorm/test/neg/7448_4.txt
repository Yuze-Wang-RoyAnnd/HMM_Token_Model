i was a huge fan of the original robocop.<br /><br />but to say i was disappointed by this first sequel would be an understatement.<br /><br />the problems are many.<br /><br />glossy though the film may look there are plenty of bloopers on screen for all to see, wires, cameramen etc, something i find wholly unacceptable from someone of irvin kreshner's pedigree.<br /><br />robocop has become a robot. there is no spark of humanity to be found in the character here. a true disappointment when one considers that his "soul" had returned by the end of the first movie. here his attitude shows no human side and makes him hard to sympathise with.<br /><br />caine is a poor villain. ok i know boddiker from the first film was better than the average, mainly thanks to kurtwood smith's performance, but the usually solid tom noonan creates a character who you couldn't care less about one way or the other.<br /><br />what's happened to the old man????. i appreciate that he didn't get to where he is by being "nice" but the change in his character here is nothing short of dumbfounding. in the first movie it's made clear he despises dick jone's tactics and attitude and yet here he's no better than jones. it makes no sense.<br /><br />doctor faxx is a poor replacement for bob morton's charismatic, if unpleasant, ocp resident genius.<br /><br />the action sequences, save the sequence where murphy is stuck to the side of caine's truck, are harsh and nasty and repel rather than entertain.<br /><br />and finally. what is with the musical score?. don't tell me poledouris couldn't have done it simply because he was working on total recall at the time. a series (tv or movie) soundtrack is part of its personality. part of its character. when you remove that it harms the familiarity of the characters we're watching. so it's bad enough but shame on leonard rosenman. his score here is lurid, camp and downright cringe worthy.<br /><br />the story has its moments to be fair. there's a lot of originality in here. but it tries too many new things to take in with one film. hob is a well realised villain and the only truly dis likable "villian" in the move, thumbs up to gabriel damon there.<br /><br />the final showdown between robocop and robocop 2 is fun as well.<br /><br />but for the vast majority of its overlong running time this is a serious disappointment.
