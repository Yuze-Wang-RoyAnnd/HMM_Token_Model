the person who wrote the summary and rave review for this film is either an idiot or an avid fan of shitty movies. from the beginning, this just spoke of cheap-ass ripoff of "the descent", a far superior film that definitely does not start off slow.<br /><br />from the very first moments of "the cavern", i was amazed at how bad it was, how uninspired and unoriginal it was, how badly written, badly acted and badly directed it was. this is without a doubt one of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life, and that's saying a lot, considering i recently suffered through "pulse". i can't believe this piece of garbage actually won awards, which just goes to show the quality of marijuana and other illegal drugs is much better in australia and other countries than in the u.s.<br /><br />the scenes where the group is running from the "creature" are badly directed, especially the retarded "upside-down-camera", intended to show disorientation, but only coming off as a cheap effect which a first-year film student would be suitably berated for by their teacher.<br /><br />sadly, this "director" will probably go on to make other movies, more than likely of the same low quality as this "film", since i'm sure he hasn't learned from his mistakes, which on this picture were excessive.<br /><br />if i had my way, the entire cast and crew would be sent up the river for life without parole. this film is a crime against humanity.
