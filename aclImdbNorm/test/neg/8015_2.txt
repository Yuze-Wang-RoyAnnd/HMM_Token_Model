i rented this because i couldn't pass up the chance to see pre-hollywood-fame clive owen and catherine zeta jones together, but it definitely wasn't worth it. the only reason i give it two stars instead of one is for the novelty of seeing them before they made it big across the pond.<br /><br />zeta jones, who is usually fun to watch even if she isn't the greatest thesp in the world, is awful. owen seems really uncomfortable to be in such a turkey, plus he wears a ridiculous, egregiously ill-fitting chin-length wig (at least i hope that's a wig and not his real hair). and the scene where he dances a country jig with zeta jones just makes you embarrassed for him. joan plowright walks around in a daze the whole movie -- she's probably wondering how she got herself into such a mess.<br /><br />the actress who plays clive owen's wife isn't terrible, but just about everyone else is. oh, and the writing stinks too.
