"catchfire" or "backtrack" as it is sometimes called, is not very good. that is, it's bad. jodie foster had already won an oscar at this point. why did she agree to do this? i don't know.<br /><br />the hostage/kidnapper relationship is not believable, even if it is a common psychological phenomenon in real life.<br /><br />worst of all, this film features a scene where hopper and foster ride a boat under the fremont bridge (a bridge in seattle) which means that traffic had to stop so that the bridge could open. i've had to wait for that bridge to go down many times, almost all of them on the bus. it's not a pleasant wait. this film caused unnecessary bridge-waiting and the world is a worse place for it.
