this tvm seems to have polarised opinions amongst the commentators on this page so perhaps i can settle everything by saying this is a very stupid not very well made television movie . how bad is it ? it's a teleplay that can't even decide what its name is because while everyone in america calls it linda it's known in britain as lust for murder and it's usually a bad sign when a movie has to change its name . and can i also point out that it's not a tongue in cheek spoof as somebody else claimed <br /><br />i will be honest and say the plot is rather sound . linda and paul cowley meet another couple called the jeffries who they get on very well with . they get on so well that they go on holiday together ( make up your own mind if there's some wife swapping going on ) and paul sees his wife kill the jeffries . after that the plot takes a shock twist <br /><br />writing the above paragraph i have suddenly realised the large amount of potential the story had and i won't say anything to put you off the premise . it's just that when the story continues after the events i've described things become more and more unlikely and bizarre . not only that but the production values are fairly unimpressive with the actor playing paul cowley doing a very wooden voice over that irritates while most of the scenes - exterior and interior - look like they've been filmed on a foggy day
