i had this dvd to watch, thinking that i would see a type of biography o painter goya, but the movie was about everything but goya. this movie is about a young woman taken away from her family by the holy inquisition, allegedly because she practiced jewish rituals (only because the poor girl did not like eating pork!). the rest of the movie is about torture, humiliation, driven by a poor script (can't believe it is by jc carri`ere as i could not believe this cr** is directed by mr milos forman) centered on a religious man and that young woman and that is all. <br /><br />ah, and there is goya, i forgot, playing a completely peripheral role - that could be the role of john, paul, peter, manuel, joaquim, jose or anyone. very disappointing - one one these movies that will be forgotten for ever (if it has not had happened yet). rent "the name of the rose" if you want a movie about the holy inquisition. and i don't know what you should rent, if you want to watch a movie about spanish painter goya. maybe a director of a good caliber, not forman, still needs to make it. ps: the spanish painter, goya - the title role who is lost in the plot - is portrayed by a scandinavian actor, something that makes this film even more difficult to be taken seriously. maybe next time we should send javier barden to play the biopic of norwegian painter, edvard munch!
