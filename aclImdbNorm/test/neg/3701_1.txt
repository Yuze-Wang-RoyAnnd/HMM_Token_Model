i know a lot of people like this show and i apologise to people who think this show is awesome but it is the worst show ever created. sure i'm sure i would be a big fan of this show if jeremy clarkson wasn't on it. i mean i think that testing out cars and doing things like seeing whether a car can beat a aeroplane is awesome! but jeremy clarkson is just pathetic. here are the reasons i hate this man: . he thinks it's cool to trick speed cameras that measure your average speed by taking measuring your distance and time by driving 200mph down the road and then resting for two hours. . he clearly thinks that he is better than richard hammond and james may. . he's got my best friend saying pathetic things. . he screams at kids just for taking a picture of him. i'm sorry top gear but jeremy clarkson is a freak.
