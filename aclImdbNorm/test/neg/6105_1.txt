i don't know what chasidik movement was this film about?i saw this film a year ago.i am an orthodox woman, living in an orthodox chasidic? community and i can tell you i was offended by this movie!it's so far away from the reality, it's scary ! the director could at least hire a chasidik rabbi for a brief consultation, before making a "realistic" movie about ultra -orthodoxs! for example meir's davening (morning prayers)! or a jewish wedding, or a mikveh ( ritual bath ) customs.<br /><br />movie is loaded with technical inaccuracies..but it's not them that bothered me. it's the spiritual side. orthodoxs are portrayed next to taliban. woman are powerless, while men are the ultimate rulers ! please!no one can force a jewish girl to the chuppa against her will ! we ,orthodoxs,also, live by the law (halacha ) which clearly states man's responsibilities towards his wife.no beating and no raping,also!and no man ( even rabbi)is allowed to peak at the woman in the mikveh.and balanit is not to place a hand over woman's head,while she's taking a ritual bath, the idea is to immerse the whole body at one time! director was clearly trying to bash ultra orthodoxs ! but could he do so at least in a nice and more educated manner?<br /><br />love story? cute ! but not credible.dialogs are long and boring.the ending sucked totally.for all that drama i was at least hoping for a nice ending ,for all that sitting i felt i deserved it! obviously someone was trying to make a nice consciousness soothing movie for less observant jews, or for non- jews, perhaps..(look at those fundamentalist, they are so evil and mean...)and they succeed! long thing short: was hoping for a nice europien (kane level ) movie, got instead a tradition bashing, unrealistic,mistakenly guiding junk. i mean , today,we live in a time of a free will as never before. everyone has a right to choose. malka chose a rock singer.rivka made her choice.meir made his. many people from non observing backgrounds are choosing orthodox judaism these days.because,in this mad world religion might be a nice gateway !
