if you and your friends find as much humor and enjoyment from horrible acting, jokes, props, and overall film making as me and my friends, you need to rent this.<br /><br />from simply reading the tag line and seeing how not funny it is, you should assume more not funny, poor quality, great, hilarious content through out. its a tale of some of kids who defy every law of physics and reality and fly back in time through a modern day big screen tv to a world of dinosaurs who eventually become their friends. not to mention a hilariously serious scene where t-rex becomes a father figure for one of the kids. yeah...<br /><br />it should be in the comedy section but you'll find it with kid movies if you find it at all. so call your friends over, sit back, relax, get ready to laugh, and enjoy. you will be quoting the laughably horrific one liners in this movie for weeks. "whats with all the ruckus?!"
