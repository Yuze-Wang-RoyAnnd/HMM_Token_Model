this formulaic film (hero's girlfriend marries the villain) just didn't move along fast enough given some of the circumstances of the story. scott seems too old in this one, and too many times his character turns away from decisive action, deflating the scenes. he responds to the deaths of some of his hands weakly; he escapes from knox's gang by hiding in a full rain barrel; his escape to the high country and pursuit by john russell seem superfluous, as does much of the film. the plot could have been tightened. <br /><br />high points of the film: seeing "tennessee" ernie ford without a mustache singing "man in the saddle"; alfonso bedoya's too brief scenes as a cook; the color photography of the high country, and the fight scene there with john russell.
