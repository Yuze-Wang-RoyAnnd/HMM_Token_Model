this documentary was neither professionally nor objectively made. the whole thing played out like a conspiracy theory by ibm to win the match in question just to make some money. garry kasparov has an ego problem. he was puffed up before the match and when he lost, he didn't like it. i remember playing chess against computers back in the 80s and it wasn't too difficult to win. as time went on, i started to lose and didn't like it. today, i simply don't play against computers anymore because they're just too good. not only that, the games are uninteresting and lack the appeal of human games, where both sides are more likely to err and open the game to exciting possibilities. this documentary keeps showing us images of the turk which is an ancient chess playing automaton that was really controlled by a human being. from the start until the end we are lead to believe that ibm short of literally hid a human gm in the back of their cupboard-sized computer. i'm a computer scientist and take offense at the notion that just because garry lost, ibm must have cheated. i know how computers play chess. it's not magic and it's no mystery. they can be trained, have huge amounts of chess knowledge and they most certainly see positions and possibilities in unprecedented detail compared to humans. it's really no surprise that deep blue won. perhaps at the time it was. if it happened today, given the ever-increasing processing power of machines; people would hardly blink. if a machine couldn't at least draw with a gm today, people would think the program was weak.
