i have vague memories of this movie being funny.<br /><br />having seen it again either i have changed or i was thinking about a another film altogether.<br /><br />it seems as if we are supposed to be sympathetic to jackie mason's character however nothing in the movie actually engenders that emotion. its notable that he is really the only person accorded tender dialogue with loved ones. no-one else's character is allowed to rise to the status of even vaguely human.<br /><br />i don't even like golf but as the film went on i found myself really rooting for robart stack and the club guys, really hoping they would repel mason and chevy chase.
