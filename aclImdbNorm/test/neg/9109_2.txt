**might contain spoilers**<br /><br />ok, lets conclude this movie in one word: bad. two words? really bad. now why do i think that? let me explain. <br /><br />guttenberg leads a special-ops team consisting of four persons that get assigned to retake an lethal virus after some arms-dealer stole it from a lab. they do this by attacking the arm-dealers in mid-flight and somehow gets back the virus after some fighting. however, suspicions arise about guttenberg because one of the terrorist knew his name. after debriefing the team-members get attacked by unknown persons and everyone starts to suspect everyone else is involved. after deciding they cant trust their bosses, they decide to, once again, steal the virus and try to lure out the possible attackers.<br /><br />in theory this is a plot that could have worked in a low-budget movie that just aims to be aired on tv. however, the plot is compromised and the movie ruined in several accounts. firstly, the plot is totally predictable and it is not fun to know how the movie is going to end after three minutes. second. the acting is really bad, or the actors are directed to act as dummys. there aren't many emotions, change of facial expressions at all etc. i was especially disappointed in guttenberg that i believe can do so much more, but fails completely in an attempt to be a rough action-hero. in addition, though i am not by any means any expert on the subject, i totally believe i could assemble a better covert-ops team by picking up five strangers and train them for a week. this seems to be a theme in the movie to do things as stupid and unprofessionally as possible. this go for good guys, bad guys and bystanders as well. then i sincerely doubt the scientific and technical consultants, if any, of the film. for example, i have poured liquid nitrogen over my hand and i didn't break instantly.<br /><br />don't know how to conclude this really, but lets say that this movie has a predictable plot, bad acting and they seem to be amateurs in whatever the do. sorry, can't be any nicer than that. do not watch this movie, it is not even so bad it is funny. 2/10
