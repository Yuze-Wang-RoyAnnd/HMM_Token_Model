this might sound weird, but i only got to see the first movie (the emperor's new groove, yaddayadda) a week ago and only because of one episode of the tv show. i simply adore kuzco's character, but kronk isn't that bad either. anyway, eventually i decided to watch the second film, just so i would've seen it. hoped it would be as good as the first one, but... i'm sorry to tell this, but the more the humour got american, the more i yawned. i agreed with kuzco when he started crying seeing all the cheesy footage.<br /><br />still, younger kids and probably veterans too will love this movie to bits (if they like the old school moralising disney that is), but i just had expectations that were an eensy teensy little bit hell of a lot higher than they should've been. kronk is a lovely character, being good hearted and dumb all at once, but it were pacha and kuzco in drag that woke me up at the end of the movie. (i'll ignore rudy... for as far that's possible).<br /><br />anyway, great movie, just not my style and as they say, you always have to be true to your groove.
