a truly masterful piece of filmmaking. it managed to put me to sleep and to boggle my mind. so boring that it induces sleep and yet so ludicrous that it made me wonder how stuff like this gets made. avoid at all costs. that is, unless you like taking invisible cranial punishment, in which case i highly recommend it.
