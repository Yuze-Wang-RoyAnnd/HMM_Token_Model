subspecies is set in romania where two american college students michele (laura mae tate) & lillian (michelle mcbride) arrive to study local folklore with the aid of local friend mara (irina movila). there they rent rooms in a hotel & become curious about the mysterious ruins of a nearby castle, it turns out that a powerful & evil vampire named radu (anders hove) lives there who has stolen the bloodstone from his father king vladislav (angus scrimm). radu takes a fancy to the three girls & starts drinking the blood of mara & lillian, meanwhile michele falls for a guy named stefan (michael watson) who just so happens to be radu's brother. michele & stefan decide to team up & rid the world of the evil radu...<br /><br />directed by ted nicolaou this film seems to be quite highly regarded amongst genre fans & while it's not terrible i certainly wouldn't call it very good & i could't really see anything much to get excited about. subspecies is a rather slow going film, not that much actually happens & while it does try to stay close to certain classic vampire lore there's all this nonsense about a bloodstone & some little monsters that grow from the tips of radu's severed fingers for some reason. subspecies could have been a half decent film if not for the fact that it's dull, i really can't remember that much about it, good or bad. the character's are alright but some f the dialogue is silly & there's a scene which bugged me near the start when the girls are at the castle ruins & one says they have to go because it's getting dark yet it's still clearly the middle of the day & very bright. there's also a scene where one of the american girls finds a coffin that hotel's attic & doesn't really seem that bothered by it, i am not being funny but is some bloke whose house i was staying at had a coffin in his attic i would be very, very worried if you know what i mean. i don't think i would ever want to watch it again, there's no real threat, the plot is weak that mixes classic vampire themes with silly subplots & i was distinctly unmoved by it all. not the worst film ever but hardly the best either.<br /><br />the film looks alright with nice locations & some local scenery although you feel the look is down to the budget rather than the makers attempt a authenticity. there's not much gore apart from a decapitation & some broken off finger tips. for no apparent reason the makers throw in some average looking stop-motion animated monsters that really don't do anything or have much significance to the story.<br /><br />filmed on the cheap by charles band's full moon entertainment production company in bucharest in romania, the production values are alright & better than many later day band productions. the acting isn't great with many of the cast putting in below par performances while genre regular angus scrimm has a small cameo at the start. there's a little bit of style here on occasion with a few scene reminding heavily of the original nosferatu (1922) in particular the bit showing radu's shadow coming down the stair with his long claw like fingernails standing out.<br /><br />subspecies is a film that many seem to like for reasons i don't quite see, i thought it was throughly average at best & overall rather dull. followed by bloodstone: subspecies ii (1993), bloodlust: subspecies iii (1994), subspecies 4: bloodstorm (1998) & the spin0off film vampire journals (1997).
