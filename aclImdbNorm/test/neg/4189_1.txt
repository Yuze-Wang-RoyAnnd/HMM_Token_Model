this is by far the worst ever 'horror' movie, no, make that any movie, i have ever watched. shame on block buster for even carrying this type of crap. i never ask for a refund on any movie, but i think this will be a first.<br /><br />the movie is so bad that i had to stop after just 15 minutes of watching it.<br /><br />i had more fun watching any of the fuzzy youtube movies than watching this piece of dropping.<br /><br />the marketing dude for this movie must have some type of silver tongue to move this thing into an establishment as blockbuster.
