this film did well at the box office, and the producers of this mess thought the stars had such good chemistry in this that they cast them in the much darker screwball farce, the gazebo. frankly, i am shocked to see all the positive comments on this ludicrously plotted unfunny comedy. both lead characters have the maturity of seven-year-olds and are much less interesting to spend time with. a veteran supporting cast including fred clark, harry morgan, and eva gabor lend excellent support. and, the beautiful cinematography certainly makes the rich countryside of spain seem lush. and, there are four or five truly funny scenes to go with two wise scenes and a whole bunch of recycled and unfunny clutter.<br /><br />i cannot recommend it started with a kiss.
