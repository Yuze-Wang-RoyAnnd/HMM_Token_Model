this is a fine concept piece and the acting by brando is a fine piece of work. dean martin isn't bad and montgomery clift is quite good as well. unfortunately, it's a very disjointed, very long piece that really should have been edited down to something closer to 2 hours (it's almost 3 hours). <br /><br />we follow the lives of 3 men from 1938 through the end of wwii and watch as they discover who they are and what they might become as they discover both the world about them and what they're made of. for some, it's the women in their lives that brings about this realization, for others, it's the broader general circumstances. all too often however, i found myself asking what had just happened or what the import of a particular scene was.
