although i think the reviewers who hated this movie have encapsulated exactly what it does wrong (everything!), i had to add my two cents. if you'd like a long version of how terrible this movie is, please read the review by coinlightning.<br /><br />here's the short version: shameless use of the actors' names to propel the plot as opposed to using their talent (no one brought their "a game" to this), blatant commercialism (i guess pepsi can afford to stick an advertisement - or 40 - into a movie now), and a plot (???) that was so convoluted with "rock star" clich'es that it was totally ridiculous.<br /><br />let me put it to you this way . . . i was thinking of 'wayne's world' the whole time i was watching this movie, but i wasn't laughing! anytime you try to throw in steven tyler (aerosmith) to help your movie plot along you've got serious problems.<br /><br />please, warn your friends and family - this movie sucks.
