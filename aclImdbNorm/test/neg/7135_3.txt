i would not deny that i have quite enjoyed watching any japanese horror films, but everyone must get quite fed up with them after you have seen the same thing over and over.<br /><br />the film follows the story of the grudge. audrey, as requested by her mom, is going to get her sister back. but when she arrives, something strange happens to her sister and then her sister is killed. she wants to find out the truth behind the curse and later a photographer (eason) joins her. on the other hand, there's also something happening to a family and three girls, but they seem to realise it too late...<br /><br />in fact, i can't see the points for the three girls from international school to appear in the movies as they're not (quite) related to the story. the reason why the woman holding the grudge keeps killing people is still not very clear (it seems to me they're just telling the same things i saw in the grudge). and the sudden appearance of audrey in front of the boy is undoubtedly odd, which i suppose is an attempt to make the story about the family related. the killing scenes are absolutely the mixture of those in the ring and shibuya kaidan. the acting would be another bad point. as a hong konger i would really like to support edison chen's first effort in hollywood, but as a film lover i really can't find any point to support bad acting. other actors like the father , though he just appears in a few scenes, should also have done better. what is kept good is the atmosphere of the film, especially when i watched it in the middle of the night alone.<br /><br />if you have time, really enjoy any horror films and have seen all the possible horror films except this, like me, you can go for it to kill some time. but if you really like japanese horror films of this kind, you should spend some time watching the japanese version of the ring.
