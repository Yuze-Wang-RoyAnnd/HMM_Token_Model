why does the poster & artwork say "clubbed is one of the best uk indie films i have seen in a very long time. screen international" when it was a quote of the french distributor reported by screen international (an influential film trade publication). see www.screendaily.com/screendailyarticle.aspx?intstoryid=39811 which reads:<br /><br />"pretty pictures has acquired all french-speaking rights to neil thompson's clubbed ....james velaise, president of pretty pictures, said: "clubbed is one of the best uk indie films i have seen in a very long time.""<br /><br />isn't this rather misleading? the distributor is bound to say it's good. are the other quotes real?
