i'm sure a lot of guys will love this movie. the only woman who shows any "balls" (unfortunate pun regretted) is made to look, talk, and seem like a guy, the other 2 women are portrayed either as sexual objects with one thing on their mind- sex / being sexy, with sex as their only attribute and skill (iris) - or as freaked out pretty little princesses who's neurosis negates any strength and professional authority they had before all hell broke lose (doc). the only strength iris has in the end is the result of some advice from a big strong man. besides my negative gut reaction as a feminist, i have to give the camera work props- and ethan hawke is great in the very first scene. after that his performance loses steam. empty entertainment for a brain that wants to take it easy. at least the film skims the subject of the duality of good/bad in the criminal mind.
