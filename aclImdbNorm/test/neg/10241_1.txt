if ever there was a film that can be considered a missed opportunity then that film is galaxina. what could possibly be wrong in basing a sci-fi film around a sexy statuesque female android? surely such a film could never be a complete waste of time? well, sadly this movie is pretty close to useless. there are a number of faults with this production it has to be said, however, there are two basic problems that entirely destroy the whole enterprise. firstly, this is a comedy with no funny bits at all, or at the very least a film where the potentially amusing aspects are presented in an incredibly unamusing way. secondly, the title character is woefully underused. this may be because dorothy stratten was not really an actress but if so it was a terrible decision as she is still easily the best thing about the film. i don't think she really needed to be a great thespian to pull off the role of a sexy android to be perfectly honest. anyway, what we are left with is a whole lot of mind-numbing comedy relief, which often is made up of hopeless spoof-type gags of the big sci-fi hits of the time such as alien, star wars and 2001. it's badly written and not funny at all, and it doesn't even really have a plot to propel things along. the story basically is about a police space-cruiser that is sent to get a rock. that's it! steven spielberg once said that a high-concept movie was one whose plot line could be described in one sentence. what he didn't define was what you call a movie that can be described in less than a sentence - pointless maybe?<br /><br />this seemed like a sure-fire winner to me but it failed miserably. it seems to have been an attempt to spoof star wars and combine it with adult comedy situations. all it does actually achieve is to leave you cold and a little irritated that it wasn't close to what it should've been. a barbarella for the 80's this ain't.<br /><br />shortly after this film was finished dorothy stratten was murdered in an appallingly violent and horrific way. and for that reason galaxina has derived a considerable amount of it's cult interest. i just think it's a great shame that dorothy didn't have a better film left to immortalise her.
