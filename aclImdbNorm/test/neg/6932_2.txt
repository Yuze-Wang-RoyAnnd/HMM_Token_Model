i can only guess that this movie was an experiment that misfired. years earlier, it would have been moving images accompanied by music. later, it would have been sound added to silents. eventually it would have been technicolor, cinemascope or imax. this movie must have been a misguided attempt to introduce a new element to the talking picture. during all the emotional scenes, the character stops in mid dialogue and their inner thoughts are narrated while they gaze off into the distance or appeal to the camera. this interruption is painful at it's very least. imagine these top tier actors trying to look busy while the narration drones on. painful. i have no idea who came up with this gimmick, but it was the only time i ever saw it used - and for good reason. in every scene the actors were forced to roll their eyes, wring their hands, or overact to such a degree, i actually wondered if this was really a comedy. <br /><br />the story is a hopeless soap opera that takes place over a couple of generations. norma shearer, disappointed in love, searches for a reason to live. she has a friend, played by ralph morgan, who worships her - but she takes him for granted. she is attracted to a doctor, played by clark gable, but he is self absorbed and isn't interested in her. she settles for a weakling that needs her desperately. she marries him only to find that there is insanity in his family and she can never have a child with him. along comes the doctor who selfishly pops a bun in her oven, only to find out later that he loves her after all. the child builds confidence in her husband who becomes a success, but she realizes that it's really clark she loves after all. confused yet? forget the rest, just watch a couple of episodes of "as the world turns" and it'll all become clear.<br /><br />if your are ever forced to watch this movie, hold out for the final scene. the gyrations of the actors put harold lloyd to shame. it is not to be missed.
