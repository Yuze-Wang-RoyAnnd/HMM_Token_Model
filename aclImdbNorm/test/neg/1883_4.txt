i appear to be in the minority on this one, but i found one true thing to be schmaltzy, contrived and generally unpleasant. not that the acting was all that bad, but the characters seemed little more than archetypes (the bad father, oh, but wait, maybe he's not unredeemably bad; maybe there can be a resolution at the end . . .). admittedly, the woman i was with loved the movie, so maybe you'll like it. but i didn't.
