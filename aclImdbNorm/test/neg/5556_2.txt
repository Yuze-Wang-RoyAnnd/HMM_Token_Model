ok i have seen hershall gordon lewis movies before but this one really takes the cake,its really gory and gross,not to mention disgusting the way the strippers are done in,i'm talking bad acting that makes plan 9 from outer space look like hamlet,the only saving grace is the late great henny youngman as the strip club owner,yeah take my wife..., please.the stripteasers are real sexy for 1972,i believe they used this same plot again in the roger corman movie;stripped to kill in 1987.i did enjoy the earlier h.g.lewis flick 100 maniacs,which was a mini masterpiece of sorts,but bad acting,no awards here,but be aware this is a splatter movie that paved the way for friday the 13th,and saw.in one disturbing scene a half naked stripper has her butt spanked with a meat tenderizer.ugh!morbid stuff here.h.g. lewis strikes again. 2 out of 10.
