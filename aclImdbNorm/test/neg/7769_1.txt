i truly despair for womankind when they discuss this joke of a programme as if it's intellectually engaging and promotes female liberation and independence. this show is the biggest insult to women next to all those libidinous hip-hop videos. if talking like a bunch of reckless teenage boys over $100 lunches in swanky restaurants, indiscriminately shopping for unnecessary fashion and jumping into bed with the nearest male in site is considered empowering, the fate of western women may be doomed as we speak.<br /><br />aside from the damage it does to the female gender, sex and the city is not entertaining. not once has it been funny, captivating, exciting or original. the episodes play out monotonously. each character are factory produced mannequins who behave in the same manner every episode. not once have any of these shallow, unattractive women evolved. perhaps the worst is lead character carrie bradshaw. aside from looking hideous, her penchant for over analysis of relationships is cringe worthy. on top of all this, the show portrays men as a bunch of empty headed slobs who are unable to commit to healthy relationships. even when there is a decent man, he is somehow painted as a villain. the utter lack of empathy for men is clearly the work of some "progressive" pseudo feminist.<br /><br />saddest part of the whole show is that these women live unfortunate miserable lives. any intelligent woman would never envy them. it is a banal show with even more banal characters. the nyc tourist board must hate the way this garbage is showing up their otherwise fine city! thankfully this train wreck is over! desperate housewives is seen as the fitting replacement for satc. while dh can be quite far-fetched, at least it explores women in more multi-faceted ways. plus it treats men more respectfully and it's actually entertaining!
