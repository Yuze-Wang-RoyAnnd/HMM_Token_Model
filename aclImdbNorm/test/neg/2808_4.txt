i didn't expect too much from this movie, but i was still disappointed. it's supposed to be a comedy, but there are only four or five scenes where i actually laughed, and i think that's rather poor. there is no real plot either, i always had the feeling that most of the scenes could have been put anywhere in the movie because there's no connection between them. but the worst thing was the "acting" of kim franke. he has one facial expression during the whole movie, as if he was supposed to play some retarded guy, but i believe that's not the case. all in all i rate it four out of ten, i've seen worse movies than this, but i wouldn't spend money on this one again.
