i'm guessing that the movie was based on a hefty book. given the number of characters and subplots during katyn, i thought that the movie creators, perhaps the writer or director, intended to create an epic movie. but really there wasn't enough time to properly spend on developing characters or story. aggravatingly, there were many unrelated side-stories that could have been edited out.<br /><br />in relating the events leading up to the mass-murder of all these intellectuals and officers, i don't think the movie explained any reasons why murder was necessary. was it political? philosophical? revenge? the interesting part of historical movies are seeing personal motivations or emotions. instead, the murderers of katyn seemed like automatons, controlled entirely by stalin, who's appears occasionally framed as a charcoal sketch. the portrayal of the russians and germans seemed entirely one-dimensional. (are polish people just that angry at the russians?) besides being badly edited and biased or at least unrealistic, choices of music and cinematography felt mismatched to each other and to the movie itself. i don't think you can really shoot an epic war film or war event on hand-held camera. (but if the director went with a character-driven story, perhaps by focusing on a single family, maybe the handy-cam approach would have worked better.) and if you use really dramatic music, it needs to be better balanced to the type of shots made.
