geologist realizes a big earthquake is coming but no one will listen. whats worse is his father in law had predicted the 1923 tokyo disaster and he's been called unworthy to be his successor. of course the big one comes and tokyo is knocked flat.<br /><br />a poorly dubbed japanese film that is pure soap opera for the first half. the second half- after the earthquake destroys a model city its an escape drama. there are some nice moments but the film wastes them either by undercutting the action by too many poor miniatures or by having people do unreal things. hokey and not very good it has an ending you won't believe...
