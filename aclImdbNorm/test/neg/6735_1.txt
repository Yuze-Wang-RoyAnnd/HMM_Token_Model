if i could have given this film 0/10 i would, and this is the first film i have wanted to rate so low. its worse than awful. if i went to see it in the cinema i would want the cinema to pay me for watching it (at least minimum wage). some of the camera shots were quite effective, but a lot were rubbish eg. villains reflection in a mirror that separates his head and shoulders side-ways from his body (seeing is believing). several totally pointless killings of innocent civilians. 2 murders that made me laugh out loud due to the victims actions/facial expressions when they were shot. i only watched it to the end (fast forwarding about 10 mins of the boring pointless dialogue) hoping to see seagal in some decent hand to hand combat, but there was almost none of that (should have known that when at the beginning he threw someone while going down an elevator and it was shown in slow motion with music - end of 'action' scene). in one scene we see seagal hand chop someones neck in slow motion which makes it obvious that his hand never even made contact). the chief villain keeps coming back to life. he gets shot in the chest on 2 separate occasions. the 1st time its with a shotgun which blows him out the 2nd/3rd floor onto the street. to sum up, this film is a total waste of time and a total joke. it looks very low budget (even for seagal). the colour is dull and grey. i could go on and on....just like this film, but i wont. watch this film if you've got insomnia. its guaranteed to put you to sleep.
