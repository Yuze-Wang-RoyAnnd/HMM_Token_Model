maybe james p. lay knows what do to in the sound department if a director supervises him.<br /><br />in 'dreamland (2007)' however, he cannot accomplish anything as a writer or as a director.<br /><br />there is absolutely nothing in this film, no story, no character building, no events, no atmosphere, no plot, no twists, no acting that deserves that name.<br /><br />in any of those departments this movie is billions of light years behind any short film that has some actual thinking in it, even a one minute one.<br /><br />it has nothing to do with any of david lynch's works!<br /><br />i actually think it could be used as mental torture or as negative propaganda material against the west.<br /><br />recommend it only to your worst enemies!
