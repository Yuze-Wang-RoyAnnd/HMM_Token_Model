jerk hazer mike(david zelina playing this college frat man as one major bastard you want to see die right away)and his college cronies leave hypoglycemic diabetic sam(caleb roehrig)hanging on a wooden cross along with this scarecrow which is a legendary ghost story. they get po'd at sam who essentially goes into shock and aims a swinging punch at mike that lands across his girlfriend patty(kristina sheldon)instead so leaving the poor guy hanging is his punishment. somehow, sam's soul "emerges" with the inanimate scarecrow who comes from the cross to destroy everyone who left the poor guy there to rot. mike and the gang send the uninitiated dorks back to bring sam down but they are the first to receive a swinging blade across their throats. mike and his posse head for the beach to gulp booze, play volleyball & bicker until the scarecrow arrives to end their little soir'ee. sam's substitute brother jack(matthew linhardt)is supposed to look out for him, but decides to sleep with new love-interest beth(samantha aisling)instead. so when he receives a cell-phone message from mike concerning how they left sam hanging on the cross while they were off at the beach taking in the sun and sand, jack is frenzied with fear. beth's estranged father is a doctor and he agrees to see after sam's condition after they cut the nearly dead young man down taking him to emergency hospital. returning to the beach to confront mike because of his negligence(..not to mention jack's promise to coach ramsey, played by ufc fighter ken shamrock, regarding no hazing), jack and beth will face the same straw-stuffed assassin that is bumping off the others. coach ramsey, who was part of a past hazing incident that went awry causing killer-scarecrow-mischief, has to confront some demons himself as he informs the survivors of the group about what they are up against.<br /><br />babes, boobs, and blood..this flick follows the basic slasher guidelines. yet, this flick also carries the typical slasher traits of corny characters, acting, dialogue and overall plot. the flick shows signs of it's low budget particularly in the violence as most of the real action takes place off-screen instead of showing it happening up, close & personal. what appears on screen is mostly the aftermath of the killer's vengeance:one fellow holding his guts, another with a stake(holding up the group's volleyball net) plunged through his chest, blood spatter after a woman gets hit over the head presumably with a large rock, one chick laying dead after the scarecrow hit her with the suv, etc. there is also some dubbing problems where it's clear the sounds of their voices often don't match the movements of their lips..particularly the unintentionally hilarious sequence where ed(travis parker), wannabe rock star, is singing to his buddies a horrible song they all seem quite impressed with.
