this movie is one of the worst movie i have ever seen in my life! i waste my time on this. i watched this movie completely as i took it a punishment for me. i wonder how suneel darshan could make such a movie? it doesn't have any continutity. it feels he just shoot scenes and then joined them in some editing software!!! music is of course good but the film doesn't need so many unwanted songs. kangana ranaut looks fake and i wonder what role does celina jaietly has in the movie? bobby deol is good. at least he can act! upen patel needs to take some acting lessons rather than taking off his shirts in almost all the scenes! the end was the most pathetic!<br /><br />i watched shakalaka boom boom after watching "300" (the movie), you guys can really imagine what i felt about this bollywood movie. <br /><br />i really respect bollywood but please directors and producers, get real, not everything is fantasy!
