i can confidently say that this is the worst film i have ever seen, and i usually love foreign films. the movie is nothing more than poorly-made violent pornography. if you choose to see it, prepare yourself for endless sexism, gratuitous nudity shots, and a stupid sensationalized rape scene, which i'm sure is the main appeal for the people who like the movie. <br /><br />additionally, the plot meanders aimlessly, and none of the characters is likable. many scenes are filmed from the woods surrounding the river the girls are on to give a constant feeling that someone is stalking them, which was a pathetic attempt to make up for the lack of story to tell.<br /><br />perhaps i wouldn't have wasted my time to see the movie, if it had been accurately described in reviews.
