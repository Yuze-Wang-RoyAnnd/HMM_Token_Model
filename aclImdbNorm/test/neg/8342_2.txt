considering the subject matter, i thought that this film would at least be enjoyable, if stopping somewhat short of a masterpiece. i was wrong. i was still waiting for something to happen and it finished - i thought that the finale was the bit that happened before it got exciting. the only reason i gave it 2 instead of 1 is because the effects guys deserve some recognition.
