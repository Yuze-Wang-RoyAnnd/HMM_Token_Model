here's yet another movie with dysfunctional lead characters who are totally amoral and, yet, we're supposed to root for them? not me. no character in this film was worth a damn.<br /><br />robin williams plays car salesman "joey o'brien." the man has no class, a loser in every moral sense and a guy who thinks he can talk his way out of anything. knowing williams' ability to talk, he was good for this role. the women in his life are driving him loony, too. some of them aren't much better than him.<br /><br />tim robbins plays a similar low-life who starts the take over the film when he, fully loaded with explosives, crashes into a car dealership showroom and holds people, including his wife, hostage. robbins, as in normal for him, plays a disturbed and ridiculous character. i guess these nut-case roles come easily to these two actors. gee, i wonder why.<br /><br />there is so much yelling and screaming in this the movie that it will give you a headache. combine those two screamers with the nasal voice of fran drescher and you really have an annoying over-the-top cast. this is like listening to chalk on a blackboard for an hour-and- a-half. this is comedy? no, this is lame. <br /><br />in fact, for a robin williams film to only have a dozen reviews posted here tells you something. it's a far cry from his best movie.
