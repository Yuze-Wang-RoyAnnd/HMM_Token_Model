this movie was a poor movie. the plot was poor and the comedy they "tried" to deliver came out poorly. the accidents seem contrived and predictable. i thought the actors tried to some extent but with this movie, it was so lame it can only go so far.one of the worst films i have seen and don't recommend it to anyone. the only accident to mr. accident was it's release.
