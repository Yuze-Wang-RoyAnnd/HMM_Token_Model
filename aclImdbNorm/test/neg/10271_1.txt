wow. what can i say? i was born in 1960. i love bad tv movies. love them. i get involved. the works. i want to get involved. i'm spending time watching the thing. i watched the emmys last night on tv. how in the infinite world was the empire falls (excellent name)tv movie up for any awards? it truly had wonderful talent. of course. and they tried admirably. but how can anyone pretend that was an ok (tv for goodness sakes) screenplay? ok direction? you know, i wish everyone the best. really. but i thought it was totally mind-bending that hollywood was placing this very very bad film up for so many honors. awards? for me it was sort of a wake-up call that hollywood is such a small insular community. being cynical is not really my thing. but wow. --xptyngi
