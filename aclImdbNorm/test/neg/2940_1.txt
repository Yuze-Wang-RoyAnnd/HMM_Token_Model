stay the hell away from this one... no, really i'm serious - i know you might think this is a fun, campy, cheesy hong kong action style b movie. i did, but trust me, it's not. in fact, the only thing accurate about that description would be the words hong kong, and then only used in a strictly geographical sense.<br /><br />yes, donnie yen has co-directed it. jackie chan has a cameo. the guy ekin cheng, from storm riders plays the lead. it got vampires. it should be good - or at least fun, charming and action packed. once again - it's not.<br /><br />i could digress on why this movie sucks - i could dissect it, hack it to tiny, shivering pieces. but where to start? there's so much to hate...<br /><br />to make it easier, and to give this hate-fest some credability, let me say that i'm usually a big fan of hog kong cinema. the heavier drama stuff as well as the more lighthearted action and/or comedy.the really good movies as well as the really cheesy ones. i can sit through hours of bad subtitling, jokes lame enough to make first graders roll their eyes. i can handle lovers as chaste and celibate as a convention of nuns, that and pretty much anything else the average film goer would bang their metaphorical toes against on their way between action sequences. also, hong kong or any other origin - i love it when a movie goes from just being bad to bad enough to be good.<br /><br />but this - arrgh! it's just horrible, stupid, unwatchable garbage. so far from being funny or charming it's actually painful. so derived of action it makes a bergman movie look like the texas chainsaw massacre.<br /><br />why?! why waste such an opportunity?! this could have been so much fun!
