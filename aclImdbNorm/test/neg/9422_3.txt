solo is an action movie about a terminator-like android that is constructed and trained for the military. when a flaw is discovered, he is issued to be deprogrammed. rather than face death, he chooses to flee into the jungles of central america, where he takes refuge in a village. the military chases him into there, leading into a big action feast.<br /><br />mario van peebles does a decent performance the android. his movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done. actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero. and it works out; the action scenes aren't that spectacular, but they aren't all too bad either. the acting from the other characters is pretty bad, but i was not expecting anything too good. the special effects were decent as well.<br /><br />solo is decent as an action flick, but very forgettable. it lacks the substance that most movies possess. but if you just want to pass a couple hours without much thinking, this will get the job done.
