anthony wong stars in both this and the original (far superior) untold story, but the similarities stop there. wong doesn't reprise his role obviously, and instead plays a bumbling policeman who gets involved with a rather suspicious female, fung (1994's miss singapore, paulyn sun) who's a repressed nut-job, sure. but her tame jealous "wanna be with a guy who's with a girl" killer is no where near as compelling as what wong played in the first one. the movie itself seems tired and by the numbers. yeung fan as the physcho's love interest's unfaithful girl tries to keep one from total boredom by stripping down whenever possible, and sun does have a nice ass, but even that can't save this dud.<br /><br />my grade: d <br /><br />mei ah dvd extras: sub-titled interviews with cheung kam ching & paulyn sun; anthony wong filmography; a very brief synopsis; theatrical trailer for the film; & trailers for "chinese erotic ghost story" and "twenty something"
