i want the 99 minutes of my life back that was wasted on this pathetic excuse for a movie. the acting was horrific! i used to be a fan of cameron diaz and vincent d'onofrio. i will never look at them the same again. keanu reeves and dan aykroyd were not a surprise. everyone knows they never could act. thankfully, only dan attempted an accent. his accent was a disaster as expected. i think he was either confused about the location of the film or had never actually spoken to anyone from minnesota. i hope this review helps anyone who is undecided about what to do with their precious time. the only reason i was able to sit through the whole movie was because i was stuck somewhere without anything better to watch or read.
