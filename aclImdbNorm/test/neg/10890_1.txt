i only comment on really very good films and on utter rubbish. my aim is to help people who want to see great films to spend their time - and money - wisely.<br /><br />i also want to stop people wasting their time on garbage, and want to publicize the fact that the director/producer of these garbage films can't get away with it for very long. we will find out who you are and will vote with out feet - and wallets.<br /><br />this film clearly falls into the garbage category.<br /><br />the director and writer is john shiban. it's always a bad sign when the writer is also the director. maybe he wants two pay cheques. he shouldn't get any. so remember the name - john shiban. and if you see anything else by him, forget it.<br /><br />i won't say anything about the plot - others have already. i am a little worried by how much the director likes to zoom in to the poor girl's face when she is crying and screaming. these long duration shots are a little worrying and may say something about the state of mind of mr. shiban. maybe he should get psychiatric help.<br /><br />enough already. it's crap - don't waste your time on it.
