the movie was actually not that bad, especially plot-wise, but the doughy (and hairy!) actor they chose for the leading role was a little chintzy in the acting department. i would have chosen someone else. the idea of "going to america" was very ingenious, and the main character questioning everything that he'd ever known made him somewhat likable, but not very much so when there's a pasty blob for a leading actor.<br /><br />the storyline was interesting. it brings about the question of how the subject of cloning will be handled in the future. certainly cloning wouldn't be allowed for the purposes in the movie, but it's still a valid argument even for today. clones are still people... right?<br /><br />the movie wasn't particularly special, but it still is a lot better than some of the cheese released during the 70s. let us not forget the "giant spider invasion." i give it a 4, since it didn't totally stink, but the mst3k version makes this movie a 10. (i still like dr. super mario!) you'll like this movie, but it won't be your favorite.
