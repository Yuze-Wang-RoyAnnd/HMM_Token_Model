american tourist on package tour in asia suffering recent bereavement decides to break law by: 1 ignoring curfew; 2 joining revolutionary army; 3 possessing and using illegal firearm...... etc etc what is meant to be a political and educational statement about the so called atrocities of a military dictatorship in asia ends up as a "how to" travel guide for disillusioned americans....especially those who wish to protest that the water in the hotel does not work.... regrettably the authors of this silly yarn have no clue about asia...nor it seems in writing sensible dialogue... example:...our human-rights heroine searching desperately for medicine in the furthest outreaches of the asian jungle miles from anywhere comes across a peasant and asks: "excuse me-does this town have a pharmacy?"...well....those who know something about the asian jungle will appreciate how ludicrous that scenario really is.... mind you i was recently in the thai jungle and an american asked me.... "excuse me....do you know where is macdonalds?" this movie is meant to be a serious drama but ends up as a parody and rip-off of all those "killing fields" type of films designed to confirm tha asian stereotype held by much of western "civilization" and re-inforced by hollywood fantasies such as this..... the basic message of this picture is: "we americans...coming from the worlds only true democracy have a divine right to go to all other nations...and put right their wrongs.....screw-up their environment....and teach them about freedom....." (see for example the beach......at least leo did it with a bit more style)....of course vietnam is another story.... and.....the educated asian may well ask why the yankie gungh-ho attitude about asia should come from a nation whose main contribution to humanity has been helping to spread cancer... aids.. gun carrying kiddies and jerry springer......et al.. at the end of this picture the cynical viewer may well be cheering for the burmese military..... 3 out of 10.<br /><br />
