how can anybody give this anything higher than a '1'?<br /><br />i thought "manos, the hands of fate" would forever be the worst movie ever to impinge itself upon my optic nerve. indeed, i didn't think anything could be worse.<br /><br />i was wrong. "galaxina" is that rare movie where every single element of it is achingly, agonizingly, blindingly bad. how often have you watched a movie and commented, "who the hell lit this thing?" from lighting to soundtrack to effects to script to acting to cinematography to . . . well, everything, this movie is absolutely unendurable. it's so bad, i couldn't even tell for some time if it was the worst comedy or the worst drama i'd ever seen.<br /><br />it's too bad even to be laughable. i'd sooner eat a platefull of broken glass than sit through it again.
