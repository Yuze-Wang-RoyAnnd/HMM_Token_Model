i am ashamed to admit in public that i even held the cover of this movie once! this is an absolute reason why one should research on the movie before seeing it! the 'makers' of this movie have called us all fools and gullible losers with too much time on our hands.<br /><br />based on the mythical indian shape-shifting powerful cobras and rebirth, the story takes us for a painful ride. college going 40+ actors (now really?) are the target of their former friend manisha koirala (who was in her former life a cobra, but is now a ghost!) and her pathetic, eternal, powerful boyfriend cobra/killing machine boyfriend munish kohli (who thankfully hasn't been seen since). now do you need to know more?<br /><br />i vote for studying for the upcoming test in school rather than this movie! give it a pass if you are sane. if not... then you'll probably enjoy it.
