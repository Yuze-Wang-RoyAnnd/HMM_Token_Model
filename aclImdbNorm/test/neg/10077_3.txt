(a possible minor spoiler) the first "jurassic park" was an effective, but silly film that did it's job and was actually pretty good. the sequel "the lost world" had a few decent moments, but those were ruined by the lame end portion of the film which had a t-rex running amok in san diego. now in "jurassic park iii," what little story there was in the first one and the sequel, has been thrown out the window and replaced by a mere 90 minutes of basically non-stop action, which would have worked had the film not been so poorly done.<br /><br />sam neill is back as dr. grant, who is given a proposition by a couple (william h. macy & tea leoni) to come with them to an island to help them find their son, who's been lost for over 2 months. but of course this island just happens to be populated by dinosaurs and of course the plane the are on just happens to crash leaving them stranded with a bunch of dinos after them.<br /><br />this one was obviously intended as a thrill ride, with no real story whatsoever, but even on that level the movie doesn't deliver. director joe johnston ("jumanji") somehow managed to take what little magic was left in the "jurassic" movies and squeeze the life right out of it.<br /><br /> the dinos look okay, though by now they're just standard fair and not very scary. the bottom line is it's not a very good film, even as a thrill ride. * out of 4 stars.
