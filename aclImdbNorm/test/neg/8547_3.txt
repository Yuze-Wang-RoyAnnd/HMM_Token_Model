begrudgingly gave it a 3 - one point each for fonda, stanwyck, and the supporting cast.<br /><br />never saw this one before - am watching it right now and it has just gotten to the part where henry fonda is carrying babs over the threshold. if i continue watching, it will be just to see if fonda and stanwyck will be able to pull this one out of the dumper.<br /><br />but after reading the other viewer comments, i'm not very optimistic.<br /><br />the opening ski scenes were enough to put me off my lunch. the voice-overs were obviously done in a sound studio, and the editing between the exterior shots and the closeups was horrendous. i do not know that much about the technology of that era - but i can't believe there wasn't something they could do to make it more believable.<br /><br />my second gasp of disbelief was when fonda wiped out and (i imagine due to the extreme velocity of travel) he is burrowed head first into the snow up to his torso - stanwyck pulls him out with obvious staged difficulty - and, (i imagine because she is such an experienced doctor) does not react at all to his apparently unconscious state and limp posture.<br /><br />look, i'm completely capable of suspending my disbelief, but i couldn't get over the fact that she had just jostled a man with a possible head injury and that he might be paralyzed for life. not my idea of big yuks.<br /><br />so, as i finish this comment, we have just seen kirk's first jealous outburst, and dr. hunt is off to perform an appendectomy! i'm not sure which i hate more - the script, the background music, or the story!! argghhhh! i'm done. game over. click.
