after just viewing the movie, i must say this is one of the worst films i have ever seen. this takes my worst movie award away from komodo, which is no easy feat. it is neither a porno nor a legitimate film and it gives them both a bad name. the acting, camera-work, plot, script, and sound are all awful. my personal favorite part of the movie is the duck asking the bartender if he has any grapes. why was a joke such as this put in the film? was the director thinking; "i need a humorous scene to balance out the great acting so i will use some lame ass joke i read on a laffy taffy wrapper." another retarded part is when norman spills the invisibility potion on himself as he attempts to keep it from spilling. why did they even bother to give the film a nc-17 rating, were they hoping to get as large of an audience as possible? at least if it were rated x it would be more sexual and therefore taking the viewers focus away from the overall low quality. i pray for someone who worked on this panty waste of a flick to respond.
