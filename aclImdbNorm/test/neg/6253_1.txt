i saw this on the shelves at the rental place and i have rented everything else so i said why not. why not is because it's one of the worst movies i have ever seen. it looks like it was shot with home camcorder. i guess thats all the budget would allow. there was less boobs in it than i thought there would be. some people made it out to be soft porn with a few killings. the funniest part of the whole movie to me is in the extra stuff. there is a spot with deleted scenes. well there is only one but it is the dumbest and i think it may have brought the rest of the movie down. the girls get in a hot tub and find some chocolate syrup in the bathroom. yes it ends up all over them. great stuff !!! this movie is very very bad. don't bother.
