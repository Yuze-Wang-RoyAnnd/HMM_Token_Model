i can't knock this film too terribly, because it's obvious midway through the the watching of it that they were trying to make it bad, or 'campy' if you prefer. anyway, many of the parts they tried to make funny actually are, but often simply for the cheese factor. watch the 'space invaders' game, actually played as real-life! scratch your head at the bumbling robots...oh, the wackyness! and watch the whole thing go way over the top near the end with the 'time warp'! and the sexual innuendoes just keep on flying...i'm actually surprised this got away with a pg. oh well. a fun way to waste a couple hours, but star wars/trek this ain't, folks. 3 out of 10.
