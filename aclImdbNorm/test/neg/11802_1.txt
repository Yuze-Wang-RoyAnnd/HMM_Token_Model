okay they tell you it's real. they don't list any screenwriters or directors, but one viewing of this movie will prove to anyone - it's not real in the way you were hoping for. the speaking rarely sounds like real natural talk...but also down not sound to be scripted. (possibly loosely scripted). to me it sounded much more like they were always trying to ad-lib. (which they almost always did poorly). therefore, they knew they were making a 'movie', not just collecting real natural footage. so i'm sure these people knew what was going on, knew they had certain spots to look for things that were set up...and they were just told to ad-lib around it all.<br /><br />*************'major spoilers'**************** *****************************************<br /><br />okay, it's so lame. every item, spot or thing that could be strange or use d as a scare, is magically stumbled upon by these people. let me list off the ridiculously obviously faked things that happened that i remember:<br /><br />1) less than 2 minutes of entering the house, they turn a light switch on - the light sparks and a chandelier almost falls on a guy.<br /><br />2) they happen to find an old medical bag with a bloody butcher knife* in it, while exploring the cellar.<br /><br />3) they hear a noise in an armoire, so they open the door slowly - bam - a cat happens to be in there and jumps straight at the camera while shrieking.<br /><br />4) then they happen to notice there is a hole in the wall, so let's stick our hand in...wow, they pulled out a doll of a baby wrapped in mummy tape.<br /><br />5) let's go to the attic, uh-oh it feels 'heavy' up here....boom - a chair flies across the room.<br /><br />6) time to eat. oh no ! the girl that was scared of bugs had a roach in her sandwich ! lol !....ridiculous.<br /><br />7) let's get out the ouija board...oops one of the legs on the planchette fell off the side of the board. that couldn't be because the people were pushing it could it ? (they find out a ghost there is named charles)<br /><br />8) wait ! what was that noise in the chimney...clink - oh my shackles fell out "i think she* kept people up here".<br /><br />9) now wimpy girl is going to brave looking up the chimney shaft...oh, what's this she sees something...and is asking people who aren't looking up the chimney what it is. swish - it falls off straight at her. (perfect camera shot) she moves just in time. it was more chain.<br /><br />10) now we have to separate and each 'cleanse' our designated rooms - wouldn't it be something if things started happening one by one to these people now...okay:<br /><br />chick #1: wow, suddenly her room is shaking...but no one elses does.<br /><br />dude #1: actually says to himself "charles, is that you charles...it can't be you because you're just a figment of my imagination aren't you charles". well guess what, he gets knocked over and dragged across the floor. another lucky camera shot.<br /><br />chick #2: hears things..try to communicate ...and is standing there getting abrasions or something.<br /><br />dude #2: he was in the attic, reached his arm through a hole in the floor and got a splinter....i don't remember what else.<br /><br />11) dude #2 runs, gets chick #2...they hear chick and dude #1 screaming...they find them chained to a wall and strapped to a table.(*) they leave. cut to black. final text tell us they escaped safely, were treated for minor cuts. they have since had nightmares and insomnia, we also find out the next day a 911 call was made by they name a someone named "charles".<br /><br />*************'major spoilers'**************** ******************over********************<br /><br />okay, when i first heard this movie was being made, i couldn't wait. i thought it was going to be real. real, real. - and more professional, with more professional type people. i love the idea of this type of thing, i'd love to see real haunting footage. before this movie was released i saw couple reviews of it by people online. they both claimed how fake it was and how stupid the people were.. time passed i forgot about the film....then i realized it was never released at theaters. so i found out it went straight to video, rented it....found that every brutal review was completely true. it's too bad, i really wanted this to be good.<br /><br />random thought: the house didn't seem to have tvs, radios..kitchen appliances that i recall...which would make me think no one has lived there for a long time. especially the house is truly known for being haunted...im pretty sure no one lives there. but it looks so clean and tidy...and what was a cat doing there ? the property does not have near by neighbors....<br /><br />all-in-all, you'll only want to rent this if you and your friends wanna sit there and make fun of it...or if you heard about it a long time ago and it intrigued you. (you will will be disappointed if you are expecting a good film...or real film)<br /><br />random thought: i believe the producer says "the 'footage' you see is real". well technically it is real footage isn't it ? real footage of fake hauntings ? maybe that was his loop hole.<br /><br />i give this this movie one star - strictly on the fact that they told the story of madame lalaurie. a real new orleans story.<br /><br />the best performance was by the guy who teaches the participants about the ghost hunting equipment in the beginning. he was obviously actually real...or a good actor.<br /><br />
