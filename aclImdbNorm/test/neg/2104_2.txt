oh. good. grief.<br /><br />i saw this movie title in the tv schedules and thought "i must watch this movie, ripping off snakes on a plane, it will be terrible but hopefully laughable too. sounds fantastically bad". well, i was half right.<br /><br />this movie is eye-meltingly bad and, sadly, not even unintentionally hilarious. it's just bad. even worse, it takes almost an hour to get to anything resembling action. for the first half of the movie we have to endure some mumbled foreign language (mexican or spanish, apologies for my ignorance) and terrible acting as some woman vomits up live snakes for reasons we only find out later on. then we have to endure even more terrible acting, and we find out that those mumbling in the foreign language could speak english anyway, as the snakes finally get loose on the train and things move from the sedate to the ridiculous.<br /><br />low-budget does not always mean "bad" but, in this case, it does. what we have here is a movie given no thought, a terrible script, a bad cast and not even the sense to capitalise on it's very few strengths. i give two marks for a few decent special effects and a whacky ending but that still feels a bit too generous. avoid if you can.<br /><br />see this if you like: stagknight, the wicker man remake, terrible cgi.
