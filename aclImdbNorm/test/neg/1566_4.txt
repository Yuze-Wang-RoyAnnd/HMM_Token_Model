george and mildred was a spin off from the mid 1970s sit-com man about the house . though i haven't seen the series since it was last broadcast i do remember it being fairly amusing with most of the comedy arising from the eponymous couple going to live beside the snobbish fourmile family , a sort of love thy neighbour without the cynical racist gags .<br /><br />having seen this " big screen version of the show " i find myself asking what it's a big screen version of ? certainly not of a popular mid 70s sit com of the same name . for some reason the movie jettisons all character interaction from the television by having george and mildred leaving the street where they live behind and getting caught up in a plot involving some serious gangsters who want something george has inadvertently picked up and which leads to some cringe making situations and lines like: <br /><br />" did he give it to you " <br /><br />" no that's the first time a man has resisted my charms " <br /><br />" i meant the envelope " <br /><br />you do get the impression that screenwriter dick sharples ( who never wrote an episode for the original sit-com ) has never seen an episode of the source material and has got the show confused with the carry on series of films . in many ways it resembles the same mistakes of the latter lost in space movie in that it has absolutely nothing in common with the series that spawned it
