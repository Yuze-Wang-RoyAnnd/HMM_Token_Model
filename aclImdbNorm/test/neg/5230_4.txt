star rating: ***** the works **** just misses the mark *** that little bit in between ** lagging behind * the pits <br /><br />based on another of stephen king's lengthy novellas, this takes place in the sleepy little new england town of castle rock (also the name of the film's production company!), where a new antiques store, the titular needful things, has opened. the owner and proprietor, leland gaunt (max von sydow) hides, you might say, a devilish secret. there's an item in his store that everyone in the little town wants-a small cash price upfront is first required, before a far more sinister price is asked for. as suspicion, hate and madness tear the town apart, it falls to police chief alan pangborn (ed harris) to restore order and save the town from a terrifying end...<br /><br />i read the novel of needful things earlier this year, and was eager to watch the movie adaptation again to compare them (like that was going to be any contest!) but it had been deleted on video and dvd and i couldn't find anywhere to rent it from. so i was happy when i finally found it in a flea market whilst on a shopping trip...<br /><br />it's one of the cruelest ironies that king novels are generally the best to read but when they get adapted to screen nine times out of ten they are complete junk, as is the case here. the material that makes his books great simply doesn't translate into a movie script very well, for some reason. and i suppose there's always the question: why bother watching this when i could be reading the book again instead? <br /><br />i appreciate that some are simply too lengthy (i.e. it, the stand) to be made into a complete screen work with all the situations and characters included, but there's no reason this one couldn't have included all the material from the book. as a result, a lot of key characters from the book (i.e. ace merrill) are not included at all and we have some terrible character development that means we don't care about the characters that are involved since they are so stripped of depth and motivation- for example we have one character from the book, danforth keaton, who murders his wife toward the end yet we were shown no build-up to hint at any reason that he didn't get along with or hated her and so it has no impact when it happens, unlike in the book where there was a lot of depth invested and it really involved you to find out what happened to the characters involved. all the material in the script to fill in the cracks, if you like, is really stupid and corny and the typically goofy stuff that gets included in king adaptations like this.<br /><br />most of the film's problems are that it deviates so far away from the book but there's also some terrible acting from a cast that obviously can't feel for the daft material they're being asked to perform. in the 90s, a lot of king's work started skipping the cinema and just being made into made-for-tv/video territory. rubbish like this must surely hint at why. **
