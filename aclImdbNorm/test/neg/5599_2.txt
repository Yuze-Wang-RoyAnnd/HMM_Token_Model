ok if you are looking for a fun lesbian romp. this is not the movie if you are looking for a fun movie with hot sociopathic characters (in the vane of 'cruel intentions' or 'wild things') this is not the movie if you are looking for a classic vampire lesbian seductress's movie. this is not the movie.<br /><br />however if you are looking to wast an hour of your life, this is your movie. it is badly written, badly directed,badly scored, badly filmed.it had bad special effects...i mean really bad special effects. i think that you can actually generate the same special effects in imovie lol.<br /><br />it really is a pretty bad movie.<br /><br />the actors were classic starlet beauties however look more like porn stars. it is shot like a soft core porn however you never get the money shot and the actors all look bored out of their brains. the 'girl on girl' scenes, which suck btw, were so lame that there hardly worth mentioning. go watch the 'almost sex scenes' on youtube cos that's the only reason you would want to watch this movie and even there not worth it.<br /><br />a wast of money and time!!! don't even pick it up, go watch 'cruel intentions 2' instead - same movie without the bad special effects, bad storyline,bad writing,bad dialog and bad acting. actually i might go watch it now just to purge my mind
