this movie was, of the 67 of 71 best pictures i have seen, by far the worst. first of all, i found the plot line somewhat absurd - the absent husband for 25 years/ still in love/ not even a letter! give me a break. and why was the guy who was absent for so long coincidentally working on an oil rig next door to the congress-woman's party? this film also exhibited some of the worst stereotyping of african-americans that i have ever seen. it makes gone with the wind (see prissy) look downright progressive! i have scarcely seen a movie that i disliked this much. ugh!
