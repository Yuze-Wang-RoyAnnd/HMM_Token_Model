this movie is an example of small budget,ineffective star cast,weak storyline and poor entertainment. this kind of movies are made for commercial breaks and not for any entertainment of die-hard fans of bollywood movies. i went to this movie because i thought the earlier one gangster was tolerable so this is also. only thing i appreciate the way new actress put herself in the movie in a very bold way, she very much resembles bollywood actress nandita das. she is good ,sexy and acting well. she definitely go up in her career. our mithunda was all time good at his work .atleast he has some good to the movie. i didn't like imraan for his role must advise him to improve himself now as he has done many movies as new actor and he has been seen as established actor this movie has nothing except the bold scene done by new actress never try this movie
