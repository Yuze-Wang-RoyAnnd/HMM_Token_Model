hercules: the tv- movie hercules - a very twisted and molted version of the story about the greek superhero. paul telfer makes a good attempt to play this hero. sean astin rehashes his sam gamgee image by playing lupin, a thrown in character to make the whole thing a buddy-movie picture. i almost expected his to say at one point "we're in a bad situation mr. frodo, uh i mean hercules. an unexpected good performance comes from timothy dalton (one of the lesser james bonds) as hercules's father. herucles's love interest looks like paris hilton, something which just turned me off right away. unfourtunetly someone has twisted and molted the original story into somewhat of a murky and sometimes incomprehensible story. the special effects don't help either. while the hydra scene does the original story justice, the nemean lion and harpies are just....well lame. i believe the creatures and effects from power rangers flashed across my mind at least twice. and the golden hind felt rushed and very computer generated. and they took out cerberus! one of my favorite parts of what was originally a very cool story. the movie can't decide whether it's greek, roman, or american. and it almost ruined the original story; a classic epic. don't bother looking for this one on the direct to dvd. - c
