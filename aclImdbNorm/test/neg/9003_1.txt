take it from me as a camera man who worked for republic studios from 1946 to 1950 and then warners bros and paramount from 1950 to 1993, this is a piece of crap. sure it would be great to show it to your favorite friends at a house party but to try to sell this on a dvd is absolutely ridicious.<br /><br />i have seen bad acting in my day but this is no acting. the hero is almost laughable and he really thinks he is something judging from his comments on the specials. i hate to see his fan club. the old films did not jive with the action in many of the scenes. what the hell was that garden scene with three of worst actresses. i never seen a garden on a ship. they could not even emote. i would not mind it if they could have once ounce of acting but the only one was the guy with the translvanian accent. i am sorry but this is not a clever film as some persons are stating. i would think horror film buffs would be insulted by this piece of film.
