anyone who will pay to see troma movies knows, and appreciates, what they are going to get. having said that, i didn't think it was possible to make a movie this bad, and still be compelling. i found myself watching just to see how much worse it could get before the end. first off, it's an indonesian action movie with an american main character who looks and acts like the bastard son of "taxi"'s christopher lloyd and rambo. he puts posters of himself dressed up like sly's "cobra" all over the place and even has a custom built firing range (with action-posed cutouts of his greatest enemies)in jakarta although he's in the cia and has just arrived days earlier. there is a lot of action involving gun-play(no muzzle-flashes on those m-16s, only sound effects), motorcycles(that bust through walls), karate(where no one makes physical contact) and even some sex(where all the actors are ugly). the main plot of an epic like this should at least be reasonably plausible, but not here. it involves the world's most dangerous drug cartel going all out to find a "drug detector device". why would they need it? that is never revealed, why not kill drug-sniffing dogs? makes no sense, but, it is taken seriously. the actors are to be commended because they really seemed to think this movie would make them all famous and tried hard to "act". best line? "now dance to your grave you dirty whore!" best scene? rambo jumps onto flying helicopter, pulls machine gun out of baddie's hand, let's go, falls, shoots helicopter as he's falling, helicopter blows up, cut to mannequin thrown in water. f**king genius! if you can't appreciate trash, don't watch it. if you can, it's awesome. one last thing, did i mention it was directed by the three punjabi brothers?
