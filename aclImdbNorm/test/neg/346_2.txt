i think that you can not imagine how these people really work...!! before i came to the studios to watch the guys work there, i actually thought quite the same as you do. but since i saw and did the work the guys on that tv-show have to do, i have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long. that really is no easy work. and also the actors, which in your eyes may be terribly bad, are really great people and a lot of them really can act! i don't think that the material given to them can really show that, as i think this material isn't very good. but they are truly good! so i don't think that you, before you haven't seen these guys doing there work, can judge over them! and i shouldn't have judged over them as well before i met them, but i did and am now terribly ashamed of it. so please, do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you haven't seen them doing there job.
