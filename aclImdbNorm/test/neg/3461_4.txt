this is defiantly a dvd rental movie. i'm a big fan of the cast members but the storyline never really grabbed me. don't expect "oh brother where art thou" in any way shape or form. funniest part in my opinion is when the war hero explains what happens over in the argon. seems like they were trying to copy some of clooney's funny facial expressions from "oh brother where art thou" but you could kind of tell they were trying for that. john krasinski was the bright spot and was solid throughout. renee zellweger plays the part of a zealous reporter willing to do whatever for the story. overall it's a movie worth watching at home.
