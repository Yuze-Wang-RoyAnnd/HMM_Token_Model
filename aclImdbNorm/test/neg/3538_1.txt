the only reason i saw this movie was because it had giovanni ribisi and it was supposed to be "horror". don't be fooled, this movie has to be the worst "horror" film i have seen. it's about these people who go to a secret location which has a "monster" in it. the monster is a man with a deformed face running around in blue sweat pants who has a craving for brains. some people die, some people don't. in the end they throw the monster off of a plane and then fly away happily. but oh no! the monster is still alive after falling out of a plane! go spend 2 hours some other way like watching paint dry on a wall, trust me, it's more entertaining than this crap.
