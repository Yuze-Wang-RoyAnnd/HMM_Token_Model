this is a parody. that means, there are no characters as such, they are all plain stereotypes, and the movie relies completely on the quality of the jokes.<br /><br />well, there are quite some good jokes in this movie. unfortunately, they are hidden in a mass of real stupid ones. if one expects all dialogues to be absurd, the fun wears off.<br /><br />you see, there is american pie 2, my all time favorite teenager movie. it contains a lot of real original characters. maybe the jokes are tasteless, but all the people have some kind of live. for example, they feel embarrassed if something embarrassing happens. that is what makes the jokes themselves actually funny !<br /><br />not so this movie: every scene is clearly arranged as a pure parody, so there are no characters at all, therefore there is really no room for any sympathy. too, if you know the original movies, you know whole scenes in advance. add the fact that many jokes are not funny at all, and you have this movie.<br /><br />the only thing that saved me from getting completely bored where in fact the comments from some teenagers in the cinema where i was watching the film.<br /><br />ah, and my personal highlight of the movie was the very short appearance of melissa joan hart in one scene. sigh. she is just too cool, she can't be real. hmm, worth a whole movie ?
