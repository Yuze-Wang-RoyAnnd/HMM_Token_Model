this is quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen. i would think you could get that from the title. also, there is a particular love scene that could be the strangest in the history of film. i can't even remember why i saw this film or when. only that is an absolutely horrible movie-viewing experience. on the other hand, if you are looking for the absolute weirdest movie to waste two hours of your time, then by all means rent it. good luck finding it at your local store though. i doubt this movie is in a very wide-distribution. and please do not show this to children by any means as it may warp their impressionable minds forever.
