i watch family affairs,coronation st &east enders on uktv every week night family affairs is by far the worst, bad plots, bad sequences and the worst acting of any soapie,even worse than the americans and that is saying something.<br /><br />i find it very frustrating that all these shows on uktv australia" are so far behind the uk and when one trys to find out the reason for this they just fob you off with some story that they will show double episodes to catch up ,needless to say, this never happens. i am very happy that family affairs is going , to make space for something of better quality, but at the same time i would to know the background reasons, did they finally realize how bad it was? did people stop watching it? whatever it was you musn't leave us in suspense why do you feel that you have to keep everything a secret from your fans? or is it that you just don't care? i feel strongly that you should try and keep your public up to date. family affairs is notorious for just having its characters disappear and reappear for seemingly no reason,we do get involved in the people and enjoy following their lives.\<br /><br />i can understand why family affairs would have to come to an end, even though we are so far behind here in australia, it is easy to see that the writers are running out of ideas for new plots,so many plots are being repeated and old episodes coming back.i have also noticed that as new characters are being introduced, a lot of them are really bad actors, like you are scraping the bottom of the barrel and ending up with the drek regards vince
