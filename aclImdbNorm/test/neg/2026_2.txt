the beginning voice over sounds like 'the wind' could be quite an intriguing movie, but as the story unfolded i knew it was downhill from there. the major things about this movie that blew were the terribly bad acting jobs all the main characters did, (except for a few scenes involving the inner turmoil of mic), there was a total lack of character development and absolutely no point to the plot - what were the writers thinking?<br /><br />michael mongillo won 2 'horror/sci fi' awards for 'the wind'. huh? what was so scary about this movie? nothing! except for the resident evil 2 video shots, the rest was more of a 'made for t.v thriller' - it wouldn't even have to be edited. if you want a far better movie about 'murder among friends' rent "shallow grave" instead.<br /><br />'the wind' */*****
