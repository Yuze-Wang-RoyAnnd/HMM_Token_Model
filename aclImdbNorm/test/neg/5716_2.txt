you know that this film is in serious trouble when the best acting job is the support role played by arnold schwarzenegger. while this was still relatively early in his career and he wasn't the best actor, compared to brigitte nielsen, he's sir john gielgud. in fact, this film proves that the only reason she got much of any attention were her boobs and because she was involved with the incredibly self-destructive football player, mark gastineau. so, instead of this being her "break out film", this and a beverly hills cop movie mark about as high as she went in her one-note career. it was obvious, too, that the financing wizards gave up on this movie as well, because the supporting cast (aside from arnold) is pretty lame and the script is dull, dull, dull. fans looking for another conan movie would no doubt be very disappointed in this slow and uninvolving film.
