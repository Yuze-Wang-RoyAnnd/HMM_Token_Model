i disagree in calling this a stoner movie just because weed also makes an appearance. i can't imagine this as even approaching "stoner classic." that would be like calling singles a "grunge film." the movie definitely plods along with a murky plot. at times i wondered if the script had either been dropped and shuffled or if they lost it entirely and just tried to wing it. watching this movie reminded me of watching children play-acting and making the story up as they go along.<br /><br />the characters are wooden, the dialog is taxed, and the whole story seems to be completely disconnected. who got killed? when? what? and this is how you act when your friend overdoses? complete lack of emotion and utter disconnect from reality.<br /><br />as for the droning guitar soundtrack that accompanies each scene: enough! it was like watching the opening menu screen where the same track loops endlessly in the background, neither moving forward or back.<br /><br />i kept watching and hoping that the plot would somehow fall in to order, the acting and dialog would improve or something, somehow would focus this mess in to a coherent movie. after 112 minutes, it never happened.
