omg what has disney done lately..most of their new shows really suck. suite life of zach and cody are pretty good but other shows like cory in the house, wizards of waverly place suck and are unwatchable.<br /><br />naturally sadie is just beyond stupid and dumb. its about a teenager named sadie who likes science and grows up and goes through her everyday life. there are her friends margaret and rain and her older annoying brother hal. there all annoying and stupid. especially margaret who thinks she's the most popular girl in school and thinks she's soo pretty...its just beyond awful. i hate all the seasons of this show, its just terrible in every way (the first season was better though).<br /><br />if you value your life, you wouldn't watch this crap, its painful and stupid
