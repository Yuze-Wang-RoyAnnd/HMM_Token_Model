this film was basically set up for failure by the studio. one, anne rice (author of the book) offered to write the screen play but was refused by the studio. two, they tried to stuff 2 in depth novels in to a 2hour movie.<br /><br />i maintain the only way for these two books -vampire lestat and queen of the damned- to work in a live action form would be through a mini-series. first off the the vampire lestat alone takes place from the 1700's to the 1980's and has a plethora of character vital to the plot understanding of the main character, lestat. the entire book vampire lestat sets up the events of the second part queen of the damned. without that full understanding the premise of a movie is destroyed.<br /><br />lestat was not cruel and vicious to all, he was not wanting to go along with akasha's plans, marius did not make lestat, lestat did not love jesse or make her, lestat could not go remain unscathed by the light, marius was not after david nor the other way around, every character was completely represented wrong, basically same names different story.<br /><br />if they wanted to make a vampire movie, fine. even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels, fine. but don't piggie back into the theaters off the success of rice's great novels and characters just to destroy what her loyal readers have come to love.<br /><br />if you haven't read the books you won't understand the film really, if you have read the books you will be insulted. that being said, i am such a huge fan i had to see the movie knowing full well this was going to be the case and still went for it. catch 22, must see it, will hate it.
