what on earth was that? my family and i just waisted 2 hours of our life for this piece of rubbish !!! there was no plot, no tension, only a lot of boredom !!! my kids could do better movies with our video-camera.<br /><br />but maybe we just did not get the point of the movie...oh wait, my mum did. she was the only one who liked it for the following reason: "at least a film with no cars screeching..." if you are looking for a war-film with no fighting in it, is still interesting and gripping and has a strong anti-war-message, then you should watch "the trench".<br /><br />i give this film 3 out of 10 because it is good enough for an afternoon-nap and because i am too nice...
