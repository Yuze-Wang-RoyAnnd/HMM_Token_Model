this one is a poor attempt at spinning the old "cons turn good" yarn, which we have seen so many times before. it actually reminded me of the american series 'the players', although nowhere near as good. omar epps is totally unconvincing as the hard man of the bunch, as is ribisi, who's attempt at being the funny guy gets lost along the way. danes performance was decent though, and you can see from this performance, why she was cast in terminator 4.<br /><br />the mod squad is a film which lies in a kind of grey area between serious thriller and comedy. at times it takes itself serious but other times it tries to be humorous but fails miserably. the film has a kind of half-finished feel about - as if it was stretched to the 90 minute mark.<br /><br />you'l be disappointed.
