the only good thing about this movie is, that i now have a movie on the worst ever list. rest stop being on the end of the spectrum where i can compare all terrible movies to. really, this movie is the worst plot, worst directed, throughout the whole movie all i wanted to do is pull out my hair and kick the writer's and anybody who made this movie possible's ass. i am a deployed soldier, and when i spend my precious downtime watching movies like this. these people should feel terrible, they had to of watch this before it came out, and must have been to freaking lazy to redo , after they noticed it freaking sucked. i am so amazed that this great country of ours is letting them make another. honestly, this is the first time i have ever commented on a movie, i had to let the world know, not to waste their time. delete this movie from the face of this planet. it makes us humans look retarded.
