wow -- this movie was really bad! you talk about formulaic, typical movie plot? watching this movie was like hitting my head repeatedly against a brick wall. the transitions kept trying to be cool but failed. the plot twist at the end, where we find out who the bad guy is was unexpected, but doesn't make much sense until his monologue. even then... the amount of gore in this movie doesn't help either. are all of those images necessary? my last complaint is about the plausibility of chunks of the movie. would the pd really send a lone officer into an unlit warehouse, subway tunnel, or wherever to find a body, when the location of the perp is unknown? and why does the romance at the end just kind of happen all of a sudden? it's like the writer was trying to fit in every hollywood cliche he could. don't waste your time seeing this piece of... something.
