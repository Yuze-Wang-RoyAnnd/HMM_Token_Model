this movie is beyond horrible avoid at all costs!! i want my hour and 20 minutes back!!!<br /><br />not funny at all, you can watch this movie without laughing or even smiling once. swears spill out of the speakers like a waterfall, each one getting more annoying as the last, and not contributing to the comedy or plot (general comedy - not this movie in general!).<br /><br />all in all, its a lame-a$5, watered-down -typed- "out cold"ish movie - but tremendously awful. the movie focuses around two groups of a city poories and richies (how obviously dumb is that?), where the two opposites have snowboard battles with each other. (story is much like a 4-year-old's bed time story without all the swears and stupid jokes)<br /><br />movie - 1/10 - because you can't give any lower scores
