other than it reassembled the characters from the first film and gave them more backstory. essentially, lucian the lycan (werewolf) fell in love with sonia the vampire, a romeo and juliet scenario you know is going to end badly if you've seen the first movie. so with absolutely no suspense, we blunder forward with two hours of unremitting cgi and actors with little or no screen presence. all shot in that monotone color that the first movie had because nothing was shot in daylight.<br /><br />worth your time.. probably not. in fact, the quality has gone down, even the cgi looks like it was done on the cheap, you don't buy for a minute that these are real werewolves.
