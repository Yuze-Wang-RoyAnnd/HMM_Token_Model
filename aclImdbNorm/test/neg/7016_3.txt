who the heck had the "bright"(?) idea of casting lucille ball in this film??? it should have been angela lansbury's baby all the way. at the very least lucy should have had her singing dubbed. <br /><br />there is some compensation in the fact that jerry herman's score is pretty well kept intact except for "that's how young i feel", and we do get performances by the original broadway cast members jane connell and bea arthur. <br /><br />i suppose robert preston had to be given a song, hence the inferior "loving you". <br /><br />overall, i think in this one the wrong redhead was cast.
