naked deanna troi! <br /><br />richie's brother chuck (from "happy days") with a reverse mohawk!<br /><br />death wish 3 has all this and more, including one clever scene where chuck bronson's character sets up a mousetrap like device that brains a punk when he opens the window.<br /><br />chuck also places a board with a bunch of nails on the floor near another window and smiles when he returns and sees bloody footprints leading away.<br /><br />all i can say about death wish 3 is that it is one of most incomprehensible "serious" movies that i have ever seen--loaded to the hilt with mayhem, and nearly zero police response, despite the use of military weapons to mow punks down by the score.<br /><br />as i understand it, bronson disowned this film, but happily cashed the check from golan globus.<br /><br />if you enjoy quality movies, avoid this one, but if you're in for a cheap "jackass" kind of thrill, check it out.
