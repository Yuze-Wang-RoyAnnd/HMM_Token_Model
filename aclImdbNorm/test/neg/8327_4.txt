danny lee's performance as a wisecracking cop is the only spot of interest in this film, even though it has an excellent cast including chow yun-fat, carina lau, andy lau, shing fui-on and alex man. cyf plays a triad boss who wants to settle down to a life of peace and plenty but alex man, a total psycho who has a big grudge against cyf, won't let him. cyf tries to escape to malacca but to no avail. after his family is blown to bits, his cronies dead or turncoat, wounded and broke, cyf returns to hong kong to get into some serious revenge.<br /><br />it sounds a lot better than it is. cyf is well-dressed and handsome, looks pained, grimaces and cries on cue, but somehow or another you just don't care. andy lau looks great, but that's about it. carina lau has a tiny, tiny little part which was nice, but she gets a bullet in the head early on so that ends that. alex man is a cartoon villain he's so over-the-top which at times can be intriguing but the writing here is so flat that he just comes across as a garden-variety nut.<br /><br />danny lee is great though - too bad he's only a small blip on the screen of this dark (literally) and essentially boring movie.<br /><br />rent it, don't buy it. or just skip it altogether.<br /><br />this is the sequel to "rich and famous", even though it apparently was filmed simultaneously; it was released first because of cyf's boxoffice power.
