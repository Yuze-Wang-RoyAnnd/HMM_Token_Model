andrew gurland's "cheats" is his fictionalized "true story" about four high school friends who maneuver to cheat on tests. the quartet are: supercilious school-hating trevor fehrman (as handsome davis), his likewise good-looking pal matthew lawrence (as victor), their chubby school-hating chum elden henson (as sammy), and crooked geekster martin starr (as applebee). the adults include high-strung north point principal mary tyler moore (as mrs. stark) and pornography-loving father griffin dunne (as mr. davis). the high jinks begin with mr. fehrman and mr. lawrence supposedly urinating on a teacher's grade book. put this one at the bottom of the pile; and, be thankful it doesn't go on anyone's permanent record.<br /><br />*** cheats (2002) andrew gurland ~ trevor fehrman, matthew lawrence, elden henson
