i wish i had read the comments on imdb before i saw this movie. the first 1 hour was ok, though it did make me wonder why everything was centered at chicago and why no one reported any weather anomaly from outside us. isolated acts of nature (of this magnitude) are unthinkable. but beyond the first 60 minutes, the movie just drags on like a never-ending story. the screenplay is horrible. as for the actors, very poor choice. only the people hired to run in panic stick to their roles. but i do have to agree that this movie has got some good 'special effects'. if you rented it on a dvd and would want to watch the movie, despite the reviews, then play it on maximum speed your player would allow!
