the st. francisville experiment claims "this ain't no walk in the woods", a direct slap in the face of blair witch. where blair witch proved to be a film that overworked the viewer's imagination through simple suggestion, the st. francisville experiement overworks the viewer's patience. one must say, however, that this is destined to be a camp classic.<br /><br />warning: spoiler is forthcoming!!<br /><br />i viewed this movie in a local theater in which the movie's "paranormal consultant" troy taylor spoke about the making of the movie. should anyone want to see this movie without knowing the forthcoming information, stop reading here. for those of you who can't resist, read on my friends and all shall be told.<br /><br />mr. taylor, a writer of rather unintriguing ghost stories which he claims are all true, informed the audience at this video screening that the st. francisville experiment was not a documentary. shock! amazing! as if we didn't know... he informed us that all of the frightening discoveries the participants made were all staged and prearranged by the film's producers. matter of fact, he informed us that the last 15 minutes were not even filmed in louisiana, but rather in california. all four participants were true actors (notice i didn't say good...). one of the participants is actually a special effects technician on er.<br /><br />what infuriates me about this film is that it proclaims everything is true. it feebly attempts to outdo the blair witch project by claiming it's true whereas blair witch was a hoax. the amazing thing is that no one could have belief this film for an instant. filled with dreadful acting and hilarious lines such as "surround yourself with the white light" and "i love the ghosts", the st. francisville experiment belongs at midnight movies everywhere so the crowd can properly heckle, boo, jeer and chant "i love the ghosts!"<br /><br />talk about false advertising. true stories are not filmed with staged special effects that look as if the neighborhood boy scouts troop set up a haunted house. from the bug in the sandwich (ooh...scary...) to the annoying madison, from the "seance" which is nothing more than the foursome playing on an oujia board to the two mice being found under a bed, the st. francisville experiement is one embarrassing hoax of a movie. lion's gate would be wise to dump this thing into the nearest trash compactor or advertise it as it really should be:<br /><br />"the st. francisville experiment: a comedic look at how not to make a movie".
