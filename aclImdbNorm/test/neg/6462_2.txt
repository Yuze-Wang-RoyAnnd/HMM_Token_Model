i am a huge fan of northern exposure. men in trees is a complete knock-off of northern exposure. there's the city-folk from new york stuck in a remote backwoods town (marin frist / joel fleishman). she immediately doesn't hit it off with a local (jack slattery / maggie o'connell). the town only has one pilot who is not often available. ther is only one radio show. and the entire show is about quirky people with sincere and odd relationships. too many parallels. just like northern exposure except one obvious demographic has been altered in each character. i'm bored. give me something new to think about.<br /><br />on the upside, the writing is pretty good. but if this was a school project, it would certainly have earned the stamp of plagiarism. <br /><br />perhaps people who love this show were sheltered from the dedicated creativity and hard labors of joshua brand and john falsey.
