crash is supposed to be a film about racism in los angeles. but in fact, it's just a bunch of coincidences between several characters that connect each other during one day in one of the biggest cities of the world. who the hell is going to believe that? there are unrealistic situations, one after the other. on the other hand, this film pretends to show racism between asians, iranians, latinos, blacks, and whites. but the big error relies on a pre-establish racism coming from the writer. mainly because the white characters in this movie are usually portrait as people with a better social-economical status than the rest of the other races. iranians are poor, just like the asians. and latinos, as always, are portrait as housekeepers, police officers, or with a very low profile job like a locksmith. jesus!!! don't you guys think it's about time to change these stereotypes? same with blacks, portrait as gang members, with the exception of a black tv director, who was the only fresh character for me. this movie sucks so hard, that makes me so disappointed about the kind of cinema coming out from hollywood these days. always with stereotype characters. no realism whatsoever. nothing to identify with. it's simply a big waste because this could have been a great opportunity to show latinos, koreans, iranians, and blacks, from a different perspective.
