a colleague from work told me to watch this movie, since he considered this movie to be one of the best movies ever. so i did watch it. first i have to admit that i dislike mainstream movies and prefer to watch movies with a real meaning.<br /><br />and this is the point, why i dislike this movie. it doesn't have any meaning. it's just a combination of funny, stupid, boring, entertaining, absurd and thrilling pieces.<br /><br />at first i thought that this movie could be a real mystery thriller (as the german packaging read), but the movie was too mysterious for me.<br /><br />david lynch may be able to make a combination of the most different images, but the composition tastes to me as awfull as a combination of milk with beer. both for themselves are pretty good, but together?
