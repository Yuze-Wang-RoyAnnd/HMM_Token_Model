i was just watching a forensic files marathon on court tv. the episode was identical to the plot of this movie, right down to the incest secret and the affair-with-the-sister subplot. i don't recall any based on a true story disclaimer, but the case does have mow written all over it. apparently it chronicles the real homicide of ruby morris by her husband earl, sentenced to 25 years to life for her murder. just goes to show you, truth can be stranger than fiction, because i thought the lifetime plot was contrived and a more than "a stretch" insofar as believability goes. i'm with the other posters who said the acting was bad. i didn't notice it with all of the players, though. it was really the lead character, the daughter, whose performance was bad.
