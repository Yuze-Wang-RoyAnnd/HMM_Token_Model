this really is the worst movie i have ever seen. for a while, i made a habit of watching lousy movies, including "battlefield earth", "delta force commando" and "starship". all of these movies are cinematic gems compared to ironheart.<br /><br />there isn't much point in summarizing this piece of junk; i think it's more beneficial to summarize my reaction to the movie, which is as follows: i become furiously angry and i want to rip the tape out of the vcr and burn it after (roughly) 80 minutes of play.<br /><br />i rate this movie a 0, but imdb does not let one rate a movie less than 1. i give it a 0 knowing full well that i am saying any movie that has any score above 0 is infinitely (undefinably) many times better than this one - that's really how bad it is.
