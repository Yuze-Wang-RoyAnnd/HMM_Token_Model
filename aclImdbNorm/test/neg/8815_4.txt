i really tried to like "saw." the story was good, and i admire the breakneck pace of the way the film was shot. however, there were too many clich'es and elements that while they may have looked "cool," they really made no sense.<br /><br />first, what i liked about the film was the overall tone of the story, and i thought the premise was fantastic. the character of the jigsaw killer was intriguing and reminded me of vintage dario argento. danny glover was excellent in his role as an obsessed detective, and monica potter was good in a thankless role as a doctor's abducted wife. shawnee smith's scene was incredible and both wan and whannell should be commended for using that scene as a demo to get the backing for the film. the whole notion that the jigsaw killer finds a way for his victims to kill themselves is an excellent notion, but once the film got going, logic began to get away.<br /><br />once they showed that zap was the one holding dr. gordon's wife and daughter hostage, it was apparent that he was not the jigsaw killer, and part of it. the scene where he puts a stethoscope over the heart of the terrified diana while allison screams at him through her gag was one of the most gratuitous scenes i've ever seen. it was supposed to be chilling, but establishing nothing. also, since the jigsaw killer finds a way for victims to kill themselves, he has no problem slicing the throat of a police officer. i guess it's a way to show that he doesn't want to get caught and will go to any means necessary to ensure that doesn't happen, but to me it just didn't make any logic, especially when he shows no remorse over the death of another detective (which i did like that setup, just would've been better if given to someone who actually deserved it).<br /><br />i felt leigh whannell was fine as adam. it wasn't really a showy role and he has a lot of potential as a character actor. however, i wasn't too fond of james wan's direction. the story may have been original, but the direction sure wasn't. i guess i'm tired of quick, mtv style cuts in favor of the old approach to directing, but a lot of scenes involving the jigsaw killer reminded me too much of "se7en," way too much of it. as the film progressed, to me it was starting to become a series of demo reels like "hey, look what i can do." instead of being intriguing, it became very distracting. but hey, it worked. he's now directing "final destination 3" so he's on a path to a successful career, and i think he will become a top notch horror director in years to come.<br /><br />what really did it in for me was the ending. like i said, i knew that jigsaw wasn't zap, and i liked how adam discovered the mini tape player after killing him. it would've had a terrific ending, except for one fatal flaw: i felt they should've left it where you didn't know who the killer was. the way it was done was only done for one reason: boy, are we clever? uh, no. to me, it just didn't make sense.<br /><br />some of the better horror films are made for a reason, where there is a reason for the violence we see in the story. while "saw" started out very well, it started to become undone by the filmmakers' insatiable need to be "cool" and detract from the winning story they had. perhaps if they weren't too insistent on making the films themselves, and relied on a more experienced horror director to helm it, i think it would've been the horror classic that it undeservedly has been given over the past four months. if this and "cabin fever" are the future of horror, i'm very scared.
