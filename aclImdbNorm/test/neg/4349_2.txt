i and my brother are very big asian movie fans, so when finding this movie hidden in a shop, i bought this one on dvd, because it sounded very promising and i couldn't wait to watch it. so i watched this movie with my brother and i must say, in the beginning it was very promising. both of us really loved this brutal ball scene in the first scene. but i guess that was all. there are some interesting fights, but it is not a action movie, as it claims to be. instead it's a love movie... with the clich'e of love so extremely played over the top, even shakespeare would vomit on this title. sorry for my language. by the way: the characters act like being picked up from the street and given 100
