my paraphrase above of the slogan on the back of the dvd box sums it up: this film was far more horrible than horrifying.<br /><br />this is the worst film i have seen in as long as i can remember. my wife accidentally rented it thinking it was the tom cruise version. the laughably crude special effects on the menu screen should have tipped us off. the gratuitous nudity already in the opening scene made us more suspicious.<br /><br />but as the film wore on, we were benumbed by clumsy acting -- both over- and under-acting -- non-continuity in directing and editing, trite writing, and crude special effects. we gave up after a half-hour or less; after starting this badly, it couldn't possibly get better.<br /><br />since i despise reviews that pan a product without giving specifics, here are some examples of the film's especially awkward moments, even if they amount to spoilers:<br /><br />- the lead says good-bye to his young old son as the latter is about to drive away with his mother, the latter prickly because it's their wedding anniversary but the lead is not coming along due to sudden business. the son asks, quietly worried, "will i ever see you again?" perhaps it's supposed to come off as a premonition, but it instead comes off as incongruous behavior for a child that age in that situation.<br /><br />- a huge alien spacecraft has crashed to earth and sits in an enormous crater. a crowd of people stands nearby, peering at it uneasily but otherwise looking generally unaroused. one woman finally says "it's gi-normous!"<br /><br />- after this craft has laid waste a village and its inhabitants, the lead and a bystander, now alone near their homes and trying to load their cars for an escape, have an exchange something like this, in a quietly puzzled tone:<br /><br />"what was that thing, anyway?" "i dunno..."<br /><br />- a crowd attempting to evacuate over a bridge is blocked by the military, since part of the bridge is destroyed. when an alien ship shoots an explosive at it, the crowd starts to run away, seemingly only because a director told them to and not because they're frightened or in any kind of real danger, let alone unusual circumstances.<br /><br />and so forth... writing about the film falls short of the experience of actually seeing it. but please, please, save yourself the bother, even if your morbid curiosity is piqued! the film is so bad it can't even be enjoyed as unintentional humor (versus, say, king vidor's "solomon & sheeba" starring yul brynner wearing a wig). life is too short to waste watching such nonsense. there must be something more productive and enjoyable to do, like walking the dog or cleaning a birdcage.
