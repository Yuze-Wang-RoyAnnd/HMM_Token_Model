acclaimed argentine horror director emilio vierya directs a script from jack curtis and antonio ross. cheesy and ridiculous are in the mix for the method to the madness. a doctor's son is nearing his early death, until his desperate father transplants an ape's heart into his chest. as expected, things are going to get weird; when this young man turns into a mask wearing monster and roams the beaches scouting out nice looking party girls to make his slaves. when heroin is injected, his beauties become zombies. the monster summons his dazed minions with strange organ music. so bad...well...it's just bad. in the cast: jose e. moreno, alberto caneau, mauricio de ferraris, gloria prat and gina moret.
