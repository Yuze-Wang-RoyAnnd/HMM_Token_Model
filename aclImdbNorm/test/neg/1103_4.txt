child death and horror movies will always remain a sensitive & controversial combination and therefore it is my personal opinion that every movie that shows the courage to revolve on this topic should receive some extra attention from horror fans. of course, like in the case of "wicked little things", controversial themes don't always guarantee a good film. despite the potentially interesting plot, the atmospheric setting and the involvement of video-nasty director j.s. cardone ("the slayer"), this is an uninspired and clich'e-ridden film that couldn't offer a single fright or shock. after losing their husband and father, the remaining tunny women (mother karen and her daughters sarah and emma) move to a small and remote pennsylvanian mountain town where they inherited an old, ramshackle mansion. their new home is dangerously close to the old mine ruins where dozens of innocent children tragically lost their lives in 1913. strange things start to happen, like young emma befriending an (imaginary?) girl who used to live in their house, and the eerie locals seem to keep secrets from karen and her daughters. quickly turns out that the undead children still leave their mine-graves at night to seek vengeance on the descendants of the mine's owner mr. carlton, who was responsible for their deaths. "wicked little things" is rather tame and extremely predictable. the script shamelessly serves one dreadful clich'e after the other, like car wheels stuck in the mud at crucial times, malfunctioning flashlights and horridly broken dolls. there's very little suspense, even less gore and the make-up effects are disappointingly weak. the zombified children don't look menacing at all. actually, they all look like miniature versions of marilyn manson, with their black outfits, pale faces and dark eyes. the excitement-free finale is stupid and just as derivative as the rest of this pointless production. lori heuring is thoroughly unimpressive in her leading role as the mother, but scout taylor-compton (currently a big star thanks to the "halloween" remake) and young chloe moretz are adequate as the daughters.
