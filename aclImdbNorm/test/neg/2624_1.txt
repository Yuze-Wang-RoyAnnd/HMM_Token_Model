lazy movie made by a lazy director. the characters are grotesque. despite the tragic of this war, there is no emotion at all in the movie. symbolism is artificial and inefficient (and old bosnian woman giving a photo of her son to arbour will "concretize" her willingness, will awake the super-mother sleeping inside her, a corpse eaten by worms to show the horror of genocide... too much is sometimes worst than not enough).<br /><br />this movie is only an advertisement, an empty elegy to a woman who is not a hero. she worked for united nations. remember un failed to protect civilians at srebrenica. who are the true heroes of this war? a canadian judge leading post-mortem trial for atrocities that happened mostly because her organization failed to prevent them? where is the criticism in this movie?
