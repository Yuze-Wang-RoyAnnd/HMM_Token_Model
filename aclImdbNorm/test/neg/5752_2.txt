for many months i was looking forward to this release. the previews looked good, early reports on the net were encouraging, and golden eye and timesplitters were excellent shooters (by the same people). it turns out i was greatly misled! haze had the potential to be up there with call of duty 4 and other next gen shooters, however it looks, plays and feels like something from 5 years or so ago. i played haze on a 1080 tv and was initially disappointed that the game's developers had limited the graphics to 720. the haze universe lacks detail and atmosphere, the feeling of "they must have really rushed to finish this" is always there.<br /><br />the controls are sluggish and cumbersome, and i have yet to find an adjustment for x/y axis sensitivity . there are many parts of the single player game that are very dark (visually), to the point where you can't actually see where you are going. why not add a torch function like in halo? or even better, night vision? the use of the performance enhancing drug "nectar" is interesting, however just as you get used to it you switch sides and don't use it again! why bother? i could go on with many more haze faults, but instead i'll just say don't bother! wait for killzone 2 or play call of duty 4 and try to unlock the gold ak!
