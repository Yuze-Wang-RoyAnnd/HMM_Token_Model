there's an underlying current in all the positive reviews of this movie - it's just a brainless comedy, don't take it seriously. chillax dude!!! well that's one point of view. the other would be - why are we accepting exactly the same script, the same formula and the same unfunny people in all these "comedies".<br /><br />what you get is a slacker who, through some totally unreal circumstances, has to change his life (always a he), overcome a set of circumstances which would only pose a problem to a raccoon or a teenager, beat the equally stupid bad guy who is trying to steal the gal he met two days earlier and triumph by remaining a slacker but with more money/self-esteem. on the way somebody does something gross but very illogical. this means you the viewer can call someone after the movie and say something like "you won't believe it maaann. this guy finds the otter drowned in the bucket of diarrhoea the other guy left after he ate laxative brownies. then he shines his shoes with it". hilarious.<br /><br />most of the usual names turn up. david spade and rob schneider do unfunny shtick but they're crrrazzeee characters - a russian and, i'm holding my sides, a waiter in a vegan restaurant. adam sandler, the king of the brainless unfunny, illogical comedy co-produces and some talentless nobody called dante shows up, yet again. the us will have to explain to the rest of the world what this guy dante is famous for cos we are clueless. allen covert plays a 36 year old which got the biggest laugh of the night from me. he was 42 and looked years older.<br /><br />did i laugh? yes, but no more than i would at a tv sit-com and i don't have to pay a penny to watch them. please stop making these movies.
