what more can i add? this is without doubt one of the worst films i've ever seen. terrible acting, a daft script, tediously slow pace - even visible microphones dangling from the top of the screen. i could go on, but i really can't be bothered. i watched this for 90 minutes before the sense of losing the will to live became too great for me.<br /><br />i can only assume that the first set of comments and votes were from people associated with the promotion of this insult to british film-making.<br /><br />and worst still, i had to buy the mail on sunday to get it :-) the only reason the dvd hasn't now been redeployed as a coaster is that it now takes pride of place in my top 10 worst films ever collection.<br /><br />definitely one to be avoided.
