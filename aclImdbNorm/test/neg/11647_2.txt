what was i thinking when i rented this one? what did the distributor think when he copied the tape and shipped it all the way to holland? that anyone really wanted to see this s***?!?<br /><br />it's about some astronauts getting into trouble outer space (apollo 13 flashback, but never even in the shadow of this fine film) and they want to return to home. if you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!<br /><br />this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (deep impact and armageddon), and this one fails everywhere. deep impact and armageddon weren't perfect either (far from it), but they were at least worth watching once (and maybe one more time when we're all old). they gave some fun. max q doesn't. it gives irritation. okay, okay. it's a tv movie, but does that mean you're allowed to come up with such a mess?<br /><br />if you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.<br /><br />it gets at its worst at the end when the space shuttle lands on... no, i can't 'spoil' this one (imdb guidelines forbid it). so you have to see for yourself. no! don't see it (sorry), but rent a movie which is worth renting (like battlefield earth... just kidding!)<br /><br />probably the worst one i have ever seen.
