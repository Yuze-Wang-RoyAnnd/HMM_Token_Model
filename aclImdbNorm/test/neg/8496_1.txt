mr. kennedy should stop experimenting with bad movie scripts. what was he thinking? this is a movie that should not have passed the "hey, i've got an idea, let's make a sequel" stage of inception. if there was a zero rating, i'd give it, but i guess i'll settle for a generous 1. it seems these days that if there is a buck to be made, movie execs will dig up an old hit and run it by a set of writers and see what turns up. (hey, i said "hit and run"! kinda describes how i felt when this movie ended!) how this piece of trash ever saw the light of day is beyond me. it is filled with unpleasant humor, strange animation and jokes that don't quite take you anywhere besides a state of confusion. if you are being dragged to this movie, and someone is paying for you....fine.... but its still going to be more painful than a brick in the forehead. however, if you're planning on paying your own hard-earned money, search out a better alternative.
