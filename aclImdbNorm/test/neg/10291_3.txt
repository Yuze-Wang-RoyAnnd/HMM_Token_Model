this movie was *good* relatively during the first parts of it.<br /><br />we have a story, from 3 points of view. so let's find some clues and complete the story.<br /><br />oh wait...none of that stuff matters because the fbi guys are the bad guys! though that was a great twist...it was almost a terrible twist. i immediately downgraded the film from a 7 maybe 8 to 3 based on the last 10-15 minutes of it.<br /><br />does anyone else not see why the twist is so bad? yes, it's a good shock. but it is bad because it has absolutely nothing to do with the preceding hour and twenty minutes. there's no connection to the killers.<br /><br />the killers are in about all of 5 minutes of this movie (as killers) and the two fbi agents are only in 15 minutes of the previous hour and twenty.<br /><br />we get it...surveillance...oh, the killers are voyeurs. which makes no sense, because they were only described in limited terms as just being psychopaths. and the hour and twenty minutes of surveillance we are watching of the 3 stories goes out the window as everyone is dead in 5 minutes.<br /><br />all of this makes the ending even more ridiculous. oh, they killed a bunch of fbi agents in the beginning...what fbi agents sleep together? all in the same room. to be found and murdered by amateurs and then impersonated by people who know nothing about being fbi agents? a cop 3 feet away apparently can't hit either one with a standard police issue pistol that can shoot several shots. i hate movies that try to make you feel like this could be real when they make absurd leaps they think we will believe.<br /><br />the other thing is the movie ends about 10-15 minutes after they are revealed as the killers with a girl standing in the field somewhere...
