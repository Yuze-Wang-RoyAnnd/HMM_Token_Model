the only riddle in this film was how it ever got made. the british film industry needs to make films people actually want to watch and not look to get taxpayers money (a'la bbc) to keep luvvies in their life style they have been accustomed to, with doing nothing for it.<br /><br />the film was every thing wrong with british films it relied on stereotypes, it had to be about a london were people were either posh and corrupt, gangsters, luvvies or gawd blimey jellied eel types, the story script was just pathetically weak, to the extent when the police man pulled out his phone and the ring tone was the "sweeney " theme i just expected it. the whole film was a happy shopper sweeney / minder rip off.<br /><br />the priceless manuscript i noted got left behind and lost on a few occasions and is something even i with my limited street wiseness wouldn't carry around in my breast pocket every where, to the beach and fights etc saying that vinnie jones is likable which is about the only thing in the film, poor bloke.<br /><br />when derek jacobi walked into the water at the end because he was dickens, oh my god, what a load of crap, and i am being positive here
