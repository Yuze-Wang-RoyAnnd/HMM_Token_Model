egads.<br /><br />i used to think keannu reeves was the worst actor in hollywood. i not so sure anymore, willy gives keannu some stiff competition with his "i'm made of plaster" performance in this movie.<br /><br />combine that with the fact that there is almost no plot, and not a single likable character, and it's pretty hard to recommend this turkey.<br /><br />natasha tries her best, but even julia roberts couldn't save this flick from obscurity.<br /><br />avoid it unless it's really late and there's nothing else on. -oh heck, in that case just read a book.
