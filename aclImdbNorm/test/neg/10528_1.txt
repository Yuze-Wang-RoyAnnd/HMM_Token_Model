this movie is at times a wild 80s college sex comedy, others a sweet romantic one... then it has moments of serious drama and then sprinkles in dashes of science fiction... it is so uneven its almost ridiculous.<br /><br />but i would hardly rank it as one of the worst films i've ever seen except of course for the fact that they casted peter o'toole.<br /><br />there is absolutely nothing for him to work with here. poor dialog, poor performances to work off of, poor everything... and yet he's fantastic... there is not one good thing about his part and yet he makes it work if only on pure charm alone.<br /><br />the fact that he was so able to achieve so much with so little shines a spotlight on how greatly everyone else in this film failed, making it seem even worse than i suppose it actually is...<br /><br />if any other actor was in o'toole's role, i would have forgotten this movie as crap and never thought of it again, but a fine performance by peter o'toole despite all odds ensures that i'll remember this film for a long time to come... if only as a film that, maybe, could have been good if anyone involved in it was nearly half as good as peter o'toole.
