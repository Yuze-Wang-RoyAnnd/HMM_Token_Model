once i heard that the greatest and oldest preserved germanic heroic poem was transformed into a film it almost became my obsession to see it. the first glints of its appearance i caught never disappointed me. a futuristic interpretation with lambert our favourite highlander and mitra, tomb raider to be,in leading roles seamed appealing, though some doubts came to life (an important female character in beowulf?)... two hours ago i saw the film. after i had read the director's name my world fell apart. as i said - from that point on, there was not many surprises. first and foremost, the film has nothing to do with the original beowulf if we disregard a couple of violently and pointlessly stolen names. if they had not stolen the names and declared it to be a new story, it might have passed as an f-class action stupidity with nice costumes and scenography. this way it is simply a crime! an attack on a legend and its ideology as well as on common sense. ok let me be positive for a second... apart from the general electro-goth atmosphere which is nice it also has good music. that was it for both the positive part and this comment.
