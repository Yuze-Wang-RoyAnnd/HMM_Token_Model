i have seen this movie but not in a single sitting. what happens it that it is playing on the tv, i watch for a few minutes, find that i have take all that i can take and then leave the room. during those few minutes i do not laugh once, experience no pleasure in what i am viewing, and find myself more depressed that angry. interestingly, i am told the psychological states are incompatible, that is, one cannot be angry and depressed at the same time. this movie tests that theory.<br /><br />i think part of the problem is that i spent nearly ten years in chicago so as i am watching the scenes i am thinking of my own experiences in that rotten town and thus i am clearly bringing a lot of my baggage to the piece. it is entirely possible, i am willing to concede, that if you are not a chicago denizen you will find the piece amusing. if so, i envy you.<br /><br />and yet. john hughes set his films in chicago and those movies worked for me. i think the difference is that hughes was a first rate writer. i think it obvious he knew how to comically balance his situations, as well as make his characters both sympathetic and believable. in a comedy (as distinguished from a farce) this balance vital. and it is not easy to achieve. if it was everyone would be making great movies and we would not have to fret as we do in the real world wondering when genius will ever appear. in "adventures in babysitting," it doesn't. i hated those characters. <br /><br />there is a difference, profound and real, between sympathetic and simply pathetic.<br /><br />for me every scene in this movie is a clunker. there is no humor, no humanity, no people one can recognize. just actors reading their lines as if it all they can do to restrain themselves from screaming them out, certain that finally hilarity will ensue, this time for sure! it's like watching the antics of very bad comedians. it's embarrassing and after a while, usually at the point when i get up and leave, i start to feel pity for all concerned, which is a kind of emotional connection, i suppose. elizabeth shue is terrible. she doesn't act, certainly not act comically, and it's entirely possible she can't. but lord how she tries. she looks older than 17, and acts way younger like a seven-year old straining in a school play certain that this is how one gets an award. and she is not alone. it is as if everyone cannot relax and let the tale flow. as if everyone simply has no idea what they are doing. <br /><br />now, this was an early effort for chris columbus and he clearly would improve and having better writers (e.g. john hughes himself) certainly helped, so perhaps some forgiveness is in order. but the film just reeks of desperation. yet like i said it may work for some. if any of the above appeals to you, and it clearly did some of the reviewers, then go get the dvd and knock yourself out. otherwise, avoid this mess like you would a dark chicago alley where as you hurry by you can only see shadows and hear muttered threats.
