i didn't like this movie.to me,it didn't make much sense.it was hard to figure out what was really happening.i also didn't think it was scary.i did however,think it was silly,even absurd,but not in a good way.radha mitchell is the main character in the movie,which cam out in 2003.she was also,coincidently in 2006's "silent hill"which i hated.it too i found confusing and pointless."visitors" isn't as bad,but i think it is certainly below average.there is just nothing special about it.the script is just too muddled and there are things in the movie which don't need to be there,in my opinion.i think radha mitchell is probably a good actress,if she has more to work with.my vote for "visitors" is 4/10
