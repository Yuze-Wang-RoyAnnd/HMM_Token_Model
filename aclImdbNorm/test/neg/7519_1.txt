if you loved the early-60's version of "the time machine", don't waste your time; as with last year's "the planet of the apes", this has been "reimagined", and not for the better. and, just as with "planet...", its lead actor is woefully miscast and leaden; guy pearce, a terrific actor of great range, is all wrong for this role, giving a one-note performance that elicits zero sympathy; he's so dour and serious, and lacking in awe of the (supposedly) amazing things he sees that you don't believe for a moment that he's experiencing them. worse yet, whose idea was it for him to resemble the love child of david spade and calista flockhart?? a handsome actor, here he is sickeningly gaunt, which is, believe it or not, a major distraction. frankly, the man looks gravely ill and is photographed cruelly. he shares absolutely no chemistry with anyone on the screen, a direct result of a performance that is out of sync with anyone else's. sadly, even with a proper leading man this movie doesn't stand a chance for it is fatally burdened with both a totally inept director - whole scenes go nowhere and are poorly realized - and a screenplay that is utterly inferior, scattered and at times incoherent - not for a single moment do you care about anyone in this film, for the single fact that there is nothing in the way of character development! in the original, you got to know the eloi, so therefore you felt for them, and felt their terror of the morelocks; here, as the movie stresses several times, they are nothing but sheep and act accordingly. unless you're a member of peta, scared sheep are hardly the stuff of entertainment! <br /><br />samantha mumba does as well as possible, in her movie debut, but, like everyone else in this mess, most especially jeremy irons (if he's the leader of the morelocks [who look like rejects from "the mummy returns"], why then does he look like edgar winter's long-lost brother?) is completely wasted. also wasted was the money spent on the endless 'special' effects, which belie the $70m spent on the film; they are uniformly lackluster, obvious and unconvincing. and then there's the look of the film: poorly photographed, its art direction and sets are just "there" and its costumes are typical in design. there isn't an original thought or idea expressed behind or on the screen. most of all, it isn't even fun! (the filmmakers use the now-ubiquitous orlando jones as "comic relief" but, as usual, jones is irritating, and just how does his electrically-driven character survive in a world seemingly devoid of electricity?)<br /><br />all in all, this is an empty, lifeless, dull, sterile and confused affair: didn't they already remake "planet of the apes"??? (at least that had the fortune of some strong performances!) <br /><br />*spoiler!* the final insult (beyond a head-shakingly terrible, not to mention convenient, ending)? not only do they barely feature the changing dress-store figures, they make even the time machine itself an anachronistic, gaudy glass-n-chrome bore! (if "the sopranos" had a time machine, this is exactly what it would look like.) pathetic...
