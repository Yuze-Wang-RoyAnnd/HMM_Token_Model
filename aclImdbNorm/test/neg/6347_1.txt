one of the worst movies i've ever seen. completely ridiculous. the story is bad. the animations are completely childish and displaced. the physics of the holograms are hilarious from how much they are completely wrong. omg, i even wanna believe that this film has disney label on it. yuck. the actresses are somewhat beautiful, but there are so many good films with astonishing actresses that are far more valuable to see than this one. final remark, bad film. don't bother to watch it. if you're looking for films to see with your kids consider other alternatives like ratattuile, monster inc or an enchanted story (on theaters). seriously.
