don't get me wrong. i've got a considerable soft spot for the works of charles band, both as producer and director. but you've got to raise an eyebrow when the man who was willing to put his name to "dollman vs the demonic toys" sticks a pseudonym on anything. as a bit of bad-movie fun, "head of the family" is rather lacking, although it is better acted than you might expect. jacqueline lovell is a definite talent who deserves better than these kinds of movies. j.w. perra is also quite funny as the titular monster, though for such a superintelligent being he does get hoodwinked quite easily. y'know, i'm nitpicking because the rest of the movie is so sharp and witty of course....<br /><br />and having a lead character called lance bogan? nice one guys. we didn't know you americans knew that piece of slang!
