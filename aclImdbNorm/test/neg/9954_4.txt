pretty bad prc cheapie which i rarely bother to watch over again, and it's no wonder -- it's slow and creaky and dull as a butter knife. mad doctor george zucco is at it again, turning a dimwitted farmhand in overalls (glenn strange) into a wolf-man. unfortunately, the makeup is virtually non-existent, consisting only of a beard and dimestore fangs for the most part. if it were not for zucco and strange's presence, along with the cute anne nagel, this would be completely unwatchable. strange, who would go on to play frankenstein's monster for unuiversal in two years, does a lenny impression from "of mice and men", it seems.<br /><br />*1/2 (of four)
