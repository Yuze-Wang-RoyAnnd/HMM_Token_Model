it's strange, while the film features full x-rated sex scenes and violent murders, it never feels as shocking as it ought to.<br /><br />a group of scientists go to an island in the caribbean to investigate a radioactive incident. upon their arrival, a mutated islander goes about the happy business of murdering the men and having his way with the women. doesn't it always seem to work out that way.<br /><br />among the sored acts we find a some lesbian encounters, a three-way with male prostitutes, assorted heterosexual couplings and the rape of an already dead body. even though it's all fully explicit, it fails to ever shock or stir as it is meant to. as soon as the sex goes fully pornographic it just loses it's edge; the suspension of disbelief is broken and we realize we are just watching people having sex.<br /><br />there is some blood and gore with the murders, but given that this is a d'amato flick it's really tame. for a much more rounded experience watch the similar 'erotic nights of the living dead'.<br /><br />2/10
