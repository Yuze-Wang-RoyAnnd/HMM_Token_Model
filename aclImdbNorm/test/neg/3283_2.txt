if you haven't seen "the war at home", let me tell you what you've been missing. it's a show about ethnic diversity and sexuality that could have only been edgy and funny in the 60's. where america has grown in it's acceptance of race, sexual preference, religion, etc... this show seems to argue with that progress. it's a backward step in america's evolution.<br /><br />for example, one of the ongoing jokes of the show is that the white daughter is dating a black kid from school. this is obviously hilarious seeing as how you can't see that type of relationship at any mall in america. i've lived in both small towns and big cities, so don't give me some type of red state, blue state excuse. not only is this the joke, but the father, who is supposedly not racist, finds this disturbing and asks his daughter repeatedly to break up with her boyfriend, which opposes his "he may sound like a racist, but he's just dumb" character.<br /><br />if this isn't enough, a second running joke is that one of the sons, and soon to be metro-sexual, is ambiguous in his sexual orientation. the audience learns over and over that he isn't gay, but the father isn't convinced, so he constantly avoids his son, afraid perhaps that his son will hit on him, as all gay men are nymphomaniac wild men, who can't control their will. the father always comes to some acceptance of his son, once per show, but usually goes on avoiding him in the following episode.<br /><br />the only way this show can cure itself in my eyes is if the continuous exposure to these "unnatural occurrences in life", open up the father's eyes a little, but that may be too much to ask - and besides, with jokes like these, i'm sure we'll have hilarity in episodes to come like - episode 13, "father votes against women voters", and episode 14, "my muslim neighbor is a terrorist".<br /><br />please drop this show, fox. we're living in a different world from the one your execs grew up in.
