avida is a game of words mingling life and eagerness, but i personally think this movie was overblown by its ambition and does not make justice to its title. it gathers a set of awkward characters united by unbelievable links. furthermore, the way everything is connected at the end is, in my opinion, a bit pathetic. what remains of it was a set of images... an interesting one, but not enough to make this a good movie. <br /><br />i believe this film is supposed to be a comedy, but i surely didn't noticed! the nonsense and caricatural nature of the movie is actually the only good thing about it, but when it drags on an on and on it becomes no longer bearable. i have to say i fought hard to continue seeing it until the end, and i am still not sure it was worth it...
