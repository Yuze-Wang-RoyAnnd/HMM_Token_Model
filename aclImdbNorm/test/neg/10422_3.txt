it's reassuring to see that other imdb reviewers have had the good sense to pan this disappointing film, at the risk of blaspheming against the great vadim, malle and fellini.<br /><br />these directors may be talented & artistic in their own right; however in attempting to pass off this hodgepodge of attempted eroticism and 60s chic as *in any way* related to edgar allen poe's stories, they exposed themselves as frauds. either (a) they didn't bother to read the poe stories, or (b) they read them but were so transfixed by their own egotistical agenda that they didn't pay poe any mind.<br /><br />imagine if metallica plugged in their guitars, cranked the amps up to 11 and moshed out 3 chords claiming it to be beethoven's 9th symphony. that's the feeling you'll get after sitting through this film. if you're a vadim/malle/fellini fan (metallica), you'll dig it. if you're a beethoven fan (poe), you'll puke.<br /><br />metzergenstein...<br /><br />here we begin with a bizarre porno version of poe. ok, "porno" may be a bit extreme haha, but at the very least you have to call it a barbarella version (including, i don't doubt, some of jane's outfits coming directly from the set of that scifi romp). vadim falls into old clich'es of his own: the girl lying on a bed being pleasured by some man whilst from the pillow-cam we see the apathy in her eyes; the general lassitude and ennui of a woman who finds no satisfaction in hedonism. cute stuff, but "metzergenstein" ain't the place for it. and in addition to the barbarella outfits and irrelevant erotic themes, jane fonda's awful american accent and unconvincing performance as a european countess made this the worst casting since julia roberts in that lousy version of dr. jekyll & mr. hyde.<br /><br />william wilson...<br /><br />here's a great poe story about the madness that claims a man when he realizes that he is no longer unique in the world. if you really want to see a fantastic visual interpretation of this theme, go watch star trek episode #27 "the alternative factor". but here, malle glazes over that central theme and instead focuses on... any guesses...? yup, eroticism, sadism and debauchery. ho hum. brigitte bardot's role is a complete fabrication to accomplish that end, and once again the director distorts a classic poe story into a masturbatory catharsis of his own unrequited sexual issues. do it on your own time, malle. i thought we're here on poe's dime.<br /><br />toby dammit....<br /><br />the absolute worst of the three and possibly the worst film i've seen since "staying alive". at least fellini showed some tact in changing the title, but his departure from the original plot, theme and humour of the story is so vast, i wonder if he just picked this reel out of his private collection of home movies, stamped "edgar allen poe story" on it and submitted it to this collection. i strained very hard to find any thread of familiarity with poe's works, but there was absolutely none.<br /><br />the original poe story ("never bet the devil your head") is a short and hilarious dark fable about a man who constantly exclaims "i'll bet the devil my head..." on a foggy morning, the devil takes him up on his offer. the result is the sickest and silliest thing you've ever read. this was poe, the comedian, at his finest (yes, poe wrote many comedies. also check out "a predicament" and "devil in the belfry" if you want a taste of his witty, satirical works).<br /><br />this fellini version? it's bland, soulless, and not funny at all (unless you consider it funny to see a drunk stumbling over himself for 45 minutes). here fellini's egotistical rant is about an artist struggling with the hypocrisy, pretense and mediocrity of cinema. most of it is set at an awards ceremony where fellini beats us over the head with sarcasm, cynicism and that classic "sour grapes" attitude that we find in all fellini films dealing with cinema. note the sarcastic jabs at "the critics", a recurring theme in fellini's films. for someone who considered himself above the critics, fellini sure spent a lot of time talking about them. at any rate, i feel like fellini just took some outtakes from 8 1/2, spliced them together and sold it as a poe story. worst "adaptation" ever.<br /><br />i think i put more effort into typing this review than any of the three directors put into making a poe movie.
