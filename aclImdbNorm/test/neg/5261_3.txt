my age: 13<br /><br />keats, played by damon wayans, and archie moses, played by adam sandler, are the best of friends and have been for a year. what moses doesn't know is that keats is really jack carter, an undercover cop, who is waiting for the right time to bust moses and frank colton, a major criminal who moses is involved with. when colton and moses find out that keats is a cop, colton wants to kill moses, but he gets away after shooting carter in the head, which does not kill carter. moses is found by the cops and is taken for proof of colton's wrongdoing. but when the cops, including carter, are about to escort him across the country on a plane, all the other cops are killed and moses and carter are alone in the desert. carter has to stay alive as well as take moses in.<br /><br />a fairly average action-comedy, bulletproof has a fair plot but a lot of the film is just plain stupid. for a comedy, i found most of the jokes entirely unfunny. but as an action movie, it has a few fairly good action scenes. not being a good fan of either adam sandler or damon wayans, i found the acting and therefore, the characters, well below par. the climax isn't really great, and the film is so unrealistic. it is not entirely bad, but also not too good, and it is far too short. running below 85 minutes, i though there was another 15 minutes left before it ended, but there wasn't, and the film felt too short. overall not a complete waste of time, but i still wouldn't recommend bulletproof.<br /><br />australian classification: ma 15+: medium level violence, sexual references, medium level coarse language<br /><br />rating: 56 out of 100
