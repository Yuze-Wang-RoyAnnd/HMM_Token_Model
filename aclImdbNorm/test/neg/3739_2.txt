i love john's work as a singer, but the movie was dull and 'no worth the time' to view. <br /><br />i thought he did an 'ok' job at acting his part. when he says, "your having an affair with the ol' man", to his co-star, i kinda chuckled at his facial movements... or lack thereof. <br /><br />i would suggest the movie if you like john's music but not as a saturday night video. <br /><br />if you love his music, then the video has a little music from him in it, but not much. <br /><br />so so.. at best
