having watched the first scene, i realized the acting was so bad that it couldn't possibly pick up later. superficial and artificial, with frequent attempts to look professional through references to technology the way a five year-old tries to make it sound as if he knows what he's talking about. <br /><br />the second-to-second storyline is completely unrealistic and just about every single decision the screenwriter did, was the kind you expect from a below-average grade school student. the overall storyline was as unoriginal and predictable as a pack of sausages. the few attempts to make the dialogs sound intelligent, was limited to neurotic, apologetic behavior. a ten year-old might like it. but it would take a five year-old to accept the lack of realism; how does advanced cell function allow someone to bypass a code lock by touching it as if with a magic wand, pick out one out of 100s of voices through a ventilation system (thereby ripping off superman), and repair a home computer by just sensing whats wrong instead of looking for faults? actually, that scene is a neat example: the fault was that one of the cooling pipes (aluminum ribbons) on the cpu was broken, the way it would look if a exhaust pipe on a v8 engine is ripped off by an explosion. this is something that can't happen, and if it did, it wouldn't prevent the computer from working. there is no electrical current passing through this ribbon, but when he (without doing it himself, his arms worked by autopilot because the cells in his body was super efficient) put a push-pin into the rip, a desktop with icons appeared on the screen immediately without booting.<br /><br />and so it goes all the way. like when he escaped an interrogation room in the nsa headquarters by lighting a lighter below a fire sensor, resulting in open doors throughout the building. naturally, nsa didn't predict this sharp witted approach to escaping, nor did they put any guards outside his room (or anywhere else) to guard a living, walking breakthrough in military nanotechnology. so he walked out and got a cab. examples like this one are not only numerous, there is in fact just about no single scene that makes sense. <br /><br />also, the so-called great effects were terrible. he threw a basketball back to a kid in the park, and the kid was thrown back horizontally 20 feet into a tree. no acceleration or deceleration, but constant speed and height, like a motorized trolley. i'm sure if i paused and looked for the cables that kept the posture of this kid the way only cables can, they probably didn't know how to or bother to erase them completely. if someone is thrown that far into a tree, they would at least say ouch (or rather be hospitalized with broken bones), but the kid was just just confused and amazed.<br /><br />moronic. that's the word for every creative decision made throughout the entire production. i'm going to put the director's name on my own personal blacklist, someone as poorly skilled as him cannot improve. i feel like demanding compensation for having wasted 45 minutes of my life for watching it, and the time it took to write this. although it felt therapeutic, it was traumatic to realize how little it takes to get a pilot approved. the only excuse a slightly intelligent person could have to watch this voluntarily, would be imprisonment or lobotomy.
