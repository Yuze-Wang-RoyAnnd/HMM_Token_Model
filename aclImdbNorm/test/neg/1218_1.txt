this is the worst italian movie ever, quite possibly the worst movie of all time! joe d'amato is of course no cinematic genius but many of his movies are interesting and watchable. unfortunatly this is not one of them. its cheesy and boring....waaaaay boring. if you want a movie to mst3k, get troll 2, if you want a movie to put someone into a coma, get deep blood!
