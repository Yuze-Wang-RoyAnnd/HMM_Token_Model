before watching this film (at a screening attended by the director herself) we were informed this had won the short film prize at the galway film fleadh. surely this result will give filmmakers hope, anyone can do better than this!<br /><br />how anyone cannot notice the flagrant rip-off of donnie darko in this i'll never know. the film is pure drivel, the acting cardboard, the dialogue ridiculous & the ending just flat! the only crumb of comfort we enjoyed after seeing this rubbish was to loudly comment on how dreadful it was, in front of the director! yes that was mean, but liberating!<br /><br />at least irish film-making can't sink any lower!
