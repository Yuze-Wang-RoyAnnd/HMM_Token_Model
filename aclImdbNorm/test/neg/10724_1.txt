what a terrible misfire. not only the title but the idea is the same as that jane fonda, george segal vehicle of a few decades ago. why? i wonder, someone with the clout of jim carrey will, not only star, but also produce this tired, ugly, pointless excuse for a comedy. he could be taking comedy to a whole new level, instead, he goes for what he may assume is safe territory. money, money, grosses, christmas. but i'm sure this uncomfortable mess will have very short legs. i call it uncomfortable because that's how i felt. aware as i was of the desperate attempts tried out on the screen to be funny. and failing, miserably. it could have been an outrageous, politically incorrect, mirror comedy of the post enron days but no, that would be pointing too high, too risky. what a shame!
