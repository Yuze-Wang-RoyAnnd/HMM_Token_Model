obviously with this film going straight to dvd i wasn't expecting a lot but this film is so unfunny it is unbelievable. the only part of the film that you actually may find remotely funny is before they even get to the island, where eddie's son is blasted out of the bathroom by a jet of water and then that's it! why do they bother at all? the first christmas vacation with chevy chase was brilliant and hilarious. this is not. they rely on jokes concerning a dog with flatulence, and a character called uncle nick who is about 80 and keeps trying to get his way with beautiful women. when they approach the island on the boat, the island in the background just looks so fake and randy quaid although funny in the previous film, just overacts and seems like he's trying too hard to be funny. you have been warned!
