five fingers relies heavily on barbaric, shock value hollywood tactics to elicit apparently a positive movie-going response. this is where this movie fails throughout, primarily because it is too graphic to be taken seriously. i was repulsed and disgusted that five fingers was even made, and essentially had to force myself to continue watching it. torture in and of itself is gruesome. even the sounds coming from a room where someone is being tortured are gruesome. but obviously the makers of this stinker of a movie felt that was not enough. it had to go way beyond what was needed, and simply and effectively ruined any chances this movie had of making some sort of valid point. for this reason, this movie came across as nothing more than being self-gratifying. five fingers also pretty much relegates itself to a b-movie status solely by its indulgence on manipulation of time. in other words we are shown the present and then the past is revealed in snippets. this is a little bit of a twist of the normal hollywood manipulation of time. whereas the viewer normally is shown page 95 in a 100 page script as the beginning of the movie, and then the rest of the flick is essentially explaining the ending, five fingers is dedicated to flashing back, which gets quite tiring by the end of the movie. overall, five fingers made me feel stupid for watching the whole movie, because torture is obviously obscene, and it certainly was not necessary to resort to graphic mutilation to make this point. i am surprised that dick cheney did not make a guest cameo appearance at the end as some sort of torture superhero. this movie is a perfect example of what happens when an important topic falls into the hands of greedy, mindless dolts.
