like many other people, i've heard about "more" and i wanted to watch it due to the music that was composed by pink floyd. i must say that i was truly disappointed, not because of the music but the movie in itself. it's a boring insipid movie that lacks rhythm. where does this disappointment come from? according to me, from different things. first of all, the movie's subject, the drug links up badly with the idle sunny atmosphere of the movie. this one should have taken place in the sordid areas of paris and should have gave birth to a dark and helpless climate,for example. moreover, it's supposed to tell a descent into hell but this descent is softened and barely sketched out. barbet schroeder doesn't insist enough on the dramatic side of the story. you could have wished a little more of madness, cutting. on another hand, schroeder doesn't succeed in gaining the audience's emotion and adherence in front of the two main characters' distress. you watch carelessly their trials with drug. whereas the two main actors, they're perfectly inexpressive and hardly evolve during the movie, especially mimsy farmer. at the end, you only retain the beauty of the mediterraneans landscapes bathed in sunlight. the film created a huge sensation when it was released in 1969. nowadays, it <br /><br />seems dated. the hippy culture is nothing less than a faraway memory.
