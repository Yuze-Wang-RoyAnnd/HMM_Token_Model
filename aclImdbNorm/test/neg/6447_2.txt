i rated this one better than awful because i liked seeing jonathon from buffy in something again -- even if it was the same role.<br /><br />first, the concept is kind of cute for a short, but not an entire movie. the writing was forced and contrived. i have the feeling that the movie suffered the most during editing.<br /><br />second, amanda bynes always looks like her eyes are crossed -- even when she's not trying to do it. she's just not funny. she always plays some sort of misfit girl who triumphs by being herself -- ironic, considering amanda seems to always be a caricature. i would actually like to see her in something serious. i really want to give her a chance, but she is always cast in these trite roles where she wiggles and makes faces and somehow that's a good thing?<br /><br />finally, the whole "i'm a dork" segment was ripped off from revenge of the nerds. there was nothing in this movie that was unpredictable.<br /><br />shame, shame, shame.
