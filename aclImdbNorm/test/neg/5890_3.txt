i just saw this movie last night, and after reading all the reviews i expected a good, emotional sports film. what i got was something clich'ed and boring. yes, i thought it was boring. i saw the all-star getting hurt long before the game. i figured maybe they'd wait for him to collapse until, ya know, the game before the "big one" but i guess the first game is good enough.<br /><br />the parental relationships were also very clich'ed, with the dominating drunk father (i will say mcgraw impressed me, however), and the boy who wants to stay and help his (ailing?) mother.<br /><br />i especially liked the random girls (melissa and maria) who were in the movie for all of 5 minutes, and placed there simply to get the football boys some action off the field. i thought "ok, now how does this work into the plot again?" maybe i missed the point, beyond "well they play football in a town that loves it so the girls throw themselves at their feet" point.<br /><br />the sports action had some good points, but most of it was so rushed! i think the first game lasted longer than the montage of the entire playoffs! and i wasn't so sure about the continuity of the winding-down clock in the final game.<br /><br />i guess i could see this movie winning the espy for best sports film if it was the only one released. honestly though, i found it to be a boring movie full of people sickeningly-obsessed with the pigskin. for a better football film, see remember the titans.
