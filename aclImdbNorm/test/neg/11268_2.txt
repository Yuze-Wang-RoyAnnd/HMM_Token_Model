if you're in the mood for a really bad porno with no good porn combined with a really bad horror movie, this movie is perfect for you. however, if you breathe air, make sure you spend your time watching anything but this. the acting is crappy. the "plot" is crappy. they try too hard, and the whole time i was waiting for the one good redeeming scene that might make the movie worth watching. nope. stick with the scrambled cable.
