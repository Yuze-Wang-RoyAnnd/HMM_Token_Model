in general, i prefer horror movies that creep me out so much i'm afraid of everything for the next day or so, not the ones where people act stupid and get killed by an indestructible monster. this is one of those movies. the chupacabra of legend is a dog-faced lizard-skin greenish-gray monster that hops like a kangaroo, has fangs and claws, has a row of sharp spines sticking out from its back, and sucks the blood of livestock. as in many horror movies, good and bad, this movie takes liberty with the legend. it not only attacks humans, but it eats their intestines and has a bulletproof, nearly indestructible constitution. so tell me, how can a hypodermic needle penetrate its skin when bullets can't? and why, when the marines figure out that armor-piercing bullets can hurt it, do they split up so the chupacabra can pick them off one by one? john rhys-davies gives a performance that rises above the bad movie, and chelan simmons and dylan neal deserve credit for their performances, too. otherwise, the rest of the acting was poor to bad, just like the rest of the movie. my rating is based on rhys-davies, simmons and neal.
