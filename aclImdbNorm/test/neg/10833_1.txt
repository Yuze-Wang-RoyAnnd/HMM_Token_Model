even a awful 1 is to much for this film, everything form start to finish made you cringe. i don't think it would be possible to cram more overly clich'ed moments, into one piece of mind numbingly numbingly waste of film.<br /><br />prisoner cell block h meets thunderbirds, hell even virgil's expressions were more life like than his son.<br /><br />i haven't even finished watching this and i'm on here now.... oh no, the cheesy clapping of 3 actors and a backdrop done by a child with adobe premiere. this truly is the end of my "i've started so i'll finish watching it" phase.<br /><br />oh joy, the credits have come to rescue me. (and relax)
