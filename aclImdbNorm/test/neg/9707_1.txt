if you have never heard of jane austen, seen the original movie or the 1995 bbc adaptation, or even seen a pop up version of the book, then this farcical attempt to show this classic love story may be considered vaguely endurable.<br /><br />from the opening scene, this film must be remembered for its awful acting, abominable miscasting and complete lack of the classic wit of jane austen.<br /><br />whoever decided to cast actors (with the exception of the excellent judi dench) who have obviously never heard of jane austen, let alone read her, should be punished! keira knightley grimaces and grins through every scene, and came across as being so obnoxious that no-one would want to marry her! darcy looked as if he was trying to remember his lines throughout the whole film and the rest of the bennet girls were interchangeable in their lack of portraying their characters as they were originally written.<br /><br />this version failed to show the proper pride and prejudice that both darcy and elizabeth suffered from and, at the end of the longest two hours of my life, who cared whether they got together or not! absolutely abysmal - even the too few minutes of judi dench cannot save this rubbish. i cannot think of anything good to say about this film apart from that it eventually ended!
