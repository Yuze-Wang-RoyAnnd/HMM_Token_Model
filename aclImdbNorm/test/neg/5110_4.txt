every once in awhile i'll remember that i've actually seen this bizarre fiasco that's a cross between "whatever happened to baby jane?", "sunset boulevard," the lana turner lsd movie "the big cube" and the manson murders, which also took place in 1969 but maybe before this so-called "movie" was made! there are some descriptions of the plot already here, so i won't go into it. but it's worth noting that miriam hopkins plays a parody of herself: a chattering, ego-maniacal, fading actress. perhaps she thought she was making a movie that would be as successful as one of the bette davis horrors. the old gal hopkins never stopped working, so you have to hand it to her. she shows a little too much flesh in this movie, something davis and crawford would never have done. and there's a scene with miriam in the actual tacky hollywood boulevard christmas parade, which must have been filmed xmas, 1968.<br /><br />gale sondergard is old, old, old. it's just shocking how wrinkled and awful she looks. john garfield, jr. looks a bit like his father, but not as interesting. i think one of the three stooges is the tour guide at the beginning. if it's not one of the stooges, it's somebody.<br /><br />i was astounded to come across this thing in the form of a commercial videotape given to me by a friend who knows all about junk like this. it's amazing!!!
