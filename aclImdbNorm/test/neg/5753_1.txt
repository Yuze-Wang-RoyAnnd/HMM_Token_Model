this game is a good looking first person shooter. -----------hang on......<br /><br />but of course a story must be put around this genre, so a quite innovative plot about soldiers now driven by drugs to save the world and kill the terrorist, nectar is the drug of choice which creates a super soldier. <br /><br />great, now just give us some fun, challenging missions, throw in some great new weapons and free terrain vehicles that can be driven at our leisure and i will be quite content.<br /><br />no!!!!<br /><br />the maker's of this game decide to create a propagandish, military driven game, that tries to make sense of our fears of terrorism and embracing democracy. the game has twisted ideals that just re-enforce morals that we learned when we were in primary school, nothing new is told to us, but "drugs are bad...mmmkay". then pushed in a type of ....yvan eht nnnioooojjjjj! (join the navy) of how standing up for the common good, given rants on normality and abnormality, right and wrong....gooooooooood we get it! let's kill something!!!!<br /><br />no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />you can't, you are forced to endure extremely long gaps of completing bullsh!t objectives such as "run to helicopter"......."go to group of troops" .....then once this is completed.........cinematic takes over.........you sit there for at least half of the game watching little scenario's played out by the characters, one's you cannot skip, but sit and wait, sometimes when people aren't even talking, we sit and wait for a helicopter to land! <br /><br />bad game, by a laughable group of programmers! don't bother making another because i will rather see the movie!
