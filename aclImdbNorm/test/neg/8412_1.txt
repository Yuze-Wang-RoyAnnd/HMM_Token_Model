i usually seek to find good in movies, even the bad ones.unfortunately this movie is one where i fail miserably-and the fact that there's barely one positive review on this board shows many imdb reviewers share my pain.<br /><br />i don't usually watch sequels but i just had to see this since i love "rosemary's baby" so much. what a mistake that was. it simply reaffirms my belief in the fact that most sequels are lousy-though thankfully, very few are as bad as this. in fact in my mind this isn't even really a sequel, it's a satire on how bad a sequel can be. movie recommended very highly for not viewing-at any time-ever.
