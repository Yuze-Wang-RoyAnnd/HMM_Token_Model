this (very) low-budget film is fun if you're a john krasinski fan, but is otherwise disappointing. at least it was short, so i didn't feel like i had wasted too much of my time. john's scenes are funny enough, but the attempted 'deep' scenes with lacey chabert are pretty nauseating. it starts off seeming like it could be a funny movie, but some of the characters are just so outlandish while the others are far too serious that it just falls flat. don't get me started on the ending. it was totally implausible and didn't even fit with the rest of the movie. i will say that i wasn't bored, though, which is why i rated it above a three. fans of john krasinski will enjoy seeing him with a bandanna and stockings around his head, and eating cheez-its. oh, and make sure to check out john's deleted scenes, they're better than some that were actually included in the movie.
