i just watched that movie, and was pretty disappointed. i didn't expect much to begin with as the premise of the movie doesn't suggest greatness anyway. sadly, it doesn't even manage to deliver just as stupid entertainment. the main problem is probably the acting. while i've seen far worse actors in far worse movies, the story would require some people to act out as violent maniacs, some others as people caught a in really stressing predicament, and they fail to deliver that. although i watched the german release i watched with the original audio, so it's definitely not just bad voice-overs or anything like that. added to that, the german dvd release seems to be cut, the killings are all pretty much left out, meaning that except for a few semi-gory scenes closer to the end the german release doesn't deliver as a movie for "gore-hounds", either. can't comment on that for other releases of course. the plot has some stupid moments thrown in here and there and the beginning is just hilarious (ever heard of a demon visiting a psychiatrist?). too bad the movie takes itself far too seriously, if it was filmed as a horror-comedy and changed a bit here and there accordingly it might have worked better. the ending is just a huge disappointment.<br /><br />if you've got really nothing better to do and just can't stand the boredom anymore you might (and it's really a weak "might") consider this movie. if there's anything else available to watch or do: pick that alternative.
