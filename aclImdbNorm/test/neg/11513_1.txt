with actors like depardieu and richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie. but weber is a master in setting a slow pace and making supposedly funny scenes without any wits and depth. this movie is high on story but low on character. you never get to know any of the characters except for superficial slapstick. unfortunately weber has no idea what slapstick is all about. his style could be described at hit and miss. of course some people laugh when they see someone slip on a banana peel. weber directs his humor at this lot. it is a shame how bad he uses good talent. many good french comedians have been wasted away by mediocre directors.
