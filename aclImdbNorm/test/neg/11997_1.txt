this film started off really tense when a poor young boy is set upon by a pack of savage dogs. after a tense chase he is saved by said grandpa with magic whip.<br /><br />we are then introduced to a string of annoying house mates, including one tart who is always half dressed. during this stage the film heightens tension with strange "plinky plinky" background noises that had me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />i stopped paying attention for a while but when i looked back on the screen there where weird creature type things going around grunting and killing. one word of advice if you are ever trapped in your home by some nutter - get some cardboard boxes and a tray.<br /><br />although we did skip half the film, because it was totally non interesting or memorable, we are now at the stunning conclusion, the last surviving creature thing fights a "whip duel" with grandpa and his magic whip. i wont say what happens here, but i can say the whip battle is full of tension, with aerial fights, split level fights and all manner of drama.<br /><br />i am now going to shove this film through the door of a neighbour i don't like.
