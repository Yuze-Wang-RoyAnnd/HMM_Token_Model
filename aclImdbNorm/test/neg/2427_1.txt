ok from the point of view of an american, who i assume do not know much about rugby this would be an amazing film for them.first of all its got heart, good morals the typical good coach trying to change the bad boy. however to us where i come from rugby is the number one sport, it is a way of life it is a game played only by the bravest and the victorious are hailed like heroes as though americans do for their baseball/basketball stars. am not really sure if it was the cheap budget or the maybe the director or actors knew very little about rugby and being a rugby fan my whole life i can see than some of the actors didn't even knew rugby existed before acting in this movie. in summing up to me this movie was terrible. if you watch it and thought it was great please make time to go online and maybe google "all blacks" this is new zealand's national team and the ones who made the haka famous. believe me they will make the highlands boys look like school girls.
