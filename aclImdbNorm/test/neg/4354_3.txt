i've tried to watch this film 3 or 4 times, but i just can't get past the fact that everything about it is just awful. i'm sure it was a courageous move by somebody to cast jack palance as the protagonist, but there is not one single fiber of my being that believes that he could act at all, much less act against type.<br /><br />yes, i understand that clifford odets was a brilliant author, but it's not evident here. this odd and forced mish-mash of 50's hipster dialog seems to obfuscate any genuine meaning, which explains why none of the actors, even the good ones (steiger, ida lupino, shelly winters, everett sloane) seems to know how to deliver their lines - it's as though they don't understand the meaning of what they are saying. and in the meantime, wendell corey and palance stage a terrific contest to see who can be more stone-faced.<br /><br />the direction is amateurish and completely overwrought. the physical interaction between the characters is as stilted as the dialog.<br /><br />and can we discuss that hideous set? it's so busy, ugly and contrived that it adds to the robotic, disconnected quality of the characters, the dialog and the portrayals.<br /><br />this film seems to suck the energy right out of me. it looks like everybody took an overdose of valium each morning when they arrived on the set. it takes a pretty lousy movie to make rod steiger and shelly winters look bad, but this one succeeds.<br /><br />i can see that it might have been effective as a play on or off broadway, where intellectuals and beats could have congratulated themselves for appreciating the power of the plot and the artsy flourishes of the pseudo-hip dialog.
