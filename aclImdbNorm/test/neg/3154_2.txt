ok, when i was little (and i mean like 2 or 3, not 6 and 7) barney was one of my favorite shows. i then grew out of it and threw all my old barney tapes away. so one day as i'm flipping through channels, i see that barney now takes place in a caboose, and i thought "um huh is this the right show?" once i realized it was, i freaked. why did they change the show's setting from a school to a caboose? ever since then, the show has been absolutely terrible, and the only reason i'm giving it a 2 is a) because i'm nice, b) because of riff, and c) because in the old times the show was tolerable. now i just hate it. hate it.<br /><br />2/10
