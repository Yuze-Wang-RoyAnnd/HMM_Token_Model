the only reason i gave this episode of "masters of horror" a 2 instead of a 1 is because the two lead actors are good, and it wasn't shot on vhs. the story, the dialog, and the plot are ridiculous. <br /><br />talking / driving zombies who come back to vote and sway the political tide against the war! give me a break! what next, zombies who come back to go skydiving? maybe zombies who come back to host qvc shows? <br /><br />i never supported the iraq war, but i do support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces; and "homecoming" was disrespectful in that it mocks the true horror of war. <br /><br />with zombies being mass produced in today's market... this is the spam of zombie-related entertainment. how "homecoming" made it onto "masters of horror" is beyond me.
