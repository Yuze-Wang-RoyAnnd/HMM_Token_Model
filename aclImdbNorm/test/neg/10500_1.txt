i don't normally give movies a "1." although i am a heartless critic, i try to find anything that makes the movie worthwhile (that is to say, watchable). the main thing i look for is a coherent plot. if it has that alone, i can watch it! let me start by saying, this doesn't even deserve to be called a movie, this is more like an elementary school project...gone horribly wrong! and i've seen every sci-fi movie special that was ever made.<br /><br />many times i've read professional critic reviews that say crap like "this played like a made-for-tv...(etc, etc)" and i kept saying "oh come on, i wish they'd think of a real criticism." well this is worse...much worse! this is truly the worst "thing" i've seen that's lasted the length of a movie (if i did consider it a movie it would be my new worst movie of all time), and i've seen every movie uwe boll made! this movie makes uwe boll look like francis ford coppola! :) i'd rather watch jaws the revenge all day then see this one more time...even 5 minutes of it...there was one good scene and it was the end! ;-p ok enough bashing the works of ron hall, now for the serious criticism.<br /><br />the script is poorly written, the dialog is delivered in a wooden manner, the effects are cheesier than those in a power rangers show, and don't even get me started on the screen zoom-in transitions (ugh). someone actually watched this thing, edited it, and then said, "ok release it"? i would have rather burned this than release it! in closing all i can say is "thank goodness dvd and vhs players have a stop and eject feature!" my advice...don't rent it, if you do, you'll be glad you have stop and eject too! :)
