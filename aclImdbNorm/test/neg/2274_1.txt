well, anne is way way too old. wentworth looks younger than she and he should not. louisa is much too young and too cheerful oh sister mary is way too pretty. she is supposed to be average, not pretty. when this actress complains the way mary should all i think is that she is too pretty to be a complainer. lady russell is too old. this is crazy. if you read the novel, she is anne's older more mature friend, maybe as old as annes mother would be which would be around 18-20 years older than anne- so around 50 not 70! its crazy, doesn't fit. how come anne is so darn happy in the beginning? she smiles when she says "oh the worst is over, i've seen him now the worst has passed" yeah right. ok if anyone has seen the 1995 roger michell version than you cant compare these two. that one is right on. this one is way off. read the novel and you'll know what i mean.
