in this silly symphony, a mouse from the country visits his cousin in the city. most of the short is the two mice exploring the dinner table. the animation is fine, where this short suffers is in a lack of humor. perhaps i've just seen this "dinner table adventure" in one too many tom and jerry shorts. even though this came first, i just didn't find it that enjoyable.
