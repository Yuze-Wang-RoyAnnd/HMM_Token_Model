"paranormal state" is an interesting show for most paranormal believers. i enjoy watching what the "team" has to say and what they "find", however, i know that the entire show along with it's build ups and story lines are completely set up. they go to real haunted locations and i suspect that they speak with actual witnesses. i commonly feel as i watch it that i am not watching non-fiction but an actual movie that is contradictory to reality. i personally would not advise or recommend anyone to watch this show unless you are a basic scare seeker. <br /><br />interesting show. stick to "ghost hunters"
