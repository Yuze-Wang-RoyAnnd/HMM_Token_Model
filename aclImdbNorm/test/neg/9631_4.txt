by 1971 it was becoming more and more obvious that hammer film studios were on the way out . hands of the ripper is a case in point where even the idea smacks of desperation - the spirit of jack the ripper posses his own daughter ! yeah okay no one was expecting a documentary but this plot seems to be scraping the bottom of the barrel for stupid premise and you do find yourself questioning why on earth the producers brought jack the ripper into the story . was this to give the movie a snappy title ? <br /><br />the production values are unimpressive and the cinematography gives the whole movie a cheap tvm feel but you know you're not going to be watching a classic hammer horror as soon as the title starts because the music is laughably inappropriate . i think the composer was trying to make the theme tune haunting and touching but the music resembles something out of a soppy romantic movie . i will give the cast some credit as they do take their roles seriously in what's a far from serious movie <br /><br />i didn't enjoy this film much and it instantly reminded me of the phantom raspberry blower of london town from the two ronnies which i'd been laughing at in the weeks before i saw this
