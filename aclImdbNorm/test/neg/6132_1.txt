here is a fantastic concept for a film - a series of meteors crash into a small town and the resulting alien infection is caught on a deputy's single camera dash cam as the town slowly taken over. leave it to albert pyun to screw that up! don't get within 100 feet of this flick! holy crap, what a bomb...it might be pyun's worst yet! the crazy thing is there is the germ of a creative idea in here - an entire of an outbreak told from the pov of a dashcam. when i heard that a while back, i imagined the car smashing into stuff, people getting run over, and infected types breaking the windshield and surrounding the car in chaos. that would be cool right? instead, we have the lead driving around in circles for the entire time in a wooded area, occasionally running into the three infected types who just stand there. the last bit is literally a 15 minute shot where nothing happens in front of the camera, just noises are heard offscreen. stay away!!! on a somewhat relieving note, i think i am officially calling an end to my pyun watching...only took me 20 crappy movies to realize i have better things to do.
