i was fairly lost throughout most of this film, and i am the one who usually understands the works of such enigmatic cinema greats as david lynch (twin peaks: fire walk with me) and darren aronofsky (pi). not to say that northfork doesn't make sense on some level, it just doesn't combine to form a wholly coherent film. as time passes from watching the film, its themes and intentions become clearer, but during my initial viewing, i was really confounded, and i find that this is the major fault of the film...its lack of direction. the plot centers on the town of northfork, montana in the year 1955. the town has been emptied and will soon be flooded to make way for the creation of a hydro-electric dam. the major problem is that not all of its inhabitants are willing to be evacuated and relocated. a group of men are hired to coerce the remaining residents out of the town before it will be drowned, and for the most part they succeed amidst some fairly odd situations and townspeople. simultaneously, the film tells the story of irwin, a very sick young boy (or is he a fallen angel?) whose adopted parents gave him back, due to his illness, to the northfork orphanage that they adopted him from. father harlan (nick nolte) cares for the dying irwin, but irwin imagines (or does he?!) that a group of angels (including daryl hannah and anthony edwards) have arrived in the desolate and empty town looking for a fallen angel. irwin has scars on his back and on his head, and he tries to convince the angels that his scars are where the humans amputated his wings and halo. oh yeah, and during all of this there is a strangely surreal walking animal on stilts that roams throughout the backdrop of the landscape. there are a lot of other small events that happen in the film, but none of them end up amounting to much more than momentary intrigue. one can appreciate the artistic quality of the film (it's obvious that the filmmakers cared deeply about this film) and its rich cinematography, but the film still tries too hard to be different and then gives up and whimpers to an end without making much of a statement. like i wrote earlier, it becomes clearer, long after viewing, what has possibly taken place in the film. irwin is dying, and so is northfork, and in coping with his own loss and death, irwin has most likely created characters, from ideas he gets from the objects that surround him at the orphanage, to console him as he is abandoned and his life nears its end. but then again, maybe he really is an angel, and he has found his kind and can now return home. i must emphasize that there are some truly beautiful moments in the film, heartbreaking, vivid and full of loneliness and sadness. unfortunately, the film as a whole just ends up feeling disconnected and somehow incomplete.
