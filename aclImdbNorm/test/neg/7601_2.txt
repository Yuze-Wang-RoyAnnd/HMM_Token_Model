no wonder a lot of us hate classical music; and what are the children to think? with "educational" pr like this, serious music will soon slip from life support to the morgue. kids know when they're being talked down to, and this is no exception; why can't someone good do a movie about classical music for kids? i must admit, i enjoyed the actor who played beethoven, he took to the role with enthusiasm and a keen balance of the poignant and humorous aspects of beethoven's character; he obviously did his research. otherwise, this is a third rate rehash of the old abc afterschool special format, with none of the occasional charm those short films had. sorry about the rant, but this is an important subject for young people to know about, and it could have been done well; i wonder if musicians or filmmakers were responsible? either way, the kids are hipper than you think, folks...<br /><br />medtner
