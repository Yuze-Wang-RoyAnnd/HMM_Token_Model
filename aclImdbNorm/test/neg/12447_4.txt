don't get fooled by the 'awards' and the comment below. this is just 1 poor movie. the way george katt played his character (the soft gangster) makes it very annoying to watch. the conversation in the opening scene is a dramatic display of this. de in the rest of the film the character's head seems to be somewhere else. his emotions don't match with the things that happen in the film.the things he says as a voice-over doesn't add anything to the film. it just makes zeus an even more spineless character with is head in the clouds.<br /><br />the story and the film was put together with a total lack of fantasy. all parts of the film were poorly stolen from other modern directors. let's hope jon rosten will use his own style and ideas for his future films.
