first let me say i'm not someone who usually cringe at the fact of having to think while seeing movies, i love tarkowsky movies for example, berghman is also a favorite.....but this? the positive points can be summed up easily: the photography is splendid, and the music is perfect....does it make a good movie? i used to think so, but this one is a perfect example of one that (for me) doesn't make it.... maybe it's because i'm too dumb? possible, but i don't think so.... tarkwosky for example also used very long shots, but what he never did was filming 5 minutes of the exact same image of two people walking (and i mean just their heads, because in this movie there are a lot of those shots, but sometimes it is effective), the general result is plainly boring, even with the intelligent undertones (which are done in a way that, while intelligent, is above all very pedantic)<br /><br />you also always feel that the director is making some of the long shots not for the aesthetic, or symbolic effect, but just to spare on budget....<br /><br />i'm very disappointed in this film, because i really liked the first 30 minutes or so, but it just went on and on, without even keeping the same level as in the first scenes....<br /><br />while reading the very praising comments on this page, i also get the feeling some people just try to see much more in the movie than there is to it...when a movie is slow and arty, it doesn't necessarily mean it is very profound....yes it is an allegory on musical theory placed in the context of a small town, which is quite interesting on itself, but it does not make a profound movie....except for people who absolutely want to make some sort of intellectual masturbation out of it, but then it's not what you find in the movie, but what you find in yourself....an exercise that, in my opinion can be made much more effectively while watching "stalker" or "solyaris" than werckmeister harmonies, that owes much to tarkowsky, but cab never equal it's level....
