this was on tv last night. i painfully forced my way through it, and barely made it through. first of all, except for leroy, hilary, and possibly coco, none of the other students we are supposed to care about have any discernible talent. it's like hspa had no standards, just sign on the dotted line and you're in. <br /><br />the story lines were grating and obvious. doris was just impossibly awful. the gay guy was such a thrown away clich'e (funny how that school had only one gay guy, right...) i liked the leroy character, but calling your teacher an obscenity and then vandalizing the school should have sent leroy packing. lisa looks like she'd rather be anywhere else, and since she wasn't any talent, i wonder why they kept her. <br /><br />i would have rated this one star (awful), but the music wasn't that bad, and i did like the premise. it just would have worked much better if the students had been attractive and actually had some talent.
