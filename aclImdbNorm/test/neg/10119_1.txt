first of all, i really can't understand how some people "enjoyed" this movie. it's the worst thing i have ever seen. even the actors seem to be bored...and i think that says it all!<br /><br />however, i have to give my applause to the opening credits creators - that team seems to have a really good future. that's why i recommend the big studios to watch only the opening credits, and one or two special effects sequences (if they're watched outside this movie, it almost looks like a good movie).<br /><br />better luck (or judgment) next time for the producers of this, this... this "thing!".
