the story overall, though quite graphic, is actually decent and reasonably interesting to readers. however, the movie was absolutely dreadful. the story was good, but the acting was terrible. i was crying the whole time because i knew i could never get my spent time back. don't see this movie. if you do, bring a pistol with a bullet in it, and a few bullets if you're going with friends. i feel sorry for everybody who had anything to do with this film. i also feel sorry for everybody who had to watch the film. avoid this film at all costs, and if your mother forces you to watch, kill her. hahahahaha! see! i'm a psycho now!!!! ikwtcbs turned me into a psycho!!!!
