star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning <br /><br />as a boy, mark goddard (c thomas howell) sat powerless as his family, including his hero cop father (jeff fahey), were brutally murdered by vicious criminals he'd tried to bring down. with an inner desire to punish wrong-doers festering in him as he grew up as a result of this, mark employs tough means when bringing the suspects he's chasing down in and gets into a lot of trouble with his superiors because of this. but then he learns of 'justice incorporated', a secret group of men and women lead by a mysterious man (ed lauter) who serve to dish out punishment that fits the crime outside the law.but, then things get out of hand and getting out alive might be harder than he thought.<br /><br />the sweeper gets into problems from the off-set, because we've seen this exact same plot done before (and better) in films like the star chamber with michael douglas and magnum force with clint eastwood. the title doesn't make any sense either. but we also have to contend with the movie's utter ludicrousness, including a scene where a daughter's headphone manages to drown out the sound of her family being slaughtered, a finale involving a chase with a bad guy that starts on the freeway and ends on a wright brothers plane, as well as some of the most ridiculous acting ever put on screen and a very clich'ed, pretentious script. but there's some cool action sequences here and there and the movie's unintentional laughs factor certainly keeps it alive with a pulse. **
