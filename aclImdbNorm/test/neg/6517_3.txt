this film is about the encounters of 7 couples on hampstead heath in one sunny wednesday afternoon.<br /><br />it shows 7 different types of couples: married, divorced, breaking up a relationship, homosexual, elderly, blind date and escort service. they are not connected to each other apart from the geographical location, so that is a disappointment. the film is a collage of conversations, without any discernible plot. the film jumps from a pair to another without any logic. i find this film boring and purposeless. the only redeeming feature is the great weather throughout the film. it is sad that talents like ewan mcgregor and sophie okonedo get wasted by this film.
