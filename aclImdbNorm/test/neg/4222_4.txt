if you really loved gwtw, you will find quite disappointing the story. those who may think this is just about a romantic story and the south, will be probably satisfied with this decent tv production (altought i consider an important miscast the choice for scarlett). but, let me say that considering the novel, nothing good could came out of this.<br /><br />i've read gwtw more than 20 times and i can really appreciate the adaptation mrs. mitchell did for the film. it took me some time to understand how good the ending was: scarlett knew for sure she was going to recover rhett, since she always got what she wanted. but there was no kiss in the end.<br /><br />then alexandra ripley came to "fix" this by showing us exactly how perfect and mighty scarlett could be, and of course, describing in detail how exactly she gets rhett back even when she had an important affair with someone else (nothing could have been further from mrs. mitchell mind, i am sure).<br /><br />the story between these points is in my opinion just a long and boring ride made up to tie ends, showing off costumes and scenarios just to give us an obvious and totally unnecessary ending.<br /><br />if margaret mitchell could came to live again, she would die one more time at the very moment she'd find out what scarlett became after gwtw.<br /><br />sure it's not fair to compare this to the original but this is not gwtw fault. isn't it? is it any good if i don't compare it to the original? maybe. sorry to say i don't really care.<br /><br />i would expect little more compromise to continue someone else's (suberb) work, otherwise don't even try.
