it is terrible! it is like somebody gave a kid a faulty video camera and $30 and told them to make a film. even then you'd get a better and more professional film than this. the story is so dumb you can say there isn't one. i don't think the guy who made this knew what to do at all -- watching foreign art movies all day long isn't enough to make somebody an instant director. the acting is very bad, really kindergarten level and the writing is just plain awful. the only scene i didn't hate was the one with the caravan accident but even that only means it was just slightly less horrible than the rest of the film. how do people get finance for this stuff? i don't mind alternative films but shouldn't they at least not be a big steaming pile of cow manure? i would call 'price of milk' amateurish if it wasn't an insult to amateurs. this would not even be a good film if you were drunk or drugged!
