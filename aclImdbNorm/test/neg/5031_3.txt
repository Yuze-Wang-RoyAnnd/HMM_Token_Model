i was not making big assumptions on the fact that this for sure was a very, very free adaptation from the work of eca de queiroz, and i must say that this free adaptation form the book as a lot of possible good ideas and characters. the problem is the way that is done, without any care, without any taste, just a rumble of bad taste clich'es everywhere. the script is so fake and the characters so unreal that's makes petty seeing nice actors as unas, bryner, morgado, lagarto and others, lost themselves in a net of whatever except cinema or storytelling. for my surprise the newcomers jorge corrula and soraia chaves bravely stick in their performances, but you can see them lost like a drifted boat without any direction. and talking about direction, this seems to be something totally missing on this movie
