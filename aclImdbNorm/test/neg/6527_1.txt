let's get one thing straight; this was bad! so putrid that it doesn't even qualify to be imprinted on anyone's memories.<br /><br />the ever repeating storyline (who's constant recycling of not only jokes but story lines and character appearances.) a typical storyline goes as follows; sue (the mother) opens the episode quoting on how she loves her baby son but smells awful (as if that doesn't get old! har-de-bloody-har!), some australian quasi-nationalist "bogan" -look it up- appears to say how she thinks she's awesome because she's an ozzie while everything/everyone else that isn't sucks before disappearing for the rest of the episode. (a small mercy)<br /><br />the rest of the plot revolves around the father (gary) getting in some kind of disagreement with sue and him talking to members of his band for advice on how to sort it out.<br /><br />the phrase "words fail me" is an old one but this is where it is the most truthful thing to say. it is so incredibly bad! so horrible, that i would like every trace of it's existence sent to the lowest depths of the north sea and life can go on.<br /><br />it saddens me though, to see someone as good as sally bretton (good actress, i like her) make a prat out of herself, ardal o hanlon (my hero aside) has the ability to be pretty funny - but not here - and ben elton, distinguished for so much good stuff somehow manages to come up with this...thing then comedy is in very serious trouble!
