i watched this movie with my boyfriend, an avid hip-hop fan and he was really really looking forward to catch the "soul" vibe the movie claimed to have. boy, we were dead wrong. when i finished watching the movie i felt two things: remorse and relief. remorse because i regretted wasting my time to watch this awful piece of dung, and relief because i watched it free on cable.<br /><br />this movie really really gives a bad name to black people, by putting so much awful stereotypes that i believe all smart black people everywhere has been trying to spell off. i'm asian, and i feel very very sorry and sick for those who made this movie. what more to say? bad writing, even worse acting, and horrible storyline.<br /><br />even if you're bored to death and has no other choice, don't watch this movie. seriously. the movie really has nothing to offer, except if you want to see things like minor illegal drinking, animal slain, women degradation, and overall: a really really bad-obnoxious-sickening-awful movie. yuck.
