why do people make bad movies? didn't anyone working on the picture know that what they were making had no point? there is something about this picture that threw me off, besides the fact that i found this "movie" to be unrealistic, pathetic, and poorly acted. i admire them for the try, but the "actors" in the movie at times seem to be trying to hard and no single character has substance or says anything mildly intelligent. this movie deserves zero stars. but i did not have that option, so it gets a 1.
