worse than mediocre thriller about an abused wife who goes on the lam after she is linked circumstantially to the death of her husband and sister. determined to prove that her husband is alive she follows leads across the state, her peril increasing at each stop. chasing after her are the traditional 'good-cop' and 'bad-cop' pair of partners. one is convinced of her innocence the other more interested in closing the case and getting home. this pair is often able to corner their suspect but never quite to capture her. all the main players meet up in a remote town in the desert and the truth begins to unfold with deadly consequences for some.<br /><br />wow! this was a bad movie. the lead acted as if she was tranquilized, the cops couldn't find a suspect if he or she is in the police station (this happens twice) and everyone else is as one-dimensional as can be. avoid this one at all costs.<br /><br />
