i've seen every episode, and the characters have all remained the same self absorbed whinny little brats thought out, there's no character development in 5 years (getting pregnant is not development if your still the same daddies girl, only now delinda whines to danny because dad isn't around) sam never changes or grows, which makes her boring, repetitive and just so annoying its sickening after season 3, danny is a typical soft character that gets ordered about by everyone in his life, (he has no principals morals of his own) especially mary and delinda. the old boring clich'e will they wont they on and off relationship does get boring very fast indeed.<br /><br />james cann can act and his character is ok to watch, only he is just another hack writers wet dream, an ex cia man that has huge contacts and training etc so he can stop any thief or cheater known to man, even though the cameras cant do half the stuff they make out its fun for a while, however in 5 years the writers act very dumb, why? because they have all this expensive and advanced technology, but no simple walkie talkie (communicating is fast and easy) you never see security walking the floor, only when there's a situation, and suddenly everyone is just there.<br /><br />the plots very quickly move from the cheating and robbing the casino in one way or another, to awful typical american boy girl relation ships, the same done to death material seen all over the world, they have sex, but i hate you, i've always loved you, i think i do but i love her/him instead, but what if, maybe one day blah blah blah.<br /><br />i'd recommend ''hotel babylon'' to people who like las vegas, it has so much more going for it simply because the characters are interesting engaging and not forced down our throat for 6 months of the year.<br /><br />i'm glad to be british
