i love most movies and i'm a big fan of sean bean so i thought that i would at least like this movie. also, i'm canadian and this is a mostly-canadian movie so i was prepared to cut it some serious slack. nothing could have prepared me for the garbage that is "airborne". steve guttenberg as an action hero? give me a break. the acting throughout the movie was so bad i am going to have trouble sleeping tonight. i now have only two wishes in my life.<br /><br />1. i hope that you never have to sit through this movie. 2. i wish i could get those 6 hours back. oh wait, the movie's under 2 hours - it only seemed like 6 hours...<br /><br />don't watch this. seriously.
