silver city (2+ outta 5 stars) as a huge fan of john sayles' work for many years now i feel safe in saying that this is the worst movie he has ever done. that said, the movie isn't exactly *terrible*... just very uninspired. sayles throws in familiar elements from his previous movies (corrupt politics, illegal immigration, the selling out of youthful ideals) but fails to bring them together in any new or meaningful way. even the dialogue (usually sayles' strong point) is disappointing this time around.. sounding clich'ed and forced in almost every scene. the movie looks and sounds like episodes from a tv series that didn't make it past its third episode. there are tons of big stars on hand... and they try their best to make their bit parts come alive... but the material just isn't there this time around. while filming a campaign spot a governor-hopeful (a poor and obvious george w bush stand-in) fishes a dead body out of a lake. an investigator is hired to try and warn away people who may have deliberately set this up to discredit the candidate... but he soon finds out that there are deeper and darker (and more clich'ed) secrets to be discovered. sayles has made similarly-themed movies so much better in the past ("lone star", "matewan", "return of the secaucus seven", "men with guns"). it's a shame that he went to the well one time too many and came up with tainted water. one good line, delivered by richard dreyfuss: "danny, you're a loser. that's already been established beyond doubt. so just try and be a good one, okay?"
