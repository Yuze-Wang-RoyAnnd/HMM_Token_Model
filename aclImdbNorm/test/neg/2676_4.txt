"curse of michael myers" is a very frustrating piece to deal with for a fan of the halloween series. after a very disappointing letdown in halloween 5, the series reached a near ebb in plot lines, with a silly devolution into witchcraft and a teenage cult dedicated to the worship of michael myers. "curse of michael myers" ups the ante in blood and gore, but really represents a decay in the series' integrity. it's too bad to, as this is the last movie for donald pleasance as the character of dr. loomis. pleasance has some good screen moments (precious ones if your a fan of the series) as the now very aged and as he says "very retired doctor". sadly he died before the movie was completed, and it is very apparent at the conclusion of the film that the stories original climatic scene was never realized. right from the beginning credits, halloween 6 has more of the feel of a made-for-tv movie then that of the block-buster horror flick that it started out as in 1978. any loyal halloween alumni should have demanded more from this film,... dr. loomis and donald pleasance deserved more.
