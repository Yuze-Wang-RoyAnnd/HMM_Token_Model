i only wish there was a grade lower than f to give it! i scored it a 1 in the vote tally.i am grading this not even as a regular film,but as a t&a film,and this is the worst,lamest,crappiest and most awful movie i've seen.the acting,story and music are all terrible,not to mention there isn't even any nudity for the t&a connisuer.it's about a male cheerleader and the viewer is made to sit through many painful scenes of him doing cheers.avoid this piece of trash at all cost! this is the worst of bad 80's teen cinema.
