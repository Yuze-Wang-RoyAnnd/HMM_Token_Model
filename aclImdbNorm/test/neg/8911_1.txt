stephen seagal plays the role of a dude who gets talked into driving an armored car for a bank hold up and drives into everything that comes across his path. however, the police seem to appear on the scene very quickly and seagal smells a rat who gave the police advanced notice. the story gets into many twists and turns and the money from the hold up has disappeared and nobody knows its new owner. poor seagal gets a bit framed into this hold up and naturally he is out looking for the person or persons who are trying to put him away for a long time. in this film, seagal tries to be a good guy but the forces of evil are against him. unfortunately, this is not a great film and rather boring and too long.
