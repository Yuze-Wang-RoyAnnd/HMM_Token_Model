as a scot i find the idea of "macbeth" shifted in time and space to america totally moronic.i am sure this doesn't apply to broadminded imdb users,but why are so many americans unable to relate to any film concept that isn't set in their country ? this attitude does americans no favours in the big wide world out here.<br /><br />it was bad enough that "the wicker man" was remade and set in the usa ,totaly stripped of its cultural context, and with a polticaly correct gender change for a leading character.<br /><br />one wonders what next,robert the bruce as a new york cop ?,mary queen of scots as a "soccer mom" juggling ,kids ,a career and relationships ?<br /><br />come on hollywood, open up to all the other cultures on the planet!
