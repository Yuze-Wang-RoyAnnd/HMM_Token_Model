the other day i showed my boyfriend a great movie, stand by me, a movie i have shown to many people and they absolutely adored it, but for some odd reason he didn't like it. he lends me a movie called backdraft and he tells me that he's shown it to many people and they loved it, instead i hated this movie. i don't think i've hated a movie so much in a while, how this movie has even a 6.6 rating is beyond me. i couldn't keep up with the five million stories here: billy baldwin becoming a fire man, the random sibling rivalry, the random love story(s), the who's being an arson story, the investigator, the fire who has a personality of it's own. i just have a problem that this movie can't keep up with all these stories, they didn't balance out well enough make the film interesting. i would have just preferred if this movie was about being a firefighter or the investigator and how he came to be one or what it is exactly he does and why.<br /><br />the movie tells the story of a group of chicago firefighters, two brothers. stephen "bull" mccaffrey, the elder brother, is obsessed with the beating of the fires that he fights. brian, the younger brother quit the fire fighting academy school several years before, then embarking on a number of other unsuccessful careers before returning to become a firefighter. he is looked down on by his elder brother who expects him to fail in his newly chosen career as a fire fighter. donald "shadow" rimgale is an arson investigator who is dedicated to his profession. he is called in because a number of fires that have occurred have somewhat similar connections. .martin swayzak is an alderman on the city council. he has obvious hopes of being elected to mayor, but has had to make a number of budget cuts to the fire department. many of the rank and file firemen believe that the cuts that he has made are endangering the lives of the firefighters. however, swayzak is initially successful in portraying the fire department as bloated and ineffectual after firemen are repeatedly being killed in blazes.<br /><br />i just couldn't get into this movie, i don't know how anyone else could, it was incredibly unrealistic and portrayed firefighters all wrong. i loved how they had every action clich'e in the book to match this action flick. i just felt also like there was great talent wasted on such mediocre roles, donald sutherland, great actor, but such a strange role that could have been taken by a lesser known man who had the upcoming talent at the time. i know ron was going for great quality, but i think him casting such huge actors in small roles was a mistake for this film. i even had to joke my way through while watching this movie commenting how the doctor in the background was probably kevin spacey. the fire was so unrealistic and the movie was just so out there, i didn't enjoy it and honestly wouldn't recommend it to people, i'll stick to the recommendations in my relationship from this point on.<br /><br />2/10
