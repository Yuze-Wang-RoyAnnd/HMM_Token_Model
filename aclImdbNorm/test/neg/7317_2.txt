this is a typical college comedy and its very average. the story is ok but not very entertaining. its about a unlucky guy named reno who looses his job, gets his car ripped off and then his uncle dies in a stripbar. his got a girlfriend though (a nice one btw. :-). anyway this uncle gives him his mansion in la and mercedes as heritage and soon reno and his girlfriend moves to la to this new house. the problem is that they would need some roommates in order to pay the high rent for this house and so the film unfolds... <br /><br />the movie starts ok and has a few funny jokes here and there, but the suddenly the movie takes a turn straight down to hell... the ending is bad. really bad. it destroys everything about the movie. you will know what i'm talking about when you see the movie...<br /><br />2/10
