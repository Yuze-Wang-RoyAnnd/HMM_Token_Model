don't waste your time or money on going to see or even renting it. it is by far the worst move i have ever seen. its two hours (way too long) of your life you're never getting back. if you're looking to be scared, go see something else. we went with someone who still has nightmares about the gremlins and she wasn't scared in the least.<br /><br />there are so many things that make this movie an incredibly poor attempt at making money. now before i begin, let me say that i loved the first grudge! however the second one is something of a different story. the plot is very in-depth and intricate. however in the end you are wondering "what the heck was this or that all about." the acting would be considered poor in a b list pornography film. i could site several examples but i don't want to spoil it for those that are glutens for punishment, but i can sum up two horrible hours in two simple words.... it's spreading.
