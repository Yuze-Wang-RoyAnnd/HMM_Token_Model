most of the comments on this movie are positive so i thought i would try and redress the balance. i came out of this movie wondering what was going on. i now know and still consider it to be a poor movie. i intially discounted a dream sequence as that seemed too obvious. i was glad that i had a free ticket to the movie or i would have asked for my money back. movie reviewers and critics love this movie, which only confirms to me that most of them would rather sound intelligent than review how an audience may enjoy a film. the 8+ rating this movie has is so misleading. in 20 years time this film will not compare to true greats such as the godfather. the film does have fine performances from both the leads but that isn't enough to save the film. (nor are the lesbian scenes!)
