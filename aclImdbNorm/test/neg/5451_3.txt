i wish it were "last dumb thriller". but thrillers are like that. they are like children: numerous, illogical, and often annoying. they want so desperately to be taken seriously but what is there to take seriously about a child's behaviour or a thriller's plot? having seen this particular child - i mean... thriller - i understand why reviewers refer to it as "a hitchcockian thriller"; they might as well have called it "idiotic" for that's what "hitchcockian" means in the movie dictionary (look it up, if you don't believe me). even the soundtrack is old-school hollywood which is a mistake: it doesn't fit a late 70s film and makes it look phony. besides, how dare they steal de palma's idea of stealing from hitchcock?! the story is absurd. scheider's wife is killed, and her killers are never an issue. instead, first his former employers follow him around, and later decide to kill him. why do they decide to kill him? no explanation. perhaps because the fbi is a dark, dark organization ("x-files") which is very trigger-happy about knocking off its former employees for pension-funds reasons. or perhaps because it's fashionable to want to kill scheider in this movie; everyone seems to be after him. and while the poor unsuspecting viewer is trying to figure out the mystery by logically assuming that there is a major conspiracy, in reality the killer is... janet margolin! yes, the woman occupying scheider's living quarters; the one that briefly hinted she was "depraved". why does she go after scheider at precisely a time when his wife was murdered and he is feeling paranoid - and followed by his own ex-employers - and not a few years earlier or few years after the wife's murder? a pure hitchcockian (look it up again in the dictionary, in case you forgot what it means) coincidence. and how about that brilliant motive of hers...! her grandmother was forced into prostitution when she was a fresh-off-the-boat 15 year-old virgin in ny, and then syphilisized by a bunch of horny jewish men, one of whom - tah-dah! - is scheider's grandfather. as a result, margolin has been playing a hooker in her spare time (among other things) in order to kill off all the descendants of the men who so cruelly syphilisized her once-virginal grandmother. how hitchcockian (look it up) is that? the finale then shamelessly rips off the mount rushmore scene from "north by northwest", except that the love-interest is a killer and she doesn't get saved.<br /><br />the movie also offers some dubious/off-kilter dialog and some not-so great acting. check out the silly and obvious way in which napier follows scheider at the cemetery. let's also not forget the moronic plot-device of napier reaching for his jacket and holding his hand very suspiciously - but it wasn't a gun! how brilliant! napier in the tower: now, there's another string of illogical behavioural patterns. j. demme was, is, and always will be a director without style, without flair, and the man who directed "philadelphia". let's give him another oscar!
