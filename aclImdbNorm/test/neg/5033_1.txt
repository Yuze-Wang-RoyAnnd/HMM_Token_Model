i turned this off within the first five minutes. it's very sick and disturbing, the moment i turned this off was when the beautiful white horse was let into the slaughterhouse and it's skull was punctured by a small tubed instrument. this creature was lying on the floor in a state of shock before it died. the narrator said the animal dies instantaneously, it didn't. i don't agree with graphic realism towards animals, insects or any living creature. i was very disappointed as i had just watched 'eyes without a face' which was a brilliant movie and this short film was attached, which spoilt my night - as i couldn't hurt a fly, never mind watching this savage documentary.<br /><br />reading other reviews on this page, i had noticed they used words such as aesthetic - this is not art or beauty. i can imagine that the documentary would be very articulate and profound but not aesthetic.
