absolutely one of the worst movies i've ever seen! "the beginning" was not the greatest either but better than this one. this is not a good way to lead up to the original movie. it's just simply awful! the cgi hyenas were so fake looking in both movies! why not use real animals? i enjoyed the old sinbad movies better than this. i was royally disappointed! the only good thing i can say about this waste of film is the cinematography and clothes which really captured that era well. i understand why this movie was redone as "the beginning". it's just that bad, in my opinion. where does the money come from to waste like this? give me a multi-million dollar budget and i'll show you how it should be done!
