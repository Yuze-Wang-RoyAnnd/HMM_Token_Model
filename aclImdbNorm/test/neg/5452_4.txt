aalcc informs us that 14-year-olds can be pretty obnoxious and vicious. to those who don't know that, the film performs a public service. otherwise, it's a lot of flashy videography with little or no reason for being. i will allow that the camera-work is sometimes striking, but also that it can be madly self-indulgent at other times. the actors occupy screen space and screen time, but do not compute as compelling human beings. i suppose the e-mail that flashes across the screen throughout means that you have to figure out which character has which moniker, but i simply couldn't tell enough differences to do so, and really didn't care anyway.
