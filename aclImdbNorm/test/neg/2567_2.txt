dr steven segal saves the world from a deadly virus outbreak. this movie strikes me as foolish earnestness that has morphed into an unintended camp classic (the best kind). memorable lines include "knowledge is like a deer. chase it, and it will run away from you" and "drink this. it will make you feel better." it is so sublimely bad -- they couldn't have made it any worse if they tried.<br /><br />segal tries to convince you that he is 1. sensitive -- by saving a stricken pony; 2. a good father -- by a saccharine cooking scene for his daughter; 3. a man of science -- by looking at a fake spectrum; 4. in tune with nature -- by using homeopathic remedies; 5. politically correct and multicultural -- by having indian friends; 6. an iconoclast -- by opening a rural practice after a former life in a national research lab; and 7. an action hero -- by being really fat but yet can still fight. rotfl.<br /><br />it's good to see on as a late-night saturday flick, with friends, preferably (but not necessarily!) inebriated.
