i love his martial arts style, it is quick, close up and oh so fast, but it seems like his movies are becoming more and more crime based lifestyle quality and less meaning...i thought he was out to bring forth a deeper message. at least some of the movies had a hidden meaning or agenda this one had some good redeeming qualities of the character but the rest was so far off. i was very disappointed. the martial arts is also suffering. i am hoping to see a more devoted segal in his future films. this movie also lacks in keeping the story line going, there are too many gaps so the thought is lost. too many things are cryptic without a solution.
