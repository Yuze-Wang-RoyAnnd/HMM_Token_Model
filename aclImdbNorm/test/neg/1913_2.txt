i rented this movie the other day b/c i love romance stories, but this has got to be the worst one i have ever seen in my life. i find it hard to believe that sam would fall in love with kelley after they've said hardly no more than 2 words to each other when she has a great long-time boyfriend who's devoted to her completely. i thought kelley was a major jerk throughout the movie, and he never changed at all. the only good thing about the movie was josh hartnett. i thought he did a wonderful acting job, and i'm going to start watching more movies of his.
