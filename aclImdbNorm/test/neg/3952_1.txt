a group of young adults open a plain of escape for the spirit of elizabeth bathory when they recite her poem from a video game supposedly representing a s'eance. the only one who dies in the game is miller(adam goldberg)who also is found dead the same way he perished in said video game. while the others' characters didn't die in the video game, their reciting her poem has instead unleashed the video game into reality with walking cgi characters stalking and killing each of them, one by one. they must follow certain methods using a mirror and nails to defeat bathory and save their skin.<br /><br />if this premise sound stupid, that's because it is. the characters are ho-hum rejects from bad wb television shows, this time allowed to spout profanity. this flick follows the slasher rules, but doesn't show much violence or gore. it stays pg-13 safe with most of the death taking place off-screen. there's a scene where the true hero and heroine are running from video game characters pursuing them. yes, it's that bad. nothing at all to recommend. good-looking cast including sophia bush as the appropriately named october.
