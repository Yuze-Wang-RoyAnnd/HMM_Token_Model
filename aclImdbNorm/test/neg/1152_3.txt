i had never heard of this film until it came to dvd. i was immediately intrigued by everything about it: the actors, the title, the cover, and especially the author. arthur miller, you can't go wrong with him, can you? yep. i haven't read the novel, but i'm going to guess it was a lot better than the film. i had high hopes for this movie. i love macy and dern, and it looked interesting. unfortunately, this film never really rises above cookie-cutter messages about racism and bigotry. if you've never seen any other films that deal with this subject, or if you never knew that america was founded on bigotry, then maybe this film will wow you. others will probably find it predictable, stale, and overall bland.
