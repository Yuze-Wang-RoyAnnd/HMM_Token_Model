i have to ask myself, do movies like this get their support by people associated with the movie itself coming here and critiquing it? how can something so awful score this high? my parents went to see a lot of the more adult themed movies when we were kids, anything with an r in it until we were old enough. i only remember two films that had them saying yech! when they got home. this one, and "catch-22".<br /><br />the movie is comprised of bumbling physicians and staff in a filthy hospital, rambling narratives, and a pack of inner city people (who look like rejects from a 1970s norman lear sitcom) staging a protest. the worst part is the "murder mystery", a crazy old guy doing "god's work" by killing doctors and others. when he confesses, scott and his girlfriend show little emotion. they only care about him getting out of there where he will "be safe and happy". a doctor that drops dead of a heart attack is faked as the man so he can get away. oh, my, what a fun movie.<br /><br />this movie didn't "make me think", chuckle, or have any other feeling other than "it must get better", but it never does. people wonder why it was a failure, no wonder here. i wonder how imdb has enough members that think this movie is good. yech.
