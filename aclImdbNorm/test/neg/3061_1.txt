is this movie as bad as some claim? in my opinion, yes it is. i wasn't going to comment, noting that quite a few comments have already been made, ranging from 'awful' to -not nearly so bad...'. however, i can't resist.<br /><br />what do you make of a movie that has, on the dvd cover. the phrase "the real story of "ma barker and her boys...", and the standard "any similarity to actual persons..." disclaimer in the credits? i'm not naive, but in this case, it's a pretty relevant observation regarding this movie.<br /><br />several comments knock the performances. they are pretty awful, roberts, russell, milano and stallone have something like 315 movies and tv shows listed between them. they can act, or at least perform.<br /><br />however...the dialog is not to my taste, and quite unintentionally funny at times. the story arcs didn't seem to be anything but the barest minimum required to string specific scenes of violence and melodrama together.<br /><br />direction and screen writing has to be faulted: amyrillis giggles after seeing ma barker's violent temper and finishes with "take the girl!"?????. what ever you think of alyssa's acting abilities...some screenwriter wrote that line or reaction, and/or some director shot it, and said, 'ok, that's good enough, no need to retake that, that's credible...' one footnote: i did pick up my copy for $1.99 or $2.99 in a grocery story discount bin; the running time is shown as 91 mins, and i note that the running time is listed on imdb as 95 mins. i don't know what 4 minutes i'm missing, but i acknowledge that if those 4 minutes were of the right sort of person in the right sort of situation, my rating might soar to 3 or 4 out of 10. as i saw it, 1 / 10 is what i must vote.
