my original comment on this particular title was deleted, by a imdb user or the staff, only because i just happen to dislike this film to the point i had to sincerely write what i felt after seeing this poor excuse for a film. where's my freedom of word?<br /><br />obviously this movie was made by students, 'cos so lame and amateurish it felt. of course even they have to start from somewhere? the script was incoherent mess and so was the acting. with low budget and b- class actors, what can you expect? there's some cgi in places, so poor, it looks like done with an old pc. some may say, this is sort of an "alien" clone, only this time it's dracula (in a vintage costume) who's sucking the other cast dry, one by one. the sets are unconvincing, cheap and small (boiler rooms), although the story takes place in a large space craft. <br /><br />it would be fun to know what the stars (erika eleniak, casper van dien, coolio and udo kier) thought about the film after it was released... coolio must be the worst rapper turned actor ever!<br /><br />it was a total waste of my time and money, don't know why i even bothered to rent this flick. honestly, i just hate this film. with uwe boll's house of the dead, dracula 3000 shares the questionable honor of being the worst movie ever. (well, i've seen even worse than these two)<br /><br />avoid! any other film will do better.
