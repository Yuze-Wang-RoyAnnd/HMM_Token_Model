awful! awful! awful! drab, unimaginative, predictable - and with all the usual suspects. exactly the sort of film the irish film industry shouldn't be making. and with the added bonus of a treacle-coated ending. a sickening example of how talent & originality is by-passed in favour of an almost aggressive mediocrity. yes - the children are sweet. yes - it almost looks like it's done professionally. but this is film making by numbers, a direct smash and grab on what the director obviously thinks is 'success' - a film which patronises and despises the audience. it's quite amazing that working title would pour lb3m into this rubbish. but then, they paid for love actually. don't waste your money.
