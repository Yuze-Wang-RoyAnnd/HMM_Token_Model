*criticism does mention spoilers*<br /><br />i rarely make user comments, but this is one movie i have no problem slandering. this movie stinks, and its mediocre of rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such pulp. the bone collector is not at all the same calibre of film that silence of the lambs or seven were, despite what its ad claims. this is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller. the pace of this movie was extremely slow- i actually left for about 10 minutes half-way through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression (i refer to you the part where angelina jolie's character debates denzel about cutting off a corpse' hands). the movie is not at all scary, but tries to compensate this with a love-subplot albeit sexy angelina jolie's character and denzel washington's. of course, what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor-student relationship as seen in the brillian epic silence of the lambs with hannibal lecter and starling, however, even this lacks all effectiveness and i was personally routing for the villain to kill denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two. with such a crappy movie, i was half-expecting a plot-twist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit- things that mediocre movies like arlington road and scream pulled off. anybody with a 4th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved ( a situation which mimicks alfred hitchcock's rear window). the cliche of having the killer explain his motives was uninspired enough, but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid it had me spewing latte over the screen. esoterically speaking, i even think the murderer's intention was completely lost as denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial 'chess game' and gets with his pet project, angelina.<br /><br />if you are a fan of movies with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts (like i am), you will not appreciate this film. if you have not attended a single movie in your life and would like to catch-up on every single hollywood cliche ever borne (the late-night knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer, the ridiculous serial-killer to prime investigator relationship, the horrible 'woman trying to get by in an all-male dominated workforce aka sotl) , see this movie....but even then its too slow-paced and you'd be bored.
