i don't know how expensive was the creation of this movie but the effects were awful. half of the movie was filmed on stage in front of a movie canvas (that's sure that blue box wouldn't look so artificial). when they traveled on a boat, the background canvas was moved imitating the movement of waves but the characters weren't moving. the cgi effects: terrible (i am not sure but i guess the effect were created with paint and made a gif sequence of them - next time the creators should hire a professional cgi maker team). it looks like the cgi creator would have drawn on the picture strip with shaky hands. awful, that's sure. when i first saw the trailer, i thought it was created in 1983. one of my friend told me the correct date: 2005. my jaw dropped, i was so shocked, i thought he was kidding. people, i recommend you to skip this movie, the story is also twisted, you won't enjoy it.
