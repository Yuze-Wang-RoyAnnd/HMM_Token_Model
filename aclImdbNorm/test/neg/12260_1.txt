i don't understand why this movie was released, it looked like something that you show your mates after you borrowed your mums handycam she bought in 1987. i am australian and work for a video store in the uk and thought that if an aussie film made it into our store it can't be all bad... boy was i wrong!<br /><br />if anyone writes a good comment about this movie they are either lying or the makers of the film.<br /><br />the picture was bad, the sound was horrible and the acting, oh the acting, it was the worst acting in the history of film. <br /><br />it makes me embarrassed and offended that they used the word 'aussie' in the title because i am proud to be australian and this movie is seen in other countries and may give people the wrong idea.<br /><br />please anyone who reads this and has seen this movie, take the time to find other aussie movies to watch because you could choose any one of them and it would be better than that one.<br /><br />i could have made a better film if i took a camera, filmed my but for an hour, ate the film waited for it to pass through my body then threw what came out at the television... no offence.<br /><br />do not watch this film!!!!!!!!!!
