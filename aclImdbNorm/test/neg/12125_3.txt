ok, so i know better than to watch movies on scifi . . . er, sorry . . . syfy. or shifafa. or whatever it is now. so sue me. i spent my whole saturday doing advisory-board brainstorming for a nonprofit. i can be forgiven for flopping into my armchair and wanting to watch some movie i'd never seen, rather than read proust in the original or learn how to play the oud.<br /><br />which is to say, i didn't deserve open graves. of which i saw none, incidentally. were there any? did i fall asleep? why is it called this?<br /><br />some icky visuals. not many scares. as with too many films in modern horror films, no reasons are given--apart from shared humanity--to care about any of these people. half a point, though, for the legless entrepreneur, who was clich'ed but did have one good scene.<br /><br />it all sort of plays like final destination delivered via a board game. the game does have an intriguing look to it, and it involves one of my favorite old conundrums. i'll give it that much. the drawback there is that the game possessed more personality than most of the characters.<br /><br />as for the end, if you didn't see it coming, then i think you fell asleep. somewhere back around the dawn of the genre.
