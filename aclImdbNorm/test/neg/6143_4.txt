one: your screen will be filled with beautiful effects and colours. these do nothing for the story, but they will keep your lazy eyes occupied for some 50 minutes. a good example is the eternal use of a computer screen that shows each fingerprint from the database as that print is compared with the one they want to find out about. yeah, right.<br /><br />two: these guys being like real professional pros, they will engage each other in intriguing pro talk: "look, grissom, these are what we call fingerprints. everybody has them, and they are different on each person. so, with these fingerprints we can actually find...".<br /><br />yup! exactly like real pros would talk to each other if there wasn't a completely uninformed and stupid audience around.<br /><br />however, not everything about this show is bad. some stories work to some degree, and the colours _are_ really beautiful. they use red, blue, green, yellow... all of them colours i've loved since kindergarten.
