the threesome of bill boyd, robert armstrong, and james gleason play coney island carnys vying for the hand of ginger rogers, a working gal who sells salt water taffy. with the outbreak of world war i, the threesome enlist and pursue ginger from afar. the first half of this rko pathe production is hard going, with the three male leads chewing up the scenery with overcooked one-liners and 'snappy' dialogue that quickly grows tiresome. the second half concentrates on action sequences as the us navy pursues both a german merchant cruiser and a u-boat. these sequences are lively and well-filmed, but overall this is an overlong and unsatisfying comedy-drama with a flat ending. for fans of the stars only.
