i don't understand how some people can stand playing "half-life: counter-strike" when there are so many better first-person shooting games available.<br /><br />"counter-strike" is a game that doesn't use any imaginative ideas in its weaponry. all the weapons in the game are real-life weapons, but there could have been at least a cheat that allowed players to have access to a "supernatural" weapon, like the all-powerful bfg in the quake & doom games.<br /><br />another problem is that the player actually has to reload the weapon manually. this can become extremely annoying, especially while in the middle of a firefight when you are so close to killing the enemy. the reloading delay also gives the feeling that the gun is slow at performing its task.<br /><br />there are not many choices of characters to choose from. if i remember correctly, there are 4 types of characters each for the terrorist and counter-terrorist forces. this means that many of the characters look the same as each other, which really brings down the game's realism.<br /><br />the game is pretty sexist when it comes to character selections. in the early version of counter-strike, there was a woman available to choose (in the terrorist force selection) which was good for the female gamers. in the latest versions, however, the female character was deleted and replaced with another male character. i wonder if the women who played the game were disappointed at the newer versions.<br /><br />finally, the maps in the game are very small. the biggest map seems to be the desert map, but it has standard detail. in fact, all the maps in the game have standard graphics. in other words, nothing new.<br /><br />to sum up, i think "half-life: counter-strike" is the most un-imaginative first-person shooting game of all time. there are plenty of better & more imaginative shooting games to play, so why waste your time on this boring game? you're better off playing the unreal tournament, quake, and doom games. avoid this over-rated & over-hyped game.<br /><br />i give the game a 1/10.
