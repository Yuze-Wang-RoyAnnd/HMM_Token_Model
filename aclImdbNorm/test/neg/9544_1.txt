i wouldn't recommend this to anyone, except cinema-goers who like to laugh at a film, not with it.<br /><br />quite a promising premise and set of actors get progressively worse over a film which ends with perhaps the worst ending ever seen in a film. i won't spoil it, but basically the most over-used set of movie cliches get done badly and half heartedly for the most disappointing last five minutes to any film, ever.<br /><br />the movie also includes the most cringe inducing scene ever, the attempt at on-screen chemistry between the two lead roles when we're presented with a close up of angela jolie stroking denzel washington's finger lovingly. it may be the only thing he could move, but quite why the viewer is treated to a zoom of washington's finger getting stroked amidst the kind of dimmed lights and music appropriate for a sex scene is beyond me. i laughed out loud and shook my head.<br /><br />the direction of the storyline borrows heavily from se7en, but here it is executed far more simplistically, and far too obviously. to call it a poor-mans se7en would be an understatement, this really is nothing more than a made for tv movie and even jolie and washington's best efforts can't convince that this is a box office film.
