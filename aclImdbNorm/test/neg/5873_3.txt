i bought this movie at a thrift store. months before, my friend told me about it when we were talking about dumb movies we've seen. once i spotted the cassette, i knew i had to have it. i watched it that night. i could tell it was going to be very cheesy and cheaply done. . . that's what drew me to it. i popped it in and i laughed the whole way through. i recognized gregory (the ice cream man), but i didn't recognize his name and i couldn't remember where i saw him. later, while watching the andy griffith show, clint howard (ice cream man) was featured as an extra since he is ron howard (opie taylor)'s brother. i saw the credits and i gasped. i turned to my mom, who was also watching the show, and said, "that's the ice cream man!!" she, too, gasped. this movie is great, but only for laughs and criticalness. it is the perfect example of a cheesy horror flick. if you feel like laughing as well as poking fun at low-budget movies, rent this video.
