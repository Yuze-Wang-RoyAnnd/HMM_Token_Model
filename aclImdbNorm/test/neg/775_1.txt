this is absolutely beyond question the worst movie i have ever seen. it is so bad in fact that i plan on renting it again as soon as i can find it. this movie makes 'plan 9 from outer space' look like an oscar contender. just looking at the actors makes me want to laugh out loud. i cannot say enough bad things about this movie. it's awfulness aproaches perfection.<br /><br />the plot is based on a terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon in san francisco (i think). that's as far as i can go ... i am laughing too hard. i know it shouldn't be funny but ..... *lolololololololol*<br /><br />move over ed wood !!!<br /><br />regard's *dato*
