i love a good western movie, but this was more like watching a play on stage or an act at the local street carnival show. i could only stand 38 minutes of it in hopes that it would improve, but it only got worse and i had to end it. each actor(s) stated the lines as if reading directly from the script or cue cards. there was too much predictability to the lines and actions not as if a natural occurrence or conversation. the wig on rachel kimsey was obvious. the actresses playing native american sisters, could have played non-native parts and should have. wardrobe for the native americans could have been better and a little more authentic looking. if i decide to watch it with any friends in the future, i will do so, not with the expectations of watching a good western, but with the expectations of watching an amateur comedy film production.
