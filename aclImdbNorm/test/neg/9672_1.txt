just when i thought nothing could be as offensive and/or irritating as a billy mays infomercial, i had the intellectually shattering experience of renting this piece of garbage. peter barnes and john irvin should be brought up on criminal charges for smuggling this script into the public venue. the actors need to be charged as accomplices, serving no less than a lifetime away from the public eye.<br /><br />this production offers the disclaimer, "for dramatic effect, we have taken poetic license with certain facts", or some such inadequate statement to fully brace you for the absolute repugnant rewrite of a bible story which needed no drama added. what they did add was enough to make your i.q. drop three full points for every five minutes of viewing time.<br /><br />the "poetic license" taken, invents characters so bizarre, you'll recognize nothing but the names of a few, and, of course, the ark.<br /><br />for some reason, noah and lot are both living in sodom, so maybe abram was vacationing in switzerland on a skiing trip. lot's wife, played by carol kane, is a harpy, and when she's turned to a pillar of salt, lot breaks off her finger and carries it around in what appears to be an empty baby food jar. if that's "poetic", i'm a kumquat.<br /><br />when noah - who has now begun drinking wine in quantities that could help float the ark - whines about the tough job of the building project, he awakens one morning to find that god has delivered enough precut lumber to lighten his burden. at least i think it was god. it looked like a delivery from 84 lumber, neatly stacked and bundled. maybe 84 lumber is really an agent for god????? rather than bore you with the cargo being loaded, i'll regale you with the account of the pirate attack on the ark. incongruous, you think? this movie is filled with such insulting nonsense. after an untold time on the waters, noah spies a pirate ship heading right for them. and who might the salty sea-captain be? well, duh, it's lot, of course! my only surprise was that his uncle abram wasn't aboard. if you're going to slaughter a plot line, slaughter all of it. the piracy attempt is unsuccessful, and the swashbuckling was pathetic, not poetic. i think it was around this mark that my nausea prevented me from punishing myself anymore.<br /><br />an ugly, senseless, moronic distortion of anything remotely resembling a bible account. on a scale of 1 - 10, this movie is premeditated mind abuse. stupid and insulting, you'll be more entertained by reading the yellow pages.
