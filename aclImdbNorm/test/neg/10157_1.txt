there are a whole lot of movies, primarily from the 80s, that are so terrible that you can't help but love them. the last slumber party is one of those. i hate this movie so much, but it still remains one of the most watched movies in my collection. i have watched it countless times and get a huge laugh out of it every time. it is the prime example of how in the 80s, any movie could get released.<br /><br />our killers name is maniac randles. (scary, huh?) randles is an escaped psychopathic killer running around in doctor's scrubs and a doctor's jacket hacking off people with a scalpel as he goes along. he ends up coming across a house of girls that are having a slumber party. one of the girls is the daughter of the doctor that tried to operate on randle's, and randle's ended up pulling him down in some kind of sexual position. (lol just watch the movie to know what i am talking about.) now i know what you must be thinking at this point: this must be another cheesy low budget hack and slash flick like slumber party massacre, or valentine's day massacre, right? no! this movie is horrible! first off, the quality of the film changes off and on throughout the film. sometimes it will look like it could have been filmed this year, but other times it is so grainy and blurry that it isn't even watchable. the funny thing is that certain specific camera angles will be blurry and grainy, and other specific camera angles will be clear and perfect, which is absolutely ridiculous and proves that they did not care at all.<br /><br />the director played the killer (as if that wasn't funny enough) but because of the fact that he wasn't talented enough to act and direct at the same time, he just filmed one shot of him walking toward the camera with his scalpel, and then just replayed that clip over and over every time someone is killed.<br /><br />the characters in this movie are completely ridiculous and unlikable, and these people who are suppose to be ages 16-18 look more like they are 25-45. i know that slasher films commonly use adults as teenagers, but i have never seen a movie where it was this obvious. my guess is that the reason none of them are still in the film industry today is because they have all died of old age... or maybe it was just because this movie was so horrible that they never wanted to show their faces again, and that is a good thing because i highly doubt that they could have gotten into any more movies even if they tried. all i can do is hope that tyler will one day make the last slumber party 2: the final conflict and have all of the original actors return. i'm sure everyone would love that.<br /><br />the movie was directed by stephen tyler, (no, not the singer) who never went on to direct again, and it was released by b&s (which i am sure stands for bull and ****) productions. bull&s only released one more film, "forever evil," which was pretty awful, but not near as bad as last slumber party.<br /><br />a horrible, horrible, horrible film... highly recommended.
