lois weber's film "hypocrites" was and still kind of is a very bold and daring film. i enjoyed it and was very impressed by the filming and story of it. the priest sees the hypocrisy of the people in his church and tries to show them the "naked" truth. the people are appalled when he reveals the naked statue portraying truth, after failing to lead them to it and the few that did, help along the way. the people do not want to face the truth that they are doing anything wrong, but it shows them putting things before god, going to beach parties acting inappropriate, their materialistic ways, and other things in which the people of our world do that tend to not be morally right. in the end, failing to gain any followers, he must enter into the gates of heaven alone. this film seems to me to be very bold, in the fact that a naked woman is shown throughout it, especially considering the time period in which this film was made. the imagery and symbolism portrayed in this movie i found incredible. the way they made the naked woman translucent and using a naked woman to symbolize the naked truth shows a lot of creativity and art. showing the different sins of the people as they walked down the road and refused to follow along the path, each with different excuses, setbacks, and/or higher priorities, was a great way of representing the people of today. this film does a very good job of getting the moral message across to its audience. lois weber has a tremendous way of capturing her spectators' attention with her creativity, symbolism, visuals, and through auditory. even the music of the piano throughout this film is very beautiful and fitting with the whole theme.
