this is one of those "family" movies that i can't imagine having much appeal to anyone over about 9. a group of siblings discovers a "sand fairy" (yes, really) conveniently located at the end of a not-so-secret passage at the country home of their eccentric uncle, to which they've been evacuated from the london blitz. ...and there you have it, all in one sentence. the story is about the role of magic in childhood and the danger of getting wishes fulfilled, but neither of these issues is examined in a way that would be interesting to adults or instructive to children (or vice versa!). the only reason i can think of for watching this is to see how starkly freddie highmore's outstanding talent stands out from the rest of the mediocre performances.
