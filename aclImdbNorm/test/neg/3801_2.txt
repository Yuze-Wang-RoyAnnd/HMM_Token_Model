sequels, well there are many reasons to make 'em but what went through irwin allen's mind to come up with such a boring idea is beyond all logical matters. there are so many open answers to this movie that it is ridiculous...like the poseidon which is a monstruous ship with passengers on is drifting on the sea and just michael caine with his miniboat and an evil telly savalas discover the boat...well, at the beginning the french marine are circling above the wreck with their helicopter but as a sinking cruiseship is a daily thing, they just fly away... what am i trying to say??? hmmm, michael caine goes on board with sally field and he might pick up everything he sees (diamonds)if there wasn't a telly savalas who is looking for weapons on the ship...my god, why in fact am i wasting my words on here? it's ridiculous and knowing that both field and caine were involved makes you think what went through their minds when reading scripts....certainly not diamonds....
