some of the greatest and most loved horror movies have a wicked sense of humour, but when a film comes along that isn't as original as the "classics" but just goes at it for laughs then a bunch of po-faced, wanna-be critics completely slag it off. this film made me laugh aloud several times, this is testament to the way this film was approached and it shows. the two main leads look natural and believable together and this really helps this film. you root for them the whole way and laugh along with them, everyone has friends like both of these guys. another highlight for me was the monster truck, it's awesome, intimidating and really well shot. taking inspiration (completely stealing) from loads of films, the most obvious being duel, jeepers creepers and probably in reference to the jack black alike co-star orange county. but really you can pick any road trip gone wrong movie and find a reference here. but so what, it's not trying to win any oscars just give the viewer a good dose of frights and laughs and on that score it's a 10! obviously it's not getting a 10, i give real sensible reviews and scores unlike 99% of the people on imdb. there is no-way this movie can get a zero like so many lazy idiots give to too many films and as fun as it was it ain't getting a 10 either. it's just a good fun movie for anyone with a sense of humour and a liking for scares. you really can't get anymore simple than that.
