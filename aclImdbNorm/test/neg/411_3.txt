an extremely fast paced,exhilarating, interesting, detail rich book. its a huge shame that the film had none of these qualities. not only was tom hanks' mild mannered portrayal or robert langdon laughable, but the name changes to key characters, huge deviances from the original story line, and poor irish/italian accent from carmalengo played by ewan mcgregor, made for the worst book to film ever.<br /><br />as a huge fan of a&d the book, i had high hopes for a more lavish, true to book detailed movie, where it would start and finish just as the book did - leaving me wanting more.<br /><br />all the film really did was depress me within the 1st 10 minutes.<br /><br />what was impressive was how the... sorry! i couldn't even finish that sentence without laughing.<br /><br />in short - vittoria was the token hottie, a very second to audrey tatou and there were some very nice alfa romeos.<br /><br />i would recommend reading the book to understand that, if ron howard must insist on making another book to film, i would be happy saving my lb6.40 for a kfc zinger meal and some chicken wings - far more entertaining and deeply more satisfying!
