this film is much the same as cannibal holocaust. if it weren't for the needless animal killing in the name of 'shock' ("ooh look at us, we're hardcore, we've added real death to our films") these films would make their way onto my dusty classics shelf - i'm a huge fan of cannibal films and zombies. but as it stands, it's another example of shock horror clutching at the last straws of the pile in a desperate effort to make a poor film generate more hype. to sum up, a crusty gore flick with limited appeal. a fan of 70's gore should give this a try, but anyone with modern ethics and tastes should pick something a little better written for their popcorn-fest.
