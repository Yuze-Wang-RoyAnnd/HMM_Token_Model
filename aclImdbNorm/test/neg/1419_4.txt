saw this movie at a saturday matin'ee with a friend. theater was about 70% full.<br /><br />although there are quite a few funny lines, it is more of a drama/suspense with humor sprinkled on top. robin williams gives a decent performance as does laura linney. being a daily show fan, lewis black is pretty good in this. christopher walken gives a good performance also. <br /><br />the movie starts out slow and remains that way for about the first thirty minutes, then the suspense part kicks in and starts keeping you a little on edge throughout the rest of the movie. suspense in a supposed comedy movie? i know that i, as well as everybody else in the place, was struggling a bit with this. a character would crack a joke during suspense sequence and you would hear just one or two laughs in the theater. <br /><br />in all fairness, after the movie was over there was smattering of applause. so, definitely, some people enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />i gave this movie a four out of ten, because i believe the comedy aspect doesn't work very well in a suspense/drama movie and the actors performances, while not bad, were just decent. <br /><br />again, this movie isn't what was advertised.
