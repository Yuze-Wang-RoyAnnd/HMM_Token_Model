i absolutely hated this movie. even though the movie wanted to transmit some kind of social message, it was done in such a clich'e ridden and melodramatic way like a mexican soap opera.<br /><br />also the acting was terrible especially charityn and her son. that's one of the problems with dominican movies, they use celebrities that can't even act just to attract the masses. <br /><br />i'm even more ashamed about the positive reviews here which sadly means dominicans are just being condescending to what's done here instead of giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry base itself on quality.
