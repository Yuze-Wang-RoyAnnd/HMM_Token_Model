i though that it was hard, if not impossible, to watch, and not because of the horrors it depicts but by the way they were depicted. imagine what costa gavras could have done with this true horror story. what i object to is the idea the need to denounce, which i subscribe to, is enough. what about showing it to us with the power of powerful cinema. i feel that the eagerness of the filmmaker, maybe even the justifiable anger, didn't allow him to see it clearly from a cinematic point of view. or, if this was a cinematic point of view, i mean, a choice, then, i didn't like it at all. i was more disturbed by the way the movie was shot than by the movie itself. well intentioned i'm sure, but, unfortunately, that's not nearly enough.
