this film is truly pathetic in every conceivable department. awful, awful, awful. it's only around eighty minutes long, but believe me you'll feel like you're watching an andy warhol film (then again twenty hours in the life of the empire state building would surely be far more interesting).<br /><br />where to start... the putrid script, the disgusting cinematography, the so bad its bad acting, the spectacularly dismal effects, dreadful music, or just the wafer thin plot that thouroughly resembles a sieve. this film is an incoherent shambles<br /><br />a particularly noteworthy scene takes place outside a cafe when dominic pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue the waitress watching through the cafe window who comments with an average english accent "god damn". to right that woman. god damn this horrendous monstrosity.<br /><br />everyone involved should be thouroughly ashamed of themselves. let us hope that the director never finds the funding to work again.
