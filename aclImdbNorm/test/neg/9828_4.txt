the lavish production values that you generally find in a merchant/ivory film are all here, but this is an exceedingly dull take on what could have been a very lively affair. i agree with an earlier poster that it makes no sense for the story to be unfolding through the eyes of an african american family and yet their own ancestor, sally hemmings, has barely a role to play in the proceedings. there is not much clarity to be found in helping the audience understand the motivations of any of these historical figures. and i was very bothered by the accents of a number of the characters. nancy marchand sounded very british for what one assumes is a french nun. and both gwyneth paltrow and greta scacchi seemed to be trying out different accents in various scenes. in fact, gwyneth is very poorly served in this biopic. her role as thomas jefferson's daughter, martha, is written in such a manner that we never get a handle on who she really is. one moment she is slapping a slave, and another moment, she's deploring the whole system of slavery. nick nolte performs the role well enough but doesn't ever make us truly care for jefferson or any of his exploits. very disappointing all in all.
