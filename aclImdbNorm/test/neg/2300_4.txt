the murder of the red comyn in grayfriars abbey was a long way from one of the most horrendous things ever done in the scottish war of independence and fights (and killing) in churches wasn't unusual at all. not that much later robert bruces wife, daughter, two of his sisters were captured during a fight in a church in which people were killed. and comparing it to the massacre of berwick in which the english slaughtered at least 8000 non-combatants (some, yes, in churches) is ridiculous.<br /><br />that said this is not a well-made movie. it is slightly antidote to the absolutely ridiculous sniveling representation of robert bruce in braveheart. whatever bruce was, it wasn't a wuss.<br /><br />too bad that they didn't do a better job of this because someone should make a really good movie of a war that is so amazing that it sounds like something someone made up going from complete defeat at the battle of methven to a secret return from hiding to a long guerrilla war to bannockburn. this isn't it though. poorly made and to a large extent poorly written and acted. too bad!
