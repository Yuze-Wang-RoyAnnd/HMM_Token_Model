oh my. started out with such great potential - a bunch of cute sorority girls walking around practically naked, check. then off to a bar where the 80's cheese gets turned up a notch, check. off to a woodsy state park the next morning, check. a bunch of girls and their professor, rowdy bikers, a general store guy, and that dood from they live acting as the local drunk - makes for a nice body count, check (and speaking of body count, notice the strong resemblance on the dvd cover to the foreign horror flick - body count! aka camping del terrore). a whacky indian in the woods doing some sort of ritual, hmmm, ok i'll let it slide, check. and then, oh brother, all downhill from there. terrible. the lochness monster head in the pond had me cracking up though.
