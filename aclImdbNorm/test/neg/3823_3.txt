some of the reviewers of this film were extremely "generous" with praise. i personally was disappointed, because due to those reviews, i was optimistic as the opening credits began to roll.<br /><br />the all-too familiar story line goes like this: deformed boy and his father live out in louisiana swamp. local boys ridicule and torment him. local boys start gruesome's, oh sorry, i mean victor crowley's cabin on fire with him in it. dad attempts to rescue his son, formerly known as eddie munster meets the elephant man, but accidentally puts a hatchet through the kid's head instead. victor becomes a murderous ghost who hunts down unfortunates who enter his domain. oooo... scary.<br /><br />one thing i appreciated about hatchet was that it never took itself seriously and some of the gags even made me laugh. the thing is, i've grown tired of the hollywood-polished, b-horror slap-sticks. i like to laugh and i enjoy a good scare, but this film didn't deliver a solid dose of either. as for crowley being the next michael, jason, or freddy... pumpkinhead has a better chance.
