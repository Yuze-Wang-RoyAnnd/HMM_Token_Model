being a huge laura gemser fan, i picked this up at a rental outlet just to see another emanuelle film. boy, did i make a mistake!<br /><br />emanuelle in egypt has nothing to do with emanuelle. laura gemser is in it along with her husband gabriele tinti, but that is the only connection to emanuelle. here, laura plays "laura" (original, huh?) a beautiful supermodel who goes to visit her wealthy friend pia (annie belle) in egypt. in tow are her a**hole photographer carlo (a haggard-looking gabriele tinti) and some blonde woman who is never named. also living in pia's mansion is horatio (the sexy but dumb al cliver), a mystique who speaks nothing but nonsense. arriving for the weekend are pia's two daughters, one a short-haired lesbian and the other a brunette. lots of sex is implied, but hardly shown. one good-looking actor plays ali, the egyptian servant, who gets lucky with three of the women in the mansion. laura has sex with the lesbian, the lesbian has sex with horatio, pia and the blonde have sex with horatio at an egyptian orgy, laura drinks goats' blood and is possessed during an egyptian ceremony, carlo rapes laura. it all happens with so little flair that emanuelle in egypt is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. far from erotic, even the actors themselves look bored during their sex scenes.<br /><br />considering there were two famous couples in this film (laura and gabriele & al and annie), the number of available sex scenes are uncountable. instead, a film that offers a top-notch eurocult cast and never delivers the goods will piss every viewer off, except the hardcore laura gemser completist. otherwise, steer clear of emanuelle in egypt!
