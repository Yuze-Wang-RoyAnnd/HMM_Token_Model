i decided to watch this movie because it has been noted as the "scariest movie ever" so, that's what i expected. unfortunately, what i found out is that the movie didn't have a single scary moment in it (and i'm the kind of person who jumps very easily). the movie was nothing but terrible clich'es and every time there was a jump-moment it was incredibly obvious. the pros of this movie would be the music and the odd scene thats actually shot well (like the very last scene when she opens the door and you see tun in the reflection and when it swings back to him you see the ghost on his shoulders). overall, this movie really added nothing new to the j-horror genre and all-around lacked creativity and scares.
