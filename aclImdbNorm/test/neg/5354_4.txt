a time to kill is based on john grisham's first novel, the one he wrote before he was famous, and the one that didn't skyrocket him to fame. (that would be accomplished by "the firm"). that's why this movie didn't get made until much later, after grisham was off churning out meaningless books with the movie dollar signs fresh in his head. unlike most of those, this book was actually about something. it had meat, it had weight, and it had heart.<br /><br />but it also had a fatal flaw, and this fatal flaw gets translated into the movie. namely, "a time to kill" sets you up.<br /><br />here we have a black man (jackson), on trial for the murder of two white men who brutally raped and tortured his 10-year-old daughter. we have an underdog lawyer (mcconaughey) battling the big bad system to save his client. and oh, by the way, the whole thing is set against the backdrop of racism in mississippi, complete with hooded kkk men burning crosses.<br /><br />in other words, we're supposed to sympathize with carl lee hailey. we're supposed to believe that a father who loves his daughter is justified in killing the men who raped her. we're supposed to feel the injustice of a system where a racist all-white jury could judge a black man who was just trying to avenge a brutal crime. we're supposed feel like we're standing alongside the people chanting "free carl lee".<br /><br />but the racism issue is a smokescreen, and the whole thing is contrived. carl lee hailey was a vigilante. yes, there were mitigating circumstances for what he did, but the fact remains that he wasn't innocent. this would have been true no matter what his skin colour, or the skin colour of the assailants of his daughter, the judge, the jury, or anyone else.<br /><br />and what's so heavy-handed about this film is that it paints anyone who believes carl lee should have been convicted is a racist. the message seems to be that if you believe that the law shouldn't be taken into people's own hands, then you might as well be burning crosses on a lawn somewhere wearing a hood.<br /><br />this isn't the first time a heavy dose of sentimentalism is inserted into a story like this, and it won't be the last. as a movie, a time to kill stays pretty faithful to the book, and the acting isn't half bad. but it played the hand it had been dealt, really. even a good cast can't elevate bad source material.
