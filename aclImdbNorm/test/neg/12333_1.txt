the worst movie i have ever seen. the sound quality was bad, the cutting of the scenes was even worse and above all it was not logic and it had no speed...<br /><br />i first tought: "oh no, i don't want the trail that proves that poor patrick was an innocent killer". but this turned out to be even worse. typically in this american film you get a super-hint or no hints at all. i want very tiny small hints that direct you to the killer. the audience isn't involved. and now, when i don't get any hints at all, you can expect a several 's/he-is-the-killer' sweeps in the end. and that is not all. ah... this is hopeless, lets make an end to it...<br /><br />in one word: disgusting..<br /><br />
