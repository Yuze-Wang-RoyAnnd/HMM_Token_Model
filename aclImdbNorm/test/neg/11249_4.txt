barbershop 2: back in business wasn't as good as it's original but was just as funny. the movie itself lacked little things which the original held which made it much more enjoyable. back in business seemed to be just another worthless sequel made to bring in money with a very thin plot. cedric the entertainer's terrible excuses for flashbacks ruined the movie and seemed to be a bad way to try and get the audience to adapt more with the character. overall barbershop 2: back in business was a sequel not needed, without the originals charm, soul & spark.
