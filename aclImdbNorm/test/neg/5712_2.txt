this is high-gloss soft-porn; a boring soap opera concentrating on one thing: sex. they actually made sex boring, sad to say, because i defy you to watch this casually and tell me what the storyline was. what this is, is an excuse for kim bassinger to show off her great body and for mickey rourke to smirk a lot. that's it. rourke's smugness is so bad it's sickening and bassinger, despite the great figure, looks cheap more than beautiful.<br /><br />kudos to the photographer for some nice closeup shots and some wonderful color, but the story is so weak - no character development and no plot - it's unable to compensate. let's face it: this movie was made for only reason - to titillate male viewers. on that level, it probably succeeded. if i recall, it's why i gave it a look being a fan of bassinger's looks, but i actually expected a story, too.<br /><br />those trying to pass this off as "arty" and something deeper than soft porn are only fooling themselves.
