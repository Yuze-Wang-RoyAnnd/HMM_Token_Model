john travolta reprises his role as chili palmer, hollywood gangster, who now turns his eye to the music business. using his "negotiation skills," he tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend, played by uma thurman, and try to get his young singer (christina milian) a hit record.<br /><br />before i saw this sequel, i had heard that it was a terrible film. however, be cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it's not as good as the original. the movie focuses on the music industry this time around instead of the movie industry. the music business is portrayed very poorly in the movie and they use a bunch of lame stereotypes. i can't tell if this was the intention or not since get shorty did a nice job of spoofing the movie industry. the same can't be said for the sequel and the attempts just come as lazy.<br /><br />an impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking. the best performance is given by the rock and it's nice to see him in a different type of role. vince vaughn also gives a funny performance though he started to get annoying before the end. surprisingly, uma thurman gives an average performance and i was expecting more from her. john travolta returns as chili and he does an okay job. his performance is kind of dull though. christina milian gives a horrible performance and she's also not that good of a singer. cedric the entertainer gives a good performance though he isn't in the film for very long. there are also a bunch of cameos including steven tyler and james wood.<br /><br />f. gary gray directs and he does a poor job. he just doesn't handle the film very well and the movie is kind of a mess. there was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile. also at 118 minutes, the film is too long and there are a lot of slow spots. the film needed to be edited badly and it clearly wasn't. fortunately for the film, the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and they deliver some funny scenes. sometimes, the film tried too hard while other times it was actually pretty funny. compared to the original, the sequel doesn't measure up well. however, be cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy. in the end, be cool is worth a rental and that's it. rating 6/10
