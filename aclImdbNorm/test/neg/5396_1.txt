skeleton man was okay for the first 5 minutes but as soon as the so-called "special force agents" hit the screen, it went down hill faster than a fat kid on a sled.<br /><br />the opening makes us think we might have a corny, yet fun, horror flick on our hands but no...the film makers ruin any hope of that when the "special force agents" show up. i wish the screenwriter took a different route and had the "skeleton man" chase down some dim witted teenagers until one of them finally gets the upper hand. instead, the "skeleton man" chases down some dim witted "special force agents" and offs them until their captain finally gets the upper hand.<br /><br />i know the whole "stalking of dim witted teenagers by a killer" thing as been done before but it would of been more suited for a movie like this.<br /><br />when the "skeleton man" finally does meet his "so called" demise, in a building that blows up, the captain of the "special force agents" is asked the following by a police officer outside of the building: "what the hell happened in there?" my answer to that question: "who the hell cares?"
