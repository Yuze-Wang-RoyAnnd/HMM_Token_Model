this certainly isn't a comedy - i don't know what it was marketed that way. as a serious movie, it lacks any sort of substance. unless you're fresh out of sunday school or needing your noah fix, you'll find yourself bored to tears.<br /><br />the supporting cast took away from what little of the movie was left. lauren graham plays an empty housewife with no real depth. his children don't really add anything to the movie. they seem to be around solely to brood about their absent father at the beginning. jonah hill plays a creepy internet addict that doesn't come off as humorous. <br /><br />i found the original to be a decent movie. disappointed that this one didn't really go anywhere.
