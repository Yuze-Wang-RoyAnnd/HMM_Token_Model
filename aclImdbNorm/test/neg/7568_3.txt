i like j-horror, anime and even kinda dig the pink movement, which some have claimed this a member of, but this did nothing for me. i willing to go a step further and label this one of the biggest let downs of my film watching career.<br /><br />three young rockabillies go around getting their kicks out of raping girls. one of the group starts to develop a concisions about their pass-time when his kid sister nearly catches them in the act. invariably, the group turns on itself as the once friends begin fighting with each other. it ends on a down note befitting the film as a whole.<br /><br />aside from watching the friends yell at each other, which they do a lot, there isn't a whole lot going on here. the film is littered with long continual shots that only exacerbate the issue. on top of that, even when the film starts to do something interesting, it suddenly gets bogged down in ethereal philosophy that never makes any sense. for instance, after one of the buddies has his change of heart about assaulting girls, he goes out and does it again, but then stops his buddies from taking their turns. huh? the cinematography is slow and lighting is poor. the writing is ok, as is the acting, which makes this a sub-par cinematic effort from the start. mix the lack of technical prowess with the flimsy content and you have nothing more than a waste of time.<br /><br />oh, and one more extra note, at least one of the girls that appears in the buff does not look old enough to be doing that kinda stuff.<br /><br />3/10
