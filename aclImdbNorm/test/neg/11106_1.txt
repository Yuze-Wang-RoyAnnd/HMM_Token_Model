horrible script, which was apparently directed by...no one? the marines can't fend off the monster with machine guns, however it backs off when a 15 year old girl karate kicks it in the face a few times. it's supposed to be a luxury liner, but the fancy dining room looks like a cafeteria in a hospital. it appears that they rented a high school for the summer, and pulled out chairs and stuff to decorate the set with. in the end shot, they are pulled from the water and into a boat and less than 3 seconds later they are apparently about two miles from the ship as it sinks.how do movies like this get made? i guess anyone can be in a film these days. aaron james, nyc
