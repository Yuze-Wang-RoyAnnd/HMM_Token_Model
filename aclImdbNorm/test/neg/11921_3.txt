started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters. in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all. the scenes between the bakery owner and the assistant were nice but the rest was just very slow. it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film. the characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce. by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didn't care what happened next and so i switched off. glad i didn't pay to see it. didn't laugh or even smile once. there seems to be a strange tendency for americans to classify their films as 'comedy' when they are funny peculiar rather than funny ha ha. i have finally learned to avoid what americans term dark comedies which usually turn out to be gruesome weird and unfunny. now it looks like i will have to be a bit more discerning when they call a film romantic comedy as well. maybe comedy means something different when applied to a film rather than a series in america. i don't understand why america can produce amazingly funny comedies like two and a half men, will and grace, king of queens but can't seem to produce really funny films without resorting to toilet humour. this film wasn't gross or anything. but it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...
