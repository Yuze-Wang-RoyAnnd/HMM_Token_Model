shopping, sunny skies, beaches, boarding school for rich teenagers and perfectly happy endings. welcome to the life of zoey brooks and her friends. zoey brooks is portrayed by jamie lynn spears, the self proclaimed actress who got her claim to fame by being the younger sister of the international pop star britney spears. with her lovely blond wig in the first season and an attempt at hiding her monotonous country accent, it's confirmed that nickelodeon has indeed gone to the dogs with nepotism. when kristin herrera, the actress who portrayed dana cruz in the first season, left the show, all hope vanquished as she was the only decent actress. the female casting is a complete disgrace but the male casting has potential for a teenage media. if they continue to pursue jamie lynn spears as the picture of perfection, very many people will have to lower their standards. with hope, they will soon find that you can't make a career out of nothing. jamie lynn spears is useless for acting, singing and anything else she attempts for that downward spiral she calls a career. there is no wondering why she is a self-proclaimed actress. critics would most definitely proclaim her as something other than that.
