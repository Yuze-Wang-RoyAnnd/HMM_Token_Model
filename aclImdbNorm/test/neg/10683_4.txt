i was all ready to hate this but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerable - though the mtv-style of film-making (shot on dv, to boot) is quite an eye-sore! i liked the script's self-mocking style, as well as its central idea of having the female vampire lead doubling as a contract killer. as to the cast, eileen daly (best known as the 'star' of those horrid "redemption" intros) has an undeniable screen presence - and is quite sensual, despite her age; however, christopher adamson's hammy chief villain is obnoxious. david warbeck has a brief role as a doctor (dubbed "the horror-movie man"!) who conducts the autopsy on one of the vampire's victims; the film seems to have taken quite a long time to shoot as warbeck died in 1997! there's plenty of nudity and violence on hand, but not much sense alas (especially since its subplot involving a secret society of vampires infiltrating the power structures is barely developed); the film is also overlong for its purpose, and eventually slips into tedium during the last half-hour.
