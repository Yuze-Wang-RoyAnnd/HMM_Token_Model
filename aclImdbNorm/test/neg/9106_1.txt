seriously, this film is not. steve guttenburg is constantly forcing his tough-guy dialogue and then giving everyone the evil-eye all the time. he just wasn't believable, he seems like he's trying to be a badass and he sucks at it. i just remember him as the millionaire dad with the olsen twins in it takes two...so, this is a big change. i rented this film for sean bean, and he dies (as usual). only this time he didn't get impaled on a boat anchor (patriot games), smashed by a giant satellite dish (goldeneye), or get run over by cows(the field). he just got shot, real quick-like and civil, and that was all i got from this film that they didn't kill him off in an extremely grotesque and morbid way. how sad is that? i was only watching it for the 3 seconds that sean was in it, and then the rest was rubbish. i actually tried to watch and understand the plot, but there really wasn't one. seemed a little like mission impossible with the hole,"oooooo! there's a mole! it's the leader of the group, and no one expected it! let's trap him! let's frame the underdog good-guy so we can get away with it!" cliched and tired, this movie was a waste of time.
