if you see the title "2069 a sex odyssey" in the video store, beware!! the cover has tori wells and three other "80's" porn stars, and has a copyright of 1986. if you're like me (and i hope you're not) you'll think "80's porn? tori wells? alright!" trickery!! it was made in 1974 and has dubbed german stars! there's nothing inherently wrong with 70's german porn, but it's not my cup of tea, and it's nothing like what the cover leads you to believe you're getting. once i got past my rage about the blatantly misleading jacket, i watched it anyway. it's a bad, bad movie. sorry, i guess i didn't really get past the rage.
