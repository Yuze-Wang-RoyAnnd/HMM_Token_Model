both killjoy 1 and killjoy 2 stunk, but the first was better. the special effects in this movie were not special at all. even though the killings were better in this installment, they were not anything to brag about. one thing that was worse in part 2 were the characters. they changed emotions suddenly, and some of their lines were just dumb. for instance one character quoted, " you better have some r.e.s.p.e.c.t. or you'll find out what is means to me." once i heard that line i figured it was of the worst i've ever heard. another thing that i hated about this movie was the fact it was too short. a successful movie has to go more than one hour and twenty minutes, like killjoy 2. if full moon makes part 3 of killjoy, that would be stooping to the lowest level they can possibly go. overall, 1 of 10.<br /><br />
