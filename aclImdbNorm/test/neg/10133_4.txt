describing this film is a difficult task. on the one hand, it's an over-the-top vampire spookfest, complete with cobwebs, eerie music, a hypnotic medallion, and of course a coffin with a creaky lid.<br /><br />on the other hand, this is one of the silliest scripts this side of edward d. wood, jr. produced by the same people who gave us "the bloody vampire," "invasion of the vampires," and this film's predecessor, the modestly-titled "the vampire," the movie sticks close to the lack of logic that characterizes the other films.<br /><br />as i mentioned, this film is a sequel to "the vampire," which i have not seen. but no matter...it's real easy to imagine what happened. dr. enrique, played by abel "the brainiac" salazar, is befuddled when the well-intentioned but misguided dr. marion brings back the staked body of his vampiric enemy, count karol de lavud (i suppose there is a rule somewhere that all vampires must be counts of some sort). dr. marion complains that all important doctors throughout history have had to resort to some sort of grave robbing in order to advance their medical studies, and he hopes to use the vampire's corpse to study such phenomena as the vampire's lack of a normal reflection (at which point he holds a mirror up to the vampire and instead of no reflection, we see the vampire's skeleton. ???).<br /><br />enrique is not pleased, and seems determined to pass off the events of the first film as mere fantasy and superstition. "this man was no vampire...i'll admit that he liked to drink a little blood, but that's all!" he states. also confusing matters is the fragile martha, a part-time nurse and part-time showgirl (!) who happens to be enrique's object of affection. martha narrowly escaped de lavud's clutches in the first film, and apparently enrique has spent a great deal of time "healing her mind" and getting her to think that everything that she experienced was not real.<br /><br />ok, so if you were the scriptwriter for this film, you would need a way to get someone dumb enough to pull the stake out of the vampire, right? well, how about the greedy con man who helped marion steal the coffin? after getting a glimpse de lavud's body, he sets his sights on the expensive-looking brooch that the count is wearing, and he conveniently returns to steal it when the doctors aren't looking. but darn it...he can't remove the brooch because of the stake, so...you guessed it. de lavud is on the loose again, this time with the shady con as his human henchman.<br /><br />ok, so of course the vampire is after martha again, and meanwhile the doctors are really confused about what they believe. at first they are determined to prove that there is no such thing as a real vampire, then by the end of the film they are trying to get the police to put an all-points bulletin out for "a man who is dead but still alive!".<br /><br />you can probably imagine the rest of the plot from here, but the filmmakers do throw in a few pleasing twists. one of the sets for the movie is a spooky wax museum (is there any other kind in these types of films?), complete with a fully-equipped torture chamber...with real torture and execution equipment. the movie has a very keen sense of style, and not just in the campy cobwebs. one effectively creepy sequence has de lavud chasing a victim down a seemingly endless series of streets and alleyways, following their progress alongside vague buildings with no doors while lighting the scene like a german expressionist nightmare ("the cabinet of dr. caligari" seems to be an influence).<br /><br />but the rest of the film is juvenile, particularly in the film's climax. the special effects are quite crude, even for the year that this was made, and the climactic fight with de lavud in bat form is laughable enough...but the director feels the need to ask us to believe that martha would faint and collapse directly over top of a guillotine, positioned so that her head was in the perfect location to be chopped off by the blade, which is in danger of falling because the restraining rope has suddenly begun to fray right at that very minute! what an unfortunate coincidence! to make matters worse, he cuts away from the fraying rope to scenes of enrique trying to dodge the swooping rubber bat, basically standing still and waving his arms around. it's definitely an ed wood moment if ever there was one, especially when martha seems to revive on her own and rises groggily to her feet just as the blade slams down. whew! what a relief! in terms of kookiness, "the vampire's coffin" does not have the lunacy factor of "the bloody vampire" or "invasion of the vampires", but fans of these types of old horror films will appreciate the atmospheric photography, and the fact that the director manages to wring some real chills from this material has to "count" for something (haw haw).
