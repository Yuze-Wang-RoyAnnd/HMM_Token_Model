there were but two reasons for me to see this film. first of all stellan skarsgard and marisa tomei were in it (who are both good actors) and i had nothing better to do. while seeing the film though, i immediately thought of something better to do: sleep! this film is a complete waste of time. it is a standard ex-cop flick. the ex-copper is the best there ever was, but he was fired. he keeps doing stuff on his own to the dislike of his former buddies and he saves the day. all big surprises (not!!!). go to sleep, or if you have insomnia, try this one.<br /><br />4 out of 10
