hard to get in-depth with this kind of stuff since there is absolutely no existing shred of even partial reason for watching it, let alone expressing an opinion on it. i don't know anything about this - watched it for a laugh and stayed for the fake breasts. apparently, it's an unofficial sequel to 1982's "slumber party massacre", which i did enjoy as a fun slasher. "cheerleader massacre" looks like a late-nite soft-core cinemax porno! and not surprisingly, chicks like nikki fritz and samantha phillips (prolific t&a actresses) are in this. plenty of nekkid hooters and not much else... a group of 20-something high school cheerleaders, two random guys, and the fat, stupid comic-relief slob become stranded in the country and find a house where they plan to stay the night. the recently escaped "slumber party" killer is in the area and begins killing them off. there's no gore or originality and i wouldn't say the nudity is a real "selling point" since this is just about as boring a slasher movie can be. absolutely terrible...
