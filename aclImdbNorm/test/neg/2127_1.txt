yikes.<br /><br />i've seen quite a few bad movies in my days, a lot of them in the company of mike, tom, crow and the others from mst3k. so was the case with this one as well and even though i found the movie in itself quite funny, it wouldn't have been nearly as fun without the mst3k commentary.<br /><br />the movie is a prime example of really bad movies coming out of europe during the eighties. horrible music, horrible acting, horrible plot (what little there is), horrible dialogue and really, really, really, horrible editing. cripes.<br /><br />this might be called a turkey if it weren't for the fact that it's not unique in any way whatsoever. it's pretty much the same kind of film that almost every italian hack of a director cranked out.<br /><br />so, try and get the mst3k version. it's a pretty fun episode with mike and gang in quite good form.
