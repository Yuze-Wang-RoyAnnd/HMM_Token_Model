a family (a teenage boy, his mother and a stepdad), sick of city life, decides to move to the mountains to get away from it all and have a fresh start. however, their idyll is shattered by three brothers and their domineering father, who don't take kindly to newcomers on their patch. while having objects thrown through their window and being threatened in the street is just the start, the youth decides to make things even worse by having a relationship with the terrible trio's sister. with the law unwilling to do anything about it and the violence escalating rapidly, the lad decides to take matters into his own hands..<br /><br />veering wildly between hilarity and nastiness, this is one of the oddest exploitation movies ever made. at first, you can have a chuckle at some of the hammy acting and ludicrous dialogue given to the characters, especially the overwrought bad guys. but then, you get completely unnecessary scenes like a mother being raped while her son is forced to watch, or the thug's sister getting herself beaten up by her siblings for daring to sleep with our young hero. in fact, the whole view of women in the movie, which seems to be that they're pathetic creatures who scream a lot and can't defend themselves, is pretty despicable. but of course, there's the obligatory nude scene, which this time involves a young lady diving into a pool bra-less under a very thin t-shirt. who cares about plot consistency when you have some willing young starlets ready to shed her togs. right?!<br /><br />the climax centres on the teenager, who up until now hasn't been able to sneeze without jumping, suddenly morphing into a rambo clone and blowing off his assailants left, right and centre to save his stepfather who is being held hostage by the gang. it's completely implausible but hey, so is everything else in this film.. so at least you can't accuse it of not being consistent. so, rather than attempting to find logic in a place where the word doesn't exist, check out the imdb pages for janet laine green, dehl berti, stephen hunter, jonathan crombie.. etc. notice a pattern emerging here? their careers all hit dead ends. why? sit through this, and all will become clear. remember kids, if you want to get ahead in this business, hire a decent agent and always read the scripts they offer you. please.. 3/10
