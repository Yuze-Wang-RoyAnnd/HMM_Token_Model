(r#64)<br /><br />unredeemable, merit-less, and above all dreary trash. you know a movie is going to be bad when its sole star power is lance henriksen. the french title for this movie says it all: "inexplicable". how can you possibly make a movie this unbelievably bad in this day and age? whatever jonas quastel's trick is, it worked. this is "uber-trash, i'm talking 'manos'-level crap, meaningless, unwatchable, not-even-so-bad-it's-good, cinematic bile of the highest order.<br /><br />lance henriksen is harlan knowles, a character who could have been interesting if he wasn't so utterly devoid of characteristics or personality. he, along with a bunch of morons, goes on a field trip to search for an evil sasquatch which is believed to have attacked a plane which crashed out in the woods, or something. not much else happens. there's some soft-core (meaning: teletubbie level) nudity and some blatant rip-offs of "predator". after 92 minutes of utter pain and another ripped off scene, this time from "blair witch", the movie finally staggers across the finish line and ends. as a bonus, we only see the monster itself for about one or two scenes in the entire movie.<br /><br />there's really not much to say about this film. all you need to know is, this is a very bad movie and not even worth viewing as a "so-bad-it's-good" flick. "the untold" is to entertainment value what orlando bloom is to character acting. avoid it like arsenic.
