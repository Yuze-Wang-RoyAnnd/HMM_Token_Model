thank god this has not been renewed by itv.<br /><br />this series, while popular (god knows why) has a very simple - 'look i've found another body behind the flowers/bushes/trees/wherever they are working - for the sixteenth time this series' plot. the dialogue is so simple it's as though this has been written for children - talking down to the viewer and explaining every plot point.<br /><br />they just 'happen' to be around when someone does something out the ordinary - and no-one notices them.<br /><br />every time they look into and investigate someone's murder, they get in the way of everyone else - messing up the lives of all - including those completely innocent.<br /><br />they break and enter into people's homes, stealing items and evidence (even firearms) being nosey and getting into people's lives, spying on them and going through their stuff. they never apologise, never get caught or arrested (and if they do they can talk their way out of it, even though another character who does the same gets put in prison!!!).<br /><br />they always come up trumps. now i know that this is an easy going series, but i think that realistically this should not have made it past the first few episodes! put simply, it's unrealistic.<br /><br />i think that they have found enough bodies in the undergrowth both here and on the continent (where they are every other week), so i do hope it never comes back.<br /><br />itv should get some action on the screen instead of all the years of humdrum - 'someone's been murdered at the village fair - again' type series.
