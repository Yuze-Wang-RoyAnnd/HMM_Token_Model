8 days no script that's what the dvd tells you is how the movie was made. it's shot in blurry video that's occasionally used to good effect, but it's really partially naked women sitting around in a room for most of the running time. it is very well acted and this helps a lot. but the killer only shows up once in a long time and the girls/women sit and mope they don't try to escape or do anything too interesting, so the whole thing grinds to a stand still after about 20 minutes. would have been a good short maybe even powerful. even for eight days they do very little. why? because they had no script. how many movies have been made without scripts. not too many. i wonder why that is? how many great movies have been made from bad scripts. not too many. why is that? working against this major problem, the direction tries and does some interesting things but with what is essentially nothing. topless girls shot in dark grainy colorless video sitting around will keep some going for a while but not for the short but too long feature length. actors again deserve praise, if only there was a script.<br /><br />also the video quality, or lack thereof, is really low end, they try to use it to advantage and at times some shots look they are from miami vice, the recent movie that is. but that's not intended to compliment miami vice or this failed venture.
