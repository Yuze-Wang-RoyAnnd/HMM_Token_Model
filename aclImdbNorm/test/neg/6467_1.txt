the only entertaining thing that i found about watching this movie was listening to star wars coming through the wall of the movie theatre (yes i go to a really bad movie theatre). this movie is so mind numbingly bad that i think i would rather have my eyes scratched out by a cat rather than watch it again.<br /><br />let's compare it to the original. one is charming, funny, exciting, well acted, and one of the best movies ever made, the other is so far from funny that all you can do is hope that your eyeballs will fall out so you don't have to watch any more. i'm sorry christina ricci is a fine actress but cannot compare with hailley mills, and don't even get me started on doug e. doug in a part one occupied by the amazing and absolutely charming dean jones. dean jones' tiny part in the new version is the only partially redeeming part of this movie, and it is the only reason i can justify a 1* rating (also because the imdb doesn't go into negatives).
