well, i'm a huge fan and follower of elizabeth berkley. i bought this on dvd off of ebay for my boyfriends birthday. we sat down to watch it and it was so boring. i don't remember laughing once. it's only on for about an hour and half and it seemed to take forever to end. elizabeth is great in this though. maybe it's just because i'm a big elizabeth berkley fan though. if she wasn't in it i wouldn't have watched it but every time she came on my face lit up. unfortunately even elizabeth couldn't save this film. just the overall story and awful comedy makes this a film you'd rather miss than waste an hour and a half of your life. it's a very forgetful film.
