this extremely low-budget monster flick centers around a group of mine surveyors exploring an abandoned gold mine in order to see if its worth reopening. they get trapped after a cave in and find they are at the mercy of a strange, slimy creature which seems bent on knocking them off one at a time. the word that most came to mind as i watched this movie was 'desperate'. the script and acting is terrible, the stop-motion monster effects were unintentionally funny, and since the bulk of the movie takes place underground lighting the sets convincingly looked like a logistical nightmare. all that being said however for some reason i felt this movie failed not from lack of effort, but maybe from either a lack of budget, experience and/or lack of creative inspiration. the whole thing came off like it was either a college project or a first film made by amateurs, i have a certain amount of affection for films like that even when they completely miss the mark. i guess what i'm saying is i give it an b for effort and a d- for actual results, not insultingly bad as some low-budget monster movies i've seen but still not worth seeing unless you have a lot of free time on your hands. i'm voting it a 4.
