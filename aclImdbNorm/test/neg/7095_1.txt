this movie rips off of every mobster/gangster film ever made. mp da last don has a reference to every movie. the acting was by far the worst i have every seen. who the hell is john mario anyway? his acting was by far the worst i have ever seen. he makes bad actors look good. as far as master p goes, he's selling out quicker than an n*sync concert. i really wish i was there to tell the whole production company: what the hell were you thinking when penning the script?" obviously these people are so fixated on the gangster image that they decided to make a movie and live out their gangster lives for real in their minds. one thing i do know is that there wasn't anyone who wanted to distribute this film so it seems (and how predictable) that the guys at no limit had to start; no limit films. i've said enough! this movie is terrible and it does not deserve to be called a movie!
