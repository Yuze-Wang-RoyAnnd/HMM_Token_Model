this spaghetti western uses three american lead actors which takes away a little of the typical spaghetti aura. the plot is about an amnesty that the governor of new mexico gives to all willing criminals to provide them a chance to start a new life. usually this kind of opportunity is limited to past events but in this film it seems more like a licence to kill because even new crimes (like e.g. threatening the governor) are forgiven. the story is an endless chain of killings where nearly every character has only the purpose to deliver more carcasses. only the few leads have stamina. clay mccord is haunted by nightmares related to a childhood event where unsurprisingly he killed a lot of people. in the middle of the everlasting mayhem this kind of reflections lack credibility. compared with similar films like e.g. bandidos none of the characters in this film was likable for me.<br /><br />apart of the weak content which targets certain customers this film is well shot, sets are somewhat detailed and the acting is average. <br /><br />4 / 10.
