very poor script and acting. i was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast with his empty story that tells us nothing new. all is in the clich'e of the "mentor" and the "talented immature pupil". the characters aren't' even interesting nor sympathetic. artistically it is as empty and insignificant. the colours are very impersonal and light. only the poster may be appealing. al pacino tries very hard to give depth to his character with no success. too bad because the sport betting can be a really interesting subject to which many could relate. but i can't have a complete comment on this movie any way as i got out from the theatre 20 minutes before ending. everything was so predictable that it was a waist of time...
