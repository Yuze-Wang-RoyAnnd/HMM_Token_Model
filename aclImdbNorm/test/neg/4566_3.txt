i figure this to be an "alternate reality" teen flick...more precisely a ferris bueller type character as the leader of a cheat ring . yeah, i know it's not meant to compared to ferris bueller, at least not in a "oranges-to-oranges" way, but it will none-the-less.<br /><br />bottom-line: it's galaxies away from even being even a minor classic. it is watchable, though only if you're not expecting very much. that said, the main character has some charm, but the premise wears thin because the writing just isn't clever. the movie just did not deliver enough laughs, twists, or tension to keep my interest. <br /><br />to be honest i did continue watching...watching with hopes to see if anything suddenly clicked. it didn't. so, stylish as it is, i wouldn't recommend this movie. btw, it seems odd to see mary tyler moore as the principal. she's truly miscast, i hope the paycheck was inordinately big.
