ravi chopra wrote this film 40 years back, wanted to cast dilip kumar in the lead<br /><br />the film finally was re-written and made in 2003 and hence the subject looks dated and too superficial at times<br /><br />like the reason amitabh-hema separate is too superficial even the way the youth are shown is too bad like gulshan in avtaar<br /><br />the message though comes well but things are presented in a clich'ed manner salman's character is the worst, looks straight out of a storybook while the climax speech of bachchan is good and also the final of not forgiving the sons is good<br /><br />ravi chopra does a good job music is decent, the songs sung by bachchan stand out<br /><br />amitabh excels like always, he has played an elder stern father earlier but here he plays a victim and portrays it well his last speech is great hema is good in her part aman verma stands out samir soni is okay, naseer and the rest sons and wives are decent though divya dutta stands out salman khan is fake, mahima is okay paresh and lillete are lovable
