this movie was extremely boring. i only laughed a few times. i decided to rent it when i noticed william shatner's name on the cover. it's all about this little kid who gets picked on all the time by his classmates. when wandering the streets looking for old ladies to assist, he meets a prostitute. she takes him to a club called the playground, where he befriends several pimps. when mayor tony gold (shatner) decides to take over the pimp business, lil' pimp must lay down for his homies.<br /><br />the animation isn't very good in this. it looks like it was made with macromedia, which i'm sure it was. it doesn't suck, it's just the sort of choppy flash animation that people have gotten used to over recent years. the humor in this is not very good, i didn't think any of it was funny.
