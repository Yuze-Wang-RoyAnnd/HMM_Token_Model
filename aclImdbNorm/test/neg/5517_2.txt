if there were an epa for film, then this movie would get their most sincere approval. if we all recycled our "stuff" to this degree, we'd never run out of anything.<br /><br />funny how i was reminded of this movie when i first saw starwars i: the phantom menace. at least lucas didn't recycle his old footage.<br /><br />this is a dud. but it's a nice dud. cute in spots (i liked when the kid said, "damn rocks"). and, if you like explosions (even recycled ones) you will get your fill.<br /><br />actually for an obviously "no budget" film, it makes out fairly well. acting is weak, but there is a little characterisation here and there. story is predictable, but will lead you along anyhow.<br /><br />this is an "everybody chases the kid" type of movie which probably will appeal mostly to younger audiences. i gave this one a 2 out of 10.<br /><br />i dug up my old vhs copy of this film. i don't think it's on dvd.
