i am sure i'm in the minority (i know i am among my friends), but i found this movie long, boring and gratuitous. the fact that the role played by denis leary is the most likable character (the only other time i liked him at all was in "a bug's life"!) speaks volumes. rene russo's character was irritating beyond belief and thomas crowne himself was flat and stereotypical. to say he was two-dimensional may be a little generous. (no, the scenes with his psychiatrist did not help make him real.)<br /><br />with the exception of two wonderful scenes (both involving the museum caper and not involving rene russo), this movie made me wish i were at home watching televised golf.
