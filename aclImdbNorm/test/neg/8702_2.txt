i realise it's very hard to live up to the first the 10 commandments movie (which was grandiose and personally not a charleton heston fan) but wow...this movie/mini-series was disappointing. even the animated the prince of egypt was better.<br /><br />the one thing that threw me off was ramses. compared to yul brynner's version, paul rhys's version just seemed so weak and un-pharoh like. the acting really wasn't that great. for a modern adaptation, i was expecting something better. it just didn't look as stunning visually as the first one. i guess they were running on a tight budget or something. there's an occasional voice-over narrator which i found strange and unnecessary. it also broke up the flow of the story. and um...god's voice/lines were kinda weird.
