i can't believe some of the comments here in the reviews. the film is dated of course, and from our comfortable viewpoint in the age of cgg a lot of the special effects are deeply unconvincing now. but even allowing for this, helen of troy is so bad that it is almost laughable. <br /><br />the scripting is awful, just awful, with no characterisation at all. the performances suffer as a result, you can see the likes of hardwicke and andrews writhing in an agony of embarrassment as they deliver the most ridiculous shallow trite codswallop lines. the writers seem to feel the need to explain almost everything in a dreadful didactic screenplay that allows the viewer to decide nothing for him/herself at all. the beginning of the movie spells out the historical background as if no one had ever heard of ancient greece; i know they had american audiences to take into consideration, but the patronising way we are told everything twice to make sure we understood the action is really awful.<br /><br />i honestly can't believe the comments above describing this movie as a great epic film. even allowing for the comparatively primitive cinematography and the relative sophistication of today's audience, this movie truly stinks.
