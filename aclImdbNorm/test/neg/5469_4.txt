while walking to buy cigarettes, the professional dancer daniel (tom long) is abducted and forced to have kinky sex along many days by three hooded women. when he is released, the director of his company isabel (greta scacchi) has already replaced him in the play and his girlfriend gives a cold reception to him. the disturbed and humiliated daniel leaves the dance company and travels obsessed to seek out the abductors. daniel has sex with many women that he suspects that might be the kidnappers. <br /><br />"the book of revelation" is a weird movie with a promising beginning that loses the initial power and becomes a sort of too long erotic soap- opera or soft-porn chic. the production is classy, the cover of the dvd is awesome but the characters are not well-developed and the trauma of daniel seems to be excessive since most of the men would fantasize with the dream-situation that he was submitted
