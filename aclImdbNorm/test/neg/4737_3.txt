anyone who watched "alien vs predator" must've known that the conventions of the "alien quadrilogy" were not exactly adapted for the film. amongst some of the unusual elements, the rapid growth of the aliens over seemingly a matter of minutes, aliens with extremely long tails, and so on. however the idea of the predator species providing the impetus of city and temple building to create a hunt for would be warriors sounded so appealing that i couldn't resist.<br /><br />i had hoped the end of the film would not be the impetus of this sequel, and unfortunately i was wrong. for those who forgot how the first film ended, the dead predator had an alien burst through his chest which carried the traits of both species'.<br /><br />for this film, i'm going to just go through a list of "good" and "bad" traits.<br /><br />the good: lots of gorgeous people, especially the men. <br /><br />the bad: lots of gorgeous people get munched by both the mutant predator/alien, and the predator.<br /><br />the good: an interesting idea of the predator planet. <br /><br />the bad: an inconsistent scale of a town. its a small town without many opportunities, but with a very sophisticated (read: big city) sewer system, and homeless. is it a small town, or a city? the police force is one sheriff and three deputies, or so i counted.<br /><br />the good: um.... <br /><br />the bad: why do these mutant aliens/predators grow so fast? in a matter of five minutes, they seem to grow to their full size. i mean, c'mon...what are these things...chia pet aliens??? and while we're on this subject, why is it that an alien inside a predator's body mutates, but an alien in a human's body doesn't? does that make sense?<br /><br />the good: still thinking... <br /><br />the bad: why would only one predator come? and why does it pour acid over all the remnants of the "aliens," but it decides to murder a cute deputy, and then skin him and hang him upside down. i mean, so much for being incognito!<br /><br />the good: ah...i'm stuck. i guess there's lots of loud sounds! <br /><br />the bad: how do these mutated alien/predators procreate? apparently they find a pregnant woman and in a kiss type of motion, they deposit several offspring into the woman's body. yeah, just what you'd like to see, eh? pregnant women having their bodies explode into mutant aliens- as if the previous way wasn't gross enough!!!. i mean, there isn't even an alien queen.<br /><br />the good: did i say that the guys in this movie are gorgeous? <br /><br />the bad: when a nuclear device blows apart buildings, how does a helicopter manage to survive the blast? and how tacky is it for one of the passengers to mockingly chide the pilot "i told you not to crash!" i mean, given the nuclear fallout, when he wakes up in the morning, he'll have no hair left!!!<br /><br />i could go on and on, but i think you get the message. mutated alien/predator bursts through dead predator's body, grows over the matter of a couple of minutes, kills all the predators and manages to get crashed on earth. more mutant alien/predators are created, while one measly predator comes to earth to destroy this new mutant species. predator kills humans. mutant alien/predators kill humans. humans kill humans. sucks to be a human in this movie, eh?<br /><br />if you're impressed by lots of bangs and bumps, you'll love this movie.<br /><br />if you liked the first, i suggest you skip this sequel.
