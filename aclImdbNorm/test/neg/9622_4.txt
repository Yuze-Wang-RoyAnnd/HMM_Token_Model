i'm trying to understand what people liked about mirrormask. i am an avid film viewer and hobbyist film maker. as i was telling friends during my lunch hour, mirrormask may well be my biggest movie disappointment of the year. just like the short moongirl, the film missed its marks. several times during the movie it made attempts at humor. it sets you up for the laugh. instead of making you laugh, it leaves you feeling empty. the jokes reminded one of the recent star wars films. they weren't funny unless you were five. and the acting felt similarly terrible. i've seen actors actually act in front of a blue screen. and i've believed it. but not in this film. not for a second.<br /><br />this film takes a formula and tries to apply it with pretty artwork
