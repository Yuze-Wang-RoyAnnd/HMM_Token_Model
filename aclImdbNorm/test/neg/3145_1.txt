i was a little to old for this show i was 6 when it first came out. first off when i was a young child there were a few children's shows that were on sesame street which i did watch and learned from, but other than that there wasn't much else. my cousins were all born a few years after me 7 years was the first one more came latter. barney was a very big part of what they watched. when i first saw this show i told my grandmother how it doesn't teach anything just uses magic to fix everything. i was 9 at the time, how many 9 years old have any idea what is really going on with a tv show. more and more that i saw or heard what the teachings of barney were the more and more i told people how bad the show was. the funny thing is my parents who had a young child in the mid to late 80's which was me by the way. they agreed and said the same thing as i did. the sad thing about this is my cousins who are older now 13 and such still agree with what they saw. its not cheating its creative, its not right to think differently than what someone tells you to. its o.k to steal if the person wont find out or mind that it is gone. lets be honest with ourselves, barney is out to make money not teach children anything. the more flashy the program the more inclined children will be to watching it. children are stupid not because they are not educated they just do not know any better, second barney put on a show and parents bought it. i never believed that tv could affect people the way barney does. if you have a young child read to them watch a show that teaches them numbers, do not let them get involved in this show. barney is like smoking once is to much, smoke a few and your hooked let your kid watch this show they are hooked and one day their kids will watch the same crap and buy the same crap you bought
