because it came from hbo and based on the imdb rating, i watched the first season of this series, what a waste. the characters are occasionally interesting but mostly cartoon-like. the acting ranges from good to mediocre talent with a s t r o n g emphasis on the latter. not only prisoners, also viewers should leave all hope at the cell door that this story is believable, it's such a load of dung that you will need unusually strong testicular fortitude to keep watching. the violence, as with most of the developments in the story, is titillating and whatever morality is supposedly served up, it's of the lite variety. if your idea of excellent television includes the the writing, acting and overall production quality seen in the sopranos, deadwood or six feet under, avoid oz. if you want to see a disneyland for illiterate jerks, watch oz. stuff like this gives edgy a bad name.
