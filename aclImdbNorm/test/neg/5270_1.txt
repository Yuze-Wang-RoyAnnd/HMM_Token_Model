after the general, a film that romanticized the life of dublin gangster the general to such heroic proportions that it made the average dublin person sick, along come kevin and his attempted portrayal of mr. lynch or martin cahill, aka the general, the acting is so bad that this crime drama becomes a comedy for the native dub, and a tragedy for the kevin spacey fan. in short, is the movie worth a look.... no, unless u like bad acting with hilarious 'proper irish accents, ah sure to be sure to be sure'. the story is ripped off from the commercially successful 'the general' which, despite is glorification of a well known dublin animal in martin cahill is still worth a look, on a domestic scale because it shows real working class dublin, and on an international scale because of he true irish acting and killer cast, including john voight. all in all, 'ordinary decent criminal' is anything but a decent film. avoid.
