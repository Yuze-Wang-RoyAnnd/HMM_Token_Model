i rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case. judge and jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun, but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on. david keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent. judge and jury was well plain dumb i gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2, i gave it an extra star just because david keith's gun was cool.
