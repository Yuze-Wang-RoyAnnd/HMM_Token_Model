there is a special heaven reserved for people who make the world laugh. alongside chaplin,stan and ollie,the marx bros and.....(fill in your own special favourites)space must be made for everybody connected with "airport 80 - concorde,the movie". robert wagner in particular exceeds all expectations giving the comedy performance of a lifetime.i would never have thought he had it in him. the only way he could have been funnier would have been to have worn a red nose and a revolving bow tie. british moviegoers will recognise the fat one from cannon and ball pretending to be a russian athlete,a nice trick if he could have pulled it off but,tragically,he couldn't.i have a 14 year old labrador more athletic and almost as funny. george kennedy - bless him - has a part that requires him talk and move at the same time,and my goodness he triumphs!brow wrinkled with effort he utters timeless dialogue,each word lovingly polished into coward-like brilliance. only once in twenty years does hollywood turn out a film like "airport 80".all the years of toil and struggle,the sweat,the tears,the lessons with lee strasberg,living out of suitcases,born in a trunk etc etc,all come to fruition.a work of art is created that will last as long as there are movies and machines to show them on. i think i'm ready for my medication now.
