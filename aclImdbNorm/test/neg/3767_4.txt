rocketship x-m should be viewed by any serious movie buff for the following reasons:<br /><br />1) it is one the first -- and the few -- movies not to have a happy ending. doubtless the effect was more profound in post-world war ii america than it would be today, but nonetheless the sad ending adds to the film's message.<br /><br />2) it is also one of the first movies to deal with space travel in a serious fashion, using space as a valid setting for drama. the lack of scientific background notwithstanding, the movie stands on its own as dramatic fare. it's not so much a space drama as it is a drama set in space.<br /><br />3) the anti-nuclear war message is delivered in a serious manner that is not lost in sfx involving large grasshoppers, men, or animal. the effect of martian society from nuclear devastation is starkly and frankly presented. the fact that the survivors from the expedition crash land and as such are unable to preach the lesson learned on mars adds another element of sadness to the tragic ending.<br /><br />sterno says take a ride on rocketship x-m.
