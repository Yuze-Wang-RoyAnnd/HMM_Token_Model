what can you say about a movie whose funniest episode sees a fat man wrestling a garden hose? the acting, particularly that of lead man jerry o'connel, is embarrassing. the dialogue is so contrived and unfunny it makes you cringe. the controlling idea is actually not a bad one for this genre (infantile teen comedy), but, somehow, the director manages to make the least of it. i rate it a 2 out of 10.
