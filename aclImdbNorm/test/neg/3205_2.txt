this is a disgrace to the name of all of the lovable and laughable critters' saga. why do the writers feel the need to make the movie unbearable to watch by all quality standards. the critters are cute and adorable as ever but deadly behavior has been transformed into that of a killer baby. they aren't as terrifying, gruesome, some what spine -chilling and funny as they were portrayed in the movies before. i used to love their porcupine shots but now it is hidden as if it was thought to be repetitive and boring. and what is with the killing and not eating. i thought this movie would have been cool but everything was so wrong. why did ug have to be evil and killed by that which is known as charlie. this movie sickens me. disgrace! disgrace! disgraaaaaaace!!!!
