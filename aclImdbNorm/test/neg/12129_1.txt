john waters owes me 2 hours of my life back. i saw a sneak-preview screening of this way back in 1990, and i'm still in pain. not before or since have i seen such a terrible piece of filmic waste spewed upon the screen. there is nothing positive i can say about this film. acting--awful; plot--ridiculous; music--atrocious. following the movie, my friends and i demanded our money back from the manager of the theater. he explained that, since it was a free screening, he couldn't give us anything in return, no matter how much agony we were suffering through. how johnny depp's career survived this trainwreck of a movie is anyone's guess.
