katharine hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking--and is thought by the local folk to be a witch. kate works overly-hard trying to convince us she's a backwoods hick (named trigger hicks!), but you can see she doesn't even believe in this unintentionally comical scenario. constantly-smiling robert young plays a foreman working on the construction of a mountain dam who becomes trigger's first crush...but alas, he's married! no amount of white magic can resuscitate this formula, based on a play and brought to the screen by r.k.o. with too broad a hillbilly flourish. it is ungodly, and just about unwatchable. *1/2 from ****
