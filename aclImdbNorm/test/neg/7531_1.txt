saw the film at it's lawrence, kansas premiere. this wavering story about a group of disgruntled highschoolers killing off the competition for prom queen was just awful. it fails for many reasons - bad acting, bad script, no clear point. but mainly it just felt like the filmmakers said to themselves - "hey i have some money, so let's make a movie!" - without really thinking it out. sorrowfully most indie films that don't make it suffer from just that mentality. they just don't seem to realize that it takes more than money to make a good movie... or in this case, even a watchable one. with this film i do not feel ashamed to say, that if i didn't know some of the crew, i would have walked out. simple as that.
