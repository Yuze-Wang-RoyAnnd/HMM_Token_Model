c''etait compl`etement minable : `a fuir absolument! <br /><br />this was an idiotic attempt to destroy classic source material, and thoroughly succeeded!<br /><br />do not see this film under any circumstances unless you wish to have your ten euros torn up and shoved up your nostrils by a bunch of vapid, atrociously unamusing characters.<br /><br />this type of film clearly illustrates the gulf that still unfortunately divides directors and audiences. if the individual (heaven forbid a collective could have conceived this dross) behind this had been considerate enough to watch the version currently playing in french cinemas, he or she would have endured what i was forced to endure, and mercifully rewritten it or just scrapped it altogether. the vein of adult humour being mined here dates, to my mind, back to fritz the cat but lacks that film's avant-garde status or even its base attempt at social commentary.<br /><br />with the proliferation of remakes and increasing reliance on pre-existing source material to fund storytelling these days, one would hope that choosing snow white, and thus not having to worry about conceiving characters or a radically new story, would have allowed more time for, oh i don't know, interesting animation, smarter jokes, perhaps a coherent film that has something to say and doesn't telegraph its vacuity from the opening frame? <br /><br />a manifestly appalling production.
