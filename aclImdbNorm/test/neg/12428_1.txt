omg, another bad film by larry buchanan. that guy did not learn to stop, did he? first, he gives us zero budget sci-fi movies and lies about famous dead people, and now he is exploiting the loch ness monster as being vicious.<br /><br />the "plot" is basically about some southerners of the usa pretending to be scottish camping out at loch ness. alas, out on the fishing hole, oops, i mean lake of loch ness, there is a killer inflatable monster that clams itself to be nessie, going out of its way to kill people for no apparent reason.<br /><br />i am surprised that the crew of mst3k never heard of this movie. yes, it is that bad too.
