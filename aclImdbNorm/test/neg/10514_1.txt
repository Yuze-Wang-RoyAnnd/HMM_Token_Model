i've spent a year deployed in iraq, and amongst the hundreds of movies i've seen here was this little gem called vampire assassin. judging from the cover (african-american with corn-rows with a curved blade, leather coat and the demeanor of a badass), i expected a blade rip-off. fair enough.<br /><br />so i pop it in and observed a borderlined overweight african-american with no blade, no cornrows and, well, nothing at all really except...i don't know. if you've read any of these other reviews, you get the gist of the flick. it sucks. bad. really bad.<br /><br />i don't know if it was the highlander-esquire lightning after killing an immortal vampire, or the karate-kick sound effects for camera zooms, or the twenty dollar budget on props, or the "ok, we have 90 minutes to film this before we're caught filming in a johnson & johnson parking lot," or the martial arts that is as exciting and fast-paced as two old people having sex, or the 7th grade acting talent, or the eccentric asian master who's either senial or on acid, or what, but the movie manages to force you to question your existence. and that's awesome.<br /><br />not many movies can be so bad that your head will explode like scanners. if you heckle (or mst3k) with your friends, this is the flick for you. i've seen it three times already, and i think it might've caused permanent damage on my psyche. if you still don't have any clue as to the quality of the film, people were trying to give it away for free and no one would take it. not even by force.<br /><br />long story short, watch it. either as masochistic pleasure or punishment. it will rock your skull (and for the most part, for all the wrong reasons).
