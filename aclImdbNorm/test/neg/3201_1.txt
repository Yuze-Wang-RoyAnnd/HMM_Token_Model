after 30 minutes..mostly fast forwarding, deleted it off my recorder. the first critters movie was self-consciously fun, the "conversation" between the critters just before granny blows them away off the porch, for example. this film just limps along, waiting for someone to shoot it and put it out of your misery.<br /><br />i can't imagine anyone who worked on this turkey being proud of it.<br /><br />one was fun, four just was awful. don't bother even if the alternative is watching reruns of a tbs "700 club" fund-raiser, you'll at least get some good laughs there (and the "alien" makeup is more believable..grin).
