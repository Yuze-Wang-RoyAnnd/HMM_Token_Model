a woman as rich as she is insecure has a history of alcoholism and nervous breakdowns, helped no doubt by a smooth-talking gigolo husband who openly cheats on her. naturally nobody believes her when she claims to have been accosted by a giant man who stepped out of a giant satellite. much to the delight of her husband, this could be the incident which finally puts her away for good. <br /><br />from the very opening scenes, with it's ludicrous news broadcast and ridiculous satellite encounter, you'll probably be convinced that the only redeeming value of this movie is that it is so bad that it is funny. although not too far off the mark, this is most definitely not true.<br /><br />unlike most movies of this genre, this is not really a sci-fi or a horror film, but actually a serious drama which intelligently incorporates a sci-fi scenario into the plot. it's not a good or even mediocre drama, but it will exceed your expectations if you weren't expecting any legitimate drama at all. the acting is surprisingly good for such a low budget effort and, most importantly, it is well edited and excellently paced. it is never boring and manages to generate more than a little interest in seeing what will come next. nevertheless, this is still a movie strictly for those who can't pass up the chance to see a 1950s film with a title like "attack of the 50 foot woman"!
