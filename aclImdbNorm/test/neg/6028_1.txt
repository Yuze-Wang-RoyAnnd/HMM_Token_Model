i also have been a wife of an abusive husband, even if in my situation the attacks were psychological, not physical. he presented a very respectable, responsible and generous personality to anyone who saw us together, which, in contrast to myself, resulted in having others treat me as dull and unstable. initially, i was so incredibly flattered that anybody like gus (who worked in a bank and was handsomely confident) would even give me the time of day, and i fell completely head-over-heels for the idea of him, rather than the person he was. if i'd had my head on straight, and gotten to know him much better first, there's no way i'd have married him. however, that's my mistake. it wasn't my mistake to be abused. i didn't deserve that, nor did i see it coming until i was embroiled in the mind games, criticism and isolation. he acted like i had no business holding an opinion that differed from his own - actually he went further. if i didn't agree, he assumed i misunderstood, and increasingly simplified his wording ... by the time i finally lost my self-respect, i was incapable of recognizing the predicament i was in, and i had to be jolted to reality by outside influence. my dad said gus called me a bitch. well ... it was still a half-year before the rage that began at that moment finally exploded and i packed some stuff while he was at work, and i left. .. and it was still another several months before i could grasp the fact that i had been abused, and that it wasn't my fault he was doing the things he did. ..... so please, anyone who assumes it's the fault of the victim, think!!! if a puppy is kicked by a cruel owner when, in an anxious situation it has an accident on the rug, do you blame the puppy? by the time the abuse in a relationship reaches an obvious violent level, the target of abuse has been so wounded and depersonalized (much like in nazi concentration camps) that it's nearly impossible to judge the circumstance accurately, because by then, the victim believes all the horrible things spewed by the abuser. have a heart, people. labelling abuse victims as stupid morons is like kicking someone who's already terribly beaten. -------> and this helps how???
