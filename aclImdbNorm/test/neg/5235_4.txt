after the lush, inspiring aerial shot in fast motion in the opening of the movie, this slipped into utter boredom and a one tone note right till the end.<br /><br />where to begin, well i'll start with the characters. i really enjoyed them in the book, here they all were types and one dimensional morons that either had "victim" or "asshole" written on their foreheads from the get go. how any one didn't see through the store owner lealand gaunt (in a hammy and out of place performance by sydrow)is beyond me.<br /><br />this film lacks in thrills, suspense, and in some sense yes, entertaining values. it stretches itself for far too long with not a lot of pay off. why introduce too many annoying should-die-quick type of characters and then forget about half of them half way through? in the book practically everyone that went into the store met a grisly fate. here, besides one of the only decent scenes that translated well from the novel (the fight between wilma and nettie), was a letdown and didn't have much balls. i'm sorry but after, one off screen death,a boring shoot off, and some bickering and then a couple explosions just didn't do it for me. the brutality and mean spiritedness from the book was sadly missing. the explosion of the church scene was so over the top and badly executed, all of sudden the entire city was in a brawl? it made no sense and characters that weren't introduced all the way through suddenly are, who are these people and why should i care?<br /><br />the story is all over the place and none of the scenes had momentum. i thought ed harris and bonnie bedeila were good actors in this, but the movie gives them not enough substance for me to give a damn. amanda plummer was credible but too pathetic to really be sympathetic (in the novel she was a sad and depressing character)here it was a too one note. j.t. walsh was entertaining, but the role was far from interesting or layered. too predictable. <br /><br />the soundtrack was too classy for the material it was supporting. it stood out like sore thumb. easy there buddy, easy. something a little less theatrical i'd assume would have worked.<br /><br />i will admit some of the gore it did manage to have was good enough i guess, the director seemed to hold back a lot of the times though. if your going to make a movie that reaches the 2 hr point be sure to have far more going on then this disaster of a adaption of on of kings better novels.<br /><br />i often found myself laughing at scenes that were suppose to be taken seriously (ed harris speech at the end, or the character hugh priest in general), and was bored and uninterested most of the other time. personally the director should have done so much more with this story, his approach is too tame and hides behind too much crisp cinematography to ever come off as a decent movie. the movie looks good, but not the look i think this story deserved. i mean, this dude helmed alaska,not a good sign. <br /><br />i'd rather just read the book, as you should too as if it is far more entertaining,layered character development, grisly violence and mayhem, a nasty sense of humour, and far more oomph. this is a butchered version, that has not much to offer. <br /><br />** out of ****
