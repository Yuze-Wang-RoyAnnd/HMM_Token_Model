a bunch of teen dirt bikers are out in the forest riding around in circles. they're having fun; little do they know nature is about to be unleashed by an emo refugee from a deliverance or hills have eyes movie. he's armed with matches and fire accellerant. and he's got an eye that's bleeding or something. why torch a park? i dunno. maybe he doesn't like smokey the bear, or something. but he wears army/navy store fatigues, if that helps.<br /><br />the rangers send one single helicopter to battle the resulting blaze; that's all you ever see, except a bunch of people in a base somewhere talking a lot about the fire, but doing nothing. some cop or ranger or militiaman or whatever he is drops from the helicopter on a defective tether.<br /><br />everybody now rides their dirt bikes like they're auditioning for motocross. they forever pop wheelies, do evel knievel jumps, spin around etc. they argue incessantly. shots of the fire are as phony as a 3 dollar bill; it's the same footage from a dozen different angles, and the blaze never grows or moves. and you still never once see any fire fighting equipment.<br /><br />syfy channel movie which has about 0% science fiction attached to it. what you can expect from this: bad acting, cheap effects, and a story that goes nowhere (like the bikes and fire go nowhere). laughable insomniac cure.
