this movie starts at a and never quite reaches b. its title promises far more than the film delivers. it's superficial and filled with the usual cliches of a story in which a guy questions his sexuality. the people are agreeable, even the obligatory flamboyant type. the lead (kevin mckidd) overacts insofar as there's a reason for him to act at all. simon callow, playing a horny straight, is always worth watching, and he's by far the only reason to stay with the movie. however, the rubbish about his men's group "meditations" or whatever they are grows extremely tiresome in short order. they seem to have been thrown into the movie's mild mix in a misguided effort to vary the setting and non-stop inaction. the same comment applies to a really odd and unconvincing camping trip. don't worry about pausing the tape so you can get a snack. let the thing run; you won't miss anything. hugo weaving's character is superfluous. he appears in a sequence with one of the lesser leads and doesn't even meet the rest at all. the outcome of that sequence isn't explained, and hugo's real estate dealings have nothing to do with the story. the movie is a total disappointment at the end, because there is no resolution. the thing simply fades out and we're sent to the closing credits. this is an interlude with no structure.
