a lack of character development proves fatal for this movie. valeria golino's character grazia starts out looking like a bipolar personality but quickly degenerates into a caricature and seems unreal. the other characters are thin, probably the writer's fault not the actors'. the only exception is filippo pucillo as the younger son filippo: his energy and bravado are funny and convincing.<br /><br />i suppose the children's petty cruelty is supposed to contribute to an atmosphere of bleakness and emphasize the pervasive primal spirits in the town, but for me, the gratuitous cruelty is redundant and contributes to the overall boredom of the film. some scenes were amusing but not necessarily intended that way, for example, when the mistreated dogs turn out to be fat and healthy and look like they are ready to show. the pretty cast and setting make for an appealing trailer but cannot carry the whole movie.
