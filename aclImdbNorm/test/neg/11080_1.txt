sometimes you ignore that little voice in your head that says "stay away from this movie". we should all pay more attention to that little voice. this may be the worst movie i've ever had the non-pleasure of sitting through, or it may be the best reason to remember that your dvd player has a fast-forward button. made on a budget somewhere in the vicinity of $1.99, "the cavern" is obviously a quick cheapie made to piggyback on the current bunch of scary cave-lots of darkness-claustrophobic spelunkers-unknown menace flicks like "the cave" and "the descent". a few years back there was similar rash of look-alike movies that used sea-going vessels instead of caves. all had scary boats/submarines-lots of darkness-claustrophobic adventurers-unknown menaces...same old same old. "the cavern" is really "the blair witch project" only this time we're lost under the earth and not lost on top of it. throw in a flashlight with failing batteries, a cow skull with fangs glued on it for a monster, and one of the stupidest "twist" climaxes ever put on film. that being said, let me urge you to listen to me, the little voice in your head. i'm your friend. i want you to have a happy life. stay away from this movie.
