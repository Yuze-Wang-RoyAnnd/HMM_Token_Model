why, oh why, is this trash considered a classic? i've seen higher body counts on episodes of the simpsons. virtually nothing happens in this film and much of it's running time is filled with nearly unbearable melodrama straight out of a low-rent soap opera.<br /><br />the trenton family are going through tough times and when dad is away mommy and little boy go to get the car fixed. but when they get to the ranch they discover that the guard dog has gone mad. the rest of the film is just them sitting in the car while the slobbering st. bernard circles them over and over.<br /><br />regarding the kid, i have never, ever seen a more annoying child in a film in my life. and obviously he's completely aryan since blonde-haired and blue-eyed kids, such as the one prominently featured on packets of kinder chocolate, are apparently more sympathetic than people with brown eyes and dark hair, like me. all he does is cry and whine. same goes for mommy. she gets out the car, she gets in the car, she gets out the car, she gets in the car.<br /><br />i know this was made in 1983 but i just sick to death of horror films where the characters make stupid, illogical decisions. if mommy just used some common sense she'd be able to get away from the icky dog.<br /><br />it's very poorly written and there's zero tension. if you want to see a good "bad dog" movie then check out john lafia's man's best friend. it's funny, inventive, has a better dog, a higher body count and a more involving story. leave this garbage be.
