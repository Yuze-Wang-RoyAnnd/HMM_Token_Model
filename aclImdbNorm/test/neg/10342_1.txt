far from combining the best bits of pontypool and 28 days this managed to ignore them. whilst shamelessly copying them. (if that makes sense?) pontypool was different and got progressively tenser, this just stinks. the radio dj, "we must stay on air" spends effectively no time on air. he sits on his bottom and watches the tv for news. this is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie ever. is there a single person in the usa or indeed the world who doesn't know what a zombie is? or ever heard of the word "zombie"? well, by the 50th minute this bunch of misfits are still calling the zombies, "the infected ones" or the ones with "rabies'. the word "zombie" might make a guest appearance later, i could care less. maybe there's a copyright where you have to pay to use certain words? like the bluetooth earphone is called "the ear-thingy" i kid you not! to finish, no plot + no acting = no-one cares. a waste of time, a shameless, poorly executed rip-off.
