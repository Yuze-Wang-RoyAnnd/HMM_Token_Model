i hadn't seen this in many years. the acting was so good as i began this time, i thought, "great! another movie i misjudged as a foolish young man." but then the theme started to be clear and i felt the same way.<br /><br />this was hollywood, the seat of glamor; so the concept shouldn't be a surprise. but it is so condescending a concept i feel as if i need to take a shower after watching it. in brief, it tells us that even physically ugly people can seem beautiful to each other and even feel attractive.<br /><br />dorothy mcguire is likable as the homely heroine. she seems to have been filmed wearing minimal make-up. robert young is injured in the war and feels scarred. his parents can't bear to look at him either. he seems to have all his faculties and in part, the notions of disability are outmoded.<br /><br />herbert marshall is on hand as a blind pianist. his character speaks is hushed tones and is omniscient.<br /><br />the best performance is given by mildred natwick as the owner of the title residence. she is bitter and dour but not made of ice. her story is much more interesting, and believable, than that of mcguire and young.
