sebastian cabot is a rich jerk who wants to buy up all the land because there is oil--though none of the locals are aware of the oil. with the help of an evil gunfighter in black, they kill and terrorize everyone. when the son of a murdered man arrives, he refuses to back down and stands up to these forces of darkness.<br /><br />wow. as i watched terror in a texas town, i felt as if i'd seen this film many times before and would probably see something like it again. that's because aside from a few novelties (such as sterling hayden using a harpoon on the bad guy), it has a plot that is too familiar. once again, we've got a rich guy who is trying to drive out all the farmers in order to gain control of all the land. and, to do so, he's brought in hired guns to force people to sell or kill them. been there, done that in just too many films.<br /><br />i love sterling hayden in films, but just couldn't recommend this as anything other than a poor time passer.
