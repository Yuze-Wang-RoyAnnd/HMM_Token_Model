"snowball express" from the disney studios isn't quite as dated as some of their output from this era. there are no hippies or hot-rodders, just dull-as-dishwater dean jones inheriting a ramshackle hotel/ski-resort from a deceased relative. when jones and family pull into a sleepy colorado town, the folks who give them directions--looking like extras from "deliverance"--are curiously vague about the hotel (we expect it to look like a one-room shanty), but actually the accommodations are very nice. jones' teenage daughter has a sour look on her face throughout (which doesn't prevent one of the local yahoos from leering at her), and of course clumsy pop dean jones is a regular stumblebum on the slopes, leading to a lot of pratfalls in the slush. perhaps this square scenario might've benefited from some magical whimsy, for this script is a frozen stiff. * from ****
