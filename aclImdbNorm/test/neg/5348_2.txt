so many great actors, so little worth watching. but with a script that misses so much of what made the book special, i don't hold it against anyone on screen. though flawed, the book was one of grisham's only that i truly liked, especially how it captured the flavor of a deep south small town, a slightly different world to a coastal urbanite such as myself. i also loved the matter-of-factness, naturalness of what occurs in the book. in the movie characters are given a "nobility" of personality that seemed so stilted. the villains and foils are flat and 1 dimensional. but as with so much of joel schumacher's work, genuineness and authenticity are conspicuously absent, and every point must be delivered via sledgehammer to the midsection. so preachy, stilted, and superficial about so horrendous a tragedy, i wish someone would do a remake and get the story a little more right.
