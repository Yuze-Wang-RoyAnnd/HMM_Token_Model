this film was the worst film i have ever seen. it was a complete waste of money. if i had not been in the cinema was my two young cousins (who also thought it was disappointing, but not as terrible as i thought), i would have left the cinema. there were two points in the film that i almost laughed, but the rest of it was either boring, ridiculous or painful. i thought it would be a spoof on all superhero movies (which i love), but in fact it was mainly based on spiderman, with a few oblique references to other superhero movies such as fantastic four and batman. i really cannot think of one good thing to say about this film. do not waste your money with this film-there are many other better films out there!
