i really wanted to like this film for all sorts of reasons -- the subject matter is inherently interesting and is probably the major issue facing the world today and has thrown up fascinating works (e.g. linda grant's when i lived in modern times)usually from the israeli side of the fence. also, a bloke i like told me he thought it was the best film he'd seen all year, so with such a recommendation...<br /><br />however i actually found myself nodding off at points! admittedly i was tired and the cinema seats comfy but i found it too much hard work trying to identify with the characters. once i'd got my head round the idea that it was a series of vignettes, i went with it, but this made it disappointingly like a sketch show rather than a film. i liked the concept of a restrained, almost silent mise en scene contrasted to these utopian moments - the sexy girl, the red balloon and the ninja muslim fighter. but personally i think the film has been over hyped. i'm not saying narrative and plot is everything (it's definitely not) but even a little more dialogue would have helped.
