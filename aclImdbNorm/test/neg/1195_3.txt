had the league been unknowns pitching this script, the backers would simply have turned around and said "no - you're not having the money - this is dreadful". as a fan of the league of gentlemen, this is their poorest outing to date. not particularly funny, not particularly entertaining, there are few laugh out loud moments. they do exist, but they are few and far between. i felt the format was tired and really dragging. the film refers to the writers being bored of the characters and it shows. as for being a film. i felt the xmas special had better production value; the fx are generally pretty poor and it is clearly obvious that they didn't film in the original royston vasey (they filmed this on the cheap in ireland). the musical score is weak and the dialogue is terrible. also, the accents of the characters were largely off from their tv equivalents. tubs and edward, much underused (again), just didn't sound like themselves. disappointing really, because i was hoping for something far more entertaining. this really was the league's equivalent of the 1970s comedies where the cast go to spain...
