this film is supposed to be about the frustrations of film making. it certainly frustrated me with its endless boredom. the setting is an attractive spanish seacoast resort with his usual large cast. the script is very poorly written or maybe there was no script. just all ad-lib.<br /><br />a far superior film about the frustrations of film making is francois truffaut's "day for night" made in 1973. it shows all the delays and how the cast can misbehave in an intriguing manner. it doesn't bore the viewer and you gain sympathy for the director who somehow must complete the film.
