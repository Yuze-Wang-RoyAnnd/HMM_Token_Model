"committed", as in heather graham being committed to saving her husband/marriage, and then being committed to a psychiatric ward in failure to do so: what a clever, clever use of words.<br /><br />one of those meaningless wanna-be philosophical films in which narration is a series of oh-so wise observations that verge on poetry (90s chique club-poetry, better known as "chit-chique poetry"). oh, it's so je-ne-sais-quoi... written/directed (or "auteured") by a woman (lisa krueger, whoever the hell you are), this is a pointless, lethargically directed road-movie full of new age spiritualistic nonsense and characters that are meant to be interesting but are merely seen-before or just plain dull. the latinos in this movie, as part of the poor urban minority, are typically glorified in all their mysticism-obsessed primitivism as a "spiritually superior" people, which is the "highlight" of this film's political correctness.<br /><br />the whole affair is lifeless, and ceases to be so only when occasional good cast members appear (kay place, baker, wilson). on the other hand we have casey affleck, who is one of the very best examples of why nepotism is on par with first-degree murder as a crime. i have rarely seen a more apathetic "actor"; a skinny, ugly moron who goes through his lines in a sleepy manner, almost as if he were uttering them in a half-awake quasi-dream, plus that weak voice, one of the weakest male voices i've heard in my life. (he must have gone to the tobey maguire lethargy school of acting.) to cast this idiot in anything speaks volumes about any movie, i.e. about any director or producer. hence, lisa krueger is a talentless waste of space. we've also got that moron who had the lead role in the mst3k-spoofed "werewolf"; i think his name is goran vishnjic, but i'm not sure. check out his ridiculous accent and the dumb speech.
