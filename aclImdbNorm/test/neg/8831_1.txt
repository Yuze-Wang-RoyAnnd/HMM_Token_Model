i would like to make it very clear that i am not at all religious. i am an atheist but i could see that richard dorkins was contradicting himself over and over again. i would also like to make it known that i am not the sort of person that argues against something with philosophy all the time, but i feel that when comparing science and religion we must be philosophical and be willing to question the belief in main stream science as well as questioning religious beliefs.<br /><br />i wonder if richard dorkins ever spends any time to think philosophically about belief, anyone who thinks long and hard enough about science and religion will realise that science is indeed a religion in itself. yes there is a fundamental difference between the way that scientific beliefs are held when compared with other religions, but at it's roots, it's faith in a particular human instinct.<br /><br />throughout this series, richard insists that science methods are the only right way of thinking and that it makes sense to believe in something only if the evidence for it is strong enough. if you dig deep enough into how science functions you'll realise that it is just as irrational as religion and that it comes down to faith in the end, faith in the evidence, faith in our sanity, faith in our senses but more than anything else faith in our instinct to follow patterns of recurrence.<br /><br />this is not easy to explain but think about how the laws of physics were decided, it was because they were and still are the most common patterns of recurrence that we are aware of. i think that human beings have an instinct that makes them believe that the longer something remains in a certain state or place of existence the more we just assume out of blind faith that it is more likely to stay like it. for example, we don't expect that gravity will suddenly work in reverse tomorrow, by this i mean pushing matter away as supposed to attracting it. but the only reason why we don't expect this sudden change is because we have known for so long that it has always attracted as far as we are aware. however that doesn't mean that it couldn't do exactly the reverse tomorrow or even right now. it doesn't matter how long something may stay in a certain state or change, there is no rational reason to make assumptions about it but we do out of instinct. i would ask you to consider what is a long and short amount of time? there is no such thing, i don't know exactly how long it took for these supposed wise men to decide that everything must be made out of matter, sound, light, etc but lets give them what they would consider to be an edge way! lets say far longer than it really was 12,00000000000 years! is that a long period of time? 99999999999999999 years makes 12,00000000000 years seem like an incredibly short period of time. for all we know there could be an extreme amount of change in the so called laws of science within the next trillion years. it's all about comparison, only when we compare things can we say "that is long" or that is short. it's the same with big and small, wide and thin, heavy and light, strong and weak and others.<br /><br />i doubt that any scientist could tell me why they think that trusting this instinct makes sense. i certainly don't see why it should, but that doesn't mean that we as humanity should necessarily stop using it. with this in mind, the most hypocritical comment that richard dorkins made was when he said that faith is irrational, "a process of non thinking" he said. if what we have in this instinct that i've been describing and this instinct that we all possess on some level isn't faith then i don't know what the hell it is. other times when he is being hypocritical is when he talks about the religions being bronze age, "bronze age myths" he says. i would like to point out that no matter how much scientific methods have been changed over the years due to experience, experiments and evaluating, the pure rules of science are getting older and older all the time! they could even be described as the holy bible of science. he was going on about how he is sick of the different religions being stubborn " i am right, he is wrong" but looking back on how rude he was to the various interviewees, he seems to be just as stubborn him self. to be fair to him, at least he doesn't try to bomb religious communities. i appreciate his hatred for certain religious beliefs that generate war, but i don't respect his arrogance in his own beliefs.<br /><br />as far as i'm concerned, richard has the right to believe in science if that is his way. i am scientifically minded as well, but i don't think he has the right to go up to religious leaders having unfriendly arguments, trying to force his opinion on to them and virtually describing them as stupid. despite all his education, experience and discoveries he seems to fail to have the wisdom to properly question his very own system of belief. i have read what he says in defence of this argument that open minded atheists such as my self put forward, what he states suggests to me that he is totally missing the point.<br /><br />finally the title of the documentary, root of all evil. this states that religion is the root of all evil, it isn't true. there are causes of evil that have nothing to do with religion.<br /><br />all round the documentary series was frustrating, narrow minded, hypocritical and flat-out rubbish.
