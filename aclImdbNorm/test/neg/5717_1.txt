corny and some really bad acting but for a golan-globus film about right on par. saw this movie back in 1985 mostly because i liked sword and sorcery films(what was i thinking?). arnold is in it playing a high lord trying to make sure an ancient talisman is destroyed before it blows up the world.brigitte nielsen is the title character who at the time was sly's girl and a pretty bad actress.movie producers like to cast playboy type women who cant act in low budget b movies. brigitte cheeses it up as sonya and arnold acts wooden as lord kalidor.there is also sandahl bergman(who was in the original conan movie as valeria)here she plays the evil queen gedren,an obvious camp to her conan role. and then one of the most irritating child actors onscreen(ernie reyes)as prince tarn who should have been slapped hard and sent to bed.what a little irritating scut. some of the swordfights arent too bad but the music really sucks. special effects are cheap and look very 70's ,like the explosion of the evil queen's castle at the climax of the movie. <br /><br />overall a very low par film but b movie film buffs might like it for its campiness.
