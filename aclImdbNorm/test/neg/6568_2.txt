even not being a fan of the "star trek" movies or universe of shows and books and such, i still find some enjoyment in some of the movies featuring the old cast and in the case of "first contact" even the new cast a bit. this one though was kind of sad to watch...it seemed to want to be so much, but it failed on so many levels to be one of the worst star trek movies. the plot is very far fetched seeming to want to combine three or four stories into one ultimate trek adventure, but it ends up an unfunny when it tries to be, not tense when it wants to be and not action packed like it tries to be mess of inconsistencies. the whole movie to take a phrase from spock is illogical. the effects are nothing special as i have seen episodes of next generation that are just as good, which is to say it is fine for a television show, but not a major motion picture. the plot is laughable as the gang at first tries to stop spock's brother then joins him on his quest to find god, yes you read that correctly. the klingons make a tacked on appearance, which actually will set up the much better undiscovered country movie. all in all you know it is bad when the best part of the film is kirk, bones and spock singing row your boat, well spock was not really singing, but rather questioning the lyrics.
