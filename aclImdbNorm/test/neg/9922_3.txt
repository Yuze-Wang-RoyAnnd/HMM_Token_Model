let's get right to the heart of the matter...this is a terrible movie. the story is confusing, the supporting cast is laughable and the lead actors look like they were forced to be in it. the story asks us to believe there is a underground lesbian sex cult where members are being murdered by their psychiatrist who just happens to be a transvestite. ellen barkin investigates the crimes and develops a crush on peta wilson whose job it seems is to be the cult recruiter. the sex scenes are equivalent to bad porn and when barkin and wilson kiss, poor ellen looks like she's in pain. barkin's talent is totally wasted in this b-grade sexploitation piece of junk and i hope she gave her agent the pink slip after landing her in this film.
