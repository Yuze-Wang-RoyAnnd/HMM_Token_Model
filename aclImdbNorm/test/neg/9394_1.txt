this is just another one of those "american finds romance with charming foreigner in exotic european locale." this genre has been cinematically bankrupt since the 1950s, yet they continue to churn them out. i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it. if all you want to see is tuscany, try watching "stealing beauty" with liv tyler - a marginally better movie.<br /><br />this types of genre movies are very hallmark greeting card-ish.
