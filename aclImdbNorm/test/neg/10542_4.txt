oh dear! what can i say about half past dead? i was really disappointed in it. i was thinking....a steven seagal movie! cool! we'll get to see him kick people and flip people and break bones. we might even get to see him have a stick fight with somebody! excellent!<br /><br />however, i was in for a rude awakening. this film can be summed up as follows:<br /><br />take an episode of the a-team, remove the lovable and roguish characters such as murdoch, hannibal, mr t and face. then get a writer/director to pen a plot even ed wood would be ashamed of and who's too big a fan of the matrix and john woo movies for his own good. throw in a bunch of people with really bad acting ability and who don't have real names. finally, add in a main star who's getting saggy around the midriff and doesn't appear to be able to do his own stunts anymore. <br /><br />the result? half past dead. an action movie so ridiculous that it at least made me smile right the way through. the plot holes are stupendously, glaringly large - for example, prisoners who, when the jail is invaded, fight the invaders rather than attempting to escape. or how about the prison itself, which has an armoury that contains heavy machineguns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers? you also have a helicopter (bearing a striking resemblance to a huey) with some kind of video game machinegun mounted in the nose.<br /><br />then there's seagal himself. i like the guy. he can fight. he's even witty in a way that jean-claude van damme will never be. but all through the movie i kept hoping for that one great, defining fight scene. never happened. instead we got people firing guns a lot and not hitting a whole hell of a lot. i mean, when someone runs down a narrow corridor and you fire a sub-machinegun at them, there isn't a whole lot of places the bullets can go other than down the corridor and into the target. yet somehow they miss? even the a-team would cringe at this foolishness. and then when it gets to any kind of one-on-one physical stuff, we get treated to a shabby matrix rip-off, without the benefit of bullet-time. people getting kicked twenty feet through the air and sundry other ludicrous acrobatic nonsense.<br /><br />c'mon steven, you're better than this. your career can't be over. say it ain't so!<br /><br />this is instantly forgettable (except i'm forcing myself to remember for the purposes of this review) and if you watch it, try to find it amusing in an a-team kind of way. but i doubt it'll be high on anyone's "re-watchable" list. out for justice this ain't. more like out to lunch.
