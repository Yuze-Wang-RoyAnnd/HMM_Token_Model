i know it's not original, but what the hey? what else can be said about it? i feel unutterably silly just paying any attention at all to "from hell it came". the movie makes the important political and social issue of fallout from atmospheric atomic tests seem a matter for joking and dismissal, not the concern and alarm being raised by scientists all over the world at the time.
