maybe i'm alone here, but this is a crap show. i'm sorry but i was lured in when i found out about lil' bill o'reilly (which i had no idea came from this show until months later, and has honestly since lost its appeal) but i gave the show a fair shot. spike tries to hard to make himself into something he's not, which is to say, he tries to be human. fox didn't even bother to hide the strings when they took him out of the box he came in. his sketches try to hard, he himself isn't funny, and the writers are struggling to write material for a no-talent host. there is too much good tv out there to waste your time with this show, and fox.....fox we had some good times, but you need to get your f$%*ing act together and come up with something original instead of trying to be just another "me-too" network.
