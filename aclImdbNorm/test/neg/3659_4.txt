maybe i saw a cleaned up version, but other than a few flashes of breasts, i'm not sure what over the top nudity these other commenters are referring to.<br /><br />all in all not as bad as i was expecting by the previous comments, although the end leaves you wondering ... wtf? it was dark, but not so much that you couldn't make out the scenes, and i think it just added to the creepiness and the terror of the situation.<br /><br />film quality could have been better, but the acting was pretty decent.<br /><br />all in all a decently creepy (and yes, brutal) movie with a disappointing ending.
