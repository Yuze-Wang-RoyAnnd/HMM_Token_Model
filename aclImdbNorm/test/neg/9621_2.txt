"mirrormask" was a terribly disappointing film for me. i had expected much from a jim henson production and had found favourable reviews comparing it to "the labyrinth" and "alice in wonderland". unfortunately, the film ended up in one of those "style over substance" pile of movies.<br /><br />whereas most kids dream about running away from home to join a circus, helena is a kid who has grown up in a circus (child labour, anyone?) who wishes to run away to join real life. helena wishes that her mother drop dead, which is a bad move for a spoiled brat with a princess complex in a kid's fantasy movie. next thing you know, helena's mother flops over, and for some reason, she is suddenly transported to another world.<br /><br />meanwhile, i felt as if i was transported to the museum of contemporary art with a pair of foggy sepia-tinted glasses.<br /><br />the showcase of cgi-generated creatures and backdrop was interesting at first, and i liked the orbiting giants. it got a little too tiresome after a few minutes though, and i felt my mind wandering ...<br /><br />with no sense of narrative and mtv-style clips and soundtrack (the sphinxes reminded me of basement jaxx's "where's your head at"), i did not feel involved in the plight of the protagonist and also frustrated, as we waited for the film to lead us wherever it wanted, hopefully towards the "exit" signs of the theatre ...
