i've got to say that i'm not a massive fan of troma films. granted, i've only seen three of them (or four including this one), but two (blood sucking freaks and mothers' day) are widely reputed to be the best, which leads me to believe that all the others aren't worth seeing. that would certainly seem to be the case with graduation day, which is a troma take on the over-popular eighties slasher. while the film is never particularly bad (given the type of film), it's never particularly good either; and by the end, all i could think about was 'why did i bother watching this?'. anyway, the plot sees some girl die on a race track, and shortly thereafter; more people start dying. naturally, there are a few possible suspects; but it's hard to really care about anything that happens. of course, in slasher terms; it's the gore that is most important, and given troma's track record where the red stuff is concerned, i was expecting buckets of it. there are some decent kill scenes, and some of them are gory; but it's never very shocking, which really just makes this another dreary slasher based on a celebratory event on the american calendar. it's worth noting that there's a small role in this film for sleaze queen linnea quigley, but the rest of the cast aren't worth mentioning. the direction, plot and its execution are all very mundane; and i will say that unless you're a big troma fan or someone that wants to track down every slasher ever made; don't bother with this film.
