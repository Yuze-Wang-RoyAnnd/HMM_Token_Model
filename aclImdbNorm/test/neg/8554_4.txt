not the best of the wip's, but not the worst either. i honestly feel guilty laughing at this film considering it had to be career lows for all involved. yet the acting, dialogue, preposterous scenarios, and the ever present boom mic get to me everytime and certainly add to its bad movie charm. as much of a linda blair fan i am, top (or topless) honors go to sybil danning. also, special kudos to henry silva, who's the only one in the cast who doesn't play his role too seriously. viewing, the film now, though, makes me look at stella stevens character more closely. she plays the head officer, and i have to wonder if this where hilary clinton decided to adopt her current look and demeanor. after all, i'm sure she had to look no further than her husband's video collection to find this film. not that i'm judging. i've seen it several times myself, and it all makes me wonder what would've happened if mr. clinton had been allowed to install a hot tub in the oval office. hmmm.
