this is the one movie that represents all that is bad in the movie business. the actors are pathetic and the script is awful. the special effects, if there are any, are so badly done that it would have been better to do it with cartoons instead. besides that it's great! i think the creators of the movie meant it to have humor, but the only time i was laughing was when i saw patrick s. with long hair and the colorful costumes that every one had. the scenes at the end were good but they were not a part of the movie. in the end you will ask yourself "why did i waste my time and money with that crap when i could have watched the plants growing or the clouds moving". i don't think that i am some critic or anything but this is a truly lame movie! do not watch! danger of stupidity overload!
