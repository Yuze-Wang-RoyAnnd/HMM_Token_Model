i've been trying to remember the name of this movie for years (not consecutively, of course). i saw it at the local dollar theater when i was 11, and it was so atrocious i almost walked out; i think i didn't realize one was allowed to leave before the movie ended. anyway, it stuck in my mind as just about the worst movie i saw growing up. i can finally give it the rating it deserves.<br /><br />1/10 (that was strangely satisfying)
