this film infuriated me for the simple fact that it was made only because shepherd was gay. the men who murdered him are clearly wicked. what happened to the poor man was truly horrible and a tragedy. however, where was hollywood when four religious white kids were executed, after being forced to perform a host of sex acts on their killers and each other, by two evil black men in wichita just two years ago? the celebrities only mug for the camera when it serves a political purpose. also, laramie is portrayed in a poor light by this pseudo-documentary, which of course is hardly surprising because they are the backward hicks who must be educated by omniscient and enlightened californians. still, it's always a treat to see laura linney.
