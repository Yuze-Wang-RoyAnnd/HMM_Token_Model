i checked out this video expecting to like it. wanting to like it. i like foreign films, i like beautiful cinematography, i know the critics liked this film (including my favorite, roger ebert), and i don't mind "slow" films.<br /><br />well, it's beautiful. that's about the best i can say for it. the plot is very thin, the shots are very long, the glances are very meaningful, the actors are very sincere, and it seems like a very long movie. i fell asleep half way though it, woke up, rewound the tape, tried again. it was a trial, but i made it to the end. i didn't like it any better for that.
