*this comment may technically contain "spoilers" but it sure doesn't contain surprises*<br /><br />my cousin and i rented this the other day hoping to get a good laugh at a typical amateur crappy excuse for a horror movie. unfortunately, we didn't get too many laughs, and we certainly didn't get too many scares either.<br /><br />plot outline: a plane containing a company head's daughter and some weird piece of technology crashes in an area where our furry friend lives, so the company head assembles a team of personalities, rather than skilled hunters, to recover it.<br /><br />for the first 3/4's of the movie, things get pretty boring. it mostly consists of shots of big foot lurking in the trees with the party members occasionally hearing him, and passing it off as nothing. we also see several shots of the party through big foot's point of view, and he apparently sees in thermal vision.<br /><br />to set up the plot, we have to watch sequences of the group sitting around the campfire talking about possibilities to justify the sasquatches existence and actions. "maybe he can dodge bullets...if he sees them coming". sure enough, we later see he can. "there are many uncharted lands that the sasquatch may live in. maybe this is one of them that was over-looked". and obviously it is. "maybe the sasquatch is angry because the plane hit one of his family members". and sure enough, thats the case. along with those scenes, there are a couple of "oh my god its the sasquatch oh wait its just you!" scenes, and sadly, they are among the scariest.<br /><br />then, finally, people start dying. well, 2 people at least. plus, the bodies of past victims are discovered. the death scenes are pretty lame. it mostly just leaves it to our imagination by showing the sasquatch grabbing them, then cutting to a different scene, but first, we are treated to some horrible screams off camera.<br /><br />then at last, we get to see the protagonist's final showdown with the monster. i gotta admit, i found it pretty exciting while it lasted. but alas, it's pretty short lived, and after we are treated to an ending that makes a half assed effort to seem cryptic. then, some closing text with a rather boring conclusion.<br /><br />i can't say i recommend this movie. it's not quite bad enough to give the mystery science theatre 3000, and its definitely not scary enough and boring to enjoy as a horror movie. just don't bother with it.
