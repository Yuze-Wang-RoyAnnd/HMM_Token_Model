with the terrible acting, the awful dialog, the multitude of bad humor, the crappy plot and over terrible film. this has to be the worst film i have ever viewed in my life, and i'm the king of finding bad movies. for the effects, they just threw fake blood on people and things, didn't spend the time to create wounds and make special effects worth anything. most people making low budget horror flicks at least do something like clads of tissue or something to make a gashing wound. the dialog was far from even decent and the acting was without direction or effort. they just threw some actors on a set and said, have at it. i swear i've seen better films from my film i class at school. how did this ever get a dvd release?
