don't believe the hype!<br /><br />i had to see why all the critics fawn over this movie. i have seen it and still don't get it. the plot is thin, very thin. after the movie was over, i still did not know the female lead characters name and one of the two male characters did not even have a name in the credits, he is credited as "the farmer". i did not care about the characters, so i did not care about the movie.<br /><br />the scenery and cinematography were brilliant, but so is the stuff on national geographic or the discovery channel.<br /><br />i can not recommend this movie to anyone.
