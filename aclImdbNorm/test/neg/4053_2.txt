in the only act of commonsense they have ever made, the nsw film & television office refused to fund this film. the producers kicked up a big stink & in a blaze of publicity took their production to victoria. apart from the lost work for technicians, nsw were lucky not to have been involved...<br /><br />the film fails on just about every level. the post modernism fails, the casting fails (what is rose byrne's character all about ? which 1 dimensional snarling nasty did hugo weaving channel ? what the hell is pia miranda's character doing?) and the story is a clich'ed mess of contradictions. in fact, the story runs like a dragged out prelude rather than a complete plot line.<br /><br />it might have had a chance if the "pop culture meets depression" style was better thought out and executed. if the casting was quirkier, if the style was less serious ... if just about everything was different. <br /><br />apart from the usual excellence in costume, design & cinematography (like most australian films), the film is just a total miscue. <br /><br />at a reported budget in excess of $7m, "the tender hook" is a symptom of the malaise of the australian film industry - the wrong people and the wrong projects are getting funded. compare this mess with "noise" (under $2m), or "cedar boys" (under $1m) and you get the idea. the tough, interesting films are struggling for funding and the flabby, overblown projects with name casts are getting the bucks.<br /><br />the funding bodies who invested in this deserve to go the same way as hugo weaving's character at the end of the film.
