yes, i realize that half a dozen other reviewers have called this movie "copying amadeus", but it cannot be said enough. scenes seemed to have been lifted directly from milos forman's script with only superficial changes. you can expect to see:<br /><br />-the maestro's arrogant scene ("i am the voice of god. everything else is meaningless!")<br /><br />-the maestro making fun of the mediocre composer's work (complete with raspberries & simulated flatulence, just like in amadeus)<br /><br />-the mediocre composer's dialogue with god ("why do you instill me with music but deny me the ability to compose?")<br /><br />-the musical dictation from the deathbed scene ("common time. begin with the violins... cough cough")<br /><br />-and the list goes on...<br /><br />the problem is even worse. not only were these scenes shamelessly copied, they weren't even done very well. jeepers, if you're going to rip off an original, at least you should try to improve upon it in your own creative way.<br /><br />no wait, there's something even worse than that. it's the fact that the director tried to beat the story of mozart into the story of beethoven. folks, beethoven was not a crass, vulgar slob the way this movie portrays him. furthermore, beethoven was not a babbling idiot who takes pointers from his copyist, a 23 year old music student. unfortunately, films like this are responsible for butchering history.<br /><br />and another thing, beethoven (in real life) never called it the "moonlight sonata" the way he does in the movie. that name was given by a confused critic some years after beethoven died, and unfortunately it stuck. but beethoven's original title was "quasi una fantasia".<br /><br />and another thing, when beethoven (in the movie) yells "b-flat! b-flat! b-flat!" and hits the note on the piano, he's hitting a white key!<br /><br />and another thinggg!!! beethoven (in real life) was completely deaf for several years before the composition of his 9th symphony. this movie shows him as having barely a minor disability (saying "what?" every other line, just enough to be annoying).<br /><br />aaand!! annnother!!! thingggg...!! the american accents...! oh never mind. just... never mind. i've wasted enough time on this already. go see "amadeus" again. then, if you want to see an interesting biopic on the life of beethoven see "immortal beloved" which takes poetic liberties, but at least they're interesting ideas. lastly, if you want to see something on the lighter side, check out "impromptu", a film about chopin. but aside from those three, i've never seen a good homage to a classical composer.
