greetings;<br /><br />i never thought i would see the day when i would be so disgusted by a movie that it would be a burden to finish it... i was always a fan of horror movies, b'c and c's included. but in this case it's hard to describe how a movie could fail to qualify for any letters in that scale...<br /><br />the movie is centered on a poorly developed back story, a mix of folklore with an after taste. and to top it up, the performance of the actors is questionable. horror b movies usually fall in two categories... 1) a gem that was under looked, and under funded 2) so bad it's funny, laugh or your money back. well this movie falls in between. i wasn't scare, didn't laugh... so i guess if you really need to see it you could but i recommend you don't...
