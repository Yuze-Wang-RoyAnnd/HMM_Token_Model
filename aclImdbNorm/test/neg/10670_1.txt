first things first, how can someone with his creativity on the right side believe in a movie like this. i saw this movie and after end of couple of hours was left scratching my head, what exactly is director trying to say.<br /><br />if its a thriller, there are no thrills, if its action, there is no action barring a chase sequence, there is no drama, and the much touted love story, it actually never takes off. no passion, emotion nothing is there.<br /><br />actually i never expected wonders from the movie, however after the bumper opening it took, i thought of giving it a chance. i have no problems with himesh reshamiya whatsoever, and i am not one of the guys who will bash him at every given opportunity. i went in with an open mind and came out with a closed one.<br /><br />let's not put the blame of himesh reshamiya, he is just a debutant actor. but direction, screenplay, writing, makeup, everything has gone for a toss.<br /><br />himesh is very stiff and would take a lot of time to come up the curve. he can do the don kind of roles. hansika is just a kid, and it shows on screen with her baby fat and the way she walks.<br /><br />the only actor who was good was the friend of himesh in the movie, i don't know his name, but he looks promising.<br /><br />watch it at your own risk, not even good to watch it for a time pass viewing.<br /><br />** strongly recommend to avoid this movie.**
