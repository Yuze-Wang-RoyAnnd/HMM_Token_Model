one of low budget horror schlockmeister actor, john carradine's more animated roles as a implied nazi scientist, who is turning humans into zombies to serve the reich. mindless scuffling brain dead, only able to obey the most simple of orders....bit like staff in mcdonalds.<br /><br />hitler isn't mentioned by name, since america wasn't at war at the time they was filmed, but it's pretty obvious who the bad guys are working for!<br /><br />there seems to be two types of zombies in film, the traditional voodoo type popular in the old black & white films of the 1930's and '40's. blank eyed and just following the commands of someone else as they stumble along. and then there is the type we know from later films like 'the night of the living dead' and 'the evil dead.' still roaming about but with only the intention to kill and eat the flesh and brains of their victims. both have their moments in various movies over the years. <br /><br />'revenge' features the former zombie type, although, these are particularly goofy looking and would look more at home in an old time freak shows as geeks as they bite the heads off chickens. one black zombie named lazarus with his wild hair, looks like a young don king.<br /><br />as to the plot, the evil doctor decides to make his wife a zombie along with the others and that's where he makes his mistake. even though he lets her keep her strappy heels as a nice womanly touch as he turns her into one of the living dead, she's not happy about it.<br /><br />it all goes horribly wrong and ends in tears, and the moral of the tale must be, never, ever, turn your wife into a zombie, it's just asking for trouble....<br /><br />the film is interesting enough and it quickly rolls along to a finish, but never rises above it's poverty row origins. not a patch on any true zombie classics but fun just the same.
