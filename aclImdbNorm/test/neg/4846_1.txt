i had never heard of dead man's bounty when i saw it at the dvd store a few weeks ago, and i thought i had stumbled upon an unrecognized gem, since it had val kilmer in it in a truly unique role. sadly, it wasn't more than ten or fifteen minutes into the movie that i realized that this is a disaster of epic proportions. the first clue you will see of how genuinely awful this movie is comes near the beginning, when you have a bunch of dirtbags in an old saloon laughing like a bunch of hyenas in a scene that goes on about five times too long. it's unbelievable how bad it is. and sadly, it doesn't get any better.<br /><br />val kilmer is featured prominently on the movie's cover box, maybe to trick you into thinking that he has a role in the film, but unfortunately his bizarre role as a dead man is overlooked in favor of focusing on a bunch of half-wit crooks and the most inept conceptualization of a unique town sheriff that i've ever seen in a movie. he's played by boguslaw linda, who is unable to or uninterested in covering his polish accent, immediately making it impossible that the movie is meant to take place in the american old west. <br /><br />does poland have this type of frontier past? i don't know. my knowledge of polish history is not my strong point, but i can tell you this, the sheriff, as he is known in the movie, is the worst representation of law enforcement that i can ever remember seeing in a movie. he is introduced in a truly ridiculous scene where he is wearing some kind of blindfold and a roomful of men take turns punching him in the face. before they start hitting him, he explains that they can each hit him once, and then, after the first round, they will each hit him again, and if he can identify who is throwing the punches, they lose. what the hell is this crap? i am completely at a loss to explain why a scene like this would ever be put into any movie. <br /><br />throughout the movie, the sheriff continues to appear more and more beaten and bruised and drunk and battered, until ultimately he does nothing but show up occasionally, stumbling on screen and mumbling "not
