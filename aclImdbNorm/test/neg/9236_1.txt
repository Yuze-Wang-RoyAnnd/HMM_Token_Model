altioklar's populist approach manifests itself in all his titles, from the worst to the best. he doesn't care (or has no clue) about art, all he cares is to make people think they've got a kick in the groin by watching his movies. the problem is, the effort is way too evident, and as events unfold with all the senseless exaggeration kneaded into them, the effort fails badly.<br /><br />on this "turkish" movie (who knows where the original or originals were made, since it felt extremely hollywoodish to me), altioklar is trying to be some sort of tarantino. (mr. tarantino, if you're reading this, please watch the movie for the best comedy of your life!) he doesn't use subtle moves to do that, all he does is to use extreme stuff, and it gets unbearably absurd and laughable.<br /><br />levent "uz"umc"u as the forensic guy with the cow-licked hair is just hilarious. i'm hoping to meet him in person and ask how he felt about this movie himself. because i really found the role insulting for him. demet evgar groping her genitalia was also uncalled for, and did nothing other than making everything look fake. another specifically idiotic aspect of this movie was the 100% faulty pace setting. when things need to be taken slowly, scenes flow abruptly. and at other times, it makes you sleepy to watch the slow ridicule going on.<br /><br />if altioklar is so deeply in love with lame hollywood superficiality, he should use michael sixarrows as his name instead. even such a move wouldn't be half as ludicrous as what he has done on this movie. he should first learn not to imitate directors whose levels he'll never approach, then realize he's not in hollywood, and then take private lessons from zeki demirkubuz or reha erdem on how to lay the flow of ideas out in the plot. this useless movie couldn't be saved even by those, but perhaps he can make watchable movies in the future by taking these steps.<br /><br />by the way i've seen some infamous failures such as propaganda and otostop, and i still can't divert from saying this one was the worst turkish movie ever.
