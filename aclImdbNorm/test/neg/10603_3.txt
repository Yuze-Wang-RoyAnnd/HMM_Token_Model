i really wanted to like this movie, but i just couldn't. it had the potential to be a really cool, hip remake of a cool show, but that's where it fell apart. it was too hip, too cool. first of all, all the cool lines and scenes were showcased in the preview trailers, which i'd seen lots of times. and the editing was very disjointed, so that the scenes didn't seem to flow together and they all seemed out of place. claire danes, who i love as an actress failed to make this her break through to the beyond high school acting roles. the only bright spot was giovanni ribisi as pete. his slightly stupid, yet actually smart style was funny and refreshing. overall though, i'd recommend just watching the previews instead of seeing the movie and wishing it was more.
