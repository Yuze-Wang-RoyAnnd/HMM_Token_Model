laughed my ass off but probably because i was stoned. that aside ... this is in no way a horror movie, there is no horror whatsoever in this entire movie and the plot holes are so huge that even a below average iq person would think it was stupid. on top of that, i am living in denmark and have been for all my life and can assure you that denmark is way too small a country that you need gpss and maps to find your way back if you got lost. i would estimate that unless you really put an effort into it you could never be farther away from town or other people than maximum 3 hours on foot. secondly i don't think any part of the movie, apart from two shots from copenhagen where none of the actors were in, were actually taped in denmark. the bog woman is talking swedish not danish. the helmet on the first bog body is brand new. the girl they find in the forest is hiding under a type of rock that does not exist in denmark. this is just stupid.
