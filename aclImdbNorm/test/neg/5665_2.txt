out of boredom and vast curiosity, i decided to check this show out today since my four year old niece loves it. i should have known that it was a show that only a four year old could like. the show was pretty bad.<br /><br />first of all, the show just wasn't funny. the laugh track went off at the most inappropriate times which was very annoying, especially since none of the jokes were funny. the laugh track went off at some point when the one kid who's the cameraman said "i'm going to go polish my lense". how the hell is that funny? the parts in it (like meat drumming) that were supposed to be funny was just stupid to anyone who's over the age of eleven.<br /><br />now, i have a feeling that four year olds are not the target audience. however, since i have a four year old niece who watches it, this sort of thing concerned me while i was watching it: it doesn't show very good behavior. in the episode i was watching, it shows sam stealing carly's sandwich and pushing her down to the ground, just so carly can stand up and do the same thing back to her. i would not want to see my niece acting that rude. i also don't like the idea of two young girls having a web show where they give out personal information... if this was real, there would be freaks all over her.<br /><br />this show would probably be good and funny to someone who's eleven or younger, but anyone older than that, just stay away from it. i'll give this two stars since i guess i can see how it can be funny to a kid.
