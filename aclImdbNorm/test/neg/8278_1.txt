for me, reviewing movies is an extension of my love of film--and of horror cinema, in particular. the reviews i've written thus far have been for films that i love, respect, and admire, and i have eagerly rewarded them with glowing accolades and perfect-ten ratings. a life-long horror movie fan, it is a tremendous pleasure for me to be able to share with others my thoughts and ideas about great horror films, and to, hopefully, have a hand in exposing people to movies they may not otherwise seek out. i only recently began reviewing films for the imdb, and it was my initial intention to concentrate only on my own personal favorites, examining those which i believe are of substance and of lasting value to the horror genre. however, the existence of films like "graduation day" is, without pun, a thorn in my side. completely devoid of any merit whatsoever, this 1981 hodgepodge of unformed ideas is amateurishly directed, poorly acted, and, in every sense, an unmitigated embarrassment to horror cinema. during the brief couple of years before and after this movie's release, we saw the appearance of domestic (and canadian) films such as "halloween ii," "prom night," "terror train," "madman," "my bloody valentine," "the prowler," "just before dawn," "final exam," and "hell night," among others. these films, though of varying degrees of quality, clearly strove to achieve something in terms of story line, plotting, acting, direction, and overall tone. not every movie released during this bountiful season of the slasher era would be of the artistic merit or commercial success of the original "halloween" or "friday the 13th," but these films were all well-made and clearly contributed to the ongoing development of horror cinema. "graduation day," an abysmal farce about a masked killer stalking members of a high school track team, was directed by herb freed, whom one can only hope will never again attempt to besmirch the horror genre with such a travesty. the task of creating worthwhile horror films is best left to those who have a genuine love and respect for the genre. this movie fails miserably on every possible level, not the least of which are dreadfully wooden performances, dime-store special effects, an irritating musical score, and, most of all, a story lacking even the slightest hint of tension or suspense. a pointless exercise in how to waste film, "graduation day" is an utter disgrace to horror cinema.
