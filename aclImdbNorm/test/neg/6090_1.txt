thankfully i watched this film alone, enabling me to fast-forward through the worst scenes (aka most of the film, actually). ok, some of it is not all bad, with partially good photography (even some of the under water scenes) and at times not too bad directing. but it still doesn't save the incredibly poor script and way worse acting. additionally, when i don't find the movies "hottie" to be all that, even the wannabe-sexy love making scenes get dull. really dull! and for the drama: you know it's always a bad sign when you get to dislike all of the characters so much you really don't care who lives and who dies.<br /><br />if you still haven't gotten tired of the reality series survivor, you may find something to your liking in this movie. if not, stay well clear!
