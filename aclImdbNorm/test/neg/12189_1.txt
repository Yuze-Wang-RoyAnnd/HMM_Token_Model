it's a long time ago i saw this movie and still it's one of the worst i've ever seen. i like lots of kind of movies; sci-fi, action, drama, thrillers and sometimes even horror. not a combination of two. this could have been a wonderful movie, but they all blew it up. i didn't want to see this movie, but friends of mine insisted to watch it. i didn't know it was such a crap. i loved the first part, in which clooney and tarantino drove through texas, killing everybody on their way (especially the scene with the liquor shooting was excellent), but at its turning point, in the titty twister bar everything changed. stupid vampires took over the place and what could have been a perfect gangster movie became a stupid horror movie like 'nightmare on elmsteet'. if you like horror, watch a real horror movie. and when you love bloodstolling thrillers don't watch it at all, you will be very disappointed at the end.
