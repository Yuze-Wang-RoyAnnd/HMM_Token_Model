it is sad that schwarzenegger was the best thing about this production, especially considering the fact that he had not yet come into his own, and was still as stiff as cardboard in his dialog delivery.<br /><br />actually, this isn't as bad as some critics say, but it isn't good, either. it is amusing, and does play like a poor country cousin of the conan line, making it a conflicted, uneven, poor work. and speaking of poor, the quality is terrible, due to the era in which this was filmed, but that is not the only reason.<br /><br />the story herein is inferior, even to the conan line, but moreover, it loses itself in the "red sonja must be dominated by big strong schwarzenegger" ploy, and entirely forgets its purpose, if it ever had one.<br /><br />it's entertaining, but in a low-budget, guilty-pleasure "b" kind of way.<br /><br />it rates a 4.2/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
