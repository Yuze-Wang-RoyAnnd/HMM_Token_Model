quentin in my opinion has written and directed only really one good movie and that was the multiple award winning pulp fiction. however, most of films, especially of recent, have been real real turkeys. people still rate him and his stuff today and i really can't see why. there are many other directors and writers nowadays producing far better entertainment in all aspects of their movies. from this point on, i shall not believe the hype that is a tarantino movie.<br /><br />inglorious was too long and worse still you felt it. the humor was, well, minimal and not that humorous. the violence was nothing new (minus the end scene). the dialog was sometimes very very drawn out.<br /><br />for some they'll love this movie; and for others they'll hate it.<br /><br />... and i thought the subject matter of nazis was finally put to bed with the awesome 2004 german movie der untergang.
