this is the worst work ever of daniel day lewis..... i can not believe that in the same year he made this awful movie and my left foot..... please stay away from this movie....this is a movie only for argentine people as a curiosity... the plot is impossible to understand...... the writer thinks that in argentine all the people speaks in english... of course the patagonia bring a very good frame for the photo shooting of the film, but that is not enough reason to see this movie.... i repeat , only if you are very fan of daniel day lewis, or if you want to see the south of argentine, part of the patagonia, and you do not have enough money to travel yourself.......
