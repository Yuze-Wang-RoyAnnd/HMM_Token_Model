for a really wonderful movie, you could also try seeing the movie about saint francis of assisi - good for any audience. best thing i liked about this movie was the mexico landscape, & it gets the movie up to a 2. i was surprised that these actors didn't have terrible sunburn, they were so were not desert dwellers. and moses is said to have a speaking impediment, but certainly not here. even the "miracle" scenes were contrived & un-believable. and what's the point if you can belief anything in a tv story? talk about dumbing down, i thought this hallmark-made movie was pathetic, & i can see why others hate hollywood. i don't, just some of these corporate profit grubbers. you don't have to be any kind of religious to benefit from "jesus of nazareth", but for this waste of celluloid you need to be bored, with nothing to do, dumbed-down & religious. and for a real movie experience, try "short cut to nirvana", a very highly rated film.
