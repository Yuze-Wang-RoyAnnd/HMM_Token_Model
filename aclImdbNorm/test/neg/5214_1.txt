(chances are, i'm gonna spoil valuable plot points while writing this and because i can't determine and don't really care what you think is a valuable plot point, then if you are thinking of watching this film and have an issue with learning such things, then i suggest you hop right on to the next review.) you know, i don't mind the cult films being filed under the "cult" section. and people who believe it can go there and get their fill of the "reality". i mean, is it too much to ask that the overtly pseudo-christian propaganda films be filed with the other special interest movies? <br /><br />i couldn't have been more flabbergasted had pat robertson made a porn movie. (or would that be "flubbergasted"?) <br /><br />it was bad enough that there was an egregiously insufficient count of kicking and punching in this. it was bad enough that the same story has been done repeatedly in much better ways. it was bad enough that it wasn't filed under special interest, with other cult films. it was bad enough that it somehow is receiving nods for being "realistic" as if we live in the world where towns get possessed by the "debbil" and the really profound and nasty evil isn't done by human beings -- usually in the name of religions based on the god of abraham. it was bad enough having to simply shut the thing down because people were complaining so loudly that it was awful.<br /><br />no, the really bad part was when one of our guests stood up after we finally had to just turn the damn thing off, and declared "i for one would like to see something really violent or pornographic now, just to get that out of my head. preferably both, if you have it." and we had just met her.
