i seemed to find the trailers better than the movie. they did their job and made me interested in watching unknown. the interest waned early. a simple premise laking in scenery. five men wake up in a chemical warehouse not knowing why they are there; let alone know how in the hell they got there. confusion and paranoia brings with it fear and distrust. the men learn that a kidnapper is on his way with plans to kill his hostages. now the men size each other up trying to distinguish if all are victims and who may actually be one of the kidnappers. the cast includes: jim caviezel, greg kinnear, joe pantoliano, bridget moynahan, barry peppper, david selby and adam rodriguez.
