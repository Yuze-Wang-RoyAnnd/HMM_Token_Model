one of the latest (disaster) movies from york entertainment, "el chupacabra" excels in making its viewer want to die after having wasted two hours watching it. this movie appears to have been filmed with a spare camcorder normally used for birthday parties. the only reason i could tell that it wasn't was because of certain scenes where the cameraman's shadow is in the frame.<br /><br />just about every aspect of cinema is plagued by this movie, and i'm sure that it has set the film industry back another ten years. the actors are borderline retarded, often pausing while they wait for the off-screen cue-card to change. the actor that plays navarro not only slurs and skips word in his dialogue, but stumbles through the swiss-cheese plot line with a squinting and confounded look on his face. other actors break the forth wall and overall show the acting skill of a twelve-year old kid doing a science project in his backyard.<br /><br />my friends and i purposefully search out the worst possible movies, and this one gave us more than we bargained for. the humorous parts are unfunny and the rest is riddled with horrible clich'es and plot holes. as one friend so humbly put it, this movie is the aborted fetus of the industry. i would highly suggest this film for people like me that purposely search for these movies, but for all others, beware!
