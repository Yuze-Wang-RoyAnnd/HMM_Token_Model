yes, we all know about dan schneider's odd little fascination with making shows with young kids and icarly is no exception. see young girls wiggle their toes and stick their tongues out for the camera and wear skimpy clothes and bikini's. yes, it makes you wonder if these shows were made for teens or for some older degenerate crowd. either way the show isn't that good when compared to dan schneiders other shows like the far superior amanda show & drake and josh.<br /><br />the show is about a brother and sister (carly and spencer) living alone and having to get by on their own while their father is off in the army and their mother is strangely absent from their lives. carly has a mean spirited friend named sam and they do a very well produced, award winning web show called icarly with their little school friend freddie. the episodes deal with their lives in and around the web show and their hi jinx at school.<br /><br />carly shay is a young, all knowing web personality/ business woman/ producer played by miranda cosgrove, a young actress who relies on talking very very loudly and fast to get her point across and making odd faces. her brother spencer is a somewhat mean-spirited, dim-wit and eccentric artist played by jerry trainor, who tries a bit to hard to be like jim carrey and whose comedy style seems to be aimed at the young male audience who'd like this type of joey gladstone humor. then there's sam puckett, an unlikable, mean little, lying thief of a brat who needs an attitude adjustment played by jeanette mccurdy who clearly wears hair extensions as you can see them disappear then reappear from scene to scene. and finally there's freddie benson the web shows nerdy cameraman and technical adviser, who has a major crush on carly but will obviously get nowhere with her who's played by nathan kress.<br /><br />other secondary characters come and go such as freddies mother, carly's grandfather, annoying teachers and many of their annoying little school friends to round out the cast. most of the comedy is mean spirited, like blowing up lewbert the doorman as a gag, throwing a water balloon at a teacher and knocking over the table of young girl scouts selling cookies. all of the adults come off as complete idiots while the children are all knowing, and certain main characters have absolutely no morals. lying, cheating, stealing and violence all are acceptable in this children's show created and written by dan schneider, yes... it's a children's show! what more could the young viewers ask for?? well, with dan schneider we can expect to have the young girls dress in tight clothes and bikini's and do some odd things like sticking their tongues out for the camera and eating banana's.<br /><br />shows like this are just what the young crowd likes though and i guess no worse then any of the other garbage nick shovels at its young crowd. there's always fans to be found for anything seen on tv, at least this is a bit better then most of the stuff seen on nick like that horrible naked brothers show.
