i was looking forward to seeing bruce willis in this, especially since i remember being mesmerised by the original when i was young.<br /><br />this movie is a perfect example of how movie companies can take a very good story and dumb it down until it's just another formula ridden hype of the fabled american law enforcement system/army vs, (the russians.... no sorry the cold war is over, make that with the russians) vs the terrorists, similar to probably 50 other movies.<br /><br />furthermore it treats its audience like a bunch of idiots. the choice of weapon is well, plain ridiculous, are we seriously expected to believe that the world's most feared and experienced hit man/terrorist would select that for an assasination?<br /><br />the whole point of the original story was the tense dual of intellects between the ordinary detective who is given the responsibility and the professional who crafts a ruthless but elegant plan to reach his target and then get away. none of that survived. all we have is the tired old american cia/fbi/army vs the evil terrorist plot, we've all seen 1000 times before.<br /><br />but of course the movie company's mba's realised that a new intellectual angle here would lose them revenue from the short attention span gang, so the answer is ......bruce willis, big explosions and a crippled plot. they assume the american audience wont be able to relate to a threat to a foreign statesperson (where is france on the map afterall) so it has be an american!<br /><br />another example of a movie defiled by the boardroom.
