after seeing shootfighter 1, and the buckets of blood they shed, i was ready for another rousing jaunt of open handed heart massage, and chiropractics in a cage. but nooooooo, this was like the barney version of the first movie, with that lamer from the karate kid. at least bolo yeung still kicks booty, although he needs to do more movies like bloodsport and caddyshack.
