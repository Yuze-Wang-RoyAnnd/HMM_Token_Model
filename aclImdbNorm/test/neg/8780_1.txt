i very well remember the bad press this film got because of the producers' court order against clayton moore using the name "lone ranger" or donning his black mask at personal appearances. quite apart from any consideration of the film's quality, this was the absolute height of nearsighted arrogance and stupidity on the part of the producers and their attorneys. and i suspect that the lesson was well-learned after this film tanked, which was widely perceived as some sort of karma for the jerks responsible for the court order against moore.<br /><br />in more recent times it has become the custom, when reviving a legendary film or tv project, to invite the original star or stars for cameo appearances, and rightly so. show some respect, you idiots! and even if they turn up their noses at the prospect, which has happened, at least the offer was made. this is proof positive that film producers, studio executives, and entertainment attorneys are not quite too stupid and arrogant to be taught by example.
