stripes, an army training camp comedy starring bill murray and directed by ivan reitman, is a favourite of mine. meatballs, a summer camp 'romp' starring bill murray and directed by ivan reitman, is a complete waste of time. it takes a considerable effort for four screenwriters to produce a movie (the word 'comedy' infers a work with mirth aforethought) as witless, anaemic and boring as this.<br /><br />murray evidently reached the same conclusion during filming, but his usually reliable powers of improvisation escape him and his flailing attempts to inject life into proceedings just add to the embarrassment - the "it really doesn't matter" chanting scene is excruciating. it doesn't help that the supporting cast is bereft of talent - the funniest thing about them is their hair, but then meatballs was made in 1979. ("and introducing chris makepeace as rudy" announce the opening credits. no, not the chris makepeace?!).<br /><br />mercifully, reitman rectified his mistake two years later for stripes. murray's shtick is so much funnier when he's larking around with the likes of john candy, warren oates and john larroquette. ditch this and watch that.
