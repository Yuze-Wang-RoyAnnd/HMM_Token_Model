i can't believe i'm wasting my time with a comment - but this movie is weirdly bad. if 20 different directors were brought in to film different parts of the movie without having any idea of the storyline being filmed by the other directors, this is pretty much the result i would expect.<br /><br />i also think some of the scenes were spliced out of order - things don't always seem to progress in order. the movie acts like we're already supposed to know about half the characters.<br /><br />and steve guttenberg tries to do manic, a-la-robin williams comedy in this movie. ewww. and the whole premise of putting an ex-con in charge of a bunch of kids just doesn't seem realistic in this day and age.
