this movie is a real low budget production, yet i will not say anything more on that as it already has been covered. i give this movie a low rating for the story alone, but i met the director the night i saw the film and he gave me an additional reason to dislike the movie. he asked me how i enjoyed it and i told him that it was not easy to like. my main objection was the lack of foundation for the relationship between the two main characters, i was never convinced that they were close. i also told him that the scene where the main characters were presented as children becoming friends was too late in the film.<br /><br />he told me that the flashback scenes were not in the original script. that they were added because he felt like i did that the two main characters did not appear close. he went on to explain that these scenes were not filmed to his satisfaction as they were out of money. i agree that they did not do much for the film.<br /><br />another fact about the movie, that i was not aware of, is the actor who had the lead wrote the script based on his own personal experience. this is usually a bad move as some writers do not take into consideration the emotional reaction the viewer. the story is so close to home that the writer make too many assumption as to the audience's reaction to his own tragedy. and the story is tragic. however, it did not work for me as i never cared for any of the characters, least of all the lead. what was presented were two evil people out to make a buck by any means, regardless who gets hurt. when ms. young's character decides to give up he evil ways, it appears that she does so because she is ineffective, not because she knows she is doing wrong. if the movie has a message then i suspect that only the writer is aware of it.
