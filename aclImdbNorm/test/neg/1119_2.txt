the only reason to see this film is sung hi lee, the stunning model/actress from korea who plays "muka laka miki" (give me a break) in this otherwise crappy movie. <br /><br />she is given a fairly substantial part in this film and seems to handle it well, though none of the parts is really interesting or well written. even for a national lampoon's movie, it's really stupid. stupid humor is one thing, but just stupid is another. i may have laughed once, and that was probably just me being polite.<br /><br />warning: watching this movie may be bad for your health on two counts: 1) it, like, totally sucks. 2) sung hi lee is so freaking gorgeous she just might blow your brains out of the back of your head upon first sight.<br /><br />so don't say i didn't warn you...
