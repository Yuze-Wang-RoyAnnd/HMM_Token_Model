this mess starts off with a real tank running over a car, intercut with images of a toy tank. this is followed by a family driving home from a birthday party without saying anything. the unexplained tank and the untalkative family take up, i swear, over 10 minutes of film. finally, the family sees a car after it has been in a wreck and decides to report it to the proper authorities, only to find that the citizens of the town are all hiding in their houses, and the cops are hiding in the police station. interesting? almost. when the town folk come out due to the family's presence, we learn that both the writer and editor are conspiring to substitute suspense with incomprehensible storytelling techniques in the hopes that the audience's inability to tell what's going on will somehow bring unease upon the audience... and it works! ... but not in the way they thought it would. i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all. the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense. not in a fun david lynch sort of way, but a sort of i-walked-in-during-the-middle-of-a-boring-conversation sort of way. over the course of the next hour, we learn that the movie-makers try to bore us into being afraid by showing tediously mundane scenes combined with the above-mentioned "what's going on?" type scenes.<br /><br />the plot involves something along the lines of gentle-looking old folks putting children into a trance through the power of satan and then bringing them to a party to play with toys, and an even more sinister intention, and it's up to a group of white men (everybody's white in the movie) to grab their guns and save the day, and a tag-a-long eye candy woman who whines at the drop of a hat. they look for the kidnapped children by looking in random places and yelling the kids' names.<br /><br />this is a great horror movie for any person who has never seen a horror movie because that person is frightened by the mere thought of satanism, paganism, wicca, or even catholicism due to a lifetime diet of brainwashing from the trinity broadcast network. this represents satanism as elderly folks in halloween costumes with candles while mingling at a party, in front of an ankh. replete with a priest spouting completely made-up nonsense about satanists, while calling them "witches." the message that anything that isn't protestantism can be all thrown into the same category for easy condemnation.<br /><br />about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush, almost always in olde english, and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words.<br /><br />highlights include a guy laughing at the idea of little green men for a solid 3 minutes, a family staring out of the windows of their car without talking for 10 minutes while listening to elevator muzak. a priest studying satanism for 4 minutes with ooh-so-scary drawings of demons to scare the church lady crowd. random shots of dolls. random shots of children. paint instead of blood at every chance. film school level dream sequences. introduces unimportant characters who do nothing before they exit. sometimes, they act as if the nothing that they're doing is a big deal.<br /><br />the directing is sloppy at best. an example of the directing includes a scene at the beginning where a man and woman are kissing and the man pulls away to look lovingly into her eyes and some dark red paint falls on her cheek. looking up, they see that it's not blood, but droplets from a girl's snowcone. snowcones are ice and colored / flavored water, and would not have produced droplets of the same texture as paint, not to mention the fact that her snowcone was a bright reddish-orange. hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing. it then cuts to an alternate shot of the man, woman, and girl and shows that she's standing about four feet away from them, so the snowcone wouldn't have dripped on the woman even if she'd held her snowcone out over the woman's face. way to go, editor! of course, the acting is blah. the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.<br /><br />the director's most offensive technique is to give the actors no motivation and then go out for lunch as the unblinking eye of the camera leers as the actors make fools of themselves.<br /><br />and, finally, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell.
