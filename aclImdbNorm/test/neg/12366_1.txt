i hope this isn't a portent of things to come. high-definition camcorders are getting cheaper all the time (although i wouldn't swear that's what was used here), so it's open season for all the wannabe scorseses and tarantinos.<br /><br />there is no hiding the cheapness of this stinker, and calling it a 'film' would be doing the industry a big disservice. the photography is of a standard you would expect on a family outing to the zoo. i could build me a new house with all the wooden acting. what's remarkable about that is that nobody stands out as the worst. they are all equally terrible. like a whole bunch of ben afflecks. or steven seagals.<br /><br />what hooked me was the title. i'm a sucker for this sort of thing, like frankenhooker, or monsturd. frankenhooker was pretty bad, too, but at least i got some laughs out of it, and the acting was merely bad, not awful. i can't comment on monsturd as i've yet to get hold of a copy of it.<br /><br />anyway, i hope the people who made this didn't make any money from it. else they might be encouraged to try it on again. please, guys, pawn the camcorder and go back to your regular job.
