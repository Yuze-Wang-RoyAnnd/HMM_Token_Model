it was poorly shot. looks like a rush job, last minute casting is obvious. writing is very weak. good for stage, not film. i feel bad for andrew mccarthy. he's a very good actor who has not been getting good roles lately. this role was not for him. maybe glad it has been picked up yet. on the festival circuit this film shall stay.
