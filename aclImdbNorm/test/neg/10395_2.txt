i just rented blackwater valley exorcism because the cover and pictures looked terrifying, and i don't normally watch movies that are automatically released onto dvd, but this looked so interesting and scary! i was very much in the mood for a good scary film and to me, possession is one of the scariest subjects to watch or learn about. just look at the exorcist or the exorcism of emily rose, both terrific movies that made break-throughs not only horror wise, but story as well.<br /><br />blackwater valley exorcism is about a girl, isabelle, who from the get go is automatically possessed, so we can't even tell what kind of a person she was to begin with. but a former wife beater turned priest is on the case with a gardener...? i know... i know. then they go into several other stories with the priest and isabella's sister, and the priest hit the sister and messed around with isabelle? i'm not sure, then we get into a story with isabelle's dad and his questioning of his wife's faithfulness to him.<br /><br />i mean, the story just goes into too many directions and wasn't well developed at all. not to mention that the exorcism didn't seem authentic at all and more of a just scare your pants off type of a film, which i didn't like at all because i couldn't take it seriously. whoever directed and wrote this clearly had no idea where to go or how to direct the story well, so i wouldn't really recommend this.<br /><br />2/10
