i was looking for a documentary of the same journalistic quality as frontline or "fog of war" (by errol morris). instead i was appalled by this shallow and naive account of a very complex and disturbing man and his regime: alberto fujimori. this movie should be called "the return of fujimori". the director presumes she made a "perfect" movie because alienates both pro and anti-fujimori factions when in fact it is a very biased and unprofessional piece of work. <br /><br />the movie has few crucial facts wrong: <br /><br />1) she uses the so called "landslide" election of 1995 in which fujimori was re-elected with 65% of the vote, as an example of the massive popular support of fujimori. but we all now know to be the fruit of a very organized electoral fraud.<br /><br />2) the movie states that sendero luminoso (shining path) killed 60,000 people. in fact, the truth commission's final report states that there were 69,280 deaths due to political violence in peru. 33% of those were caused by sl. that leaves the other 67% in the hands of the police, military and other groups. the fact that she uses the same misleading information that fujimori has been using for 10 years it is another example of how terrible this movie is. <br /><br />for any person with some education on peruvian politics and history, fujimori is clearly a consummated manipulator, a delusional character and remorseless egomaniac. his regime was very far from being democratic. he is still a menace to peruvians. despite these facts the director lets fujimori tell the story. not only on how he wants the camera to be positioned but the narrative and direction of the film seem to be part of his political agenda. he always seems to have the last word. there are no journalistic "cojones", just soft questions and unchallenged remarks. where is oriana fallaci when we need her? the director, when questioned after the screening, didn't hide the fact that she was deeply impressed by fujimori, his charm and intelligence. yes, she has been definitely charmed by him, and you can tell by looking at this film. it's obvious she has a very hard time to digest the multitude of facts that point towards his responsibility on the corruption, murder and deception that took place. she assured the gasping audience that fujimori was really a "patriot" when few moments earlier, one of the leading peruvian journalists was very adamant in telling us that fujimori was, above all, a "traitor". she went on to say that despite all the accusations not "a single dollar" was found on any bank account on his name, etc, etc. it was like hearing again the same gang of ruthless thugs that ruled the country for 10 years defending their master. it was a sad moment for journalism.<br /><br />this film makes injustice to history. it is an insult to hundreds of dead people, disappeared or unjustly incarcerated by fujimori's regime. no wonder she later confessed that all the peruvian intellectuals she befriended while making the movie felt betrayed by it. unbiased? the words "oportunistic", "na"ive" and "denial" come to my mind instead.
