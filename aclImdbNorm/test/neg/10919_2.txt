i am writing this with 10 minutes left before the film finishes. i feel comfortable writing it now, because unfortunately i know exactly how this film is going to end.<br /><br />the premise is simple enough, rabid dog on the loose in a small town, kills people. great - simple plot for a good fun camp 80s horror.<br /><br />uhh ..no.<br /><br />the main problem is this is based on a book (stephen king) and you can tell that is should not have really been adapted to film, at least not with the same plot. why? cuz its boring! the first 45 minutes tries to build depth to its main characters and create suspense. it however lasts too long (half the film!) - the characters are unlikeable and we never care for them anyway, and it just about creates zero suspense. the easiest film (according to plot and time) to compare this to it the classic jaws. everything that jaws does right, cujo does wrong. jaws created good characters and a genuine feeling of dread. cujo does neither. jaws effectively creates a scary, creepy villain in its shark. cujo has a dirty st bernard running about growling and jumping, and not a lot else. jaws is exciting and unpredictable. cujo is a tireless bore that remains predictable right to the end.<br /><br />also confusing is the plethora of subplots that just act as boring red herrings to the films main plot.<br /><br />if this film was rewritten for the big screen and had a better director this could have been good. but it wasn't. it was a waste of 90 minutes of my life.<br /><br />people on here are saying this is one of the best king adaptations - im sorry you could not be more wrong. the mist is a hundred times better, thinner is 10 times better and even the one with the cats is twice as good! this in my opinion is one of the worst! the only good thing was the action scenes with the dog looked real, even though they were dull.<br /><br />films ended now, and it didn't get any better. avoid.
