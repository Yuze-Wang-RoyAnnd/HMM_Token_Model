the man (gaston modot) and the young girl (lya lys) go through the film consumed by passion for each other. they long to be together but their moments together are constantly interrupted. the film is strewn together with imagery and comes to a halt after an hour.........do the lovers find happiness....?..<br /><br />the film starts interestingly with footage of scorpions but you soon realize that its all a pretentious piece of nonsense. it's made as a silent film with occasional dialogue and it has a non-stop soundtrack playing that at one point is so irritating that you will turn the sound down and want to watch it as a silent film. the continuous drum rolls must have driven cinema audiences mad. there are some genuinely funny moments, eg, when the man kicks a dog and when he knocks over a blind man. unfortunately, this humour is carried out in the name of art so its just pseudo nonsense. the film is crap.
