i often wonder how movies like this even get made, and the most shocking part is that people actually pay to watch them.<br /><br />with aksar it appears as though the director made up the story as he went along, adding twists and turns when he liked, no matter how ludicrous they were. the script was non existent with inane dialogs such as "jo sheena roy pehenti hai, wahee fashion hota hai" and "yeh versace hai madam" (yeah right).<br /><br />every one of the characters was shallow and underdeveloped. acting was awful. constumes (lycra for udita and awful suits for a stocky emran), locales (the numerous houses that were used for interiors did not even vaguely resemble a victorian mansion), screenplay etc etc, just one word- rubbish.<br /><br />for those people who love hashmi and his movies, watch it. as for me, i'll never get those two and a half hours back. the only redeeming factor was some of the music which was decent.
