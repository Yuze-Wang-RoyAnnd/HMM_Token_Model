all right, there's no way to sugarcoat this. the plot was ridiculous, the premise was ridiculous, the acting was unconscionable, the effects were laughable and all of the outdoor scenes appear to have been filmed in new york's central park. that having been said, there was something about this movie that i couldn't walk away from. maybe it was the atmosphere, or maybe it was the evil super-vixen or the amazon wenches.<br /><br />anyway i'm not one to sit on the margins and criticise without pointing out a few redeeming qualities, so here they are.<br /><br />a violent off-shoot of the women's lib movement is portrayed in a wilderness setting (central park, of course), and all of the masochistic young men out there will be very impressed. furthermore, some of the scenes in which certain characters lose consciousness are amusingly dramatic (you'll note that i write dramatic, rather than convincing).<br /><br />all i can say is that some people like b movies and i'm one of them. if you're one of them too, then give it a go. cheers, mr kincaid. this is one for the ages.
