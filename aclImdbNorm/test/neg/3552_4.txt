a plot that is dumb beyond belief. however, that said, it must be admitted the lead actors go at their roles as though it were shakespeare. and that is as it should be. it isn't their fault the writer seems to be in a coma.<br /><br />hats off to what is really a very cunning performance by joanna kerns. she proves that just because it isn't on the page doesn't mean a role can't be seized and dug into. and she does so with gusto. good for her.<br /><br />ditto to christine elise who is called upon to be little more than confused and weepy, but goes way beyond what is asked of her by the script.<br /><br />and to grant show as well. a graduate of daytime and prime time soaps (ryan's hope, melrose place). he is always versatile and underrated. his primary drawback seems to be his impossible-to-ignore good looks. he is a sturdy, well grounded actor capable of much more than he is generally given the opportunity to do.<br /><br />the rest of the cast is basically window dressing.<br /><br />the direction is adequate and the script, as i alluded to, is fairly idiotic.<br /><br />watch this one to enjoy three good actors in the leads taking delight in performing some much needed scenery chewing. it's fun.
