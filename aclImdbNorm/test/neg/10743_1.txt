i had enjoyed the masters of horror series until i came upon this infantile dung heap. <br /><br />this anti-bush propaganda piece masquerading as a horror film comes off like an episode of the original batman done by michael moore. political satire should be clever, this however, pulls a ten on the simpleton scale with all the style and credibility of an l. ron hubbard film.<br /><br />in its campy, inane way, it accuses the republicans of stealing elections, going to war for absolutely no reason and treating servicemen and women as mere cannon fodder. it even takes a swipe at the second amendment and religion. all that was missing was caesar romero as the president cackling in glee about how he orchestrated 9/11.<br /><br />i guess the ending was supposed to be the "we support our troops" moment, but i think they would be more offended than pleased with the entire endeavor.<br /><br />i'm sure the hollywood elites are sitting in their malbu mansions patting each other on the backs for this "pithy" work while the misinformed anti-war drones hail it as genius. <br /><br />time to get fitted with new tinfoil hats kids.
