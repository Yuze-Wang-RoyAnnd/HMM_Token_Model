i've sat through less painful operations than the time i spent watching this film. <br /><br />if you give it a try thinking it's going to be something in the vein of a guy ritchie flick.....think again! the production, dialogue, acting, script , film work and plot were about the worst i've ever seen in a film. my fave part in all honesty was the closing credits. in all the history of cinema has there never been a better excuse for turning off the tv and going out and doing something better with your life.<br /><br />have root canal work done rather than wasting your time and money on this!
