there wasn't much thought put into the story line on many fronts. this is a good action movie but that's about it.<br /><br />- the movie states that the lycans were kept to protect the vampires during the day. yet they are kept in cages and have collars on their necks. so they can't turn into their wolf form or do anything any other slave can't do. how does this protect the vampires during the day? who are they protecting the vampires from? the uncontrollable lycans? the slaves in human form are nothing more than peasants.<br /><br />- my understanding is that vampires are immortals and don't age. yet sonya ages from child to adult. do they just stop aging at a certain age? i understand that viktor is old because he was turned (as explained in the second movie). but vampire babies age? strange.<br /><br />- i didn't realize that vampires needed torches to see at night. yet we see them carrying torches throughout the movie.<br /><br />- silver was the only thing that was supposedly able to harm lycan. yet wooden steaks fired from the huge crossbows kill the lycan too.<br /><br />these are just some of the things that show just a lack of thought put into the story telling.
