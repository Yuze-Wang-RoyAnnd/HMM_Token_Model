there are many reasons i'm not a fan of fact based films, but more than any other is how the filmmakers give themselves creative license over the story. if they have such great imaginations then why not use that talent to make something original? otherwise stick to the facts. this could have been an okay movie if only they had done just that. ed gein was an insanely frightening human being. it's been said if you were to take michael myers, jason voorhees and leatherface, wrap them into one person, ed gein would still be sicker/scarier. so why can't someone make a movie about him that can convey this? when will they figure out that reality is ultimately scarier than fiction? <br /><br />i've read books and watched news programs about him and, now i'm not a screenwriter or anything, but i believe there's enough documentation on gein that it shouldn't take a whole lot to write a story about all these atrocities he committed without creating murders that had never even been documented. i'm aware that he was only found guilty of 2 murders but with all the evidence found in his home and barn there should have been plenty of other ways to put this film together rather than using the deputy's relationship with his mother, and girlfriend as filler, and far too much of it.<br /><br />i guess what i'm wondering is this... why at the end of the movie did i know more about the supporting characters than i did about ed gein? why didn't we get to know his mother, father and brother and the relationships between them... what made him the psychopath he was... what abuse he endured as a child that may have contributed to the man he became? instead, the only thing we got of his childhood were flashes of him as a little boy... running.<br /><br />in the end i give it 4/10 stars. thats 2 for the gore and 2 for kane hodder. even though it was kind of bad casting in my opinion, considering gein was a smallish man, and possibly effeminate and hodder is anything but small and nowhere near what i would consider feminine. maybe i was just excited because he was jason voorhees.
