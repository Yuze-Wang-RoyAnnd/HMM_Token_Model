this is the most stupid movie ever made. the story is laughable. his wife and kid think he's insane. then they don't. then it turns out he is and i think they knew it all along. there is a dog named ned that causes some problems and i think it's all his fault...so does jim carey. god only knows why virginia madsen took this role...this is a career sinker. i think the target audience for this is 11 and 12 year olds. and that adds up to 23. or maybe it's for 8 and 10 years olds which also adds up to 23. or maybe it's for really dumb 23 year olds. or maybe really dumb 32 year olds because that's 23 in reverse. or maybe 46 year olds would enjoy it because half of that is 23. i think looking up things on the internet about the number 23 would be more entertaining than this movie, unless you wanted to see a comedy.
