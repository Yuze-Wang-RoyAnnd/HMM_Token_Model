4 out of 10<br /><br />a somewhat unbelievable storyline with some haunted-house type "shocks" that really don't fit in.<br /><br />gary oldham's performance is very erratic...not so much the quality of the performance but the consistency. his character does not behave in a consistent manner. sometimes calm/relaxed/methodical/thoughtful, sometimes violent/loud/almost crazed. it's just not believable. <br /><br />have many 80s movies dated badly? will they be more enjoyable 20 years from now?<br /><br />
