a poorly-paced sf/horror venture that takes itself much too seriously, memorable only for (a) the beautiful mathilda may wandering around naked through the chaos and (b) terrible miscasting. it has a few mildly gruesome effects and startling moments, and some unintentionally funny scenes, but is mostly a waste of time.
