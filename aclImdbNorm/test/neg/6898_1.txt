barnyard sucked! i saw this movie last week and it is horrible. what bull has udders? my 2 year old was asking me if all cows have udders and trying to explain to her that this is simply not true and seeing the movie only confused her more! <br /><br />in addition, the violent theme scared my 2 year old. they made the coyotes ferocious looking and this has instilled a fear of coyotes into my daughter. i know coyotes for a fact are not ferocious and are natural predators. the mother and son who were sitting in front of us were shouting, "kill him, kill him, yea" in a particular scene in the movie where good vs evil per say<br /><br />it is a lion king rip off and they should stop using big name actors for a lame movie. steve oederek who has also done thumb movies, such as thumb wars, thumbelina and many others are so so bad!<br /><br />if a good steve oederek movie ever comes out in my lifetime, i will roll over naked and swallow my diarrhea and post it on youtube.com ...enough said!
