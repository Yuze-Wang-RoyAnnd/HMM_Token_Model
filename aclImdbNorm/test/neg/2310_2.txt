i'd really have to rate "sex is comedy" as one of the worst pieces of dreck i have ever seen. the film inadvertedly showcases those which are the worst aspects of the french, or at least how they are stereotyped, narcissism, snobbery, and pseudo-intellectualism. i myself am french-canadian and feel slightly ashamed that the creators of this film are from the same culture as me, that should give you an idea as to how bad this movie really was! one doesn't so much watch this film as undergo torture to it, there was a total lack of humour, and it seemed to me as if the entire film was a documentary interviewing people who were neither famous, nor talented, as if to celebrate something that has never happened to begin with. instead, why not watch auberge espagnole, happenstance, or je t'aime... a la folie, three fantastic modern french films.
