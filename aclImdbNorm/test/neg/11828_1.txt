ah animorphs. i loved the book series and eagerly devoured each one in middle school and when i heard that there was a television adaptation, i was very excited.<br /><br />boy what a let down the final product was. i think for me, this was the moment when nickelodeon stopped being about cool programming and more generic.<br /><br />so what was wrong with the series? let me count the ways: 1. the characters were horrifically miscast. in the books, the animorphs were somewhere between 12-14, the television cast were at least 18. i remember being horrified when i first saw the cast photos.<br /><br />2. horrific acting/bad writing. i dunno which was to blame so i'm lumping into the lumpy mass that it was. perhaps it was the fact that the accelerated age of the cast hampered the humor that is at least cute coming out of a 13 year old because marco - not funny. in fact, i don't remember a single comical moment from the group and there were a few. the actors were certainly not helped by the writing which was bland at its best and head smackingly pathetic at its worst.<br /><br />3. my lord they were stingy with the budget. the final result of the andalites alone should have convinced viacom to pull the plug...their heads had clefts that clearly showed which was the helmet.<br /><br />4. back to the cast - rachel by far was the biggest let down, far from being the warrior woman in the books, the best equivalent in the tv series was "scarecrow". also, i know cassie was an idealist but there is a difference between "idealist" and "idiot".<br /><br />5. one of the worst opening titles ever. did the music have to be that obvious? 6. answering question 6, "yes" because everything else was dumbed down so why shouldn't the expectedly less intelligent viewers receive a thick as a brick song from a lame rap-rock rip-off or whatever the hell that was.<br /><br />since then, there have been bigger let downs (iraq, 2004) but in case i haven't made myself clear - this show sucked and was an abomination to the book series it was supposed to be based from.
