the film is very fast-moving, bizarre and colorful, it's like mad max on speed whit tons of colorers and make-up. also very cartoonish, as that said; cartoon sequence pops up here and there. the plot is also very saucy, but i'll believe it's meant too be. the thing that really drives me crazy in this movie, is the characters, they are painfully irritating, especially rebecca played by lori petty, she's really annoying (i'll believe she is the most annoying creature i've ever seen). the editing is also annoying, very mtv stylized. another thing that's missing from tank girl is an exciting adventure. the humor isn't much funny either. it has some nice visuals though.<br /><br />however a lot of people love this film, most of them are women, and that's not weird at all, because this movie is all about girl power.. tank girl this is a real chick flick, and the best example of an hate/love film.
