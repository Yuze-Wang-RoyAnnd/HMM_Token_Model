it's true, no one really expects anything from sequels. but even by that low standard this is a terrible film.<br /><br />essentially an anthology movie, this fourth installment in the hellraiser saga tries to be an origins story and a wind-up to the entire series at the same time. an ambitious idea. but none of the cast is given enough screen time to do anything with their characters and rookie director yagher abandoned the film rather than give in to studio meddling. the result is a steaming pile of mediocrity that even fanboys have trouble defending. unless you're an "alan smithee" fan, avoid this one.
