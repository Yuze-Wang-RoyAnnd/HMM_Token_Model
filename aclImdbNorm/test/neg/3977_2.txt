i have never seen this movie on its own, but like many others who have already commented, i saw it as an episode of mst3k. really terrible 70s television schlock. but someone saw its potential because it's just been turned into a $125 million flop called the island.<br /><br />and to the person who asked whether there were any good movies made in the 70s, i want to remind her that it was a golden age for american film with directors like robert altman and martin scorcese first coming into their own. not to mention little things like star wars (1977). just a reminder that the 70s were far more creative than the 21st century has been so far.
