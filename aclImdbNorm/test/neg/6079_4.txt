great piece of fiction played as if factual. tonight i was looking at the birdman of alcatraz. robert stoud was not a model meek prisoner and he was in jail because he was pimping and a customer did not pay up. once he got into jail he was so uncontrollable he spent most of his time in solitary confinement or in the prison hospital. killed a few people in prison too. this movie reminds me of the birdman of alcatraz but even worse. robert stroud did write books and he did contribute to society in someway. and the boa had some hints of strouds lunacy. but this guy henry young who murder in the first is suppose to be about was a a known bank robber who took hostages and beat them up in more then one robbery. he wasn't some poor guy who stumbled into a grocery store which just happened to be a post office and took some money. this man was a hard core criminal. he also killed a person 3 years before he went to alcatraz. he killed another person in jail not because of the solitary confinement which ended over a year before the murder. the real story of his life would of been more interesting. they did not even get the warden thing right. you can't be a warden in 3 different prisons at the same time. and by all accounts the warden in the movie was a pretty stand up guy as wardens go. plus if my math is right the warden played by karl malden in the boa is suppose to be the same warden in this movie. oh boy. not only that, in this movie we are to think poor henry committed suicide. and he wrote the word victory. not true..he might be alive right now. he was sent to springfield where robert stroud was also a medical center prison then walla walla for another murder he committed and then was released and jumped parole in 1972, never to be found. maybe he is hanging out with that cb cooper guy who jumped out that airplane in washington state after committing a bank robbery lol. now the acting was very good. kevin bacon is in that class of actors which include jeff bridges and dennis quaid, the vastly underrated actors club. gary oldman well they just might of made-up the warden part so he could play it because he was great. christian slater still somehow sounds like jack nicholson, i am not sure if that is a good thing or not. bacons wife kyra sedgwick was in the movie i think just because she is his wife. i like her though but not in this flick. for some reason i felt this movie when it first came out was suppose to be a special project for kevin bacon. i feel he could of taken a person who is truly a victim of the penal system, there sure is enough of them and spread some light on their plight. other then picking a psychopath to show as a victim.
