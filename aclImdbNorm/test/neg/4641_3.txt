this movie was terrible...how can somebody even think that this movie was like the ones back in the "good old days" when tim thomerson was not even in it. and to make things worse, they used clips from old trancer movies. thats just terrible. no trancer movie is complete without tim thomerson.i love fullmoon films, and i have been watching them since i was 4 years old. i have been through everything they have done and this movie almost made me lose it. now i got a couple of lines to fill so i will keep going. their way of breeding new trancers is completely stupid as well as way to send jack back in time. what happened to the tcl chamber. and finally! what happened in the end of trancers 5 where lina says and i quote "jack has given me something special" and her and some other broad looks at her stomach. i don't know...maybe a baby is in there. there were so many other places of going to, but fullmoon s'd the bed
