silly disney film about a college student who accidentally discovers a potion that makes things invisible. not a bad idea and some of the special effects are pretty good. still, the script is very bad...all the jokes flop and the acting is lousy. everybody's trying to be funny and they're not. a real boring, stupid disney film. but it was fun seeing kurt russell so young.
