i didn't like this movie for so many reasons i can't even say then all.i thought it was poorly made just because of the whole story line. i mean who is gonna believe that they captured the chupacabra and it broke loose on a cruise liner. lame!!! it was all right for a lame straight to video movie,but not worth spending money on it. i can't believe someone actually gave this movie a ten. but i guess there are people that like this movie. i gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1 just because it was about the chupacabra and it had the guy off of lord of the rings. if you want to see this movie i would stay home and wait till it comes on sci-fi channel. don't waste your money on seeing this movie. believe me.
