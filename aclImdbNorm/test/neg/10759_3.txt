although this series and the mini film in particular were very important at the time of release, i feel that the series as a whole was actually fairly poorly written with a weak cast. the issues at heart are extremely well portrayed yet it is difficult to relate and understand the problems within the film when the acting and script isn't convincing enough (especially when looking at the mini film).<br /><br />i also don't believe that this mini film or series has stood the test of time as now many of the scenes are quite laughable. the issues are still crucial but boys from the blackstuff cannot fully aid the cause of understanding the problems in britain in the 1980s.
