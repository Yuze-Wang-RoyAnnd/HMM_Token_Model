i, like most other people, saw this movie after hearing of it from patton oswalt. oddly enough, it was easier to find than i thought it would be. though, it shouldn't come as a surprise that i found it used.<br /><br />the plot is summed upped masterfully within the title. it's a bed that eats. nothing more, nothing less. there is an effort to throw in a story line but not a very good one.<br /><br />a demon's blood ended up on a bed and, as a result, it becomes possessed. it devours anything that happens upon it by absorbing and then dissolving it in what appears to be orange fanta. there is an artist who fell victim to the bed, but was sick and ends up behind a painting in the room it inhabits. the narrative is told entirely through him.<br /><br />this movie fails horribly at everything, even at being bad. still, it's not without its own brand of charm.
