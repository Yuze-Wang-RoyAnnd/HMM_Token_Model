when the film started i got the feeling this was going to be something special. the acting and camera work were undoubtedly good. i also liked the characters and could have grown to empathise with them. the film had a good atmosphere and there was a hint of fantasy.<br /><br />however, as the film went on, the plot never appeared to takeoff and just rolled on scene by scene. i was unable to understand the connection between the stories. all i could see was the characters occasionally bumping into each other and references to ships in bottles. without that connection, i was just left with a few unremarkable short stories.<br /><br />am surprised it did so well at cannes
