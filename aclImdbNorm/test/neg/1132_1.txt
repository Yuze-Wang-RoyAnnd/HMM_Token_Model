who gave these people money to make a movie? there was nothing funny about it. the fact that the farting dog was the funniest thing about this piece of sickness says it all. first of all, it has nothing to do with christmas, it just took the name and counted on all those people who liked the chevy chase original. they took randy 'i have no talent, i m just a fat and sweaty pig' quaid (the only wrong thing about part 1) and made a 'movie' about him...there are only morons in his family, but not the 'aren't they cute' kinda moronic, but the 'don t touch me' kinda moronic. watching this pile of dirt helps you hope that everyone who takes part in it dies! they didn't even bother to get the effects in order...when they re on the boat, the only thing that moves is the fake background...when pigface quaid is in the water you can tell by the lighting that it's in a studio. this movie was sexist (uncle nick), racist (uncle nick) and should never have been made..never...throwing the money into a volcano would have had so much more use.<br /><br />well i hope i reached some of you...nobody warned me and now i m scarred for life merry f*cking christmas
