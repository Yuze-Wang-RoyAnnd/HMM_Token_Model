well, first off, the twins are exactly the same. there is no one is girly and one is tomboy (ashley is taller than mary-kate though) and their boyfriends aren't even french, so that is bad because they are faking the accents. lamo. it is also not that bad, not their best. i am a big mary-kate and ashley fan, don't get me wrong. the storyline is ok and it is funny to watch. it is not the type of movie that you would watch over and over again. but hey, when they made this movie they were still new at the whole making their own movie thing. the girls also act like they are older then 13. but if you are a young viewer this is a good movie. not so good if you are older than 13 unless you are a parent watching a movie with your kids. then it's ok. good luck mk+a with your future movies!
