of course, all this nonsense begs the question 'does a genre as self-referential as the teen comedy really need another parody movie?' the woeful 'scary movie' (i and ii) took the formula about as far as it could go - 'not another teen movie' really doesn't have anything either intelligent or shockingly excessive to add.<br /><br />the plot, essentially based on fairyfloss teenflic 'she's all that', walks a shaky line between parody and homage ('john hughes high school'). everything from 'american beauty' to 'varsity blues' is mined for references. the result is ultimately an unfulfilling viewer experience. the downside of giving us a carbon copy plot of 'she's all that' is that we all know where its going anyway. and if we didn't then the jokes would be meaningless.<br /><br />there's extremely little to recommend here. the token gross-out scene (an erupting toilet) seems badly out of place here amongst all the 'feel-good' references. there are moments of humour - the song is funny enough and the odd good line is send the audiences way. it stinks, don't watch it.
