apart from the fact that this film was made ( i suppose it seemed a good idea at the time considering bottom was so popular ) the one thing that puzzled me about guest house paradiso was what happened to the lighting ? there is absolutely no artificial lighting used in this film whatsoever , and i watched it on network tv so it wasn`t a case of watching a dodgy tape. in fact the film was shot so darkly it was impossible to see what the hell was going on . but if the dialogue was anything to go by that`s maybe not a bad thing
