this has got to be the worst movie i haver ever seen nielson in. this movie just does not have what he needs to be funny. i think the reasons that the naked gun and the like movies is that they did not require nielson to be funny. he just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual. but when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny, he isn't. the movie had only one good part, and this may be considered a spoiler by some, and that the beginning credits were animated. if the whole movie had been animated, it might have been good. i had no intention of seeing this movie when i saw the ads for it, and the only reason i did see it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in a radio contest. this is the first and probably only movie i have ever walked out on. on a scale of 1-10 i give this movie a score of -100.
