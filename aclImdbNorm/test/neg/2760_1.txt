i was forced to read this sappy "love story" between a german 24 year old pow and a 12 year old jew. that has "political correctness" written all over it. its kind of like the movie "spirit" in which a horse wants to be free but those "evil" americans wont let it because they need it. well i have good news the americans are "evil" in the german soldier and his summer book. why!!! horses where given to us by god and if the americans needed a horse the can darn well use it. in the same sense the german had been trying to kill americans, but this book/movie makes it seem ok! the casting is absolutely awful!!!!!!!!!!!! the girl is hispanic the mother is white the dad it probubly from mostly white descent and the little sister is "shirley templish." the acting is pretty bad too, the serious parts become comedy! concluson-bad movie, bad book, but both have different endings, don't read or see either one!
