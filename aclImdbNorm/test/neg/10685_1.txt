i was permanently scarred by this terrible film.<br /><br />the main action of the movie is nothing special. it seems there's a tribe of snake-worshipping people in a remote mountain region of northern china, where women rather than men are the leaders and decision makers. i suppose among some men, this is enough to make "succubare" a horror movie... anyway, occasionally chinese men would wander into the village, take a fancy to the local girls, seduce them and then abandon them. unfortunately for the men, the women had put them under a spell, derived from snake venom, which would make them die horribly in 100 days -- their bellies swollen like a pregnant woman's with live worms and snakes -- if they did not return.<br /><br />forget the cover of the us video. this has nothing to do with vampires, though there is one inept blood-drinking scene. the title itself is only marginally appropriate: "succubare" is the latin verb meaning "to lie beneath", and it's the root of the word succubus, a female demon who would seduce men in their sleep. actually, it's the men who are the seducers here.<br /><br />but it's not the main action of this ludicrous film that's so objectionable. it's the little side-incidents. i'll overlook the slaughter and butchery of an ox that's performed on-screen. the participants seem very experienced, as though this is an unpleasant duty they actually do in real life; and i'm sure they really ate the animal afterwards... though i resent having the act thrust in my face as "entertainment".<br /><br />what i wish i could overlook (or had overlooked) are the numerous, totally extraneous shots of an unidentified man, who from time to time interrupts the story by eating living animals. he starts the movie by tearing apart a live snake with his teeth. in the course of the movie, he devours a bug, a lizard, a toad (i had to leave the room after this), and a whole mouse (i stopped watching at this point, and lost my appetite for days). let me stress that this was totally unexpected, and had nothing to do with the movie... unless it's a cynical reference to love as it's portrayed in the film: a blind, selfish, predatory survival mechanism that tears apart the helpless... but then again, i'm probably just rationalizing to get the vileness out of my head...
