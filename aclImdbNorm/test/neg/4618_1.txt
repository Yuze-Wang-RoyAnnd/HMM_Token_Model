**could be considered some mild spoilers, but no more than in anyone else's review of this film.**<br /><br />i knew that nothing could conceivably live up to the absolute brilliance of the original "carrie," which was more of a film about social criticism than it was about setting the gym on fire. carrie white was "victim" epitomized, and her story conveyed the helplessness that the truly exploited must feel.<br /><br />whoever conceived the "rachel" character for "the rage" must have completely missed the subtleties of "carrie." for the audience to genuinely share the victim's rage, s/he must be a sympathetic character-- a true outcast who is more a victim of circumstance than of his/her own vices. rachel is entirely too unpleasant to convey any sort of the emotional depth and connection of sissy spacek's "carrie." and she looks and acts like she should be right along-side the 'attractive and popular brigade' that she ends up torching. she, like the rest of them, has a soul that is every bit as corrupt, whereas carrie was a complete innocent.<br /><br />it just doesn't work. there's no satisfaction in seeing the pretty children-- not even the "home improvement" boy-- getting offed in this movie's climactic scene. and it's so unnecessarily gory! there was no actual bloodshed seen in the burning gym! <br /><br />and there is one person in particular that this movie should not have had the audacity to kill off... but i won't say who it is. if you've seen the original "carrie," it's the sort of character who dies unjustly.<br /><br />at least they did create the connection to carrie appropriately; it's explained as it should have been. but that, and the arm tattoo, which was done rather nicely, is just about the only thing this movie has going for it.<br /><br />yet another hideous "scream" knock-off, and it taints the reputation of one of the most compelling films ever made. <br /><br />rating: 1 out of 10. i wasn't expecting much, but i was still horribly disappointed. an unsympathetic character, a series of irritating pop-culture references thrown in for no good reason, and an ending scene that pales in comparison to "carrie"'s gravestone shocker.
