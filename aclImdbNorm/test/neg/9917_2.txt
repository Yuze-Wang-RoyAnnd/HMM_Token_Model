i was sitting at home and flipping channels when i ran across what potentially sounded like an interesting film. i like destruction type movies and decided to watch it. i don't know why but i ended up watching it the whole 2 hours. we have seen this type of movie i don't know how many times.<br /><br />back in 1998 - 2000 there were dozen of films that dealt with global destruction of some sort. the best one on my list so far is deep impact which was more believable than this one. here are my problems with this film: 1) cheap special effects, like something out of the old computer. 2) no background information or explanation on weather patterns. if you are going to make a movie about weather, at least have some decency to entertain the viewer with technical details. 3) how come only 2 or 3 people figure out that the storm is converging on chicago... no more experts left in the field? 4) where are some interesting characters? i truly don't care for anyone except maybe the pregnant woman. i felt that there was no character development. 5) no thought provoking moment what so ever and factually incorrect theme. and this is only the first part of the film. i bet the conclusion will show us few destruction scenes and a search and rescue operation just like it has been done many times before. and judging by the special effects in the first part of the movie, i can only imagine what we are to expect. of course, at the end, the main characters will survive and life will go on... how original
