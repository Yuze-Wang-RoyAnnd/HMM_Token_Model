today you die was the 4th seagal movie in a mini marathon i just held. wow, i don't know where to start. he seems to mumble his lines more and more as time goes on, and the scenes between seagal and treach where they seem to improv are embarrassing. and what did his girlfriend's dreams have to do with anything else in the plot? i can't recommend this to anyone but the most die hard seagal fan, and even then you are better off with his earlier work. of the 4 films in my marathon (submerged, into the sun, foreigner and today you die) today was the worst. a previous reviewer mentioned this but the usage of stock footage was quite obvious.
