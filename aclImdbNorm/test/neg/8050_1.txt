"son you must stop the experiments i have started!!" too bad nobody said this too whoever green lighted this project!! i was almost literally dragged to this movie by a friend of mine for a midnight showing when we were in high-school. now, a midnight movie in high-school on a friday night, you are not expecting much, but c'mon!! and upon seeing it again years later i sill stand by my original opinion of it. great special effects but so what!! quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. unless you enjoy blood and guts and seeing some hollywood vets (steiger & hunter) make fools of themselves for a buck. yuck!!!
