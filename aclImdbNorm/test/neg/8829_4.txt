i love japanese movies--having seen at least 100-200. so it's obvious i am not afraid of japanese films. however, sometimes there are japanese concepts for film that just don't translate well to westerners. they might be hits at home, but abroad they just don't seem, well,...normal. it's like the live fish my wife ate on a business meeting or odd ps2 games such as dating simulators or katamari damacy--things that are accepted there that confuse non-japanese. this is probably the way others view things americans take for granted, such as american football, fried snicker bars and paris hilton! well the king of strange japanese films that just don't seem right to americans might just be atama-yama. now the style of animation isn't the issue--it's different but nice enough. no, it's the story concept itself and the rather bizarre ending. that's what make this a truly unusual film and it goes like this: there was a stingy man who, for no apparent reason, had a tree growing out of his head. it was little at first and he simply cut it away, but again and again it grew back--so he just decided to let it go. and, after a while, people began living on his head under the shade of the tree. oddly, while they were under the tree, they were tiny but when they left, they were full sized again. then, after finally getting sick of it all and yanking out the tree, the man drown himself(!?) in the hole in the top of the head where the tree was! the end.<br /><br />see! i told you this was very, very odd--but not in a good way like tampopo or happiness of the katakuris--just odd. o-d-d....odd! and unless you have a very high tolerance for this sort of thing, i doubt if you'll feel bad to know that this oscar-nominated film did not win. frankly, that makes me happy, as i really don't want this film to spur on such similar films. the only reason it earns a 4 is due to nice, but not spectacular animation.<br /><br />this film made my brain hurt....i hope that isn't a sign that i have a tree!
