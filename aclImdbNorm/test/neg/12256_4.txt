prey <br /><br />aspect ratio: 1.37:1<br /><br />sound format: mono<br /><br />a lesbian couple (sally faulkner and glory annan) living in a remote country house are driven apart by the arrival of a young man (barry stokes) who turns out to be a flesh-eating alien, the vanguard of a massive invasion...<br /><br />despite its shoestring budget and leaden pacing, norman j. warren's follow-up to satan's slave (1976) amounts to a great deal more than the sum of its meager parts, thanks to a surprisingly complex script by max cuff (apparently, his only writing credit): faulkner and annan indulge an obsessive relationship whilst living in isolated splendor within the english countryside (rendered alternately beautiful and ominous by derek v. browne's eye-catching cinematography), though annan's discovery of bloodstained clothing in an upstairs room marks one (or both) of these doe-eyed lovelies as psychologically disturbed, which may explain the absence of their respective families, some of whom appear to have lived in the house at one time or another and 'left' under mysterious circumstances. stokes' unexpected arrival throws the relationship into disarray, partly because faulkner has a pathological hatred of men and partly because annan is attracted to him, creating tensions which result in a climactic whirlwind of violence. there's an extraordinary, multi-layered sequence in which faulkner attempts to 'emasculate' their clueless visitor by dressing him in women's clothing, though stokes' alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery.<br /><br />in the early scenes, at least, the relationship between faulkner and annan is depicted with uncommon grace and dignity, but this heartfelt sapphic liaison quickly devolves into crowd-pleasing episodes of sex and pulchritude, culminating in an explosion of horror when annan allows herself to be ravished by stokes following a violent argument with faulkner. the closing sequences are (quite literally) gut-wrenching, especially annan's final scene, which appears to have been clipped for censorship reasons in 1977 and never fully restored (what remains is still pretty vivid, so brace yourselves!). excellent performances by the three leads, bolstered by warren's unobtrusive direction, which takes full advantage of the stunning woodland locations, thereby compensating for the film's budgetary shortcomings. originally released in the us as alien prey.
