try not to see this one. i thought it was going to be good because i'm a fan of cheesy 80's films and i've enjoyed quite a bit of linnea quigley's work. i was wrong. i should have said "no" and watched gigli instead, which is probably a far better film. i guess my biggest problem with this film was its attempt at humor. nothing about it was funny or even close to funny. the acting is bad, even for the queen of cheesy 80's films. there is no story, just random clips. i guess i shouldn't hate it so much because it was just made as a fun and silly piece but i didn't have any fun and i wasn't entertained once. i even had to fast forward to the ending to get through all of the crap. i'm sorry, but i don't find zombies doing aerobics funny.
