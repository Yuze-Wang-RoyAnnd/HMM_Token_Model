two years after leaving the small town of grover's bend due to encountering the krites, brad brown returns to spend time with his grandmother in time for easter. meanwhile the krite eggs begin to hatch. as they cause trouble in the town, brown & the townsfolk, as well as the alien bounty hunters who have returned to finish the creatures must fight the bloodthirsty furballs before they wipe out the town.<br /><br />the original critters was a minor attempt to rip-off the family-horror flick "gremlins". it became a cult favourite on the video shelves & was successful enough to warrant a sequel. this sequel plays down the horror & makes its entire focus comedy instead. unfortunately the comedy part is extremely clumsy, as well as childish. the acting is on par with the rest of the film. it is just that the film suffers from a weak script. the visual effects are fairly well done.<br /><br />grade: d+ review by m. k. geist.
