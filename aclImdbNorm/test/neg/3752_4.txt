this 1950's howler is so bad it's unintentionally funny. tom conway portrays dr. gerard, a scientist who is turning natives into a monster using voodoo. his poor wife, played by mary ellen kay, is being held captive by her wacko hubby who has no time for her but threatens to kill her if she leaves him. along comes marla english as a greedy murderess who has already killed a man to find treasure in the jungle. her idiot boyfriend, portrayed by lance fuller, is along on the safari. they hire "touch" connors, (later renamed mike connors, of mannix fame) as a guide. english is a terrible actress, but hey, no one else in the cast were turning in academy award winning performances either. "touch" (i'm sorry, i can't even type the name without cracking up, i mean, what the...) gave the only half way decent performance of the bunch and that's saying a lot. the monster is only seen briefly, and the ending is predictable to say the least. i would say this movie falls into the "it's so bad, it's almost good" category of movies. it's good on a rainy night when nothing else is on the tube.
