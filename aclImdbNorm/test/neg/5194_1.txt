i can pretend no knowledge of cinematography or mr. angelopoulos. but i know greece and i love her people. in july my 14 year old son and i traveled to cappadocia, turkey in search of some remains of the neighborhood where his great grandfather iordanis lived until the great exodus of anatolian greeks in 1923. reading the summary of the film (refugees from odessa) i thought that perhaps i might learn something more about the forced migrations of modern greeks. if i did not have a home in rhodes, had i not been to greece 28 times in as many years, were i not familiar with dozens of islands and cities in greece and if i had never enjoyed the friendship of these ebullient, life-intoxicated people, i might have believed that this lamentation had something to do with modern greece. as a professor at a new jersey state college, let me assure you that i am familiar with the history of the period covered in the film. indeed, my wife's uncle was murdered by the communists during the communist grab for power. my mother-in-law lived through the italian invasion and german occupation...barely. these characters on the screen speak greek, they listen to greek music but who are they? no, they are not even vaguely greek. of course they are not people at all but simply allegories. they are that which the artist invents when life does not entirely fit or is inadequate to his perception of how it was or should have been. all represent some aspect of post wwi greece that greater outside forces consigned to a fate they didn't deserve. as we joked in the late 70's in america: "the revolution didn't happen." for an ideologue/artist, this is no joke. it's in fact grounds to put us through two and a half hours of torment. and it's all because the various powers (eleni's soliloquy of "guards" in different colored uniforms) didn't allow the generation after the "aristocrats" of 1919 (spyros) to follow the call of peace and freedom (the music of nikos and his fellow musicians, i.e., the movement, the cause). this dark, surreal revisionism smears the true and heroic efforts of the greek people to sustain their lust for life through the tragedies of the 20th century, to achieve more than any of their balkan neighbors, to have become so politically evolved and globally integrated.
