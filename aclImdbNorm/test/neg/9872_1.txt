admittedly, when the chance to see this horribly infamous legend of a movie, my expectations were pretty low. they weren't low enough. scholckmaster roger corman somehow came into ownership of the rights to produce the marvel comic book characters sometime in the late 80's or early 90's, and handed it off to oley sassone, whose directorial work has largely been in campy tv series such as 'hercules' and 'viper'. with a supposed total budget of 1.5 million dollars, it was produced, shot and briefly released on video and then sent to the wasteland of forgotten film. there it should have remained. however, like a banana peel in a vaudeville act, this "fantastic four" sits out in the ether waiting to cause a pratfall for those rare people unlucky and foolish enough to step on it. <br /><br />if you have ever heard of these comic book characters, you know what to expect. the people who made this were very true to the source material, and that is the only thing for which they deserve any credit in this fiasco. this presents the origins of the heroic group that develop superhuman powers when the shielding on their experimental spacecraft fails to protect them from cosmic radiation. reed richards (alex hyde-white) develops the ability to stretch his body and becomes 'mr. fantastic'. his girlfriend, sue storm (rebecca staab) can become invisible, and her brother, johnny (jay underwood) can spontaneously cause fire to erupt from his body. finally, ben grimm ('credited' to both michael bailey-smith and carl ciafarlio) receives superhuman strength when his skin mutates to a rock-like hyde and is then referred to as the thing. there is a prologue that sets up a former classmate of reed's, victor von doom (joseph culp) to become their enemy, dr. doom, who orchestrates the sabotage of the fantastic four's space flight as an act of revenge for injuries he blames on reed. there is the set-up, then the discovery of the powers, the revelation of the villain and ultimately a climactic fight. there are more details to the poorly-written script, but they are negligible.<br /><br />this is a movie that was made simply because the creators (i use that in the technical sense of the word. there isn't a whole lot of creative imagination at work here.) had the legal rights to do so. the plot will be undoubtedly mirrored in the anticipated big-budget release set to be directed by tim story in 2005, but tackling a massive special effects project like this without a comparable budget or qualified actors qualifies as an act of cinematic insanity. what special effects exist are mostly hand drawn or simple camera tricks that have existed since the days of the original 'the great train robbery'. when half of the climactic fight reverts to full-on hand animation, you're almost relieved to be watching a cartoon instead of the poor actors who were damned to be in this project. there is very little consistency of style in this mess as well. most scenes are either shot flat in available light or wild primary colors, and the only dressed sets are the obvious sci-fi pieces. there is camera-work, but it is mostly just keeping the characters centered on the screen and minimal information flowing to the audience. editing includes leaving in extra lines and using obvious wipes (at one point there is even a transition using the center of a number 4). editing spins are even used to supplement the poor special effects when the thing transforms. the one scene where morphing technology was put to use was shocking only because it was such a positive jump up in quality.<br /><br />limited camera work is not unforgivable. in 'clerks', only the most basic camera movements are used and there is almost no style. it worked for that film because it was about people whose lives had no style, and it was consistent. kevin smith never let his reach exceed his grasp. 'the blair witch project' caused some audiences to suffer motion sickness from the jerky hand-held stuff that put that pseudo-documentary together. when all was said and done, it was an effective work about the terror of getting lost and being consumed by a frightening situation. there is no sense of story or theme here on either a spoken or visual level. with this 'fantastic four', you never get more than an accidental laugh at the fact that the film makers and performers seem to be actually trying to rival other comic book movies with this poorly budgeted entry. <br /><br />any film involves a great deal of time and work. it just so sad that so much of both was poured into a project like this. if you're one of the people who were involved with this, it was most likely done as a stepping stone on the road of a (hopefully improved) film career. everyone knows about taking jobs to make the most of what appears to be an opportunity. for those who are curious about watching this movie, my advice is to only do so with a group of friends (so you can all point and say "you watched it, too") who have been forewarned about the experience (so nobody gets hurt from the shock), and maybe you can come up with a drinking game to ease the pain between the accidental laughs.<br /><br />1 out of 10
