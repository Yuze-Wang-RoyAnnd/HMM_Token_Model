i only watched the first twenty minutes of this movie and personally i think that this is the worst movie to be made in the recent years.<br /><br />the plot was so bad that it might have been possible that a 10 year old kid wrote it. the acting was also sloppy with pretty much an unknown cast and not only that the action sequences especially at the first half of the film were so terrible it was unbelievable.<br /><br />i don't know how the producers obtained the budget to film this movie but the production company must be regretting it by now.<br /><br />to anyone who may come across this film in the near future, i advise you to steer clear of this joke of a movie.
