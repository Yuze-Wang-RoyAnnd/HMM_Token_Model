well, after the hype surrounding the film and after surya labeling the film as path-breaking, i went into the theatre expecting something big. boy was i disappointed. <br /><br />first of all, the characterizations in the film are so weird! which wife would do what kundhavi (jyothika) did? an idiotic, coo-coo one? and what was the point of her standing in the rain with her child (baby shreya) after she and her husband had a fight? what was the purpose of that scene anyway? to start a vulgarly shot "maaja maaja"? not only was the song not canned aesthetically, it was just not needed in the screenplay. not needed at all! secondly, the first half of the had practically no story. the entire first half was a freaking drag. every scene in the first half of the film had no significance what so ever to the real story of the film. and also, how did aishwarya (bhoomika chawla) change so radically all of a sudden? and how did gautham (surya) and kundhavi lead a happy live together after six years even though they were so unhappy about marrying each other? and if gautham did love aishwarya like he claimed he did, why did he even marry kundhavi even if it was his uncle's death wish? why? that's the question you keep asking whilst watching the film! and how fair is the ending to aishwarya? after all, she was gautham's first wife? krishna, the director of the film, claimed he worked on the script of this film for two years, but his script is filled with flaws and leaves the audience utterly irritated! thirdly, krishna's un-imaginative picturizations of rahman's awesome is just disappointing. surprisingly, anthony's editing (usually superb) for the "new york nagaram" song just sucks! the whole song looked like it was a slide show made on microsoft power point! "munbe vaa" rangoli chorus was wasted showing gautham playing football!!! who wants to see the freaking dude playing football during such a beautiful chorus?!? whats more, the whole movie only needed two songs. munbe vaa and kummi adi. the rest of the songs inclusive of "machakari", "maaja maaja", "new york" and "jillunu oru kaadhal" are just not needed. rahman's fine efforts are simply wasted on a stupid film directed by an amateur director! fans of rahman, you ask why rahman keeps moving to bollywood. after looking at the way his songs are picturised in kollywood, why would he want to stay here? what's more irritating is that after krishna decided to include machakari into the film, the song was cut by half which truly, truly annoyes.<br /><br />surya looks handsome in his new get ups save the ones during the college scenes and packs in a so-and-so performance. his expressions during all the songs he was featured in really do not fit the way the singer sings the songs. was jyothika even acting in the film? all she did was cry! would you call all that crying acting? one of her worst performances ever! what's more, her new hairstyle does not suit her. she looked way better in vettaiyaadu vilaiyaadu. her costumes during the "new york nagaram" song are way off. bhoomika chawla is just gorgeous during the film and does justice to her role. vadivelu's comedy is annoying. when one is watching him, one wishes they could slap him on the face. it is santhanam who is the show stealer during the comedy scenes. and why the heck did sukanya even agree to do such a minuscule role which could have done by just anyone? and why is her make up so heavy when she has perfect complexion? music by a.r. rahman is just awesome. "machakari", "munbe vaa", "new york" and "jillunu oru kaadhal" deserve special mention. r.d. rajasekhar's cinematography is ok and isn't as good as his previous films though the scenery during the "kummi adi" song deserve special mention. anthony's editing is really really disappointing. the film is just so freaking draggy and could be trimmed severely.<br /><br />krishna's direction just sucks. dialogues (a.c. durai and krishna) are just too corny to digest especially the part where bhoomika professes her love for surya. the screenplay and script (krishna) are horibble. the film moves in the more un-interesting pace ever. and krishna's script is just filled with unexplained sub plots.<br /><br />and for goodness sakes, why was there so much advertising in the film? pepsi, maggi, suzuki, you name it. was the producer of the film (k.e. gnanavel) low on budget or was he just desperate? overall, jillunu oru kaadhal is a damp squib. with a title like that, one would expect a heart warming and cooling love story but what you end up is a painfully botched up love story. really, really disappointing.
