this is an excellent example of an entreatingly bad b-movie. there are worse movies than this one (titanic for example), but this definitely shares the pile of steaming crap movies.<br /><br />ok this was apparently shot in kansas city, which explains why everyone is so lame. the main guy looks like steve guttenberg, and is even more lame than him! i didn't even think that was possible! in fact, him and the main girl in the movie are responsible for the worst drama ever! its not just that there acting was waaaaaaaaay over-dramatic, well actually it was, of course the script was terrible which combines for a deadly one-two punch in bad terrible utterly unwatchable drama.<br /><br />the scarecrow, lets talk about him. the whistling you hear every time he's around is stupid, and obviously dubbed in. now his costume, i cannot get over that - its a guy wearing burlap sacks and a stupid mask! i simply am dumbfounded, maybe if your 3 years old with brain damage you'd be scared of him/it.<br /><br />one of the characters, the token black guy actually, used the line: "this might be a chance to earn my red wings" when referring to trying to score with one of the girls on her period. wow, um yea, that is the kind of dialogue you can look forward to.<br /><br />oh, in the beginning when the scantily clad girl is running through the corn, why is it roped off? i'm pretty sure its not supposed to be evident, just one of the many obvious mistakes made throughout this 'film' another is the bad dubbing for the musical number (yup thats right), there all at the beach, and the one dorkaziod gets up the courage to sing a song and play guitar for everyone, and its so obviously dubbed its funny. thankfully, the scarecrow answers all our prayers and throws a spear right through the guy's chest when he's done singing. overall the gore like that is pretty good, this is one of those films when you rooting for these people to be killed by the killer.<br /><br />ok, there's a scene where the 2 guys bury one of their friends in the sand, then stand up, whip out their peni, and urinate all over the guy in the sand. who does this? really, imagine it "hey, lets bury joe in the sand, then stand up and take out our genitals like its no big deal and pee on him" in fact, this brings up the homo-eroticism in this film, what the hell? a good part of the beginning of this movie is the jocks standing around in there underwear in the locker room and corn field while there doing the hazing. what the hell is with that? traditionally, in film and real life, jocks get the girls and nerds don't. that really doesn't make sense as all nerds think of is girls and sex, and apparently all jocks think of is sports and being around each other in their underwear, i don't get it.<br /><br />lets get to the sex. as someone who watched this movie with me put it: "i've never been so disgusted by heterosexual sex in my life" and its true. if you like hot a cup action, or ugly old woman boobs, then this film is for you. i swear, they found a girl with the smallest breasts ever and this is who they get to do the nude scene?? then the ugly old woman nurse shows her bouncy ones a couple of times, and man, i just didn't want to see that.<br /><br />now, i have to talk about the timeline continuity to this film, thats what really is just bizarre. it starts in the daytime, then they all head to the cornfield, and within like 2 minutes its instantly dark middle of the night, when they drive off from there saying their going to the beach - its instantly day again, and apparently they stay at the beach until night again, and until day the next day. so basically these events in the film cover 4 days, without any of the characters needing sleep or anything, its really weird.<br /><br />after the main killings have taken place, it flash forwards to '3 weeks later' and apparently none of these people actually care that they saw their friends brutally murdered! the surviving people literally pop some champaign! and thats when i realized the budget didn't go to the script, directing or acting, it all went to that freakin bottle of champaign.<br /><br />the ending. stop reading now if you don't want the ending spoiled for you, it truly is enjoyable.<br /><br />ok, so the end takes place in a church, and the scarecrow put his soul inside the diabetes kid body, then he fights with the steve guttenberg lookalike guy, and he fights him with a b-movie version of the power the emperor had in star wars! i'm not kidding, its so stupid! so somehow, in the middle of the fight, the scarecrow's soul jumps bodies into the guttenberg jr. guy, and then with the last amount of will he has of his own, he impales himself on a cross in the church! its awesome! some blood, but whats even better is that the cross is obviously cardboard! you can see the bottom move off the ground! wow, yea have fun watching.
