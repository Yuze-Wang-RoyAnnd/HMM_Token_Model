naach would have won an razzie for the worst film in 2004 (may be overall too) if it were global. when it comes acting badly (aka showing attitude/yawning/over (not) acting) halle berry is no match for antra malli. while the catwoman had storeline, supposedly hot actress in microscopic costume, and some action sequences, naach had nothing at all.<br /><br />one of those movies which makes me wonder why imdb does allow one to rate a movie as 0/10. yet again, i think that movie does not even deserve a 0. it has to be something negative or minus infinity.<br /><br />ok what about the plot outline? it is a funda-giving, arrogant, full of attitude choreographer meet an useless, skill-less, loafer who aspires to be an actor tale. the story is so short that if just another sentence, imdb might ban me for writing a spoiler. about the story-telling? its like a bunch (sorry 2 people for the most part) of people moving in super slow motion. don't try this movie if you have bought new dvd-player. you would end up believing that either dvd is in bad shape or dvd-player is struck. not its fault at all.<br /><br />at the end of it all, you end up giving some credits to the director. at least he realized that both antra malli and abhishek bachan (at least at that time) can't speak dialogues convincingly, so there are not too many dialogues in this movie. so, you can at least sleep your way through the movie, with some annoying noises from those antra-malli song sequences.<br /><br />do watch this movie if you are new to bollywood cinema. once you have tolerated this movie, you would be able to see any bollywood movie and enjoy it.<br /><br />there can't be worse 3 hour torture than this!
