freddy forsyth has come up with a storyline which will suit the mood of the west's suspicions about putin's russia. forsyth installs a nasty guy as the ruski president who wants to return the country - not so much to stalin's communism but more to hitlerian fascism. in fact, his political manifesto could have come straight out of mein kampf rather than marx. and, the loon has the latest weapons of biological destruction to achieve the ethnic cleansing pogrom of the russian federation. american mercenaries connive with the russian prez to realise his fanatical, genocidal dream, but then enter dirty dancing's pat swayze...and,yep,things get really down and dirty. he's a former us operative-turned-drifter,jason monk, who is enlisted by the british government to see what the russians are up to. as a corny sidebar, swayze's character who is no monk (!)has sired a russian beauty elena (played by the gorgeous marta kondova) on his previous missions to the former commie state. hardman swayze does a passable job in setting out to defeat the evil russians. but young unknown actress marta kondova steals the flick as his nubile, 18-year-old russian daughter elena who helps dad root out the terror threatening her beloved mother russia.
