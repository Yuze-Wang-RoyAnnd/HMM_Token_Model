well, don't bother. this film looks so tired, the acting is so old-fashioned, and the plot and characters so drab, that it should be studied instead of watched. it is really a horrible waste of film; stereotypes, clich'es, nonsense, and amateurish film-making. i watched it in unbelievable awe with my mouth wide open. how could such a film be made, and more interestingly, how could anyone find it funny or watchable? old, tired, sloppy... a junior-high skit, at best. there is nothing watchable there, except for a study of very ancient film. not good film, just ancient. this is not abbott and costello or laurel and hardy. this is nonsense. the acting is so bad that maybe it is worth it to watch just for the laugh. some films are so bad that they are good. but, this one goes all the way around the corner and back to bad again.
