actually i feel like having my review be that one word. my friend, whose opinions i almost always trust about movies, especially horror movies, warned me not to rent this no matter how tempted or bored or desperate to see a new horror movie i was, because it was a complete waste of time. unfortunately i haven't talked to him in a while, and i was in a hurry to pick a movie, and thought, 'what the heck, how bad could it be?' why don't i learn? what was i thinking? did i think it would magically turn into a better movie while sitting there on the shelf for years waiting to be rented?<br /><br />the 'plot' concerns a guy who edits films for some company. his boss is a jerk. the guy who had the job before him went insane and blew himself up in the pre-credits sequence, so for some reason the boss picks nerdy 'ed' for the special project of editing "loose limbs" splatter movies. he never says what ed is supposed to edit, but i guess that doesn't matter. ed is upset by some of the clips, working on them up at this house all by himself that the boss has decided to relocate him to for no apparent reason. he asks his boss if he can stop or do another project, but his boss doesn't care. he starts to slowly go insane, supposedly from watching the clips, and wants to carry out the gory murders in real life. or has he been this way all along? please note that i am making this plot sound much more deep, interesting, and coherent than it actually is.<br /><br />we don't care about the characters at all, or have any sympathy for them, or even hate the bad guys. the plot is really, really boring and predictable. the splatter isn't even that gruesome or creative-this is not worth renting just to see the gore, because what there is isn't interesting or original.<br /><br />all the 'tributes' to sam raimi just come off like really bad ripoffs, and no-one in the movie is anywhere near good looking enough as bruce campbell, so you can't distract yourself with that. i think an "evil dead ii-dead by dawn" poster is only prominently displayed in one scene in the hopes that sam raimi will be flattered and not consider any sort of legal action. a trained chimp could have written a better screenplay. every time i hear lines like "are we having fun...yet?" (which even bride of re-animator couldn't pull off without making me wince) i start feeling like picking up some sort of deadly weapon myself. characters just appear out of nowhere with no explanation, wandering in only to get killed. this might be ok if the movie was even remotely amusing or entertaining, but it was all i could do to keep from fast-forwarding through most of it. fortunately i chose to pay some bills and balance my checkbook at the same time the movie was playing. trust me, it did not require my full attention-i still felt like 90+ minutes of my life were wasted just by having this on in the background.<br /><br />don't watch it, no matter how tempted you are-you'll hate yourself for wasting your money. horror fans will be completely disgusted by how incompetent it is. even those who haven't seen too many splatter movies should stay away, as there are so many movies out there you could rent that are much more well worth your while. if you want something brainless, low-budget and fun, rent something else. complete waste of time with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. be smarter than i was at the time and don't be fooled by the "warning-not for the faint of heart" on the box. you have been warned!<br /><br />
