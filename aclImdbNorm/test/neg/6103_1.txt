<br /><br />this movie is best enjoyed amidst a large audience with the giggle-fits.<br /><br />very frequently the characters in kadosh are seen staring ahead intensely at nothing. very intense unhappy faces, very pensive, very serious. during these moments there is very serious sounding music just to make doublely sure the viewer realizes that the scene being watched is not about fun and games.<br /><br />the more entertaining portions of this film come in between the many pensive stares. we learn that the women of the kadosh community have two duties. one is to breed as many male babies as possible for their husbands. the second is to stay employed so to free their husbands from having to work. what do these men do with their ample free time? they pray. and we learn that at home they pray out loud, "i give you thanks for not creating me as a woman." and at their place of worship they pray to give thanks for possessing functioning male genitalia.<br /><br />along with the praying there are many scenes of frenzied antics, screaming, and endless head bobbing and bodies rocking back and fourth, and mixed in with everything are many intricate and bizarre (or simple but just as odd) ritualistic activities.<br /><br />the cream of the unintentional comedy comes from the sex. the imagery of an hot and bothered man actively exchanging body fluids with his wife in bed while attempting to keep his beanie from falling off his scalp is unforgettable!<br /><br />every sex scene is funny, but one that stands out is when a husband rubs his face against his beautiful wife's (ya"el abecassis) feet. oh yes, we are finally entering the land of sensuality... but no! the feet rubbing stops before anything happens and the husband begins his autistic looking head bobbing and body rocking until the scene ends!<br /><br />there are three attractive females in near states of undress, however kadosh contains absolutely no nudity. technically, there is some interesting imagery and pleasing uses of light and colors by the director.<br /><br />for a more believable, educational and entertaining treatment of the plight of being an unclean female unworthy of holding a book in a world where respect is measured by the speed by which a man can cite a phrase from ancient writings, i suggest barbra streisand's yentl.<br /><br />
