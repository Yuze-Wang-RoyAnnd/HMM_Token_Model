this picture hit the movie screens on june 6th 1980, starring stephen macht as sergeant thor, avery schreiber as captain comelius butt, j.d. hinton as buzz and starring playmate of the year dorothy stratton. the picture starts with the police infinity roaming space looking for i guess criminals. there ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown space ship. enters sergeant thor and his partner buzz as they try to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. when failing they call on captain comelius who instructs his crew to fight back. enters the gorgeous dorothy stratton, who plays the role of galaxina who is man made robot. an now a few thoughts on this picture. this movie was plan stupid and it's one of the reasons that i don't get into sci-fi. if you're into sci-fi you would have notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from an early sci-fi movie titled battlestar galactica which aired in theaters in 1978. many of the door sounds that you hear in this movie came from another sci-fi movie that aired back in 1966 titled star trek. now for the reason that i bought this movie, dorothy stratton. she is gorgeous in her one piece suit. i think her talents were wasted in this picture and she should have never been involved in such garbage. connie sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would have been wasted also. on the picture alone i give this movie 1 weasel star and on dorothy stratton i give her 10 weasel stars even though she didn't deserve to be put into a trash movie like this. if you like pictures like this you can get the dvd version on amazon.com
