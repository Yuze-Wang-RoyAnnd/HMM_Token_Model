again, like many other tv shows, a certain actor/actresses in thrust into the limelight, in this case miranda cosgrove, having built up her reputation in previous movies/series (especially by nickelodeon and dan schneider. she is now the star of the show, gets to sing the soundtrack ( which she did not write and thus gets even more fame from that). wonderful? it creates as much imbalance in popularity vs her other co-stars, especially nathan kress, who is continually thrust into minor rolls in each episode, except idont want to fight. cosgrove's music would never have met the charts without this show and her singing the main theme song (which was not written by her) and other covers such as about you now and stay my baby. let's not forget that she lip sync/sings her song live too. is that how you create vocalist nowadays?<br /><br />back to the show, cosgrove reveals more physically by acting scenes in a bikini, hawaiian hula type bra and mentioned bra many times through out. bras and seen in many cases (though not of the other actresses). wedgies are mentioned, panties have been mentioned once. og let us not forget "oh my god" a come phrase (are any of the scriptwriters/actors christian?) granted that the show is not meant to be just for kids, i'm surprised at the multitude of mentions of the female undergarment, especially in the first episode, where the phrase "pointy boobs" were mentioned. i'm not sure whether kids would thus refrain from saying that at home/in school afterwards. <br /><br />it's not that i'm against the mentioning or showing of female undergarments (which girls will wear), but for a show from nickelodeon, the people in charge should have realised that kids would get the exposure to such stuff. i doubt that other nickelodeon shows have such content in them.<br /><br />as mentioned is other reviews, the laughter track is extremely annoying and unnecessary in many parts--for example, when the character sam cries, how on earth is that a time to laugh? it distracts people from getting the joke and is used almost in every sentence.<br /><br />as mentioned, cosgrove is made the star of the show and thus gains the utmost fame and support from die hard fans, who even scolded a hotel staff when she is told to keep her noise level down (see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk0gtfuk98u). jennette mccurdy is the second star of the show but she faces competition from cosgrove in the music industry (compare the popularity of her new single vs cosgrove's covers). as noted, the third co-star nathan kress is the least noted of the lot. he is portrayed as a atypical boy who suffers the brunt of bullying by a girl and other boys but somehow a wizard at technology. his height in early episodes make him a cute actor but unusual given his character's crush on carly/cosgrove. beyond that, kress isn't breaking into the music industry and as cosgrove's fame grows with each episode, kress falls behind. i would bet that he is the least paid of all the three actors.<br /><br />the content of the show is of course fictional, but also lets one wonder how it fits into a comedy series at certain times (thus the laughter track is used).it also contains several continuity errors (how can your father be and air force colonel on a submarine? us special forces have their own branches, and the air force doesn't use us submarines--that is for seals). a unique feature is that of allowing viewers to submit their own videos to be shown during or after the episodes, but again the videos somehow do not meet the theme of comedy.<br /><br />once again, it is a show that is riddled with mentions of the female undergarments, exposure of skin, and over used laughter tracks. it is a series which thrusts a teen actress so far into the crowd such that her songs/actions are excessive supported by her fans, leaving her co stars behind.
