wow. so my boyfriend and i went to the movie store to rent a film. i like dumb horror movies, so i browsed the variety of terrible films they had to offer while he went off in search of michael moore's 'sicko'. so then i found the worst of all of them (as i would soon find out). it looked good on the cover and the description on the back seemed decent enough. the fact that there was an imdb quote on it as a review was proof that it would be bad in a good way. so the next night, we put it in the dvd player and from the first five minutes, we were so incredibly confused.<br /><br />the movie is utterly incoherent, with badly placed time-jumps from past to future that leave you asking a major 'wtf?' the plot has no sort of coherent story -- other than the vague allusion to a local myth about a murder, but this only actually comes into play in the movie in the last twenty minutes of it. so pretty much for the first hour you have this: random, confusing time jumps; incoherent plot; parents who don't age; bad acting; bad dialogue; a boy who magically changes hair colour; and a host of obnoxious characters for you to get bored with!<br /><br />the movie moves so slow that it's a chore to actually sit there and watch. i'd rather be scrubbing the toilets, honestly. don't bother with it.
