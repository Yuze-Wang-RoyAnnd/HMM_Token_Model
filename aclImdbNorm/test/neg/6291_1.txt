the movie is an adaptation of a japanese story by the respected author yukio mishima. it simply doesn't make the transition into a credible story about brits and americans.<br /><br />the story moves sluggishly, especially the part where miles and kristofferson are separated and the director fills in with the cliched shots of a ship's prow cutting through the waves, and the little route line filling in on the maps, while their letters are heard in overvoice. the film moves so languidly that i even fast-forwarded through the sex and masturbation scenes which, although long, are not really either passionate or erotic. the film did achieve a measure of notoriety when kristofferson's then-wife divorced him for extra-curricular activities with miss miles during the filming. i guess they enjoyed the sex scenes, but it isn't quite the same for a viewer.<br /><br />there are no characters to hang on to. the sexually frustrated widow is unlikeable, the little kid is detestable. kristofferson is amiable enough, but he just doesn't have the acting skills to bring much to the role, although perhaps we don't really want get too involved with him, considering his ultimate fate.<br /><br />as for the little kid, well, he kinda falls in with a bad crowd after his dad dies, and they help him plot some evil against the man who enters his mum's life. now this is a really bad crowd. they don't just shoplift and smoke dope, nosireebib. they slip a mickey to a cat and vivisect it. this is shown in gory detail. but of course, this is only practice so they can do the same thing to kristofferson!<br /><br />so the movie mostly moves slowly, with no characters to relate to, and when something does happen it is unrelentingly morbid.<br /><br />the ending is about as unsatisfying as any movie you'll ever see.<br /><br />this all might have made some sense if the japanese locale and cultural context had been retained. as it stands, it is just abysmal.<br /><br />
