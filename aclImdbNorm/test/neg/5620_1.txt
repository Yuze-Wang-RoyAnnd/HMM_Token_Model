who wrote this flick? an uninspired 15 year-old?<br /><br />could have been written by one of the kids who did the columbine shooting.<br /><br />totally nonsensical, not funny all, boooooooriiing...<br /><br />plus this: the french do not put their flag everywhere. you do not walk into a french bank and see the tricolore flag displayed like that. even on bastille day.<br /><br />i have nothing against the blood bath thing. it's just that none of this is either credible or funny. or parodic, or anything like that.<br /><br />ok, those who liked this flick will tell you i must be some type of fascist, so forget about my comment.
