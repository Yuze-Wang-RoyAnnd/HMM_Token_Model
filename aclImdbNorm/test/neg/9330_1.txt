how does a movie become a biblical epic? simply by quoting a couple of scriptures & using some names out of the bible for your characters? the only thing that was biblical about this epic was the names of the characters. oh, i almost forgot the 3 kingdoms, israel, egypt & sheba were also used. where did king vidor get the rest of his story from? it surely wasn't from the bible. it was complete & utter nonsense. if you want to read about solomon's reign as king in israel then read 1 kings 1-11 & 2 chronicles 1-9. you will even come across adonijah in 1 kings 1 & 2. the queen of sheba, (who doesn't show up until king solomon has been king for about 20 years or so, which by the way, is long after adonijah & joab had been dead) can be found in 1 kings 10 & 2 chronicles 9. one of the first thing solomon does is make an affinity with pharoah by taking his daughter.<br /><br />yes, king solomon did get involved with the worshipping of false gods & this is why the kingdom was split after his death, not the temple being destroyed by lightning. also, i think solomon was too busy marrying & providing temples to the false gods of his 700 wives & tending to his 300 concubines to be fighting egypt, let alone a dead brother.<br /><br />like i said this movie was utter nonsense. if you aren't gonna use the story in the bible then call it something else. this could've just as easily been called romeo & juliet or sid & nancy.<br /><br />
