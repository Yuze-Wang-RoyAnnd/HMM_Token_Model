awful, dreadful, terrible. the actors are bad, the music is ridiculous and the filming pathetic. i rented the dvd and had to force myself to watch it until the end.<br /><br />my advice: read the book, it is much better and you won't have to put up with all these silly images and ridiculous dreams catherine has.<br /><br />i think i have never watched such a bad movie.
