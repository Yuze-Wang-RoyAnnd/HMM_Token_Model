i understand that roger corman loves to do things on the cheap, but this is just sad. i purchased this flick from the dollar bin at my local video store not a month after watching the original carnosaur. i was blown away; it was the same damn movie, with just some corbin bernesen spliced in! it reminded me of all of those 80s ninja movies that took old kung fu movies and spliced in a bunch of white ninjas running doing cartwheels with the word "ninja" written on their headbands (if you haven't seen them, check out "ninja terminator", "the thundering ninja", "black dragon" and "ninja warriors"). thanks roger corman; you just made me waste a dollar.
