first: the recent campaigning of this movie is a huge hoax. judging from the cover you'd think this was some kind of scandal movie about kylie playing a character having sex, taking drugs and whatever. this is just a cheap market-scheme. she's barely in it and does neither of the things. the marketing here is unbelievable, and i'm surprised the filmmakers hasn't objected. <br /><br />the movie itself was to me a huge disappointment. it seemed like a sunset beach episode directed sloppy-handed by a teenage quentin tarantino. and thats not meant as a compliment, mind you. <br /><br />i think the weakness of the movie first of all is the story. it seems to be about nothing. just about cool teenagers tripping around living 'on the edge'. the characters themselves does have some personality though, but the movie doesn't use its potential. as said, there's no story of any substance here. it seems to elaborate too much on cool dialog and ends up looking like a colorful mtv ad. it definitely has that feeling. <br /><br />still though, i guess some people might enjoy it, but i'd say there's far better movies like this around.
