badly shot, badly edited, clumsy dialogue, flat characters, unsuccessful adaption of a novel. it doesn't really get much worse. decent acting and good popcorn saved me for this hour and a half - felt more like three hours - of boredom. occasional good one-liners.<br /><br />david is a dim-witted young man, who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age. he puts his faith in a chinese philosophy mumbo jumbo video, although that doesn't seem to help him much in real life. david is a member of a debt-collectors gang, where every member has an iq below sea level. a lacking script, along with uncreative shooting and even worse editing, make what could have been quite funny incidents of failed debt-collecting look like a amateurish homemade reality show.<br /><br />david rents an apartment from an elementary school teacher, haraldur, who by dropping a couple of sentences about his own importance convinces david he is dealing with the most dangerous criminal in iceland. a severely lacking script doesn't offer david anything to base his opinion on. a couple of scenes showing haraldur doing something that david could have misinterpreted would have done the work. the potentials of film as media, as opposed to the text of the book this film is based on, are not exploited.<br /><br />at first, david's connection with haraldur raises his status within the debt-collectors gang, but the prevailing paranoia in the criminal world forces david to show where his loyalty lies.<br /><br />the plot of the film is fine, but then it is based on the book. this could have been a much better film. a good screenwriter could have made something of this material. sadly, that is not the case.<br /><br />the acting is generally good. p'etur j'ohann is excellent and credible as david. eggert thorleifsson doesn't get much to work with, but does his best with what little material he has. ingvar sigurdsson and michael imperioli (in a tiny role) manage alright.<br /><br />overall opinion: what could have been quite a funny and entertaining film about a dim-witted anti-hero in a debt-collectors gang, becomes a boring, badly-crafted film made after a poor manuscript. staring at your toes for an hour and a half would be more enjoyable.
