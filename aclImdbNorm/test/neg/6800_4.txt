i could have liked this if i didn't like diane arbus.<br /><br />didn't really capture arbus unique visual aesthetic(as stanley kubrick did in "the shinning", with the twin girls in the hallway, a direct homage to one of arbus most famous photos, and one with haunting qualities none of this movies images have), and certainly none of her character(outgoing), likeness(thin and jewish, not wasp queen kidman), or life, save some very superficial similarities, she was a fashion who later photographed "freaks" and "outsiders", among many things. this film focused on the "freak", as her symbol for artistic and personal empowerment, in a really shallow and predictable fashion. outside of that, it might have been an interesting movie about middle class fetish, but i was too annoyed to care.<br /><br />perhaps if arbus name had been left off, this might have been less annoying, but had it not had her name in the title there would have been nothing to make me interested in seeing in this in the first place. a letdown from "secretary".
