the use of the term 'comedy' with relation to this documentary is an insult to the art of comedy, and worse yet is the pain that is inflicted on the viewers of this production. almost nothing was funny.<br /><br />this documentary followed a small group of stand-up 'comics' on the road as they travel from town to town to perform in small clubs.<br /><br />it's interesting to note that their conversations and behavior off-stage and on-stage are indistinguishable, but sadly, equally unfunny.<br /><br />it's possible to understand the self delusions of grandeur which the featured 'comedians' possess, but it's harder to grasp the sounds of laughter heard from their audiences. perhas these are the same audiences for whom the lame sitcoms on tv are intended.<br /><br />this was possibly the worst film i've ever watched in my 50+ years of movie viewing.
