my brother plays "moose" in this film. although most of his scenes were left on the cutting room floor. the funniest line is the movie is "nothing wong with stat." so anyway, this is filmed in portland, or, where we grew up. the dance club is/was called "up front fx". what i loved about this movie is that the main character (who is not named on the box because bolo brings more clout) is supposed to be a police detective...a great opportunity to drive around in a red convertible porsche. i need to get a copy of this, preferably the director's cut, so i can see all the scenes my brother is in. the only scene he is in is the beginning when they are in the dance club. he got the spot because he was dating this cheerleader from a semi-pro football team called the oregon thunderbolts. it is interesting because his name comes up as the first entry in imdb. fame has him, fortune, not so much.
