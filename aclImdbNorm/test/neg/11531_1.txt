i did have a good time the first 45 min. or so, but then suddenly it was all down hill. the suspense somewhat started to get thin and the jokes somewhat the same all over. what kept it going were the good actors.<br /><br />but the problem with this film is that it is trying to be cleverly funny,like tarantino and god is that outdated stuff. tarantino being a bit overrated sometimes, this movie comes ten years too late. at best it is for teenagers, and i am sure many of them find the character of johann funny, which he is for the first 30 min. the other problem i have with it is that the story fades away towards the end more and more, thou i tried to find a recovery point. maybe it didn't recover because the lack of passion comes with the effort of trying to be cleverly funny. also, like in many movies, sure, good actors who can afford it don't seem to demand a better dialogue, or just turn down the script.
