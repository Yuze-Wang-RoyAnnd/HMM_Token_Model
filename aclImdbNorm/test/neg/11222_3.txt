this movie is an obvious rip-off of underworld usa starring cliff robertson. you owe it to yourself to invest a couple of hours and watch the original. i found this one to be disjointed and hard to follow, with a lot of scenes that didn't make much sense. i'm not opposed to violence in movies but this whole thing seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to blow away one person after another, many of whom were only marginally connected with the storyline. with everyone else getting killed, all through the movie i wondered why frank didn't just blow johnny's brains out. he certainly could have and johnny sure didn't act like someone that could be trusted. another thing that bothers me is the sex scenes; why do these people have sex with their clothes on? is that supposed to turn us on? surely they didn't think they had a shot at a pg rating. nothing in this movie seemed to play out naturally. as if one were watching people in real life, instead it was done in a heavy-handed and shallow manner.
