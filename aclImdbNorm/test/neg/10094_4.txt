in a nutshell the movie is about a gang war in the 1950's. leon, the leader of the deuces, starts the gang after his brother od's on "junk". he vows to protect the neighborhood. the leader of the rival gang is just getting out of prison and wants revenge.<br /><br />the movie didn't really do it for me. the "good guys" weren't any more good than the "bad guys". very little was shown to suggest that the deuces really cared for the community. i suppose the writers were going for realism here, but i just didn't care which side won. none of the characters were likable, or even capable of drawing my sympathy.<br /><br />on the plus side the courtship between annie and bobby had some snappy dialog, and the acting overall was well done.
