i have in the past loved tim burton. i loved ed wood, edward scissorhands, and even mars attacks. but i hate this movie. the costume drama scenes in the beginning were the sort of poorly done, stodgy things that used to plague historical drama 25 years ago. then there were all the head-cutting scenes, which just left me cold, and that's the sort of thing that ought to mean something, i would think. yes, there were some nice bare trees and foggy evenings and the horseman jumping out of the tree was a nice special effect, but on the whole the movie was just boring and pointless.
