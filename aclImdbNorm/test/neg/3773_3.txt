what a waste. john travolta and scarlett johansen deserved better than this. to start at the beginning, jt was horribly miscast in the lead here. the role called for someone who could convince as a broken-down anti-hero, someone who could look haunted and defeated. billy bob thornton would have fit the bill, or even al pacino, but jt is just too alive, and looks to be having too much fun. also, surely someone who has been through the mill to the extent jt's character had would have suffered some physical effects? the character presented to the audience looked as if he could start as tight end for the oakland raiders. scarlett faired little better role-wise. where was the pain and conflict of what should surely have been troubling development? and as for the "plot" ... well, none of it makes sense. the characters leap from one frame of mind to another seemingly without cause - and certainly without explanation. the pace of the film also leaves something to be desired, namely, pace. this is a very slow film, not that i have anything against slow films, as long as they are heading somewhere. the pace only picks up towards the very end, when it shifts from a slow dirge to a frantic race to pack in as many tired clich'es as possible. in this it succeeds - the only thing missing being something involving a small dog. 3 out of 10 for this one purely for gabriel macht's performance - he was the only member of the cast who was a) well cast and b) able to convince in his role. all in all, a terrible disappointment and a real waste of a couple of hours.
