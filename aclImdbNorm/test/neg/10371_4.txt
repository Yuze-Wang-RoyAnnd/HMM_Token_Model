***slight spoilers*** this installment of the full moon franchise changes the storyline a bit and implements some new elements. first off a new puppet master is established. secondly, the puppets turn good in this sequel. finally, it introduces some scifi/fantasy elements as well.<br /><br />a new tenant of the infamous hotel by the bay, his girlfriend, her psychic friend, and that psychics boyfriend, stumble upon andre toulon's puppet trunk. they also learn about some demon from another dimension that holds toulon responsible for stealing the secret to animating the unliving. so sutekh (the demon) sends the totems, a bunch of craven little creatures that look like ear-less gremlins. then it's up to the puppet troupe to take care of the inter-dimensional threat that's trying to kill there new friends.<br /><br />like most low budget movies this film is rife with continuity problems. how did the puppets get put back in the trunk? how come nobody remembers the last rasche of killngs in the hotel? who bought the hotel? why would a contractor by a building with a history of mass murders? all this and many more questions, will not be answered...ever.<br /><br />the real suprise of this movie is the acting. it's actually pretty good. the actors take it with a enthusiasm unusual especially for a bunch of full moon nonames. teresa hill was especially impressive as the shy, nervous, psychic lauren. chandra west (susie) was also a pleasant suprise also. gordon hill was a tolerable protagonist. but cameron was far too annoying to stomach. thank the norse god he dies before halfway through.<br /><br />the puppets are there usual animated selves. with some improvements as well. there emotions (especially jester's) are much more human due to the sounds that have been given to them. blade's hisses, pinhead's grunts, and six-shooter's snicker have all been improved and sound much better. the stop-motion animation is only average at best, especially the totems. they just don't seem to move as fluidly as the previous installment in the series. also the sutekh costume is absolutely awefull. how are we supposed to afraid of a creature so humorous looking.<br /><br />the story seems a bit juvinile for the series. i think charlie band was looking to focus in on a younger demographic. the violence being toned down in this movie also seems to speak the same. gore fans will be disappointed.<br /><br />i think the above is the main problem this movie can't really stick with many people. it doesn't have the violence for gorewhores. the language is a little cleaner. yet it's too violent and harsh for the wee ones. which is why the movie gets low ratings. i have to say that the common reviews are mostly fair.
