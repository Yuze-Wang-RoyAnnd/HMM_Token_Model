two stars <br /><br />amanda plummer looking like a young version of her father, christopher plummer in drag, stars in this film along with robert forster--who really should have put a little shoe black on top of that bald spot.<br /><br />i've never seen amanda plummer in a good film. she always plays these slightly wacky characters in films that don't quite add up, and she does so yet again in this one.<br /><br />firstly, we have two young women, sisters, who don't resemble in the slightest, who allow themselves to be picked up, separately, by questionable men along the roadways.<br /><br />amanda's character, sandra, does at least have a good reason for allowing dr. jake (robert forster)to pick her up in the first place. she has been run off the road, seemingly by a maniac, and her car is pretty much destroyed.<br /><br />warning - spoilers ahead! <br /><br />however, as we go along, we realize dr. jake is not playing with a full deck any more than amanda is. he makes every decision based on the flip of a coin.<br /><br />when dr. jake and amanda arrive at a motel, who do we see but the maniac's car, and what does amanda do but get inside his station wagon and start snooping around. what her motive was for doing this is never clear considering the man is apparently dangerous and might try to kill her. one would think the last thing she would do is place herself in such a precarious situation.<br /><br />not only does she snoop around, but she finds some money and takes it.<br /><br />shortly after this we have several other things that don't add up.<br /><br />dr. jake, with amanda as his passenger, runs out of gas, and the two of them abandon his car and begin walking. one would think crossing a desert, he would have checked his gas gauge--this seems a very unlikely thing for him to allow to happen. then later, he is seen driving the same car. when or how did he get the car back? <br /><br />dr. jake tells amanda he knows she has taken the money. now how would he know that? he didn't see her do it as far as i know, and she didn't tell him she did it.<br /><br />then later we have a character named santini (david thewlis), the man who was driving the station wagon, give the two of them a lift and i'll be darned if he doesn't know amanda took the money as well. how would he know that? <br /><br />it loses credibility at an alarming rate the further we go.<br /><br />when alice, amanda's sister (fairuza balk)gets in the clutches of the killer and decides her fate on the toss of a coin - one would think she would be very, very careful that the coin she swaps for a trick coin would definitely be the trick coin - but apparently it isn't.<br /><br />it's jarring things like this, that destroy any credibility this movie may have had.
