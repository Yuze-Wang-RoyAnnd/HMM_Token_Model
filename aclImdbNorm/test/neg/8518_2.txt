eddie fischer was simply bad. possibly the worst scene came early in the movie when he broke into a spontaneous song and dance number centered around a piano and some conveniently placed employees. the song was totally stupid... i think i could drunkenly offer a few lines on a sheet of paper that would far exceed it and probably win a grammy. then, as if the writers could come up with no better way to escape the ridiculousness of the scene, fischer says something to the effect of, "don't tell (insert the guy's name). he doesn't like music" and smiles. i can't describe how bad this is, i felt a little embarrassed. and that guy debbie reynolds works with and who's always hitting on her is so annoying too. i can't even imagine someone like her wasting a fraction of time on him. the jokes were delivered without any sort of chemistry between characters which made the movie crawl by. at least the baby had cute hair. the two stars are for reynolds, who was like a swan among ugly ducklings.<br /><br />see bachelor mother instead.
