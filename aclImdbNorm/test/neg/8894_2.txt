any fan of russian cinema will have great difficulty in believing the sub-par performances phoned-in by mashkov and bodrov jr., and will perhaps be utterly perplexed by bodrov sr.'s hackneyed and confusing script, which is coupled with uncharacteristically weak direction. most of the characters wander through the movie as though they have no idea who they are or what they are doing. it is also sad to see that jennifer jason leigh's acting skills have not advanced one iota since fast times at ridgemont high, and her screen exposure is mercifully limited. this is a terrible mafia movie; so much so that it makes the godfather iii look like a winner in the genre. to see the key russians at their best, check out bodrov sr.'s work on prisoner of the mountains (which also features jr.), mashkov's turn in vor (the thief), and bodrov jr.'s new criminal in brat.
