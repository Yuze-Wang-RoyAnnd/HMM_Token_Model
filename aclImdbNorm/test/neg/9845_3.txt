"ripe" is one of those awful indies which manages to get into circulation and give indies a bad name. telling a stupidly incongruous tale of pubescent twin sisters who crawl from a firey car crash which kills their parents and then hit the road while happily shoplifting, making goo-goo eyes at some guy, and ending up on an army post so dilapidated no army would want it (yeah, right!). an apparent attempt at a coming of age flick, "ripe" is an almost complete loser which wanders aimlessly as the players drift in and out of character finally ending clumsily with nary a shred of credibility to be found anywhere. not recommended for anyone.
