this was without a doubt the worst movie i have ever see, yet once i started, it was just like the really bad car wreck on the side of the road - you can't help yourself, you just have to look. my eyes !!! the acting was awful, the production was awful, the filming was awful, awful, awful, awful. i was glad the priest got chopped, would have loved to have done it myself because of his poor acting. i mean suck-ful acting to the tenth power. i would have cheered if chris had just axed the lot of them before turning it on himself. and what was with that freaking wig from hell on his head?! i sincerely hope no one got paid, i mean if getting paid were to be considered here, they should be paid to never attempt another film project again, everyone that was involved, never, never again. that was just a huge piece of garbage that i am embarrassed to say i just had to keep watching until the very end. don't watch it, it's about an hour and a half of your life you will never get back, and then you'll have to spend time registering on this website so you can write a comment like i am doing now, which you must do as a catharsis in order to survive the aftershocks of having viewed this film (and i use the term "film" loosely here).
