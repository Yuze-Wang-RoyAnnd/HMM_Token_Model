all in all, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />and if you want to see a movie that will take you back to 1983, this will do that for sure. the only reason i gave this movie 2 points more than it deserves is for 2 reasons:<br /><br />#1. michael caine<br /><br />#2. the people, the sights, the culture and the music of brazil <br /><br />the movie is almost completely carried by caine as he commits the seemingly impossible task of transforming it into a viable and semi-believable story. even joe bologna and valerie harper fall short. <br /><br />michael caine is pure class, as always. besides being a gifted classical and comic actor, caine brings a blend of introspection, mischievousness and sensitivity to every movie he does ... the focus of his charm as far back as his role in alfie...and the reason why he won the academy award for hannah and her sisters 2 years later. in this farce, he is tenderly beguiling...funny and vulnerable... melancholy and sentimental....and besides the jewel that is rio de janeiro, the only reason to not seek out a better form of entertainment.<br /><br />well...maybe a glimpse at the 2 lovely young actresses, michelle johnson and demi moore would be a reason. but look is all you can do at michelle (though her look seems sorely dated)....there couldn't be a more painful movie experience than watching her "try" to act (most of her dialogue seems overdubbed, too). demi's acting and looks hold up 100 times better and you could easily transplant her, as is, into any movie today (she doesn't really look much different to be honest). ms. moore is surely underused, especially considering she was the bigger star of the 2. <br /><br />save the fact that it is a silly farce, at the end, i actually kind of like the maturity with which all these people handle this scandalous situation...that it doesn't end friendships nor marriages and that an affair, even with the underage daughter of your best friend, could be forgiven and everyone can move on. the injured parties do show anger and disappointment at what transpired, but all works out for the best....a bit unrealistic for sure, but surprisingly refreshing. hope always is.
