i have seen this movie twice, once a few years ago in college, and again this past weekend. although i absolutely despised it the first time, i decided to give it another chance. terrence malick is clearly a well-respected director, and it seems that the imdb viewers, at least, think very highly of the film. but, unfortunately, it seems my tastes haven't changed at all.<br /><br />where to start? for one thing, linda manz's narration is horrific. her voice is so irritating with that horrendous new york accent (please don't try and convince me that chicagoans talk that way - they don't). she herself admitted to just sitting down and talking about random things, which does not make her a talented actress. she's not even acting! i came on imdb expecting to see her ripped apart, since her performance is just so utterly laughable, but people actually seemed to like it! she's simply unappealing in every way - i kept hoping malick would just kill her off.<br /><br />the other actors were fine, but certainly nothing special. adams was probably the strongest in the cast, but she also had the only decent part. except the old guy - he was pretty good.<br /><br />speaking of acting, how could shepard's character be so ridiculously stupid?? he bought the "brother and sister" act because...uh, why would he buy that? bill and abby took every single opportunity to be touchy-feely, as though they didn't realize that their lives depended on acting in a very platonic way. it was just completely unbelievable. and finally, after a considerable amount of time, the farmer suddenly realizes that, "oh my god, they're together!" then he goes after bill with a gun, but instead seems to trip into bill's hand and ends up with a mortal stab wound.<br /><br />speaking of which, the fate of the characters was similarly stupid (and, dare i say, lazy). of course bill has to die - could it be more boring than getting shot in a pond by a pack of cops? abby goes on with her happy life, getting on a train and feeling really content about the way things worked out. and the irksome narrator randomly finds her deadbeat friend and they wander off into the sunset. but it's okay, because malick never gave me any reason to care about the characters anyway.<br /><br />as for the plot, this film drags along endlessly with no real plot twists or development. i can't believe it's only 94 minutes long - i could have sworn i was sitting in my seat for a solid 3 hours. the sudden locust disaster was like throwing the bible in my face; i'm totally fine with metaphors and allusions, but this was completely over the top. clearly the message was, "don't marry for money or bad things will happen to you." very original.<br /><br />i understand that "days of heaven," like all of terrence malick's films, is meant to be a piece of art. and i will certainly agree that the cinematography is simply stunning, and the magic hour shots add a unique aura to the film. but i need more than nice pictures to enjoy a film, and this one just didn't do it for me.
