now i know that a lot of black humor pokes fun at typical black things like for example gold teeth. but that doesn't mean that they always are funny. don't be a menace is an example of this. the urban movie certainly lends itself for satire. the problem is that wayans and consorts not only try satirize the typical 'ghetto' culture, they also belittle valid statements that are made in urban movies such as boyz 'n' the hood or menace ii society. personally i think that the makers of this movie should get their heads away from the bowel movements of their white masters. besides this, the movie in itself is terrible. it's absolutely not funny. the jokes are racist. instead of satirizing the urban movie genre, the moviemakers show their views of the 'ignorant' urban (ghetto) blacks. now there are some other jokes in this movie, but i believe this to be the main fare.<br /><br />in conclusion this movie is crap and the makers should use their talents to make a constructive comedy/satire movie. they have examples in men with black hats (which was made before this movie) and friday.
