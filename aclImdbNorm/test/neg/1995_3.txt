after nearly getting killed by a big dog, a stray cat thinks to herself, "why can't i be a skunk? then everyone would leave me alone." she looks around the junkyard and gets an idea: white paint, black paint and some limburger cheese and some garlic......hmmmm. the next thing you know, we have the forerunner to "pepe le pew," although in this cartoon, she's still a cat, she's a she, and just a skunk in disguise. <br /><br />the cat also is enjoying and taking full advantage of her new status as a smelly skunk. he's a happy, content guy now.....until a real skunk (with the charles boyer imitation voice) shows up! <br /><br />i did appreciate the cat putting on a bugs bunny outfit. however, overall i never cared for these french-takeoff characters, finding the stereotypical dialog overdone and not really funny, so i only rate this as "fair." i do this a point, however, for the moral at the end of the story.
