this has to be one of the biggest misfires ever...the script was nice and could have ended a lot better.the actors should have played better and maybe then i would have given this movie a slightly better grade. maybe hollywood should remake this movie with some little better actors and better director.sorry guys for disappointment but the movie is bad.<br /><br />if i had to re-watch it it would be like torture. i don't want to spoil everyone's opinion with mine so..my advice is watch the movie first..see if u like it and after vote(do not vote before you watch it ! ) and by the way... have fun watching it ! don't just peek...watch it 'till the end :))))))))) !!
