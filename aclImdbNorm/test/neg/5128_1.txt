i was a sophomore in college when this movie came out and i had never actually seen it until last night. i finally decided to watch it because i like good dancing and because the movie had such cultural impact. after seeing the movie i am completely baffled by how it had any effect other than putting people to sleep.<br /><br />the story is pretty preposterous when you think about it. does anyone actually buy the idea that that beer joint full of gnarly old steel-workers and teamsters could keep their client`ele with the high concept dances that those girls were doing? they would have all been over to zanzibar faster than you can say "performance art". can you imagine the reaction of the real life versions of that audience to that bizarre tv watching no theater dance thing that she did? please.<br /><br />it seems plausible to me that there could be a woman that worked in a steel yard and was also a dancer--after all both are physically demanding jobs. but i didn't buy for a second that that girl worked in a steel yard. and i didn't buy for a second that i was looking at a real steel yard. steel work is dangerous. you don't keep your work area looking like a junk yard and not end up loosing a limb. i love some of the inane shots like when two welders are sitting in the big corrugated tubes welding. what the hell are they doing in there? or when she is cutting six inches off of a rusty steel bar with a cutting torch. she was obviously board and just started cutting random things up.<br /><br />but story holes like that can be overlooked if the movie is fun or at least stimulating in some way. flashdance doesn't offer anything to balance it, however.<br /><br />the dancing horrible. it is the spastic twitch-and-pose style that ruined american musicals until...well are we really over it yet? the sensuality that the movie tries for is ruined by jennifer beal's complete lack of personality. i mean i am a 42 year old male and when she was supposed to be eating lobster my only reaction was to think that she should get a lobster bib.<br /><br />you can't really get behind alex and her dreams because her character is so stupid and shallow. the dog had more going on than she did.<br /><br />the love affair is flat. it comes across as nothing more than a boss with the hots for one of his workers. zero passion.<br /><br />even the final scene where she dances for orville redenbacher and some other stiffs is unsatisfying because the panels reaction is so unbelievable. what serious dancers wouldn't roll their eyes at alex's lame cheerleader routine? in short the movie had nothing but leg-warmers and large sweatshirts. oh, yeah, there is a good chunk of nudity when alex "rescues" her friend from being a useless erotic dancer (a laughable bit of hypocrisy). other than that the movie is a waste of time. i wish that the mst3k crew were still in business. this would make good fodder for them.
