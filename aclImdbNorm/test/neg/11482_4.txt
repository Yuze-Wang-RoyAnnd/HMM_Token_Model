i expected a lot more out of this film. the preview looked interesting so i decided to check it out. bottom line is that "the adventures of sebastian cole" only had one decent thing: adrian grenier.<br /><br />i really like grenier and found his performance to be very pleasing. the character is designed well, but everything else sort of just drifts along through the duration of the movie. clark gregg is really good, but i don't think that his character was explained too well. i mean there's not too much to explain; he wants to become a woman. still, something was missing. <br /><br />the obvious low budget of the film was nice to see. i enjoyed that the movie was filmed on just a script (a bad one at that) and just a few actors. it was a nice change.<br /><br />while the main idea of the film was actually okay, it became disappointing to see a lot of scenes that had nothing to do with it just thrown in here and there. like i said, the script looked promising and i must say that i was interested where director tod williams was headed, but it was basically a very slow movie with not too good of dialogue.<br /><br />"sebastian" started to look good towards the end, but again, it fell right back down into a hole. the acting was mostly good, the writing is in need of some work, yet the budget of the film helped it out in the long run.<br /><br />i would recommend this to someone if they wanted to watch a quiet movie with a strong lead character, but other than that i would stay away. personally, i wouldn't watch it twice.
