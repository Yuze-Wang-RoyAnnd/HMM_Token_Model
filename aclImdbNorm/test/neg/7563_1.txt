how living the dream managed to get into the laemmle 5 in west hollywood is beyond me, as it is the worst film i have ever seen in my life. i should have known when the first scene opened in-gasp, eugene, oregon-,that this dud of a film with characters that you want to like and feel sorry for from their exclusion days from high school,but can't, as they are such losers, is so wooden and atrocious with dialog that is beyond bad.<br /><br />then, clich'e, the three high school losers end up in la, and here is where the film could have been realistic if it had shown them trying to find a career in acting. but no, one works as a used car salesman, the other is a true loser in a garage call center selling magazines. even the bastard that runs the place has more audience appeal than that dreadful actor with the horrible foreign accent. and, they fraudulently get money from an insurance scam to set up an executive recruitment firm with no experience, just showing "the supposed good life" in la night spots with a cast of actors that are so wooden and bad, they better not have sag cards...<br /><br />i could go on and on about this bad film, but i ended up walking out of the theater, which had at the start six people, and when i left four men were the only ones in the audience. i wanted to like this film, but i couldn't find one merit in the story, characters, writing, dialog, nor the actors. whoever cast this film should retire. amen...enough...
