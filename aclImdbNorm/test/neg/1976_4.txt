so after the initial disappointment of the first final fantasy movie, which seemed to bare next to no resemblance to the final fantasy series, final fantasy: advent children has released itself to a warm reception and, now, a dedicated fanbase. and the reason for the films success is understandable as it has lush graphics, fast moving fight sequences and some cool as hell characters. however, if you haven't played ff7 then it is likely that you will not enjoy this film as it's storyline carries on from the game without previous explanation and your likely to get lost from the plot even if you have played the game. secondly, there is no character development, without previous knowledge from the game your opinions on the characters are limited to 'cool' and 'not cool'. of course, for ff7 fans the film is almost guaranteed to entertain, at least for nostalgic reasons, and it's cool seeing all the characters you grew to love from the game rendered in some pretty amazing computer animation. one last complaint, the film, at least in my opinion, attempted to cram too much into less than two hours and therefore the last half hour or so seems horribly rushed. if you played and enjoyed ff7 than it is a worthwhile watch, though nothing too special. if you have not played ff7 then it is best that you play it first before watching this film.
