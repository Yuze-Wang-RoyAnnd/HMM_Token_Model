on the cusp of being insufferable. somehow i stayed just slightly interested, but was it because i truly wanted to know what the "secret" was (which, i should say, is pretty damned obvious) or because i hoped scarlett johansson would put on a more sexy outfit? this movie is poor and what's more it's a disgrace to all the lonely, alcoholic southern literature professors out there. travolta wants his oscar so bad he is willing to cry drunkenly in the bathroom after urinating blood. sorry, pal. . .you were more believable is "staying alive." not everyone can pull a peter fonda in "ulee's gold." if you want the against-type brave anti- hero oscar you have to, um, actually act. . .not just pout on screen. stop this director before he/she (name is vague on gender) directs again!
