peter hunt started out as a very gifted film editor and got his first stab at directing when he helmed the james bond film "on her majesty's secret service" (considered by many bond fans to be the best of the series). other titles in his filmography include epic scale adventure movies like "gold" and "shout at the devil", both adapted from wilbur smith novels. "gulliver's travels" is an odd one on his list of films; it seems strange that a director of hunt's style and expertise would choose to direct a film of this kind. a half-live action/half-animated retelling of jonathan swift's classic satire, the film looked twenty years out of date even when it was made, and in all honesty it simply doesn't work. and there's not a damn thing that hunt (with his usual eye for fast-paced action), or star richard harris (who can usually enliven the most stilted of roles) can do to rescue this one.<br /><br />lemuel gulliver (richard harris) is a brilliant medical student living in 17th century bristol. his father (norman shelley) wants him to go to london to make his fortune; but gulliver prefers the idea of receiving rather less pay but a heck of a lot more adventure as a ship's surgeon aboard a ship called the 'antelope'. during a voyage, the 'antelope' is blown off course during a storm and hits a reef. the ship sinks and everyone is lost, apart from gulliver
