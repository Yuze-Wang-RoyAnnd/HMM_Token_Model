hannibal must be the most god-awful movie i have seen in a long time. in fact, i want my money back. what a waste of time. no plot, minimal character development, questionable motives, poor dialogue, sub-standard acting. what else can i say? if you haven't seen it don't bother. i wouldn't even hire out the video and if you happen to come by it on tv... change the channel. the only reason anyone might have to see this movie would be to see whether the gratuitous violence lived up to all the hype (which quite frankly is why they added it). if you want to see some gug eating his own brain, then fast forward to that bit.<br /><br />what was the purpose of this movie? its like someone just asked 'i wonder what hannibal is up to these days' and we just went along for the ride. he is free in the beginning and he's free at the end. in between is a lot of self-indulgence on the part of anthony hopkins and the film makers. julianne moore tries valiantly to inject some life into her clarice, but they gave her a sub-standard script and as far as i'm concerned she was set up to fail.<br /><br />in my opinion this is just a very very bad story in every sense of the word. the only reason it made so much money was because of the senseless violence they added, which at the end of the day leaves you more with a feeling of contempt than the horror you are supposed to feel.<br /><br />i give it a big fat raspberry!
