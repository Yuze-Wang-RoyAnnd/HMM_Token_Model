dracula 3000 or van helsing "dracula's revenge" (cheap cash in on another lame vampire flick) as i saw it is a master class in how not to make a movie. a rag tag collection of misfit salvager's board a previously lost cargo ship "the demeter" in the (cough) carpathian system (which later is upgraded to the carpathian galaxy) and awake a relentless evil (in this case the script). the film is a bizarre bastardization of event horizon and whatever the lamest vampire film of all time is.<br /><br />****spoliers follow**** after a plethora of production company logos and a credit sequence that most of the budget must have been blown on, we open with a cheesy exposition type speech from casper (silly name) who plays captain abraham van helsing (sillier name) and in lieu of actual character development, goes on to describe the twisted, unintelligible oddities that make up his crew. van helsing himself sports a spray on stubble and wears a body warmer throughout in a sort of retro 80's tribute to han solo (i guess). now and again the captain of the demeter pops up in some sort of mad video diary to tell us nothing of consequence in a pronounced german accent (subtitles sadly not included). crewmember mina boards the derelict ship (alone???) armed only with a gun shaped torch and thick east-european accent while conversing with van helsing on his ships bridge (which is basically a single glittery wall). mina wearing a gas mask with rubber hoses glued to the front, encounters what can only be described as a skateboarder in a black cloak who continually glides by the camera. why this happens as the vampire is not yet made flesh is never explained. this leads on to a shaky camera chasing mina down the hallways until she runs into humvee. it's possible will smith could have been drafted in to write humvee's lines as most of them consist of humvee reminding us he is black every ten seconds and saying the word "ass" enough for a guinness book of records entry while delivering all this in a "from da hood" accent (this is the year 3000, does "da hood" even exist?) one of the main problems with this film is that it insanely tries to pretend its set in the year 3000. unfortunately anyone with healthy eyes won't buy this, as the demeter looks suspiciously like a soviet style ocean going tanker. possibly the film crew thought it would be okay to leave hammer and sickle symbols everywhere and a sexy poster of lenin next to a bunch of lockers and explain it away as some sort of futuristic communist comeback special. the crew's clothes look as if they were raided from a oxfam collection box (sealed since 1993) and they are armed to the teeth with latest in 20th century automatic weapons (with added year 3000 zing when fired) which of course are absolutely no use against vampires. healthcare is a thing of the past (in the future) as the simpering professor not only has glasses but is in a wheelchair??? my god what happened to all that genetic engineering stuff.<br /><br />the professor is an interesting character as he is a direct rip off from alien resurrection who had their own rag tag misfit crew with a guy in a wheelchair (who oddly wasn't killed). fans didn't take to prof as he appears scared in a lot of scenes if i were entombed in a non-wheelchair access soviet ship pursued by bad acting vampires, and everyone left me because i was such a whining wimp, i'd be scared too.<br /><br />during the un-dramatic mina chase scene the prof informs us (with feeling) "this is disconcerting". the rest of his lines are also disconcerting "bugger", and "we're all going to die" x 100, follows.<br /><br />erika eleniak appears as the vice captain (what happened to 1st officers?) in what i thought would be the tired, standard issue, hard nosed, no nonsense, "don't eye me up unless i tell you too", beat up 10 stuntman at one time super-babe, but this is a z-flick so she basically wears a tight low cut top and even tighter leather trousers. coolio's performance boosts the ham factor by 90% and is camper than a row of tents but luckily for us he dies soon enough. although he seems to keep his heart on the right hand side of his body.<br /><br />after a lot of running up and down the same corridor, using clunky soviet style controls, and sitting in soviet style locker rooms the crew find themselves stranded as their own ship buggers off to find a more interesting crew (probably). why dracula is even mentioned is unknown as the main bad guy is called orlock which is space transylvanian for "crimes against fashion" as he dandies about in a big puffy, frilly shirt and even bigger starched collar making hammer horror vampires look slick by comparison. orlock stops to explain his entire back story (off camera) to erica eleniak, but fails to kill her in another rip-off twist from alien resurrection. his back story is such a load of mince it's not worth repeating. as the budget can't afford fight coordinators, special effects, original music, script (not written by a chimpanzee) and even proper end titles (the first cast list i saw, were same characters but completely different and italian names) the film begins to destroy whatever sanity you began with. the crew luckily are able to fight back with the help of a ships computer that contains obscure, millennium old references on how to kill fictional creatures and some handy 20th century pool cues they find in the ship recreation room (up yours "holodeck"). the ending is awful and a little suspect, either they ran out of money or the ex-soviets demanded their ship back. i walked into this film knowing it was bad but oblivious as to how bad it really was.
