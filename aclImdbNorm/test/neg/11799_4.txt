ted nicolaou made a lot of great horror and fantasy films. i am looking for all his films to see. i could not find this one for 3 year, until i unexpectedly found it in youtube. to tell the truth i wanted to see more ghosts and less talks here. it looks like in 1999-2001 ted had a crisis , maybe in money. his features of this time look more like real low budget thrash z garbage movies. but i do not claim him to be a bad director this time . everything happens. the ending has some nice creepy details and suspense but the whole film was long dull dialogues .<br /><br />only for real ted's fans.<br /><br />www.myspace.com/neizvestnostlab
