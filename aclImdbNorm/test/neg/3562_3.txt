this movie tries to say something profound; i'm just not sure what it was. too much is left unresolved in the end for me to figure out the main point. a couple scenes really have me wondering what was left on the cutting room floor. i don't think the wall was very well developed i never got what was actually going on there. when the mother finally unveils it i just couldn't make any connection to the boy's silence. what was the point of the boy not talking? was he just delusional or did he acquire some sort of power. what was the scene with the burnt girl all about? another power the boy has or what? i don't understand how that developed any character or moved the plot. i got the bully bit but what happened to the dog? did the dog come back or did mom get rid of fido for good somehow? <br /><br />there were several additional plot elements that were more clutter than use. like the radio talk show in the background discussing the iraq war. i think that was supposed to create some sort of comparison to the grief and insecurity the mother and addison were experiencing but for me it was distracting and strained. i didn't buy the link very much. i also found the teacher getting on addison about not saying "here" for roll call a bit much. the mom seeing the doctor was pointless, how did it serve the plot? was that to show how desperate the mother was getting, or was it something about the medicine that i didn't get? was that the dad coming back in the last scene, or just some guy? so did writing on the wall work? what happened to the dog?
