i purchased this one for a couple of dollars at the local video store, as they cleared out their tapes in favour of dvds. i doubt they'll be replacing this one, somehow.<br /><br />i couldn't say that it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen, but it's very dull. no real cannibal scenes. me me lai is not naked enough of the time (only about 4 or 5 times). and she's not the thai goddess that i expected, either. so two of my reasons for watching this movie were knocked out.<br /><br />there is some severe animal violence here for those that enjoy that sort of thing. a great fight between a mongoose and a large snake gets quite bloody. animal torture, as well, some of which is real and some fake. thankfully the fake is somewhat funny, but the real is just a little sickening.<br /><br />generally speaking, it's a 70s film - overly long, under-developed, not as deep as it would have liked to have been. but it's something different, right? one and a half stars!
