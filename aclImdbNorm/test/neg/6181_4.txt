ok, so i saw this movie at this year's sundance, and i was sorely unimpressed. it took a good fifteen minutes of footage before there was an edit or a line of dialogue that made any sense, and it took another 30 minutes before the ham-fisted script gave way to a working plot that wasn't contingent on a close-up of ryan gosling's smile or contrived moralizing. after the first 45 minutes however, the script blossomed into a watch-able albeit not completely entertaining or thought-provoking. the highlights certainly include both gosling and morse's acting, gosling being an up-and-coming star, and morse being an extremely well-established character actor with a good feel for disparate emotions. as a sidenote, after the screening i was talking a little smack about the movie to some of my friends when david morse walked right behind me--he looks like the nicest guy in the world, but he's a solid 6'2" and probably outweighs me by 50 pounds. i removed my foot from my mouth and promptly changed the subject.
