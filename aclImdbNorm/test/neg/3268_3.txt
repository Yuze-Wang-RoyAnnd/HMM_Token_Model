caddyshack ii is nothing compared to the original caddyshack. but, there are legitimate reasons for it. (1) rodney dangerfield was supposed to be the ace of this film but he didn't like the script, wanted to change it, his request was denied, so he didn't do the film. (2) it was low budget, bill murray had grown to superstar status. ted knight passed away in 1986, and chevy chase the "so called ace" of the first movie (although it was rodney all the way)couldn't't be on more than 5 minutes, because it would cost too much to pay him. but you had dan aykroyd, robert stack, randy quaid and jackie mason, all serviceable substitutes, who none had their best performances.
