i liked some of the characters, but our lead relied too heavily on a charming smile. i didn't care two whits about him. he makes bad choices and i really didn't care since he did not seem to either. he seemed rather unintelligent. there were a couple of moments that provided a chance at some human insight (the scene with the whale was interesting), but these are lost in the general malaise of the film. the love interest was acceptable and the other various characters were mildly interesting, but the plot meanders around too much and left me wanting at many points in the film. in the end, i wondered why i stayed so long.<br /><br />there are some tepidly humorous moments, but ultimately i did not care. i cannot fathom rating the film higher. - 3 of 10
