i watched the first few episodes a short while back and felt i couldn't take it anymore. the horrible looking fight scenes are the worst i've ever scene in my life. about one-third of each episode is dedicated to flash gordon and his "mighty" fight moves. i know fight choreography from that era isn't exactly up to par with today's standards, but this is ridiculous. they don't even try to make it look realistic. flash gordon, who hardly resembles a fighter, uses his drunken slow moves and bare fist to knock out four or five guys with knives, guns, and other weapons. give me a break! there's also a scene where he does some similar act while in the water. basically every episode has scenes similar to that. as for the rest of the episode, there's not much else i remember. i basically viewed it out of curiosity on what science fiction looked like 70 years ago.
