chris ricci sleepwalks her way through most of this, but then quickly takes on an air of boredom and disdain - much as i did when watching it. without her this would be no more than a cheap kids' movie, but at least she does add an air of quality. there are few, if any, more visually striking and charismatic young actresses in the business.<br /><br />there's not much wrong with it as long as you accept it for what it is - a cheap disney re-make aimed at very undemanding children. i could watch ricci all day so i'm probably oblivious to many of the movie's shortcomings, but unless you too are a ricci fan, a cat-lover, or very small child, i doubt you will find this very entertaining.
