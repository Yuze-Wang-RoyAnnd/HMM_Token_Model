truly a great leap forward in the perfection of painful cinema.<br /><br />everything about this film is bad. acting (if it can be called that), lighting, sound, script (if there was one), editing, direction, camera work, it is all atrocious. there is not a single element that is done well. if i thought that this was intentional then i might give the film some credit but i can not believe people would set out to make such a horendous film.<br /><br />this film is worth buying and screening to your worst enemies.
