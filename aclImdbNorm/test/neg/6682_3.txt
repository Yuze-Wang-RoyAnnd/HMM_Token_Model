this was a first feature for clinton, i was there, while he shot this mess back in adelaide around 98...<br /><br />although i wasn't involved directly in the production, i was witness to the typically delusional behavior, post set, that went down,: the parties, the drugs, the illusionary glamor, really an example of what not to do when making a film, but also a byproduct of young, talented people getting caught up in classic ideologies of fame & worldly position.<br /><br />i like clinton, we had a curious friendship, he deserves to have another crack with a more mature script...there the problems lay, and i'm sure a much better job will be done, if there's a next time round.! because, frankly, he certainly didn't do himself any favours with this on his cv and neither did the cast...but hey, it was a paying job, in country where actors regularly starve to death<br /><br />in summary, fascinating to watch 'the making of' basically, not so much fun to experience (alas!).
