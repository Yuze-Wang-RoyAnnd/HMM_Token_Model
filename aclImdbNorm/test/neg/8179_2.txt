i guess this is in the public domain as its out on dvd. first off, this is a feel good propaganda movie to be shown to a wartime aussie audience, so its not to be considered a serious retelling of tobruk. the first half to 3/4 is very dry stuff set in australia, i guess like many american war films where the recruits are getting together, oh man its soooo long. than we get to africa and tobruk, pretty bad, low budget stuff. the battle scenes on the dvd copy i watched were almost completely black. see it if you must, but be prepared to use the fast forward as i doubt you can take it after a few minutes. i enjoyed the cheesy italian "battle of el alamien" a whole lot more, also richard burton did an african theater war flick that was good "the desert rats", this movie is just a real period piece and should have stayed in that time, does not hold up well today (i doubt it was highly regarded back then either). i say the same thing about my american counterpart war flicks so don't take it personally aussies (i love australia, been there twice!).
