this movie has it all: it is a thriller, a chase movie, a romance story, a mob tale, a comedy, a road movie... well, in fact it's none of this at all. <br /><br />all the time you are waiting for something interesting to happen, but no, you are still watching the same dull, uninspiring and superficial clich'e of a movie with a very bad soundtrack. even the star cast acting is lacking in credibility. a hit man with his quirks, a girl who's playing hard to get, mob guys acting tough and incapable cops, yawn...<br /><br />i'd recommend not to watch backtrack. if you want to see a good movie directed by a famous actor, go and see 'the three burials of melquiades estrada' by tommy lee jones. now, that's what i call worth watching.
