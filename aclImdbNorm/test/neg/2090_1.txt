last week on friday, i went to see "snakes on a plane" with my friends. it was amazing compared to this horrible film (however, many of the scenes were ridiculously hilarious). basically, some woman has a mayan curse where she pukes up harmless harmless garter snakes that, instead of attacking, crawl inside of they're victims. the girl with the bag of coke is pretty hot. on the title screen it says "100 passengers... 3,000 venemous vipers!" scary, i know. there weren't even 100 passengers on the train. only a couple of stoners and some other washed out losers. it's worth the five bucks to see the woman turn into a huge cg snake and devour the whole train then get sucked into a huge vortex though. it's just sad that someone would go to such lengths to make a crap film, only to make a few bucks because of the "snakes on a plane" craze.
