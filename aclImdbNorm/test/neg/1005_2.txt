three businessmen are involved in a bar fight with three mysterious men. the three businessmen take revenge, which escalates to a murder after another. supposedly the story is about the violence that could happen to ordinary people.<br /><br />the plot has too many holes. the details were ignored in order to move the story forward. the acting was uneven. the color balance was awful even though i watched this movie in dvd. the small budget and tight schedule were apparent. the whole thing seems to be an excuse to shoot the final gun fight, and the ending was just unbelievable.
