talk about creepy. if you really want to sit down and watch this episode where the girl who was in firefly later on gets kidnapped there's entertainment for you, but only if you like this sort of thing. i don't so i thought, to be frank, this episode was appalling. thankfully it's one of a few duff episodes in season 3, and the only charles grant craig episode, so you don't get much of this sort of thing in season 3. so, overall verdict? just read the summary at the top. this is a strong contender (hell money says hi!) for worst episode of season 3. to be honest though, i hadn't really expected much. i wish i could oubliette this episode altogether. that's one thing they got right: the title.
