yes, i admire the independent spirit of it all, but it's like road trip with a bad cast and no budget.<br /><br />i chuckle when i watch american comedies, i don't laugh. this movie made me laugh, but only because of the abundantly obvious attempts to simulate high-budget american high school/pot-flicks.<br /><br />if you want good independent american comedy with pot-references, go watch kevin smith or richard linklater flicks or something. don't waste your time on this piece of sh't movie.<br /><br />i mean, how can you take these comments seriously when most people are complaining about the characters not smoking pot!<br /><br />and by the way: in norway it's called "dude, where's my pot"!
