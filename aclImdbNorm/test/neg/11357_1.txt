if you want to waste a small portion of your life sit in front of this predictable zombie film. it fails at the first post by not being scary or funny. it is a dull grey movie that i guess went straight to video. hammy and tongue in cheek acting leave a sour taste in the mouth. if you want to watch a poor but still watchable recent zombie film watch diary of the dead. poor special effects, school level script. zombie films work if they have a moral point or even a political point . this movie has nothing, there is no worthy point that zombification underscores. this is as thrilling and convincing as a republican convention, no sorry watching the republican convention would be a better example of a zombie movie.
