oh my god, it just doesn't get any worse than this!!! i always love silly little sci-fi b-movies that are so stupid they are funny and i thought that this would be one of those, but this was just so stupid i found it absolutely deplorable that it was allowed to be released. what were these people thinking? they are obviously not real filmmakers and i really hope that they have gone back to their day jobs after realizing that this is the best they could do! the acting and the not-so special effects were nowhere near the standard of even the lowest budget b-movies. and what is with the men dressed up as women, could they not find any women that wanted to appear in this crappy thing. no, probably not.<br /><br />i would give this a "0" if possible, it does not even deserve a "1" for awful. do not waste your time (and especially not your money) on this horrible loser of a non-film!
