(may contain spoilers) this movie is the epitome of weirdness. i rented it hoping for a film so bad it would be funny. however, i still honestly can't decide if this film was intended to be scary or humorous. it combines the emotions in a rather disturbing way. apparently this is trying to be clever but in actual fact it isn't. for instance, when the knife comes out and tries to kill the teacher, it starts playing happy music. when we go to toxico, we have up-beat, quasi-mr. roger's neighborhood music. however, when the little kid's dreaming of falling in "blood" and when he finds the leg, these are clearly intended to be tense. so, watch this film, and decide for yourself. it is too weird to be described in words and for that i say, kudos.<br /><br />"nose-dive... wow!"
