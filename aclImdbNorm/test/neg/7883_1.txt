this film is about two female killers going on a tour to kill random men they meet.<br /><br />wow, "baise-moi" just became the worst film of all time in my list. the plot is crazy, pointless and unnecessary. the whole film is full of violence and sex, and i am sure no sane parents would want to show this film to their children. i don't understand what people get out of by making this film, or watching this film. maybe someone somewhere has their perverted desires fulfilled. there is simply no excuse or reasons for the existence of this perverted and depraved piece of work.<br /><br />the only consolation i offer myself is that i watched it on fast forward, so that i have not wasted as much time.
