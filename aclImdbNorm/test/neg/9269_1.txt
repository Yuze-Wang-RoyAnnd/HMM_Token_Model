its hard to decide where to begin.i bought this for a few quid and its the worst few quid iv ever wasted. the back of the dvd had no pictures and a few lines plot summary, this should have warned me, but i usually like bad movies for a laugh so decided to give it a go. the movie is made up of three short stories,each revolving around someone who was on a particular bus at one point.(its never made clear what the significance of the bus is, or what city its set in)<br /><br />possible spoilers(as if there is anything to be spoiled) the first story is about a man who is persuaded, by a car, to purcahse it, against his wife's wishes.the car is sort of like a demonic brum and takes over his life.<br /><br />the second is about a slob of a man who never cleans his fridge and a monster bacteria man grows out of it.<br /><br />the third about a woman who goes to a dating agency, only to discover her date isnt all that normal.<br /><br />inbetween these, we are treated to shots of the bus(or a bus anyway) while a narrator whittles on a load of garbage about relationships(really,its like he is on commission for saying 'relationships')<br /><br />the movie actually has no redeeming features whatsoever.the acting, the costumes and the little spfx are all disgusting.there arent even any attractive female cast members to admire.simply put, this movie is a debacle.
