wild rebels is fun in a bad way, but also frustrating due to the actual good, or at least workable, elements in the story. it deals with a race car driver (steve alaimo) who gets mixed up in a group of bikers called satan's angels, who hang around a lot until they decide to rob a bank. meanwhile alaimo also gets recruited by the cops to report back to them what the angels are up to and where they'll rob next. it's not even that the film is really too 'dated', though it does of course carry the significantly crude and stupid music in the film (from the band on stage in one scene, to alaimo "performing" if you could call that drek that, to the regular generic score). <br /><br />it's just that there's not more care taken by the filmmaker into putting a little more logic, direction, and better actors for the parts. as it is i didn't have a major disliking towards the film, as i did with the hellcats, but it almost left me a little indifferent to it all, too. what could come through as being unpredictable only comes through with stupid things like the name of the florida town ('citrusville' ho-ho). so it's not completely un-worthy then of its mystery science theater 3000 status as of late. the commentary is good on the movie, even if once or twice i almost wanted to hear what the characters on screen were saying in case it might have some worth. wild rebels might be more of a good time if you've got a six-pack and low expectations, but as it is i wouldn't watch it again.
