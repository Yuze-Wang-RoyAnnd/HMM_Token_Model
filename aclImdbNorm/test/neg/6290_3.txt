kk should stick to singing- this whole movie was a big bore. i can't understand the viciousness of the boys and the romance between miles and kk- the sex scenes were uninspired too. the ending was awful- unresolved- there needs to be reason to murder. and the whole voyeurism of the boy was weird..... the mother always wrestled with the boy- don't you think he would get some rather freudian with her? and why didn't someone teach kk how to speak with inflection instead of monotone?<br /><br />glad i only paid $1.00 to rent this. <br /><br />
