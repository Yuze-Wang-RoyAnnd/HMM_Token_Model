mickey rourke ( who was once a famous movie star ) plays martin fallon an ira terrorist who accidentally blows up a school bus full of children who is so disgusted by his actions decides to leave the ira and goes on the run in london <br /><br />!!!! mild spoilers !!!!<br /><br />the movie's opening is rather disturbing as the lives of little children are ended in a fireball . things like this happened throughout the 1970s and 1980s and into the 1990s in northern ireland which gives a prayer for the dying a stark realism . however as soon as fallon decides he's going to give up violence ( what ? he's a terrorist and he's never blown up innocent passerbys before ? ) realism disappears and clich'es and ridiculous plot twists take place . martin is employed by the london underworld ( don't they have their own hit men ? )to commit a hit while he wears an ira " uniform " ( never knew the provos wore uniforms ) at a cemetery in broad daylight ( wouldn't an ira man use a bomb placed under a car ? ) where he's spotted by a priest who recognises him while he was in the sas . hands up who thinks i'm lying ? i'm not and we're half way through the running time and there's still several clich'es to come <br /><br />this all sounds very silly and it is but what do you expect from a novel by jack higgins ? everything is clich'ed , contrived and stereotypical and the bits that aren't are just plain bizarre . the critics slaughtered this movie when it came out , most notably they stated that it might have some potential if the movie had bob hoskins playing gangster jack meehan and alan bates playing the sas soldier turned priest and for once the critics would have been right . they should also noted the film might have been less dire if fallon was played by someone who was capable of doing an irish accent . rourke might be hunky and macho ( oh gawd another movie with an ira uberhunk ) but accents aren't his strong point any more than character acting is . to give you an idea how disappointing prayer for the dying is the director ended up disowning it which is always a bad sign <br /><br />as a footnote the original release of prayer for the dying in britain was delayed for several months because of " the enniskillen bombing " . in november 1987 the provisional ira exploded a bomb in the centre of enniskillen where a remembrance day parade which commemorates britain's war dead was being held . eleven ( 11 ) people were killed and scores more injured . it wasn't an accident and no one left the ira because of it
