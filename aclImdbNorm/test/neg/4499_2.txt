more of a frisbee like turtle with fangs that go up like a wart hog. more battles with people in bird suits that look like people in bird suits. a ping pong ball space ship. two naughty boys who know how to do everything, including getting on board the space ship. more tiresome music. more "gamera is the friend of children" stuff. i remember when godzill and rodan came out. the movies were a lot of fun because the monsters were actually a threat to people. now they are just a parade of silly costumes with very little behind them. the adults are all ridiculous and moronic. like in american sitcoms, the kids are the bosses (when in reality they couldn't think their way out of a paper bag). these monster movies must be the japanese means of partonizing these little snots. above all, however, is that after seeing three of these movies (with the same plot over and over; check the stock footage), the ultimate conclusion is that they are boring. if you haven't see this one, don't bother.
