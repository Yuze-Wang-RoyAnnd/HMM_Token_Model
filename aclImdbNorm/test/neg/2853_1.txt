i sincerely wonder why this film was ever made. a bulgarian-italian co-production set in a version of berlin where all germans speak english with a german accent and all turks speak english with some turkish words in between, is hardly credible. the english vocabulary is basically limited to "fuck you, bastard" and the acting is worse than anyone can imagine. apart from this, racial tensions in germany can be an interesting subject but in the germany i know there are no gangs shooting each other in the middle of the street in clear daylight. and if all that is not enough, there is also a serial killer going around who kills turkish children and paints them white. in order to create some tension, we see the serial killer and hear him hum schubert's lullaby but we won't see his face. <br /><br />i don't even believe they actually shot it in germany. there are some street shots that are quite obviously in berlin, but the actors are not seen in those shot. it's probably bulgaria with some german signs added here and there.
