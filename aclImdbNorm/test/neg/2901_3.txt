following the movie that represents the pinnacle of the 1980's ninja genre namely, 'the revenge of the ninja' salivating fans were 'treated' to this bizarre offering that mixes ninja shenanigans with spiritual possession....the end result being not dissimilar in nature to that somewhat horrifying experience when one spies a nugget of human poop floating menacingly towards oneself in a public swimming pool.<br /><br />take for instance the supposed 'action packed' introduction which is set of all places on a golf course(!) here we witness an evil green clad ninja slaying a group of golfers for apparently no discernible reason whatsoever (although i must admit that the shallow elitist attitude adopted by many participants of this particular sport does irk me somewhat though...hmmmm perhaps that's why he murdered them?.....yep i can relate to that after all). actually later in the movie we are told that one of the golfers was a top scientist but this story line is never elaborated upon nor alluded to ever again!!!<br /><br />anyway back to the intro, the police proceed to surround the golf course and basically shoot the absolute hell out of the assassin....and they have to keep on shooting him because he just won't stay down!!! yes literally hundreds of rounds are pumped into him and still he gets up to slay evermore of the law enforcement numbers.<br /><br />finally (after what seems like an eternity) our miscreant detonates a smoke bomb and disappears.....or so it seems, for in actual fact he is merely hiding beneath the soil and upon our decidedly gormless officers leaving the scene to search for his body, he crawls out from hiding and staggers away.<br /><br />we next see the lovely lucinda dickey, a truly beautiful actress and in superbly fit physical condition, here playing a telephone repair worker. from her high vantage point she happens to spot the dying (at last!!!!!) ninja. however, upon closer investigation the man, supposedly on his last legs suddenly leaps upon her and grapples her to the ground. after a bit of a struggle our feisty heroine manages to break free luckily but doesn't count on the ninja possessing hypnotic powers and she inevitably succumbs to them. it is at this point that the dying ninja actually projects his soul into our heroine! his intention is to use her corporeal form to slay those officers who killed him (the few he didn't actually manage to wipe out initially!)<br /><br />from this point on, throughout the film, whenever our heroine spots one of the aforementioned officers she is subjected to some overwhelmingly awful cinematic scenes of flashing lights, smoke effects and the sword that the ninja bequeathed unto her levitating towards her in a most wobbly manner!<br /><br />to make matters more complex, a particularly irritating police officer (who sports enough back and shoulder hair to put an average yak to shame!) persists in trying to win her affections (in a most bloody annoying manner!!!)......well of course it doesn't take the gift of preconception to work out that in a rather feeble 'shock' (less) twist towards the end of the film, he is revealed to be one of the officers she must slay!<br /><br />but wait there's some hope yet! <br /><br />step forward the one and only sho kosugi!<br /><br />yes, the ninja himself and looking here as cool as ever! golf club news obviously travels fast and upon learning of the said events that transpired there, he flies all the way from japan to sort the situation out (suspecting the worst!) in a brief sub story (that amounts to all of a few seconds!) sho's interest in this particular ninja is demonstrated to be personal after the said villain is shown to have murdered sho's father/teacher(?) and blinded one of sho's eyes (thus necessitating sho to wear a really decorative looking sword guard eye patch!)<br /><br />after stealing his dead nemesis's body from the morgue and then tracking down our heroine who provides an unwitting abode for the evil soul, matters climax at an oriental temple (seemingly in the middle of nowhere) where our man sho manages to reunite the two disjointed aspects.<br /><br />now reanimated from the dead, the evil ninja and sho battle it out in traditional ninja style with swords with the winner being........well yes you can probably guess.<br /><br />really this movie has only two things going for it, namely the always excellent kosugi (who looks absolutely fantastic in the role as always) and the lovely miss dickey. what a shame that the material they found themselves in here is such a rancid pile of ordure.<br /><br />oh well, to be fair, i've seen a lot worse than this in my time although i certainly still can't recommend this other than to those desperate to complete their sho kosugi/ninja movie collections.
