ineffectual, molly-coddled, self-pitying, lousy provider jimmy stewart is having a bad marriage to carole lombard. after falling on hard times, he endures a demeaning job, a fault-finding, passive-aggressive, over-bearing live-in mother who is in dire need of an epic smackdown, and an endlessly-crying baby. the movie trowels on failure and squalor to no discernible end. do you want to watch a couple bicker with his mom for ninety minutes? many scenes feature a shrieking baby. the movie fails to elucidate why we would want to endure the mother from hell, or why jimmy stewart can't grow a pair. who wanted to see this? who wanted to see stewart and lombard without laughs or charm?<br /><br />it's absolutely depressing and unendurable.
