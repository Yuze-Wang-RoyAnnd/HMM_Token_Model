being a great fan of disney, i was really disappointed when i watched this garbage.the animation was pretty,and the backgrounds were amazing,but i believe that good animation does not make up for a weak script,and weak story. i'm gonna have to disagree with the people who say it is not suitable for children.yes there are some deaths in the movie but isn't death something that children should at least be exposed to? but i digress. the script is riddled with bad puns and lame jokes...the kind i could expect from most dreamworks movies. the music was soppy,the morals forced(and forced without any charm whatsoever.)and the characters would burst into song at totally inappropriate times.the characters were also cold,and i really couldn't muster up any form of emotion towards them(bar irritation). i am a great fan of jungle book,aladdin,and emperors new groove, but this disney movie was a total and utter waste of time.....do not watch it!!!
