i never figured out what the attraction of karen black was. she always had those beady eyes and kind of an odd look about her. she seemed to often be eccentric or cast as the "other" woman. in this one, she is the psychic adviser and expert on the occult to a crummy producer of bad commercials as he learns astral projection. he is a mean sucker, even without the new baggage. apparently this is the avenue to immortality, because if you get good at it, you can inhabit the bodies of future generations. i believe star trek had a plot like this with jack the ripper hanging on for several centuries. anyway, this guy is really dangerous. he has a nice family and makes them miserable. he begins to murder friends, just because they have an unkind comment for them, or he doesn't like them. you can see the ending coming from the back row in left field. it's a very harsh, humorless movie. most of it must be taken as truth. why are some called but few chosen? i found it long and not very satisfying.
