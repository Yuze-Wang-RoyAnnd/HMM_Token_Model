to have to actually own up to making such a horrible movie! actually, i'm more embarrassed that i sat through the whole thing. it looks like an old 80's sci-fi movie complete with super-fake looking "special effects", queer imagery, and very cheesy dialogue. maybe that's the way they wanted it to look, maybe they think it's cool to do movies in 80's fashion like it will come back in style. who knows...<br /><br />if you think the promised eye-candy will save the film, you're in for a disappointment--the so-called "babes" are manish and downright ugly. they can't act at all, i don't understand why they couldn't at least get good looking chicks if they want babes with no talent! but i guess when you're making a film this stupid, you don't get very good choices, hot chicks aren't just lining up to do this kind of pitiful crap!
