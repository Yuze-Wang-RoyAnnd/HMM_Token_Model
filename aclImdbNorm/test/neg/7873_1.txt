one of the worst movies i've ever seen. when i was trying to watch this i had flu and i was pretty open minded for any brainless entertainment. unfortunately this was too much. how, so many totally ungifted actors can be in one movie? this movie makes porn look like european art-movie. cast just speaks out their lines without any emotions; special thanks to charlie snows (baldwin) soon-to-be-ex-wife who talks about her divorce like the rest of us talk about the weather. just horrible (and funny).<br /><br />with lots of booze and friends this might just make it as a background entertainment and few laughs, just like ed wood-movies. the plot is a joke and soundtrack straight from some cheeky soap-opera.<br /><br />hopefully nobody paid to see this movie.<br /><br />
