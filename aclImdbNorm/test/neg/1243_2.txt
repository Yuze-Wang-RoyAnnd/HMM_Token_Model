first of all..i've seen better acting and more realistic makeup in porno flicks. how bad was "chris moltisante" as stewie ungar? on the sopranos, chris is not taken too seriously and can be considered comic relief. and then throw in "bobby baccala" as one of his vegas cronies. it's just too much to take in a dramatic movie. neither actor can handle a serious role and is better suited as a second banana for tony,paulie, or uncle junior. and i want to know who did the makeup for this disaster? i want that person to be my make-up person over the next 25 years so i'll never age a day either. so that's all i'll write on this movie since it's not worth wasting too much more of my time. <br /><br />yes i do know that michael imperioli and steve schirippa are their real names.
