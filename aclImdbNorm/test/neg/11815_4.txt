pam grier is the super soul sister of the 1970's, appearing in many blaxploitation films that have recently been discovered and appreciated by a new generation. i can safely say that black mama, white mama may be the worst pam grier movie i've ever seen.<br /><br />grier is lee and margaret markov is karen; they are two female prisoners who escaped from prison after karen's revolutionary friends attacked the paddy wagon. chained to each other, the film becomes the defiant ones for women, but has three separate plots: a fat criminal (filipino sleaze star vic diaz) wants lee dead, a cowboy bounty hunter (the excellent sid haig) searches for the two girls; and karen's revolutionary friends search for her. the film eventually becomes so convoluted and uninvolved with the two women that the title should have been men chasing women. grier, an action star, is not given any chance to participate in any of the many (overlong) action scenes. markov is excellent as karen and grier is ok as lee, but both are eventually forgotten in the many subplots. one interesting scene has the bounty hunter forcing a police officer and his chief to drop their pants so he can shoot the one with the smallest penis (judged by his whore), but is easily forgotten amidst all the mayhem.<br /><br />black mama, white mama starts out great as a women-in-prison film complete with lesbian wardens and a shower scene, then completely switches to a chase film. if director eddie romero (famous for directing filipino horror films) had just stuck with the wip theme, he would have been fine. instead, bmwm gets real old real fast and the surprise ending just makes the audience wonder why they sat through a 90-minute film for it to end like this! another problem: where is the film supposed to be set? while some of the accents are hispanic and cities have spanish names (los robles, etc.), all the natives are obviously asian! hmmm... recommended only for die-hard grier fans, who even then will be disappointed.
