the production company for this film calls itself 'nott entertainment', and that is a surprisingly apt name. this very is very 'nott' entertaining from start to finish, which is a shame because a mix of zombie movie and western could have been interesting. every time a low budget zombie movie is released, it will tend to be "for the fans by the fans". i do actually consider myself a fan of zombie movies, but too many more like this one and i'll be re-evaluating my opinion! the film seems to be a rip-off of the half-decent aussie zombie flick 'undead', expect instead of just having the lead in a cowboy hat; everyone is wearing one; but this doesn't make a lot of sense because the film is apparently set in modern times. the credits sequence at the start of the movie fools us into believing that we're going to be in for an atmospheric film, but when the movie starts properly; it soon becomes apparent what we're actually in for. naturally, there's a fair amount of gore and it is actually fairly well done, though the good things i have to say about the film pretty much end there. there's a twist half way through which might have been interesting if the rest of the film was. overall, this is just another zombie movie in a world with far too many zombie movies. i don't recommend it.
