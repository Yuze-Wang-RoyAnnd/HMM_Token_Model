the only good either of the problem child films caused was bringing together amy yasbeck and the late john ritter. aside from that, the flicks are as demonic as their hero. in this basically unnecessary sequel, freshly separated ben (ritter) and his little hellraiser junior (michael oliver, who never needs screen-time ever again) move to a new town infested with willing bachelorettes. ben eventually picks lawanda (played by the most underused original snl-er laraine newman), whose blanche dubois tendencies don't suit junior in the least. to add on to junior's torture, it seems this town already has a little firestarter in younger girl form with trixie, who coincidentally has a sweet, single mother played by yasbeck, the same actress who played junior's first horrible mother-through-adoption. you can see where the plot goes from here. searching for my favorite scene is like pulling teeth, so i guess i'll go with the "cherry bomb in the toilet" gag that makes back to the future's james tolkan one of the many grown-up victims (that guy's always playing school authority figures). jack warden and gilbert gottfried return as their parts from the first film, but sadly, there is no appearance from the bow-tie klansma- er, i mean killer (michael richards) that made problem child all the more fun. on a serious note, i'm sure these films, whether abusive parents saw them or no, did wonders for the red-headed children of america. let us also salute these proud american flicks for their terrific promoting of adoption. oh, and dog poop jokes - gotta have dog poop jokes.... shmucks.
