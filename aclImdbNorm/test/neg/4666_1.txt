i can't remember when i've seen a worse movie. the acting was overwrought, the dialog trite to the point of being painful to listen to, the special effects second-rate and the overall story laughable.<br /><br />i've never wanted to walk out on a movie more, and if i'd been alone that's what i'd have done, about 30 minutes into it, and saved myself nearly another two excruciating hours of nausea-inducing dialog and a plot with more holes than a swiss cheese "the size of texas." i just can't overemphasize what a miserable experience sitting through this collosal waste of perfectly good celluloid was.<br /><br />
