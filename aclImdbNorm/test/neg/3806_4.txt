stodgy drama starring pat o'brien as a washed-up reporter who turns up at his ex-boss's house to ask for money to fund his son's operation, only to find him dead on the floor. since o'brien knows the identity of the culprit, he offers to take the rap in return for the money he needs. a decent premise is wasted on a film that pretends it has surprises, twists and turns, even though it really doesn't. performances are rotten across the board, the movie dresses itself up as a hard-boiled american noir but the mix of dodgy accents doesn't work, and the story is hardly gripping. and it contains possibly the least attractive screen kiss of all time.
