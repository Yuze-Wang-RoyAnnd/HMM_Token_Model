of all the movies in the history of movies i can't imagine someone sitting down and saying, i want to spend x amount of dollars (or pounds sterling) to remake that flawed classic film called "breeders." lots of stories have been turned into films about meteors coming to earth with something sinister lurking inside. why not put your money into making a spectacular 3d remake of "it came from outer space" instead? why look for a dingy nudie flick that existed only for the purpose of showing off a rubbery set of monsters and some naked coeds? was the script for the 1986 version of "breeders" so inspiring that these producers felt it had to be done again and this time done correctly? when you come down to it, the only reason this film exists is to show off britcom cutie pie samantha janus. but if you're gonna make a skin flick and exploit sam janus in it, you'd better have her more naked than this and naked more often than this if you want to succeed.<br /><br />meteor lands ... monster escapes ... coeds duff their clothes ... monster eats people ... and another "what if?" ending ensues.<br /><br />honestly, i never thought i would ever recommend the original "breeders" over any other film but this would be the one to come in 2nd place to it.
