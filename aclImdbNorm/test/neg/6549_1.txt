the only positive thing i can think of regarding this utter piece of garbage is that now i finally have a good answer ready if anyone ever asks me what the worst movie i ever saw was called.<br /><br />it would have taken such little effort to make it more watchable...a lot more effort and it could have been brilliant even. <br /><br />why would anyone want to produce such waste? <br /><br />i refuse to believe that a director could be so ridiculously untalented. <br /><br />making a completely intolerable movie must have been the point. <br /><br />anything else just doesn't make sense.
