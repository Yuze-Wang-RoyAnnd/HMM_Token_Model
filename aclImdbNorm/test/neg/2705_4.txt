i like errol flynn; i like biographies and i like action movies. this featured all three of these....but i didn't like this film. it just went on too long although the last 20 minutes was excellent, especially in the photography with some great low- angle shots. however, i seemed like it took six hour to get to that point, and i really can't say why i feel this way. <br /><br />the action is interesting, errol flynn and olivia de havilland are fine. in fact, it was refreshing to see de havilland actually be supportive of flynn instead of her normal role as antagonist to him. yet something is lacking in this movie.<br /><br />the film has been roundly criticized for its historical inaccuracy but i don't hear that same criticism for a lot of other films which have done the same. in fact, its rare when a film is historically accurate. for some reason, this revisionist history offended most critics. if the film had made general custer a lot worse than he really was, they would have probably liked it. well, too bad. in their twisted way, critics prefer villains to heroes. <br /><br />i really wish i could have enjoyed this more but i'll take a lot of other flynn adventures over this one.
