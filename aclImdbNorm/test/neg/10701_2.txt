this movie stunk. there is not much more to it. the final fight looked like walker taking on my grandmother, not some supernatural demon with the strength of ten men. i found the commercials more interesting. the plot twists and jokes could be seen coming a mile away. the only redeeming quality of this film was that it ended. avoid this at all costs...unless you enjoy bad chuck norris movies.
