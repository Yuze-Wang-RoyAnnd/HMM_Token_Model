actually i'm still in doubt if there's anything about this movie i like. as for the story: unrealistic and very exaggerated. the acting was too bad in my opinion. not very likely that antonie kamerling will get a rutger hauer status. some folks will expect it anyway. first let him work on his english pronunciation. if you watch the 'trip' to paris of these actors (dvd-extra) you will most likely want to trow up. advice to beau dorens: stop your acting career, you'll never get there... to the 2 main 'actors': grow up, please. being generous, i'd give it 4 out of 10.<br /><br />
