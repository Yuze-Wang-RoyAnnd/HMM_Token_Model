stranded in space (1972) mst3k version - a very not good tv movie pilot, for a never to be made series, in which an astronaut finds himself trapped on earth's evil twin. having a planet of identical size and mass orbiting in the same plane as the earth, but on the opposite side of the sun, is a well worn sf chestnut - the idea is over 2,000 years old, having been invented by the ancient greeks. in this version the counter world is run as an orwellian 'perfect' society. where, for totally inexplicable reasons, everyone speaks english and drives late model american cars. after escaping from his prisonlike hospital, the disruptive earthian is chased around not southern california by tv and bad movie stalwart cameron mitchell who, like his minions, wears double breasted suits and black polo neck jumpers - a stylishly evil combination which i fully intend to adopt if ever i become a totalitarian overlord. our hero escapes several times before ending up gazing at the alien world's three moons and wondering aloud if he will ever get home - thus setting up one of those man alone in a hostile world making a new friend each week but moving on at the end of every episode shows so beloved of the industry in the 70s and 80s ('the fugitive', 'the incredible hulk', 'the littlest hobo' etc.) the curiously weirdest bit though was the title sequence. somewhere between 'stranded in space' first airing (under the title 'the stranger') in 1972 and the mst3k version in 1991 it somehow acquired some footage from the 1983 movie 'prisoners of the lost universe'. so in 1991 the opening credits for 'stranded in space' run under a few shots of three people falling into a matter transmitter and vanishing. it's a sequence that has nothing to do - even thematically - with anything that is going to follow.<br /><br />just to add to the nerdy b movie confusion, one of the actors in this nailed on footage, kay lenz, later appeared in a 1994 movie called 'trapped in space'. knowing this fact could never save your life but it might score you very big points and admiring looks from fellow trash movie enthusiasts - if you could ever work out a way of manoeuvring the conversation round to the point where you could casually slip it in without looking like a total idiot...
