froggie is upset that he never has a big party like all the other kids. spanky and the gang seek to remedy that by giving him a surprise party. unaware that all the decorations and preparations are for him froggy sabotages everything only to find out too late that the party is for him.<br /><br />okay our gang comedy works in fits and starts. the bits work but i don't think it really works as a whole. part of the problem is that we all know where this is going and since much of the humor needs to have some form of surprise for it to work the whole thing falls down. i think in a weird way the film just sort of misses. its the type of thing that had they actually thought about it might have amounted to something more than a misfire. worth trying if you lower your expectations
