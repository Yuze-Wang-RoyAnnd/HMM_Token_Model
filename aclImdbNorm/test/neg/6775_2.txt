let me say this new he-man cartoon is not destroying childhood memories, as i didn't like the old he-man cartoon either. i loved the action figures, but i found the cartoon to be corny and i hated the storyline (the he-man i liked was the one from the very early, pre-cartoon mini-comics included in the figure boxes, where he-man was a barbarian, the sword of power was split in two pieces, and there was no prince adam, no shazam-ripoff premise, and no orko). anyway, let's leave the old stuff alone.<br /><br />the new he-man cartoon (or at least this pilot) is a disgrace on its own, s it represents both the worst cheesiness of the old show, and the worst tendences of nowadays. i watched it because i had heard the in-your-face morals of the old show were (thankfully) gone, and this one had more swordplay and character development. but i encountered an awful mishmash of the worst clich'es of the genre, characters i couldn't help but hate, and the sadly inevitable matrix-esque visual style.<br /><br />i think it was a good idea to give a bit of a background to the characters, as it was showing a pre-face-peeling skeletor, but that's how far the character development goes, aside from the usual coming-to-age rubbish i see coming in the subsequent episodes, where this teenybopper adam will be learning the responsibility of his new-acquired powers, blah blah. at least in the old show adam was not a spoiled brat! i found myself hating his guts. that's what we get when they put out an adventure show aimed at pre-teens: pretty faces and wanna-be-cool-and-look-juvenile clothes. i should check new episodes to see if n'sync make a special appearance. man, does this show remind me to the 1996 flash gordon stinkbomb cartoon!<br /><br />dialogue? ha! it follows absolutely every clich'e in the book, from the goody-lil-two-shoes randor in the opening scene to skeletor's immortal "oh, and he-man... i lied!" in the ending. and skeletor's voice is still the same high-pitch kind than in the old series. 20 years, and nothing we have learnt.<br /><br />and sure, nowadays there can't exist something remotely action-related that's not matrix-style. leave anime to the japanese, folks, think fresh ideas. and seeing the characters' poses while fighting didn't help either.<br /><br />of course, we have our usual dose of pcness: evil-lyn (now i think about it, who the hell comes up with these names?) has no yellow skin now, but grey-ish. oh, so no asian people will be offended. i bet jitsu won't appear in the show either. shades of the 1996 fg again, where ming the merciless was a green, toad-like alien!<br /><br />people are complaining about cringer's lack of speech. i don't think i would have liked this more or less if cringer spoke, he's corny enough this way. and you have your extra ration of cheese with orko! the shocking thing is, probably many of the people who (rightfully) hated jar jar binks, might be huge orko fans...<br /><br />i watched the feature-lenght pilot, and i've had enough. leave the series alone. 2 out of 10.
