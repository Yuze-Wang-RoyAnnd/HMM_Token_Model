i attended a screening of this film. travolta came to do a q & a after the film ended. it was a small screening room in tribeca. out of courtesy to him i did not walk out which i wanted to do. this is film-making at its worst. to start the script was poorly written. the writer writes in one voice. the dialogue was stilted and clich'ed. how this writer/director got scarlet johansen, john travolta and lions gate entertainment to back her on this is the only brilliant thing she accomplished in this fiasco.<br /><br />i do in fact recommend this film to all aspiring screenwriters, directors and filmmakers. because when you are told that you are wasting your time and it will be impossible for you to reach your goals. hey...just look at this crap and say to yourself...if they can make this then anythings poosible.<br /><br />ps- travolta did a great q&a though...he was at ease, spoke freely and was a down to earth nice guy. the director/writer stood on the sidelines. when john tried to engage her in the conversation she stood back like a piece of wood and never joined in. i looked at her and i thought...how was this person able to successfully "pitch" to agents, studio execs, top talent ...when she can't open her mouth at a screening of her own film. the conclusion from a few of us in attendance was that she must have strong family connections in the business.<br /><br />after you watch this you should follow it with guy ritchie's zero star masterpiece "swept away" with the most unintentionally funny and worst performance by wife madonna. she's so bad and looks so bad in this film i figure this was her his way of getting back at her for all the abuse he takes from her at home.
