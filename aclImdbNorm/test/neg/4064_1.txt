maybe this movie was actually intended to be satire like 'airplane' but it failed at that as miserably as it failed at being a 'thriller'. i don't understand why they couldn't have paid an actual pilot a couple hundred bucks for a little technical advice. hell, i would have done it for free! this magical aircraft managed to morph from a 757 to a 767 to a 747 in an hour and the power levers worked backward. and the dialog sounds like it came out the back end of a kid's game of 'telephone' where everyone spoke different languages. i actually rewound the tivo and watched some of it a second time to see if it was really as bad as i thought at first. it was.
