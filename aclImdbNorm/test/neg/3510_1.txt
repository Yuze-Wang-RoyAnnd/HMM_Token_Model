i get the impression that i was watching a different movie to the majority of other people i know who have seen this film. it's not really that i found the film offensive or anything - just that the script was unbelievably amateurish for a film that had obviously had a bit of money thrown at it. i really respected paul haggis' work on the million dollar baby script and was bitterly disappointed to see how bad this script was. it was clear to me that it was desperate to be the 'racism' version of traffic, but i don't think traffic was really a film worth ripping off in the first place. <br /><br />the worst feature of thisfilm is the way it shamelessly spoon-feeds its audience. does haggisreally think we are so dumb as to require a shot of the blanks? do wereally need to see the phone book sitting on farhad's dashboard, withthe address circled in black texta? can we not be left to make someleaps in logic for ourselves? <br /><br />i also had a major problem with the dialogue which was so 'on the nose'. i have heard one critic say that the quality of dialogue is deceptively high, because even though people may not speak this way, they certainly do think this way. that is irrelevant. it is the job of a script like this to utilise dialogue in a way that helps add to the characterisations and believability of the (in this case highly implausible) situations that are set up. these characters all speak using the same voice and all they ever talk about is racism. <br /><br />surely the purpose of a film like this should be to promote the fact that race should not really be an issue in these situations, but by making it the sole focus of every scene, doesn't it become innately racist itself? characters walk around spouting their philosophies and conveniently memorised statistics on race relations as though they're regurgitating extracts from the research essay they've just written. it's utterly unconvincing and obvious. <br /><br />a film should reveal its meaning gradually, not slap us in the face with it in the opening scenes and then never let up. i can see that haggis' intentions with this film were honorable, but dare i suggest that by directing his own script he has not been able to identify and, therefore, overcome its flaws. i really hope that writer/directors will be really careful in future when approaching this 'mosaic' style of narrative. it has been done well a number of times, but getting the balance between the personal and the political right is very difficult. and robert altman will not be outdone in that department.
