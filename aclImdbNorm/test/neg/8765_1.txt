this movie was terrible. the acting was awful. the script was awful. what was even worse were the camera shots and sound. half the time the voices did not match up with the actors lips, and different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different hues. the worst part had to be when one of the actors was at the top of a huge cross-shaped building. the building had to have been 50 stories high, and probably 100 feet wide. however, when the actor was on top of it in another shot, they had "recreated" the top of the building. the building's width had been reduced to about eight feet wide. how could a building hundreds of feet high be eight feet wide? i know the film was low budget, but it is inexcusable. the movie itself just pushed ideas about a "rapture" then actually having a storyline or point. this reduced the script to mere rubbish, the characters seemed to be selling ideas in their lines rather than conveying emotions and moving the movie along in a direction. it was a complete waste of time watching. the movie gives christians a bad name if it is one of the current best christian films out there.
