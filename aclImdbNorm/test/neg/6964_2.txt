bela lugosi as god? transvestites discussed in a movie in the straight-laced 1950s? by golly, this must be an ed wood film.<br /><br />watching this movie, i felt a combination of guilt, pleasure, and nausea all at the same time. the story is about glen (ed wood himself) and his cross-dressing alter-ego glenda. somehow, if this movie were made now, i could see kevin kline playing glen/glenda. notice how all the cross-dressers' alter egos are versions of their male name (glen/glenda, robert/roberta, etc.). it attempts to sympathetically portray it as the mental disorder that it is, rather than as a graphic perversion. <br /><br />somehow, wood manages to sneak in bondage and s&m sequences into his initial story of glen/glenda. along with these racy scenes, satan himself shows up, obviously having a bad hair day. the dialog and pace are nonexistent, but the film is enjoyable in its context -- the weird world of ed wood.<br /><br />sterno says put on your favorite lace panties for this one.
