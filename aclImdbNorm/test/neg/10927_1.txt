this conglomeration fails so miserably on every level that it is difficult to decide what to say. it doesn't merit one line, much less ten, but to adhere to the rules of imdb, here goes and i probably won't succeed the first time around and have to type some more to make up for this submission to be accepted. lol<br /><br />if i had seen this schlock during the '70s while i was going through my mushroom phase,i would have still considered it unimaginative and shallow. the most exciting shot for me was the long shot when the elevator door opened and closed.i was on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />one person on here wrote that he had met the creator of this mess, as if that were a red letter day in his life. one can only pray that something far more exciting occurs in that posters life.get a grip, amigo.
