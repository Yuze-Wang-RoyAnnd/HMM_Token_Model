i thought godzilla 2000 was the worst movie ever until i saw this monstrosity. my friends and i went to our local blockbuster and spent about an hour and a half looking for a movie. we could not find one since we have seen almost every movie created. we decided to look in the low budget horror section. we looked for the most attractive cover featuring scantily clad women. we finally decided on last slumber party, the. whoops, we made a mistake. it seems as though this movie was filmed with the cheapest camera that could be found in k-mart. the actors were picked up at a salvation army, and as for steven tyler. we will just leave that to the imagination. the plot of this movie was ridiculous. spoiler alert while watching the movie there is absolutely no closure at all. then come to find out all the events were just a dream. this movie should also have been about 30 minutes. if all the camera zooms on still shots, and scans of walls were taken out, it would have been much shorter. all i can say is i'm glad there wasnt a sequel.
