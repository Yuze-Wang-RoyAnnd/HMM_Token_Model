i watched this movie last night, and let me say, it's the absolute worst thing i have ever seen. the entire film is a train wreck, and it's not the actors. it is the horrible script.<br /><br />** spoilers ** alright, eddie loses his job to a monkey. his nerdy son is disappointed. the bathroom goes crazy.<br /><br />he gets a free vacation. he goes along with uncle nick and the original audry. their boats crashes. they stay on an island. they are stupid and don't even bother to look at the nearby hotel.<br /><br />ok, so that's that. what makes this movie pathetic is the humor. it is so horrid, hillybillyish, and stupid, you can't even laugh. and it's not stupid funny humor either. i couldn't laugh the entire thing.
