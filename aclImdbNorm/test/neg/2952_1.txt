the opening scene makes you feel like you're watching a high school play. but i've seen high school plays with better acting! every line was delivered so obviously that i felt like i was watching actors work instead of seeing characters. i found the character development to be poor and the acting very forced! i found that 25 minutes into the movie, i really didn't care what happened anymore because the plot was overly obvious and i was bored. i kept hanging in there, waiting for the film to redeem itself, but it never happened. sister theresa was overly sweet, even for a nun, yet appeared impulsive and slightly manipulative. all in all, i was mighty disappointed.
