natalie wood portrays courtney patterson, a polio disabled songwriter who attempts to avoid being victimized as a result of involvement in her first love affair, with her partner being attorney marcus simon, played tepidly by wood's real-life husband, robert wagner. the film is cut heavily, but the majority of the remaining scenes shows a very weak hand from the director who permits wagner to consistently somnambulate, laying waste to a solid and nuanced performance from wood, who also proffers a fine soprano. the script is somewhat trite but the persistent nature of wagner's dramatic shortcoming is unfortunately in place throughout, as he is given a free hand to impose his desultory stare at wood, which must be discouraging to an actress. the progression of their relationship is erratically presented and this, coupled with choppy editing, leads the viewer to be less than assured as to what is transpiring, motivation being almost completely ignored in the writing. although largely undistinguished, the cinematography shines during one brief scene when wood is placed in a patio and, following the sound of a closing door, remains at the center while the camera's eye steadily pulls away demonstrating her helplessness and frailty. more controlled direction would have allowed the performers, even the limp wagner, to scale their acting along the lines of an engaging relationship; as it was released, there is, for the most part, an immense lack of commitment.
