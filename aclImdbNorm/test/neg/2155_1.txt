there's no use trying to describe in detail the convoluted, overly melodramatic plot involving civil war bitterness, a crooked town boss, and other complications. it's all bad.<br /><br />stella stevens, andrew prine, bo svenson, william smith, tim thomerson and lee majors are all good actors that may not be big stars (or big stars anymore) but always made fun movies.<br /><br />here, they're all wasted on a picture that looks like it was shot in a wild west tourist trap, with costumes borrowed from the local high school theater department. in fact, most of the acting appears to be on the high school level too, which might not be so bad if it weren't so pretentious.<br /><br />the name of ed wood is invoked way too lightly these days. i think in this case the comparison is warranted. however, i suspect that old ed would have made a more entertaining western than this.
