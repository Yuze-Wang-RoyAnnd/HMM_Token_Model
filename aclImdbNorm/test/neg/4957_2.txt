jack brooks (trevor matthews) is a college student with some severe anger issues. his family was brutally murdered when he was a child by a monster, and now he takes out his anger on everything and everyone.<br /><br />so when his professor (robert englund) begins to show signs of monsterism, he learns he has to control his rage and use it for good instead of evil, and fight the creatures that have been haunting his nightmares ever since that fateful night.<br /><br />truly earns its b-rated rating, but what was cool about it was that it didn't focus on crappy b-rated cgi graphics. in fact, 0% of the film was cgi. the monsters were actually decently put together, and although the storyline was lacking, it was somewhat watchable...if for only one time.
