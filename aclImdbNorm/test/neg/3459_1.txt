i also made the mistake of thinking that i was going to see the 2003 swimming upstream with geoffry rush. this was worse then a lot of student films that i have seen. the script was forced, the acting was subpar and the editing annoying. it was so slow that i just managed to force myself into staying. but i always give a movie a chance, so i suffered until the very end. apparently there was a memo out about this movie, because my friend and i were the only ones in the theater. why didn't somebody send me this memo?!?! that is why i'm posting, as a warning to others thinking of shelling out good money to see this. i just hope that you actually got to this page, and didn't get trapped like i did by looking at the wrong "swimming upstream." p.s. sorry to the cast and crew if you are reading this. i know that you worked hard to make this. i know what goes into making a movie... keep trying!
