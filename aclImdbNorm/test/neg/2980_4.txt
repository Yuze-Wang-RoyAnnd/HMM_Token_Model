not finding the right words is everybody's problem in this vaudeville-type urban comedy. they don't know what to say, and they don't know how to say it, which is why they embark on the potentially humiliating enterprise of pre-arranged speed dating. unfortunately, they all come across as cardboard characters rather than real people. the story follows a conventional three-act structure: getting to know the sizable cast in their sorry single lives, the actual dating circuit, and a final stretch of romantic fallout, showcasing some of the new-found couples' follies. because it's all so predictable, i'd say that as a narrative, "shoppen" is a failure. as a comedy, most of the time it's too goofy to be really funny. thumbs up to kathrin von steinburg. she stands out from the soap opera crowd as the aloof, independently wealthy miriam. great makeup on her too (verena weissert): heavy eye shadow meets skin-tone lip gloss, creating a brooding and bohemian, yet girlish effect. thumbs up also to stefan zinner as the bavarian love machine and tanja schleiff as the hot nutritionist. they bypass the communication challenge by way of the timeless body language of copulation.
