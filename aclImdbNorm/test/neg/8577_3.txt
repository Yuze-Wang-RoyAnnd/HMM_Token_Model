this is a stereotype plot. a young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school. this leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight.<br /><br />the fights are not of high standards. they are way too "simple" in a way that 1+1 is simple to every adult. the fighter has trained and enters the ring, but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking. the coach yells do this and do that with no success. and after some more of this ridiculous beating he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once. this results in a turning point in the fight, although our hero has been taking a beating of his life up until that point. think about the rocky movies and you'll have a good point of reference of how much beating he really takes. the fights are also shot poorly.<br /><br />there final thing that screws this film up is the stupid romance. cheesy music and awkward moments are not what i call entertainment.<br /><br />these guys really could have made some quality entertainment, but the director wasn't up to the task. or the other crew in my opinion. maybe they had a small budget, i don't know, but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of 3 out of 10.
