what garbage, is there actually no part ii? if this movie actually ends the way it did, everyone involved with this movie should be ashamed. this movie is nothing close to a movie like outbreak, which was actually a fairly decent movie. this movie was rushed in hopes of being able to gain a few easy dollars. i started watching the movie under the assumption that it would be bad, but i never imagined it would be this bad. this movie was nothing more then a way to exploit the fears of the american people for profit! if you have not seen this movie, don't bother. movie is full of poorly developed characters and poor acting. i really hope the production of this movie was only a couple of weeks. stay away! don't be fooled by the hype!
