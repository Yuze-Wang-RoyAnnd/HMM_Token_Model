nothing could be more appealing than the idea of a good love story featuring kristin scott thomas and harrison ford. the cool, refined english beauty and the warm-blooded american male -- what could possibly be more lovely? well, this is not that movie. right away they ruin it by casting kristin scott thomas as an american congresswoman. that's like casting hugh grant as babe ruth. or colin firth as al capone. kristin scott thomas is exactly the sort of woman you don't picture shaking hands with greasy ex-junkies in filthy slums, or squeezing into smelly crowds and kissing babies. she would have been far better cast as the english born widow of an aristocratic senator, the kind who belongs to the hunt club and goes to flower shows but has no idea how the other half lives.<br /><br />then there's harrison ford as a regular guy cop. certainly he's tough enough for the role. but the idea that he's going to romance this stunning high society beauty is a bit hard to swallow. why couldn't he have been, say, a tough but wealthy reform politician with blue-collar roots who inherits kristin's late husband's senate seat? the two of them are initially quite cool to each other, but for duty's sake kristin is cordial to him, and he in return starts showing her some of the rawer side of life -- things her husband sheltered her from. her political awakening coincides with the jolting passion of a newer, more blue collar, lover -- one who appreciates her polish and refinement far more than her aristocratic husband. now that's a love story! instead of that, though, you get a blank, meaningless "thriller" where the action drags and nothing happens. well, there is one ghetto style "drive by" scene where harrison almost gets killed, but it's so abrupt and unexplained it's really more like welcome comic relief.<br /><br />the sky is always gray in this movie, and our refined, lovely kristin always looks a little chilled. when she's supposed to be dreaming of passion, she looks more like she's dreaming of a wool blanket and a cup of tea! she also looks a bit sleepy most of the time, like she'd really rather be napping in the bed than screwing harrison ford.<br /><br />all things considered, i'd say you can't blame her.
