anyone who thinks kool moe dee, carol alt, and corey feldman comprise a list of good actors must be smoking something i'd love to try sometime. where to begin: lousy soundtrack, hammy acting, "action" in places. this is the typical amateurishly written hack fodder that washed-up has-been and never-was's love to star in. i actually felt embarrassed for the "stars" in this "film". the only thespian missing to top this turd was gary coleman, who if he would have been in the movie, would have made it at least somewhat howlingly bad, rather than just plain bad.<br /><br />there was one part in the film where carol alt screamed, "do you think i'm an idiot?!?" yes, carol, i do, your agent does, and please for the love of all that is decent and holy... go away and stop degrading yourself like this! this film is something anna nicole smith would take part in.<br /><br />i would tell you what the plot was, but that would be one more sentence fragment to this article, plus my mind drifted many times during the movie anyway, so i barely paid attention.
