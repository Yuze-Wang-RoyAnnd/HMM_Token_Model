this movie did not give mr. bachchan justice. he is a great actor and i was very disappointed in the movie and there was not much plot to it. matter a fact this is the first movie i have ever been disappointed in with him in it. it starts out with her coming to his home with his daughter and he is a photographer. he takes pictures of her in the garden has she's hosing herself down. he is a sixty year old man that has nothing to do but to take pictures of this girl. the movie makes no sense. the whole movie is about her chasing him around and her telling him how much she cares about him. then his daughter falls and he has to take this girl around places so she is not bored and is daughter finds out. i just didn't think this movie was up to bachchan's standards. he is better than this movie. i always pictured him as an upstanding person and then i seen him in this movie and i couldn't picture him in this movie. the movie didn't hold my interest at all. i couldn't wait until the movie was over. and you won't either.
