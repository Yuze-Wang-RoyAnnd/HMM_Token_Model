produced by international playhouse pictures, it looks as if filmed in a doll house. everybody's a liar, everything is dream-like, toy-like for no good reason. i'm not saying everything in all movies should be totally realistic, but such unbelievable fantasy things and situations in one movie are way too much. how did they get these fine actors -actresses particularly- to this movie? it's nice to see mia again; if we were meant to understand why her husband wants to kill her, mia does do it well. not funny, not moving, just fake. stephen dorff briefly appears at the end, fitting for a play maybe, less for a movie, but this isn't one to measure things at. terrible.
