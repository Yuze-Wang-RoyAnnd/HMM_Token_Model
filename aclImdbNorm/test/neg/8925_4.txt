ho hum. just another flick with steven seagal pretending to be some spiritual being, but bashing heads and killing like it was nothing. he, of course, justifies it in the end by donating the money to an orphanage., how sweet. lay the world to waste and we'll ignore it if you take care of a little girl. jeesh! this time, he is partnered with ice cool (anthony 'treach' criss). gotta have someone to lay all those cringe-inducing lines on, man, and there are plenty. the dialog is pure crap.<br /><br />they go after bad guys nick mancuso and kevin tighe, two people that were born to play the scumbags.<br /><br />he's squeezing mari morrow and impressing soap star sarah buxton. how cute.<br /><br />i guess if you gotta have some july force excitement, this may suffice. if nothing else it will help you get your degree in seagalology.
