i do not generally appreciate light-weight attempts at creating humourous stories, which means that "anita no perd el tren" cannot score very high for me. the story is good: a middle-aged but still good-looking woman finds a new love. but the attempts at making this film as a romantic comedy only managed at times to be somewhat comical. <br /><br />rosa mar'ia sard`a has ably demonstrated that she can be a serious actress in such productions as "amic/amat" (qv), "todo sobre mi madre" (qv), "las amargas l'agrimas de petra von kant" (qv) and "el embrujo de shanghai" (qv). however the powers that be have over the years dished her out a lot of trivial stuff, for the cinema and for tv. something similar could be said of jos'e coronado: perfectly able to produce serious performances. mar'ia barranco belongs safely in this grouping.<br /><br />such that, in the end, i was left with the feeling that i would be real pleased to see a new making of this film, in a serious tone, which would allow the actors to really show their performing skills. and the curious thing is that it should be done with exactly the same leading actors. wasted talent on a rather silly film that could have been very promising indeed.
