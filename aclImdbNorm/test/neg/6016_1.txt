i wish that all the mockumentaries and horror spoofs would go away. if you are going to investigate loch ness..do it for real. enough of the bull****. same with horror and sci-fi..if you are going to make a movie and it is supposed to be scary..make it scary..not funny. i hate when watching a horror movie and the character is fighting for their life(or running or whatever..their life is at stake) and they are cracking jokes. this never happens..cmon where have all the good directors gone? i think horror and sci-fi have really gone down the tube since the 70's. i long for the days that a horror flick was scary..all this "scary movie" crap is for the birds. this film is also for the birds. if you really would like to see a good investigation or here serious talk...don't expect it in this video.
