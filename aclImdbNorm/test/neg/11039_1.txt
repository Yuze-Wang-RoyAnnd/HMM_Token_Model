... so some people might argue that this can't possible be the worst movie ever made, and no it's not. i have seen movies with weaker plots, worse acting and so on.<br /><br />so why do i hate this movie "uber alles? well, it's basically about a man, who gets kidnapped for many years, and when he comes out, he tries to find out who did it and why, to get revenge. the problem i have with this movie has nothing to do with gore or horror, but<br /><br />***major spoilers stop reading if you don't want to know*** <br /><br />our main character basically gets tricked into having sex with his own daughter, and he wants to cut out his own tongue so his enemy won't tell her, because she didn't know. it is so humiliating as he crawls on his knees like a dog in total submission. and why did he deserve this? because many years ago, he saw a brother and a sister have a tender moment - in the wrong way. he went on and told some people, and as a result she commits suicide. and viola, it's the brother who put our main character through all this just for that. i have wondered: maybe i hate this movie so much because i think his punishment is way too harsh. maybe because i feel this movie doesn't condemn incest, but somehow confuses it with love. maybe it's because i expected something else.<br /><br />***end of spoilers***<br /><br />believe me, nobody deserves what happens to our main character in the end, and i'm very serious; you know how some movies just go under your skin and stay there? well, i felt goddamn dirty after watching this movie, and i really wish i'd never seen it. it stayed with me for days, and some might ask: well, isn't that the purpose of a good movie? the ability to affect us in such ways? yes, it can be, but this movie not only made me sick, it made me feel violated.
