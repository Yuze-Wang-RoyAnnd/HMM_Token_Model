if you ever plan on renting (hopefully not buying) this movie, think again. it was as if gary busey had a gun to his head and was forced to act or die. i only wonder if busey was arrested for something and was sentenced to play in this movie because i just don't see the guy that acted so much better with keanu reeves in point break play in this disaster. it was a feel-good movie, but there are thousands of other feel-good movies that make you laugh without wanting you to get your money back.<br /><br />the only reason i would ever tell someone to rent this movie is to watch this movie is to see gary busey jump up and down like a monkey. if you want a good funny movie, pass up quigley and go rent spongebob or something.
