we've all got to start somewhere, it was in films like escape in the fog that somebody like budd boetticher could learn his trade before turning out good films. in fact the film was dated before it even hit the movie going public on june 25, 1945.<br /><br />the war on europe was over for almost two months, of course not even harry cohn could control the events of history. so i'm wondering why even back then the public didn't question why a nazi spy ring was helping out the japanese. another very bad historical inaccuracy was that the fbi had nothing to do with the pacific or asian theater. the cloak and dagger stuff was the territory of the oss in that part of the world.<br /><br />when you're an fbi man like william wright it sure good to have a psychic girl friend like nina foch. he's about to go on a mission to the orient to deliver the names of key underground leaders to start a general uprising in china against the japanese occupation. germans who've been bugging otto kruger's house learn of this and the whole movie is spent with these guys who've already lost the war trying to help their allies. who, by the way, they refer to as 'japs'. when foch is sideswiped by a speeding car and knocked unconscious she dreams about wright's danger and sees what is about to happen to him on the golden gate bridge. she goes there and foils the plot. <br /><br />all the stuff you'd expect from a nice noir film is there, the foggy atmosphere of san francisco, the dimly lit sets, budd boetticher tried his best as did the cast. but they just weren't convincing, probably because they didn't believe this claptrap themselves.<br /><br />it's possible, but not likely that nina foch's dream and its psychic consequences might have been more developed and the developments were left on the cutting room floor. i think it was just a lousy screenplay. <br /><br />and budd and harry cohn at columbia pictures had the fast moving events of history going against them here.
