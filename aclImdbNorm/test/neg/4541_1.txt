really for a short film that looks high budget this is just a candy coated piece of cr*p. it tries so hard to be hollywood. but even hollywood stories have an okay story (sometimes). money wasted on an effort to be hollywood. waste of almost a half hour of any viewers time. for the short film buff, look elsewhere...
