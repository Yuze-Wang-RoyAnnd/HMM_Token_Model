this film should have been much better than it was. christopher eccleston is an excellent actor but even he couldn't rescue this tale of a young woman searching for the truth over her sister's death. spoiler warning : in effect the truth is that the older sister ( played by diaz) is just a spoilt, selfish and shallow girl who took too many drugs. not much of a twist and not that interesting either. the film is also overladen with far too many flashbacks and voice overs and lacks dramatic pacing. all in all this is definitely worth missing - not to be recommended.
