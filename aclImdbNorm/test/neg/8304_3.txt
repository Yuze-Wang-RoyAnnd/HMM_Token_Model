wow. just wow. never before have i seen a horror movie in which it seemed like a bad self insert fanfic that somebody wrote one day in 20 minutes. and then i happened to come upon "lady frankenstein". this movie takes everything you know about frankenstein and turns it completely upside down... and not in a good way. if you've seen this movie you either stumbled across it on italian tv, or you have the dubbed version on the 50 chilling classics box set like i have, as number 24. and lets just say there's a reason why these movies are here. because they're not very good. enough of that though, onto the movie.<br /><br />it starts out with dr. frankenstein trying to make the monster with his assistant who's....obviously not igor for some reason. his college graduate daughter (?) shows up and states how she just graduated with a medical degree, cause yeah. there were so many female doctors back then. so she states how she wants to help her father with his work and he says no. and then he makes the monster and it kills him. so she grieves for exactly 7 seconds and then makes up a story with the assistant how it was a burglar. the monster escapes and goes on a rampage. <br /><br />ok, i really can't believe they killed dr. frankenstein so early in the movie. he dies like...20 minutes in. and then his daughter takes over. which.... doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but sure. <br /><br />so lady frankenstein decides the best way to kill the monster who's now rampaging....is to make another monster! oh yes how i love her logic. so her new monster she gets the body by killing someone and putting the brain of the assistant in it...i know. just nod and go along with it. so the monsters meet and duke it out. i love how the assistant asks "why don't we just let the mobs kill it?" and she answers with "they wouldn't know how to kill it!" and in the end he kills it with an axe to the head. haha. oh yeah, nobody else could have figured that one out. so in the end the brain switched new monster kills lady frankenstein. the end.<br /><br />this movie was just....weird. it was seriously like somebody wrote a self insert fanfic. there's no other way to describe this movie. there were some odd naked scenes too. like, this girl was having naked sex in the park with her boyfriend, the monster picks up the girl and the guy drives away. haha. nice guy. she then struggles a bit and dies from.....to be quite honest, i really don't know what she died from. but whatever. it's lady frankenstein. it doesn't have to make sense. <br /><br />this movie had a lot of those "why?" moments to the point that i just gave up. movies shouldn't do that, but for some reason i see that more than i probably should. <br /><br />so final word, it's not the worst movie i've seen on this pack, but it's a tad boring, and full of many many holes and random things. <br /><br />so lady frankenstein gets 3 frankenstein porn scenes, out of 10
