just a few words: it's a good thing george a romero is still among us cause if he were dead, he would be forced to rise from grave to vote against the people who made this 'political satire' and the saddest thing of all is that i actually agree with these people's sentiments. yeah there's zombies in it and they do have a good reason to come back from beyond the grave: to vote. oh, and one of them finishes off the doctor from startrek voyager. that's about as scary as it will get, people. if you are looking for a horror-movie i suggest you keep on looking. and if you are looking for a witty political satire you're also in the wrong place and not just because this series is called masters of horror. but don't let me hold you back: maybe you see something i've missed. though chances are you'll be wasting your time with it just as i have. let's just say i prefer my zombie-movies with the zombies standing in fr'ont of the camera.
