in a world full of films -- like "you got served" -- that blow your mind with its vast amounts of errors, you'd never figure that there would be worse films... until now. ron hall's "vampire assassins" does more than cheese you off. it knows that you are mad at it. first: there are no assassins in this movie. in fact, there's only one good guy fighting in the whole movie. second: the location... is basically one location: some jackass's house (or basement. it's up to you.). third: the special effects (bluntly stated) can kiss my ass. fourth: the acting beats "plan 9 from outer space" in the worst-acting-ever category. ron hall can't act to save his life. finally (and definitely not the smallest problem): the editing. the person who edited this film better hope that i never find him. the cuts and shots are horrendous!!!! other issues: lighting (virtually none), the fact that the guy on the cover isn't even in the movie, and the fact that this film exists.<br /><br />to sum this film up, let us just say that i tortured the dvd copy before taking it back to hollywood video (don't worry! i used the mvp membership, so it was free!). never see this film!!!!
