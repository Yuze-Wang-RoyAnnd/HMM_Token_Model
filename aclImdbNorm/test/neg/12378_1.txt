this is one awful movie!! some people told me that it was not that bad actually but i sure disagree! the monster is amazingly cheap (and funny) looking but this is something we all knew i guess. in addition to that, the dialogs are awful and the writing is just plain terrible.<br /><br />as bad as it is, this movie as the quality of being entertaining. not always for the good reasons but it's a good "so bad that it's fun" flick.<br /><br />by the way, there's no such thing as "la castagne". according to a secondary character in the film named pierre (described in the movie as a french canadian), there's a legend among french canadians about a giant bird know as "la castagne". as a french canadian myself, i can assure you that i never heard of such a legend. it sure made me laugh though... :))
