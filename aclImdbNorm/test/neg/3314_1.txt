it's nice that these three young directors have produced films with good productions values and decent acting. there's some good work here.<br /><br />unfortunately they suffer from what afflicts much of modern gay cinema; recycled plots, too familiar devices (i have seen the "pool" setting way too many times in gay male films) and hackneyed scripts. most egregious of all is "dorothy" whose preposterous premise is that a cute young guy will have trouble getting laid in nyc due to a shortage of identifiable availabe gay guys in his vicinity.<br /><br />in terms of cinema these shorts play like tacky little gay afterschool specials. not a lot of imagination in their writing or execution; basically they follow a point-and-shoot, shot/reaction shot/master shot convention which becomes painfully dull after five or so minutes. there's hope for queer cinema in the works of todd haynes, sadie benning and the late, great marlon riggs...but not here. these films are incredibly middlebrow, singularly whitebread and their values basically pander to a gay bourgeois sensibility. which is probably why they play so well at gay film festivals.
