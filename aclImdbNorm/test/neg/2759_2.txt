times i look back to high school and it amazes me that i never went lower than marvin did in this bad film.<br /><br />poor marv is the main character who's bad luck just gets worse and worse. despite his intelligence, he manages to get bullied, exploited, supports his lousy deadbeat dad, and plenty more goof-ups including a daring heist which let's say doesn't go fully to plan. of course, the viewer feels no empathy with anyone in this film, so all this disastrous gloom bounces off like harmless zeta rays. recommended for those days you're feeling down, pop this film in and you'll smile and say, "i'm so glad i'm not marv!"
