the emperor's new groove cast returns for disney pictures follow up, but this time the spotlight is on kronk(voiced by patrick warburton), who is no longer yzma's(eartha kitt)henchman. kronk has started a new life and is very happy with his role as chef of his own restaurant. things go merrily along until kronk gets word that his papi(john mahoney)is coming for a visit. kronk is worried, because he knows that his life won't impress his papi. one thing that he has always wanted and never received is a "thumbs up" from his dad. a flurry of blunders and a gigantic cheese explosion in the restaurant leaves our likable hero very deep in trouble and anxiety. to save the day, a little help from his friends.<br /><br />other voices: tracey ullman, david spade, john goodman, wendie malick, april winchell and gatlin green.
