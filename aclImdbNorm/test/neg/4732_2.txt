holy crap, the beginning picked up where the first one left off (good start). then it goes downhill from there. you it looked like as if you were watching tv and you keep on switching between this teenage soap opera, a predator movie, and some crappy detective show. the characters that are introduced in the first ten minutes don't have anything to do with each other until the final 45 minutes or so (the characters of the teenage soap opera and the actual alien story).<br /><br />then for the end the producers were quickly running out of money and decided to end the movie so they decided to drop a nuke on the city.<br /><br />p.s- what the crap is the deal with the cameras being so zoomed in you can't tell what's going on? seriously, movie makers, do a good job with fight scenes and make it to where we can see the fight.
