of the thousands of movies i've seen so far, this is the first one which made me think of the "wasted talents" expression. i had never ever seen so many fine actors giving so dreadful performances (fr'ed'eric pierrot, elsa zylberstein,and so on). the "aging" make-up is quite awful and, to make it worse, lit broadly. the use of music (e.g. love at first sight for the young aide de camp) is at times so caricatural that i could feel most spectators around me smile awkwardly. so far, antoine de caunes has been quite a good actor, but seeing this one and "les morsures de l'aube" i think he should start considering quitting. please antoine, give up that "master of balantree" project ; i doubt you deserve it.
