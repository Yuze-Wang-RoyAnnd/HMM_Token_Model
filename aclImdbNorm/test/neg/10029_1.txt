rented 3 bad movies to watch with my friends in my dorm room.<br /><br />leprechaun 4, jack frost and the prey.<br /><br />i picked up jack and lep 4 because they are well known bad movies i have never seen.<br /><br />i picked this movie out because it matched the "how to find a bad movie" guide on badmovies.org, no real description, no pics of the movie on the back, and i had never heard of it, had to be a winner :)<br /><br />(spoilers, but this movie is so awful it doesn't matter :p)<br /><br />this is a true bad movie, lep 4 and jack frost are dumb on purpose, this is dumb despite the best efforts of the cast and crew.<br /><br />this "movie" starts out much like evil dead, even the actors look similar and have the same style of dress. unlike evil dead it never gains any speed at all. for a "slasher" movie it is pretty bland, in 80 minutes 6 people get killed, but these are spread apart so far it becomes quickly boring.<br /><br />the director threw in a lot of boring shots on animals hunting, obviously to go along with the whole "prey" theme but they do nothing to advance the story and are quite boring. the gore is horrible. all these extra shots were to make up for lack of a script and story.<br /><br />the last 5 minutes of the movie are shot mostly in slow motion, yet another way to add length to this. the "climax" is such a total joke, its hard to laugh at it is so bad. the back of the box says "the ending will shock and haunt you." yes it will, it will shock you that someone could put such a bad "plot twist" on film and "haunt" you because you won't believe you paid to watch this crap.<br /><br />also the tagline is "its not human, and it's got an axe!" one person is killed with an axe in the whole movie and it is off screen.<br /><br />a true 1 out of 10. i love laughing at bad movies, but this one is so bad that it even lacks campy qualities. no bad movie night is compete without a true character building flick :p
