the title leads viewers to believe that this is a fun movie to watch and probably much better when watched under the influence, but it is not good at all. one 15 minute sequence with jack black beautifully playing one of his songs and tripping on acid while venturing through the woods does not save this movie at all. every actor in this movie has gone on to do better things, except for the main girls i could not think of one movie where i had seen them before. i hate to bash movies but i also hate not being able to find something decent in movies. the film is sad, not very funny and had such potential with its awesome cast. if it were redone and written over it could be awesome. if you want a good movie to see stoned, watch grandma's boy, or half baked or dazed and confused, but this is not a movie to be seen at all.
