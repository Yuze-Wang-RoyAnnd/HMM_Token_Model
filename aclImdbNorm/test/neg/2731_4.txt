for sci-fans this will be better than anything likely to be running on tv at any given time; that's about the best you can say of it. good points; repartee and sense of humour is less dull than usual in such movies, the plot is coherent and doesn't use any magical mystical revelations. bad points; the writers try to do good science but it falls down in direction and production (eg, a rock drilling mole using superheated rock drilling equipment breaks surface underwater with nary a bubble or boiling cauldron to be seen), the characters are clich'e's and the plot unfolding is pretty stock standard. ok for a too-tired-to-do-anything-else type evening; but don't expect any major edification or even talking points really.
