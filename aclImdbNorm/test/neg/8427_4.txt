i sat last night to see this film being played in greek television because of the upcoming olympic games hosted by my city.knowing that it is an american film, i had already expected it to focus more on the american athletes story.and i was really ready for it. but what i saw was..., too much!i mean, when a movie has such a title ("first olympics: athens 1896"), even being of american origin, you would not expect it to be so propagandizing and, on the same time, ignorant towards other countries' athletes and efforts.the american athletes seem to have all the gifts of nature (strength, smartness, generosity, kindness, politeness...), in contrast to their "sin-athletes" in the games, who seem being unable even to... speak their thoughts or express feelings.the number of times the american anthem is played during the film must be an all time record in filmography.megalomania at it's best!it even uses fictionalized facts which ridicules the greek nation, such as greek citizens serving the foreign marathon athletes with wine, in order to help the domestic ones win the race.so much for the olympic spirit.<br /><br />think of it.being a greek and putting a bad mark to a movie whose title is also greek is something that doesn't make me happy at all.but according to what i have seen, i cannot give it more than 4 out of 10 (being pretty generous actually).
