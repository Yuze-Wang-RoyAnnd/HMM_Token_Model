before last call w/ carson daly, my local nbc affiliate aired much more worthwhile programming after late night w/ conan such as second city tv, 3rd rock from the sun & carline in the city reruns, and some stand up comedy. these days there is nothing worthwhile to watch because all i get to see is carson daly and his awful show. he is not a comedian, he is not an actor, he does not deserve to be famous because he isn't a good speaker nor comedian.<br /><br />on his june 21st show, he tried to use an internet meme called the "rickroll" on his show. he failed hard. that event confirms that carson daly is awful.
