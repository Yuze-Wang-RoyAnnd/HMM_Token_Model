the story of farewell to the king is intriguing. an american "deserter" (i had the impression he and his 3 comrades were only trying to escape capture in the philippines as their desperate escape by raft to borneo is not your classic desertion). but no sooner do they come ashore when they are discovered by the japanese. nolte's character (a sergeant) has only moments earlier walked down the beach alone and was not noticed. and incredibly, no one noticed his footprints in the sand which would have led the japanese right to him. but anyway, nolte is taken in by a tribe of headhunters and becomes their king after defeating another tribesman. so he's out of the war. then the british commandos show up and want the tribe to assist them in fighting the japanese.<br /><br />unfortunately, nolte's incessant hamming ruins an interesting story. instead of acting like a former soldier thrust back into the war, now with a tribe of warriors under his command, nolte acts like he was raised by the tribe. he speaks as if english is almost a foreign language, rarely using contractions. he makes sweeping gestures when he talks, and acts like he is one with nature, as if he was raised in the jungle.<br /><br />there is plenty of action and many interesting scenes with the british interacting with nolte and the tribe. but nolte's character is never believable. it always looks like he's overacting. he needed to be a little more of an american soldier and a lot less of a tribesman. as it is, he comes across, not as a regal king, but as a lunatic who has forgotten who he really is. but that is not the intent of the film, as the script has him being admired and trusted by the british commandos. there is never any suggestion that the british thought his behavior was strange. he is simply viewed by the british as the defacto leader of the tribe. thus, it always seems that nolte's character isn't fitting in with what's supposed to be happening in the film.<br /><br />another actor might have done a great job with the role, delivered his lines believably, and made it an outstanding movie. but nolte ruins the film by hamming up every scene and appearing to not understand what his character is supposed to be.<br /><br />what a waste.
