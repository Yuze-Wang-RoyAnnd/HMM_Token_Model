some sort of accolades must be given to `hellraiser: bloodline'. it's actually out full-mooned full moon. it bears all the marks of, say, your `demonic toys' or `puppet master' series, without their dopey, uh, charm? full moon can get away with silly product because they know it's silly. these hellraiser things, man, do they ever take themselves seriously. this increasingly stupid franchise (though not nearly as stupid as i am for having watched it) once made up for its low budgets by being stylish. now it's just ish.
