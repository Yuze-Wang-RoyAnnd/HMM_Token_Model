a low-rent, cheaply made police thriller that's kept bearable by some fair humorous bits, the nice chemistry between the two leads and, especially, by james remar's satisfying turn as a narcissistic, psychopathic (and, naturally, indestructible) villain. obviously a low-quality picture, both visually and dramatically, with a rather resigned burt, but not unwatchable.
