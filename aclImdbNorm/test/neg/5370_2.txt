this show, paranormal state, has an almost "blairwitch project" feel to it. as in, you're watching a 'documentary' that's actually just a scripted movie, made to look and feel like a documentary.<br /><br />my biggest problem with the show, is their 'go to' outside advisers of the warren's, who were made famous for their 'investigations' of the amityville murders, which were shown to be completely fraudulent, just based upon the police reports of the family's deaths! (such as the eldest daughter actually having been involved in the entire thing, to the point of possibly even helping with some of the deaths!) then there's the way they constantly jump to blaming demons for everything. not to mention how haughty the group is about what cases they take. they don't want to help those who need it most, they just want the weirdest cases, that will get them the most press and attention.<br /><br />they're complete frauds, plain and simple.
