ugh. unfortunately this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time. none of the characters are remotely likable, which makes this film difficult to watch. they're all miserable thirty year olds who don't take responsibility for their crummy lives. i was only able to make it through a half hour of the film, so there's a chance things got better afterward, but i doubt it. i can't imagine five people as self-absorbed as they are would manage to remain friends with each other for ten years.<br /><br />three sex scenes in the first half hour were also disappointing, as they had no relevance to the plot, and were clearly a gratuitous (failed) attempt to bring some life to this otherwise dull film.<br /><br />save your time and money, and skip this movie.
