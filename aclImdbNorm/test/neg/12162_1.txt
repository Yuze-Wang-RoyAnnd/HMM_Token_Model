first of all, the nature in the movie is beautiful, and there is a bit of mongolian music. well, the horses looked mongolian and the camels, but that's about all what was mongolian in it. oh, borte is played by a mongolian actress, albeit a lame performance. but she is pretty, which redeems a bit the lack of performance on her part.<br /><br />but, i totally failed to understand what was the point of this painful-to- watch piece of 1.30 hour fantasy created by mr.bodrov. the plot totally lacked any sense of cohesion. there was no logic behind the development of the plot. in fact, there was hardly any story at all, just a number of loosely tied scenes with a bunch of guys in "mongolian" clothes, speaking some kinda pidgin that is supposed to sound like mongolian. most actors were either japanese, russian or chinese, most scenes were shot in china, kazakhstan or russia and there were a lot of disturbing pathos about what is it to be a "mongolian". the dialog is primitive and the scenes with dialog are slow. the battle scenes are laughable. all the supernatural pathos is lame and is obviously there only to make up for the lack of the story.<br /><br />the japanese actor was like a wooden doll, and looking at him one wouldn't get any idea how this person could become a leader who could unite the nomadic tribes. he looked sleepy, soft, stiff and pitiful for the most part of the movie.<br /><br />and i don't even want to start on the subject of the historical relevance of this piece of cinematic waste. to see chinggis-khan half of the movie as a slave, to see his two first kids be born from other men, to see his wife selling herself to the tangut merchant... my blood starts to boil. and where is the beautiful story about the friendship between temujin and jamukha? one could make a great movie out of it. where is the story of the rise of temujin? of his childhood, of his relationship with his family, with his brothers, of how he struggled to survive among mighty enemies of his family? where is van khan, who helped him a lot? where is the depiction of life in the steppe, of the life of the nomads, of their traditions, of their relations with the other nations around them?<br /><br />where is development of the characters? we totally fail to see what brought temujin together with jamukha and what brought them apart and most important, how temujin became chinggis-khan, how he, an outcast with no wealth and military power managed to unite the mongolian tribes and create such an organized and effective war machine that crushed one nation after another and created the largest land empire in history. all this could make several interesting and dramatic stories with complicated plots and deep characters, but unfortunately we didn't see any of it in bodrov's creation, not even a glimpse.
