my take: routine political thriller with mediocre action scenes and predictable twists. <br /><br />a rarely seen political thriller, which made a very poor box-office response, i managed to catch the shadow conspiracy on tv just now, and while i was glad that i satisfied my curiosity to see this rare film, i didn't exactly feel this film was all special. considering the box-office response to it, shadow conspiracy is not all quite as bad as critics and the public reacted to it, but still ain't very good to begin with and everything, from script to direction, is pretty predictable. charlie sheen plays the presidential assistant who finds himself caught up with assassins and chases (a lot of them) when he discovers a deadly conspiracy which lurks amongst the white house staff. after a professor is murdered, sheen aids the help of ex-flame reporter amanda givens (linda hamilton) to uncover the traitor and unlock the conspiracy of the title. <br /><br />but this script, written by adi hasak & ric gibbs, are pedestrian as they come, not much differing from other white house conspiracy thrillers as in absolute power and murder at 1600. some considerable talents (donald sutherland, ben gazzara and stephen lang) try their best on a routine script, but rarely saves it from predictability of the script. not to mention a ludicrous scene which involves a toy helicopter, which seems far too silly and out-of-place in this "serious" political thriller. the shadow conspiracy has its moments i'm sure, some of which are much to under-appreciated (director george pan cosmatos serves up some decent chase scenes), but none of which lifts this routine thriller of which there's not much payoff or surprises. <br /><br />rating: ** out of 5.
