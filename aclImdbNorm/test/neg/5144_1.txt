could possibly be the worst film ever made. at least plan 9 from outer space was funny. i can't believe they talked someone into actually putting up money to make this thing. complete waste of celluloid. before i saw this crap i had some respect for kristophersson. i guess somebody needed a tax write off. please, in the name of all that which does not suck, stop whoever made this, before they suck again!this movie should be avoided by all people who are not on lsd, or my crazy cousin that insists we're part native american.if you are in the woods, and an owl starts talking to you, see a psychiatrist. it is not necessary to make a movie about it.
