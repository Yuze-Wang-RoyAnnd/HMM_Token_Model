how in the world does a thing like this get into my dvd player at home? how does it even get to be packaged and distributed? are there absolutely zero screenings a movie (and i use that term loosely) have to go through before it's put on a video store's shelf anymore? i'm all for diy film making but come on! that doesn't entitle me to get a group of my friends and relatives together, a crappy camcorder, an awful story and put it all together to create a heaping pile of crap and call it a movie. and i wish people would quit using the words "indie" and "campy" to describe these types of movies. they're not either. in no other profession would something like this be considered acceptable. if someone tried to sell you car that was as bad as this movie, you'd take it back and say it was a lemon. if it was a surgical procedure, you'd be suing the doctor for malpractice. i wish i could get my time and money back after watching this. shame on the video stores who stock movies like these. they're a rip-off to the public. you want "campy"? go get any of the friday the 13th movies (even the later ones) or dead-alive. at least those don't make you want to kill yourself. it's because of movies like this that make people automatically equate independent with garbage.
