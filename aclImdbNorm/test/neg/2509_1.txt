i cannot believe i sat through this utter waste of time. i was just too fascinated by how unspeakably bad it was that i couldn't move. it reminded me of the feeling when you can't take your eyes away from a horrible car crash or the rotting carcass of a cow. you can't help but look, but you feel sick and nauseated afterward.<br /><br />let me elaborate: "plan 9 from outer space", for instance, is not a bad movie. not even "star wars: holiday special" is a bad movie. they both are awful to watch, for sure, but they both have some qualities and at least they leave you the strength to reach for the "off"-button.<br /><br />this "remake" (in name only) of the sci-fi classic left me weeping on my couch, desperately trying to come to terms with why such scripts get filmed, why anyone would soil the memory of the original classic, and whether or not i could resume my normal life without my suddenly acquired longing for the quiet and peace of death.<br /><br />although death, i realized, would offer no rest from the horrid memories of this pile of crap, as the poor souls in hell are probably forced to watch it over and over again for eternity...
