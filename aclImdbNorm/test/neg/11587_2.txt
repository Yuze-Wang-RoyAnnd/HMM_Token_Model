laughable would be a good term to describe this movie. but, since this movie deserves nothing good said of it, i'll use the term god-awful instead.<br /><br />centering around the adventures of a bunch of eco-warriors investigating the nefarious doings of the military on a semi-tropical island, the lack of a budget rapidly becomes apparent. michael pare (a real actor! but only in the sense that pinocchio was a real boy...) leads the bunch of fools through a series of monster chase-and-gobble-hapless-victim scenes. there is some vague attempt at pseudo-science to explain the presence of the giant reptiles, but it convinces the viewer about as well as the acting does.<br /><br />as if this doesn't insult the viewer enough, the movie also features what i'll call "guns of never-ending ammunition". i never saw mickey parrot or his female side-kick change clips once during the entire film, yet i can positively report they cap off at least 40 rounds each in any scene where they are required to fire their weapon. forty rounds may not seem like that many, but we are talking standard handguns here. i figure 15 round clip, tops. and remember, they never change clips, nor even appear to carry any extra ammo.<br /><br />it's dumb-assery like this which consigns movies to the eternal fires of celluloid hell, and rightly so. the third-rate cgi does little to help matters and the acting is best laughed at, else you'll start crying. why scifi channel repeatedly churns out this mush is anyone's guess.<br /><br />my advice....give this one a wide berth...a very wide berth!
