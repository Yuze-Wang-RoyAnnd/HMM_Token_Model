saimin <br /><br />(usa: the hypnotist /uk: hypnosis) <br /><br />aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />sound format: dolby stereo sr<br /><br />following a series of bizarre and apparently unrelated 'suicides', an experienced tokyo detective (ken utsui) enlists the help of a young psychoanalyst (goro inagaki) who believes the victims were acting on a post-hypnotic suggestion. but their subsequent investigations reveal an even darker force at work, linked to a young girl (miho kanno) whose life has been blighted by sadistic abuse...<br /><br />based on a novel by keisuke matsuoka, this densely-plotted mystery takes inspiration from a variety of sources (italian gialli, traditional japanese ghost stories, etc.), though some of the images in the climactic showdown reveal a more immediate influence: the recent commercial success of hideo nakata's ring (1998). for all its ambition, however, saimin is a routine potboiler which stumbles badly after a powerhouse opening (the 'suicides' are particularly impressive, despite some feeble cgi effects), though director masayuki ochiai - who co-wrote the script with yasushi fukuda - rallies proceedings for an extended finale in which the narrative's startling secrets are finally revealed. ochiai is best known for his film adaptation of novel-turned-video-game parasite eve (1997) - which also starred leading man inagaki (a member of japanese pop group smap) - and while saimin echoes that movie's strong visual sense, it falls short as drama, and most of the characters are mere ciphers, undermining the storyline's emotional pay-off. which is a shame, because the final half hour is galvanized by a series of dynamic set-pieces - most notably, a concert hall sequence in which dvorak's 'new world' symphony is transformed into an instrument of murder! - and ochiai is well-served by an excellent production team. however, those lured by the promise of gory carnage may be disappointed - the film is long on atmospherics and short on splatter.<br /><br />performances are varied, due to the script's limitations, but kanno (tomie) is outstanding as a young woman suffering from multiple personality disorder - which, the subtitles on the print under review assures us, isn't recognized as a viable medical condition in japan! - who falls prey to a sleazy tv hypnotist (takeshi masu), a prime suspect in the murders. inagaki is bland in a one-dimensional role, and he's constantly upstaged by utsui, a veteran performer whose career stretches back to the "s^up^a jaiantsu" series of the 1950's.<br /><br />(japanese dialogue)
