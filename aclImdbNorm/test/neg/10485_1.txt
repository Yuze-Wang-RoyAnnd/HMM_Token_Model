this cheap and rubbish film is about a nasa test rocket that is sent into space with a cargo of animals. it vanishes for a while then unexpectedly returns, crash landing in a forest, unleashing a vicious mutant creature.<br /><br />like many films of this type, night fright, features dumb teenagers boogieing on down to 60's surf music before being killed. none of the murders, however, are even remotely memorable, as we don't really see anything. one thing we do see, however, is that one of the teenagers appears to be about 40 years old and sports a quite impressively silly haircut.<br /><br />for a creature feature to work, it really has to present its monster to the viewer properly. in this film, however, we only get the briefest glimpses of the monster. it seems to sort of resemble the alien from robot monster. but i'm not sure; as the photography was so dark i simply couldn't make out what the hell was going on a lot of the time. although, my gut feeling was that i probably wasn't missing very much.
