plants in an ancient mayan pyramid structure killing all who come close. yes it is weird, as the travelers do not figure it out until everything starts doing crazy. and in a movie like this, i just wished it went absurd and had marching bands being attacked by plants wielding machetes.<br /><br />anyway, a group of people from america vacation and go into the mountains with a couple of other newly made german friends who know about the place. when they get there, mayans began shouting at them and hide on the structure. and when there, thats when the plants decide to take them out, mimicking cell phone noises, humans, and ancient mayan dead people.<br /><br />nothing was really scary about the movie and was not even entertaining. not even the weird ending could save this piece of crap. i kept looking for something really good to happen, but nothing. oh well.
