this movie had an interesting enough plot about clones and organ usage, but it fails as the lead actor is so annoying and whiny you want him dead. not that anyone else is very good in it either, but when you hate the character that is supposed to be garnering your sympathy the movie just fails to work. funny enough, it looks like a movie is coming out in the near future that has a plot that mirrors this one with more action and a better cast, still though i won't be able to think of anything else, but this film if i were to watch it. this movie has a super dumb clone that is somehow smart enough to figure something is wrong with his camp where people bicycle at one mile per hour and wrestle for no reason. the counselors tell them that when they are ready they go to america, but our "hero" has his doubts so he snoops around and learns the awful truth which sends him on the run from the bad guys who shoot and hit the guy repeatedly. he goes on the look out for the man he was cloned from. peter graves is in it and so is dick seargent, but they add nothing to this movie which looks like something that was made for television. on the plus side though when "the island" comes out the makers of this film can proudly say "we thought of it first".
