only a very small child could overlook the absurdities in this bomb; the first difficulty faced by the submarine "seaview" is what appear to be chunks of--rock? falling down through the water and crashing into its hull. but it's not rock, they're under the north pole--it is ice! everybody, except possibly hitherto mentioned small children (and even some of them) know that ice floats.<br /><br />then, disaster strikes--that darn van allen radiation belt around the earth catches fire! no one knows how this happened, we are told, which is understandable, because it is utterly impossible for radiation to "catch fire", and even if it could, there is no air in space for it to burn.<br /><br />there is literally no good reason to overlook science concepts basic to 2nd grade school textbooks when making a film; however, irwin allen manages to do it again and again; perhaps we are meant to focus on the "people" instead, which is pretty easy, as they are cardboard.<br /><br />the cast tries very hard not to look embarrassed in this ridiculous sub-kiddie romp, much like later episodes of his "lost in space" tv series, the concept of which was swiped outright from writer ib melchior and then rushed into production.<br /><br />the sub looks pretty good, though, which is why this one gets a "2".
