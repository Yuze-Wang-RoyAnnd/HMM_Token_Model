if i had never seen an episode of the original avengers, with blackman, rigg, or thorson, i would have appreciated this series more. while the cast did its best to sustain the action and interest of the scripts, i was just caught up in comparing the episodes to the original series. there was an expectation of steed participating more in fight scenes, and the continuity seemed as though the writers were struggling to keep up with the actors. to be honest, i can't blame them for trying to resurrect the fans from the original series, but it just didn't work, as evidenced by the fact that it lasted one season. watching steed labor through this series reminded me of gen. macarthur when he said, 'old soldiers never die, they just fade away!'
