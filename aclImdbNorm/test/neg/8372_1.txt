this really is by far the worst movie i've ever seen in my whole life (i'm approaching 47)! the description on the back of the cover equaled the scrolling text right at the begin of the movie. the further plot was nil and even a bunch of corpses would have shown more life in their "acting". i viewed the full length of it and was really relieved when the final character's death signalled the end of my suffering! the location was either some kind of vaults or a grimy beach. i suppose, that home-video equipment served as camera and the lighting was sub-standard. the dialogues were uninspired and devoid of meaning. as were the actors faces. which brings me to the topic "make-up": by the looks of it they got it as gimmicks in some teen-ager's magazines "my first own make-up" or similar. what made me buy the dvd was the name "lovecraft" printed on the cover. the only connection with this brilliant mind's works was the use of the name "necronomicon", which was wrongly translated as "book of light". the 4,70 euro i paid for this dvd were a complete loss, for the dvd went into the recycling box without any further ado.
