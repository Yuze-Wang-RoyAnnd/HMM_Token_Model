any one who writes that this is any good there kid may have worked on it or put money in to this god-awful college experiment. it was lousy, slow, and painful to watch. running time of only about 84 minutes, it felt like three and half hours. the only person to blame is the director, who knows nothing on how to direct a scene, where to place the camera! 95% of this dreadful movie was shoot by long master shots. two or three people in the frame talking or yelling forever( or what seems like forever), no close-ups!! no medium shots!!. there are two so-called fight scenes that any filmmaker with a brain would have shoot some close-ups or medium shoots for them. they looked very amateurish. the scenes with the father and son screaming at each other would have worked better if there was a cut away of just the father or just the son acting,or reacting. tri-c must be very mortified to show this any where. i have seen a bunch of bad movies in my time some of them are fun because they so bad, this is not one of them.
