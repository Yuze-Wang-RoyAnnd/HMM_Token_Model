i watched this movie with no idea what it was about beforehand. i was intrigued for the first whole hour. it was shaping up to be a great thriller. a very talented cast and good dialogue.then it all fell apart for me at the sight of the first vampire. i couldn't believe my eyes.a great thriller was flushed down the toilet. the rest of the movie from that point was totally awful.<br /><br />i gave it 4 stars for the brilliant beginning alone. i think that's a little generous, but i was entertained for a while. i'm not a fan of vampire or zombie movies at all.if you are, then you may disagree with my opinion.
