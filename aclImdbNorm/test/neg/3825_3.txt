this film was the one of the first, of the 70s women-in-prison film genre. this movie was incredibly violent, with lots of sadistic torture being inflicted on the inmates. the film takes place in the phillipines, which looks like a horribly ugly country. no doubt, the producers used this factor to their advantage, to emphasize the gruesome situation that the prisoners were in.<br /><br />blaxploitation movie queen pam grier, has the starring role in this movie. she plays blossom, a renegade who gets thrown in the vile women's prison, on trumped-up charges. her boyfriend, played by sid haig, tries to rescue blossom. he and blossom are part of a political guerrilla faction, and blossom's incarceration was orchestrated by the corrupt, phillipino government.<br /><br />pam grier and sid haig, stand-out amongst the otherwise lackluster cast. the film itself, put way too much emphasis on violence perpetrated against the prisoners. their captors just used them solely as objects of their sadism. this got boring real fast. this movie could've used more interesting plot-lines, and subtlety. this is not one of roger corman's better pictures. the many women-in-prison films that followed this one, were much better all around. i'd recommend the big bird cage, only to pam grier fans.
