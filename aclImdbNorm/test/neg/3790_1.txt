i think i've finally seen the worst movie ever made, and it hurts me to say that. as a big fan of indie cinema, gay or otherwise, i had high hopes. several minutes into the film, however, the sheriff appeared and has my vote for the worst actor of this or any other century. his performance, and the dialog he was forced to perform, caused me the unusual step of stopping the dvd in its track. hours later when i screwed up enough courage to press the play button again, it was no better.<br /><br />aside from the sheriff and his cartoon-racist deputies, the film has an attractive cast for whom i felt genuine sympathy since they had such a miserable script. the idea behind the film is fine - using lynching of gay men in the "new south" the same way it was used on black men in the old south, leaving "strange fruit" hanging from the trees.<br /><br />with an accomplished writer and director, we might have had a movie. instead we get fake detective work, platitudes about homosexuality, and a clich'e with a the one good white man trying to save the day.<br /><br />i have no doubt that racism still flourishes. the fbi is currently investigating a white school bus driver in the back woods of louisana who forced the black kids to get to the back of the bus. but this town is a cartoon, and it is hard to believe anything you see or hear.<br /><br />there a few subplots in a weak attempt to try to make the main character more three-dimensional, but for the most part, they also fail miserably.<br /><br />for the truly masochistic, the dvd contains some deleted scenes that will leave you running for cover.<br /><br />the is probably the first movie that makes me believe that writer/directors should have to pass a test and get licensed before they can make a film. although i would look forward to seeing several of the cast members in better films, i would be hard-pressed to witness anything else from this director.
