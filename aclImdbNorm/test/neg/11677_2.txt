it would be quite easy to make this movie sound fun: a call girl gets shot in the forehead by a north korean spy, but survives. the bullet that is embedded in her brain makes her long for knowledge, as well as sex. unbeknownst to her, she walks away from the shooting with the cloned finger of george w. bush in her purse, a key which can unlock the power to use nuclear armaments. just call it a romp, and at least a few people will show up to the theater. i'm not sure how many did go to see this four year old film when it opened in new york this past april, but i sincerely hope not many. it sounds like a light and playful pinku flick, but it has art-house pretensions and is really just incredibly boring. many pinku films in the past have been successful in their artistic aspirations, but this film's aspirations just make the time that elapses between the sex scenes excruciating. and then the sex scenes aren't even good! i've seen some pretty outrageous stuff in dirty japanese movies. i've never seen this country produce something with sex this dull. the spice channel is more imaginative. the only worthwhile thing in this movie is the body of the lead actress, emi kuroda. otherwise, this is pure torture.
