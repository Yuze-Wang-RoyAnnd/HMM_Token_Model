before i sat down and watched this film on hbo, i wasn't expecting nothing but a few laughs here and there and all together a stupid and common plot. well, that's exactly what i got out of it, except that i was somewhat satisfied at the end of the movie. i wasn't expecting it to be, i thought it was just going to be another hour and a half that i had on my hands to waste. well, it was, but still it was somewhat worth it. the whole plot was very stupid, cheap acting, and some of the lines were very very dumb. otherwise than that, it still had it's funny moments, even though not many.<br /><br />all in all, if you're going to rent this, don't. watch it on television. i gave it a 4, i was generous because it made me laugh, but yet it was still pretty stupid.
