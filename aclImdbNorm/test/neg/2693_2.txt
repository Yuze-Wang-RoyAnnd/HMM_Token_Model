i am a shakespeare lover since childhood. i am also a jew. merchant of venice is anti-semitic through and through no matter how hard scholars and literature lovers try to re-interpret it.<br /><br />in the play, shylock is portrayed as demonic and cold-hearted and has no forgiveness, no warmth, no love except for money and cruel revenge, whereas the christians are kind, moral people. his motives in the play revolve around money (he plots revenge from the start based on damage caused to his business as well as blind racial hate), not noble ideals or hurt racial pride as this movie wants you to believe. and this characterization is given to him by shakespeare himself, not by the other characters. as final proof, the happy ending is where the jew loses his money and is forced to convert to christianity.<br /><br />i acknowledge this and move on. it is part of history and i enjoy shakepeare despite this fact. therefore i expect a movie based on this play to play it straight. i would much rather see the work adapted for its rich language and storytelling without any whitewashing.<br /><br />but many of the the bard's artful subtleties and playful characters are lost in this movie. for example, in the last scene where the men discover portia's undercover work as a man who also took away their rings, instead of the playful game of words and misunderstandings as the truth reveals itself, it becomes a mean-spirited game where two bitchy women play cruelly with their soon-to-be husbands.<br /><br />so instead, we are only left with lovely detailed sets, fragments of the rich language with poor reinterpretation, poor casting, one intense courtroom scene, and a controversy.<br /><br />the truth is, i think it would be much easier to identify the anti-semitism in the story and move on if it were left as is. despite all the whitewashing the makers of this movie pulled out of their hats, there is plenty of hatred left, only now people can make excuses and pretend the portrayal of jews isn't so bad anymore.<br /><br />and finally, another problem is with most of the actors being miscast. pacino is way out of his league and is very uncomfortable with the language, not to mention the horribly fake accent. fiennes as bassanio is charmless and awkward with the language. irons is dependable as always but doesn't do much with his role. portia is somewhat ok but unlikeable, and covered in bad makeup, just like the movie.
