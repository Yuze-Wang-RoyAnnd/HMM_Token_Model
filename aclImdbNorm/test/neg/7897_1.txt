this could quite possibly be the worst movie ever made, up there in a league with movies like "howard the duck," "plan 9 from outer space," and "ishtar." i don't understand why i decided to see this movie, as it was a waste of my life. i also do not understand why one would like this movie, regardless of their sense of humor. the acting is among the worst i've ever seen, as is the writing. the characters are all stupid, and there is not one funny scene in the entire movie. tom arnold is quite possibly the worst actor ever-- this movie proves it. there is nothing worthy about this movie. don't rent it, don't watch it, don't even say that it looks interesting. it's bad enough i saw it.
