just finished watching this movie. i couldn't imagine watching this on vhs, as there were scenes where i needed the subtitles to hear through an accent or sound effect, even though the scene itself was in english.<br /><br />visually, the movie is pretty appealing. the few cg effects were very obvious insertions, but the prosthetics/creature effects weren't bad. not perfect, but photography and editing (which were pretty good) made up for a lot. acting was generally bad, though how much of that can be blamed on the director i couldn't say, having never seen any of the actors before. the exception, i think, was m. gomez (uxia). she stole every scene she had a part in, and not just because of a very pretty face, but there was something akin to an urgency to her performance that none of the others had. the writing could have been a lot better - the plot was still unmistakably lovecraft, and plenty of lovecraft details were written in, but i personally could have done without most of the dialogue.
