this film is a great disappointment. director vicente aranda has provided many interesting films throughout his long career, some of them were highlighted by strong and powerful performances by spanish actress victoria abril. in juana la loca, he relies on a gifted actress as well , newcomer pilar lopez de ayala, but this is barely the sole positive element in an otherwise terrible mess of a movie. while lopez de ayala tries hard to portray juana as a romantic and passionate young woman, completely obsessed by love to her handsome husband, it seems as if she weren't able to develop her character over this one-dimensional feature; juana was an important figure in spanish history, and politics of that time were essential in her storyline... but here she's introduced as a romantic leading lady out of a soap opera; this is a real pity, and the film a missing opportunity to show the way personal lives can influence history and vice versa. worst of all, italian actors daniele liotti and manuela arcuri turn out in real bad performances, which, in the case of liotti is a real problem as he portrays felipe el hermoso, a pivotal role in this story. it seems a clear choice to attract young audiences, as both of them look like top-models of this era. on the other hand, talented actors such as giuliano gemma and rosana pastor are completely wasted in supporting roles clearly underdeveloped. even if this was a big-budgeted film, little care was taken in bringing a good screenplay or creating "period pieces" on the screen. costumes are particularly grotesque in some of the group scenes, as if they were taken from stock material,without regarding of a real coherence. all in all, the main problem with juana la loca (and this is what makes the difference with far superior historical films as la reine margot or elizabeth) is the lack of a director's point of view. this a strange turn in aranda's career, as he was able to develop it in other works (libertarias and amantes come to my mind), creating very personal and interesting movies, while this juana really is no more than a routine academic historical piece... and a not very good one at that!
