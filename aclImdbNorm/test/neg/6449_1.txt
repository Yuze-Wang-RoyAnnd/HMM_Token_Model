this gawd-awful piece of tripe is all over the place. the script is bad, the plot is bad, the acting is bad. there are a couple of decent actors in it (charles durning, eg.), but the director got nothing out of them. the plot line has santa, feeling dejected and thinking no one needs him any more, taking a little girl across country to try to get her father back together with her mother. it includes a con-man in a santa suit with a stuffed parrot on his shoulder (played by "isaac" from the love boat), the world's largest elf (played by bruce vilnach - a very funny man, but no actor), a hardened factory owner who works his employees overtime on christmas eve, and a sleigh race where someone cuts one of santa's skis trying to win. if the plot sounds bad, it's worse on the little screen. if you see this movie coming up next, run, do not walk, to your television and unplug it. you may want to boil your television to remove any remaining infection. if you accidentally watch more than 10 minutes of this, you may have to burn your television, and have the cable company install entirely new lines.
