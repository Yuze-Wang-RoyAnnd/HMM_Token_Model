i should have gone without seeing the movie after reading the review here. i saw the whole movie by fast forwarding and ended in 25 minutes. though its a low budget movie it could have been made better. <br /><br />the movie starts more like a thriller and in few minutes it tells you that you should switch off immediately. and why was the movie named "crash landing" when it was landed so well in such a bad climate. <br /><br />without any acting, all the characters where just moving or doing like kids.<br /><br />and should not forget to comment on the joker - the main hijacker who would have been more suitable if this movie was a full time comedy.
