i had been wanting to see an american werewolf in paris for a long time because i loved its predecessor, but this film didn't impress me as much as an american werewolf in london. actually, to be quite honest, it didn't impress me at all.<br /><br />tom everett-scott and his dude pals are wandering paris and, in a preposterous bungee stunt off the eifel tower, rescuing wolf-babe julie delpy from death. before you've time to work out if the constant mugging and lumpy dialogue is meant to be the stuff of comedy, a full-moon has hit and the brats are being chased by dreadful cgi werewolves down parisian sewers.<br /><br />the script is disgustingly poor, the actors were made to make this film, they're horrible performances match the status of the movie. from start to end, this movie is never entertaining, engaging or even slightly watchable. i had trouble watching this whole film without throwing up my dinner, to be quite honest.<br /><br />the action scenes aren't exciting, the jokes aren't funny and the werewolves aren't scary. in short: miss out or be haunted forever.<br /><br />i rate an american werewolf in paris 2 out of 10.
