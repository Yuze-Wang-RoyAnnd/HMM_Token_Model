every once in a while, an indie comes along that has an awesome cast and a story that sounds really interesting and can't-miss, but the movie sucks. some recent films belonging to this unfortunate category are "levity" and "the safety of objects", and now here's "the united states of leland".<br /><br />said awesome cast includes ryan gosling, kevin spacey, don cheadle, jena malone, lena olin, michelle williams, chris klein, and kerry washington. gosling plays leland p. fitzgerald, the teenage son of a famous author (spacey) who commits a disturbing and unforgivable crime (murdering a retarded child), but doesn't remember it and doesn't seem to have any sort of motive. <br /><br />don cheadle plays a teacher in juvenile hall who is trying to understand leland (and also exploit him by writing a book about him), and jena malone is his ex-girlfriend. we see their deteriorating relationship (due to her heroin addiction) in flashback. sounds like an awesome little drama, huh? i thought so, too. <br /><br />the fact is that this movie is just badly, badly written. the dialogue and narration are painfully pretentious and laden with irritating platitudes about "life", the characters are all two-dimensional indie cliches, and while it does manage to make leland sympathetic in some ways, it glosses over his crime. <br /><br />for the most part, there's no problem with the acting. gosling (who was oscar-worthy in "the believer") is a tremendously talented young actor, but the way they're written, none of these characters (least of all leland) even feel like real people, so there's not much he can do but mumble his ridiculous lines and look sad. <br /><br />jena malone is the most memorable. she has one of the most expressive faces i've ever seen. even playing an underwritten character in a bad movie like this, she can break your heart with one look. when she's got good material to work with (as in "donnie darko" or "the dangerous lives of altar boys"), she's really amazing. <br /><br />but this is not good material. maybe after a massive rewrite it could have been something worthwhile, but as it is, "the united states of leland" is ponderous, inert, and for a movie that seems in love with how "deep" it is, it's really shallow.
