this show lasted for most of the 1980s, and had its moments, but plots were usually dishwater thin and often painfully unfunny.<br /><br />terry scott and june whitfield were wasted in this sitcom, they both deserved better, but it does provide some fond memories and i have found myself smiling at some repeated scenes. june whitfield's talent for comedy is allowed to shine through on occasion (when she is not being a foil to terry) and she really is clever.<br /><br />the 1980s is the last decade where you will find this kind of middle class, middle aged comedy, and many people remember it fondly, but i prefer to remember the decade for alternative comedy and the biting satire of spitting image.
