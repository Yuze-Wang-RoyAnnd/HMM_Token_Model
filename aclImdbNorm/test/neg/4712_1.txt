an annoying and talentless american documentary maker learns of a legendary<br /><br />south african monster, the half-caste. tradition says that it is a half-human, half-leopard creature with the closest parallel being that of the werewolf of european tradition. rather than focus on the creature, the film follows the meanderings of the film crew. there is little action or suspense until late in the film. this problem is exacerbated by numerous irritating characters generating a ceaseless amount of even more irritating talk. the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew. <br /><br />perhaps the director was influenced by the approach of the blair witch project (1999) or the last broadcast (1998). regardless, the film fails on most levels. avoid at all costs.
