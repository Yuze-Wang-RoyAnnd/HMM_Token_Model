as i sit and think about poison for the fairies, i realize that i may not being fair with the film. my rating of 3/10 may have more to do with my disappointment with the film than its actual quality or entertainment value. based on the plot description, reviews on imdb, and the 7.6 imdb rating, i would sure that i had stumbled on a little known gem. sadly, it just didn't do much for me. for whatever reason, poison for the fairies all but put me to sleep.<br /><br />poison for the fairies is the story of two young girls in 1965 mexico city. one of the girls, veronica, is a compulsive liar and tells her friend that she, veronica, is a witch. the other girl, flavia, is so gullible that she believes and is frightened by everything her friend tells her. that's really about it. in reality, nothing much happens and the film drags on and on as veronica attempts to terrorize and dominate flavia. one commenter on imdb described it as "the scariest film in 80's mexican cinema". my comment
