i was expecting a lot more of this film than what i actually got. the acting was just awful from everyone and the story was far from impressive. it took a lot of something i don't to even follow what was going because it was so jumpy. an example of the acting is when paxton's character, vann, is upset the south vietnamese colonel for so he throws some of the sand from the "sand map". it was impossible to get any idea of what he was feeling and his actions were robotic. to make things worse, i have no idea how i'm supposed to feel about vann. he's obviously presented as the protagonist but as soon as he gets to vietnam he starts an affair with an vietnamese english teacher. the only thing the movie had going for it was that it wasn't particularly boring. i give it 4 stars out of 10.
