rating: *1/2 out of ****<br /><br />"the net" is one of those films that won't remain in your mind till the next one hour. well... just if you keep thinking how bad it is. it's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage. one of those adjectives i've just used above is the reason which made me add 1/2 a star to the one i would have given. so is it a case of 'so bad it is good'? no. it's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'. <br /><br />bullock in a (surprise!) very bad performance plays angela bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time. she works at home, doesn't have any friends and her neighbors don't know her. suddenly, she sees herself involved in dangerous situations, after her colleague dies and the same thing almost happens to her. her identity, bank accounts, etc, etc, etc, are all deleted, and she is now ruth marx. the conspiracy involves even the government and... wait! haven't we seen this before? yes, thousands of times. "the net" tries to be modern, to be the portrait of the '90s, showing the computer as a villain. big deal! it is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes. take the scene of the boat accident. i just laughed when the camera started to get slow...<br /><br />what makes everything even worse here is sandra bullock. how awful she is! has she already made a decent film? "a time to kill", okay. but she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.<br /><br />the vantages and disadvantages of the computer were already shown in "2001: a space odyssey", the best, most intelligent and most complex film ever made. it's not needed to compare "the net" with it, is it...?<br /><br />the only reason to see "the net" is to laugh, as i've said, and to see what it tried to be. the results, well, are a shame.<br /><br />delete this film from your mind!
