the problem with making a movie like this, though, is that the finale, the cr`eme-de-la-creme of the movie, the battle between the two souped-up ships, must be done well. disappointingly, this scene in ironclads is obviously done completely with little model ships in an overgrown tub. there's no tension, little explanation of what exactly is going on and what the timeframe is of the stand-off.<br /><br />the film takes quite a few liberties with the surrounding story, as all true stories do when converted to a movie, such as the union traitor and most notably that of betty stuart (madsen), a virginia belle.<br /><br />it resorts to making a possibly-decent movie involving an interesting story on the ironclads to preaching about the evils of slavery. it was out of place in this historical drama, and was a cheap ploy to bring in the women viewers. it only succeeded in lessening the positives about the film.
