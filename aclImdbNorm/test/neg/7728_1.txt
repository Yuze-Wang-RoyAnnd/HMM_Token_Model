i haven't had a chance to view the previous film, but from what i've read on other posts it was supposedly worse than this one, although i doubt that is possible. i'm a huge fan of the "zombie" genre, and i am fascinated by the psychological aspects of viewing creatures, that for all intents and purposes are human, as an atrocity that is only worth shooting in the head. that said, hotd 2 takes the "zombie" movie to an all new low.<br /><br />without giving any big spoilers (which i really should do just so you won't bother wasting your time actually watching this movie) i would like to express my utter contempt for the way the writers of this film portray our countries special forces. gomer pile could have probably survived longer than the "spec ops" soldiers in this film. for crying out loud they should have called them the special education forces instead. if you are going to write a script where you send in an elite team to deal with an outbreak of zombies, at least have the soldiers be smarter than the walking corpses. i understand that you have to kill off some or most of the team, but you can find better ways to do it than having them set down their machine guns and walk over to lay a tender hand on the shoulder of the drooling crazy person rocking back and forth in the corner of the dark creepy basement.<br /><br />the writers actually try to take the whole zombie thing to a more high-tech level by making it a virus that they are searching for a vaccine for, and the idea has merit, if it wasn't stuck in the middle of such a ridiculous display of wayward film making. i mean come on, zombie films aren't exactly "high art", and the viewer expects some tongue-in-cheek cheesiness along with the gore and thrills, but hotd 2 is the type of cheese that makes you turn the channel in disgust and awe of the sheer stupidity of the characters. if you are a zombie movie fan like me, please do yourself a favor and stay away from this one.
