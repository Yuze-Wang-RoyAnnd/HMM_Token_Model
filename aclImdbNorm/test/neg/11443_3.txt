i watched this movie recently mainly because i am a huge fan of jodie foster's. i saw this movie was made right between her 2 oscar award winning performances, so my expectations were fairly high. unfortunately, i thought the movie was terrible and i'm still left wondering how she was ever persuaded to make this movie. the script is really weak. the story itself may have been somewhat believable if someone like mel gibson had played the role of the hit-man. the idea of jodie running off with dennis hopper and his irritating accent was impossible for me to buy into. i did think that jodie looked great throughout the movie, which was probably the only reason i watched the entire thing. maybe parading jodie around with as few clothes on as possible was the only reason the movie was made. i saw a tv biography of jodie where basically all of her movies were commented on in chronological order, and this movie was the only one never mentioned. after seeing it, i can now see why.
