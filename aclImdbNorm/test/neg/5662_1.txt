icarly is about a teenage girl named carly shay (miranda cosgrove) who lives with her artist brother, spencer in a loft in seattle. carly has a web show that gets millions of views and makes tons of money a year, so much money she "doesn't even know its a real number". her best friend is sam (janette mccrudy) who's as predictable as they come! she says "normal" things and beats up carly's neighbor, freddie who is in charge of all the technical things for their web show. carly shouts every word and looks like she doesn't have emotion. sam chases freddie around and freddie screams. in one episode carly and her friends shoot lewbert (the doorman) down in elevator and he survives.<br /><br />i would not recommend this at all, unless you like teenagers shouting, hurting people and making fun of stuff.
