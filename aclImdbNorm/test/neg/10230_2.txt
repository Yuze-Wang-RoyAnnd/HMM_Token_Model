i loved the first movie, the second one was okay, disappointed john cleese wasn't jean bob anymore as hes my favorite character. but the third one...what happened to the animation??? it looks low budget like a sat morning cartoon! except for the flashback which was taken from the first movie. they really should have stopped after number 2, this just makes the rest look bad!! derek's voice has changed but its not as recognizable as jean bob..rogers also looks very strange. i also don't understand where rothbart came from. i thought he died! this movie made me want to turn it off, as much as i love the first one, i was very disappointed with this installment. they will never beat the original!:)
