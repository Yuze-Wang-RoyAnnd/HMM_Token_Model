visually beautiful with some fine music, this film otherwise has a fairly trite made-for-tv quality. the romance between two characters, which spans a cultural and educational divide, is simply not plausible. of course, from early on we knew our persnickety heroine would lighten up, win over the locals, and find true love, but that doesn't make it any less woeful that the movie had to take such completely expected turns. this film had lots of promise, which makes it more of a shame that the promise was unrealized. perhaps a nice under-the-blanket on a cold night freebie on cable, but i certainly wouldn't recommend paid rental or purchase. i'm sure the soundtrack is wonderful, though.
