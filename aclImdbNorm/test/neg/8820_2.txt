it's always interesting to view a horror movie after hearing so much praise from other fans. experience has taught me that you should never generalize fan taste within a genre. my expectations of this movie were a great deal higher than my viewed opinion.<br /><br />children shouldn't play with dead things is a movie with a good intended plot that trips up too many times to carry it out. the whole idea of a band of actors staging a reanimation of dead corpses had me intrigued. however, everything degenerated into cinematic chaos. the actors,who for the most part were competent and amazingly expressive, were offered roles that fail to maintain consistent characterization. some of these characters go from ambivalence about the whole act of defiling a cemetery, to outspoken criticism, back to ambivalence. it's one thing for characters to have a change heart in the course of the film; it's another to produce an overly dynamic, circular attitude that loops every ten minutes.<br /><br />another inconsistent element of this film is the premise. does the main protagonist intend for the ceremony to be theatrical prank or does he actually conspire with dark spiritual forces to raise the dead? even with the aforementioned flaws, i would recommend this movie to other horror fans, since i believe that only true horror fans will appreciate the dark atmospheric components and be able to ignore the plot's inconsistency. the scene where the dead rise out of the grave is made extremely haunting (even to a veteran zombie enthusiast) by the excellent combined use of scenery and sound, and the great choice of skilled actors chosen to play the reanimated dead. current filmmakers should learn from cspwdt about using the proper video and audio techniques in mood development.<br /><br />all in all, if you are zombie movie completionist like me, you should take time to locate and view this movie. it's a fun watch.
