oh, the horror, the unspeakable horror of this film. if you can even call it a film. this looks like some first-year art school project, hastily cobbled together.<br /><br />the "talents" here will subject you to a painful mix of under- and- overacting, and practically all the scenes were terribly contrived and pretentious.<br /><br />the film in no way reflects malaysian culture or social conventions - nobody even talks that way over here. i live in malaysia, btw.<br /><br />spinning gasing seems tailor-made to pick up an award in the foreign film category of some western film festival. and unfortunately, that ploy seems to have worked. some reviewers would no doubt describe it as "exotic", but a more accurate word would be "atrocious".<br /><br />
