i have watched this movie over and over since it first came out. i was fifteen and even then, i knew it was cheesy. it had such great potential and i constantly rewrite the script in my head. the capoeira ruined what could have been a good drama. i loved the fact that it was shot on location. too bad that the characters were underdeveloped. it's like they wrote a first draft of a script then made the movie right away. at fifteen i could have written a better script!some scenes and dialog seemed to come out of nowhere and you were left with a lot of unanswered questions. and was it just me, or did it seem like lobo was sexually attracted to his cousin? "elena's grown into some kind of woman!" and the way he was always touching her. would have an interesting plot twist, elena working for her drug dealing cousin who is also a perv. too bad they missed the mark on this one.
