i'm amazed that "the hospital" has been so well-received by the critics and the public. i found it dreary, visually ugly and generally meaningless. after the first virtually unwatchable 40 minutes, the film does improve (relatively), but it remains way too far-fetched (not to mention unfunny) to be successful as a satire, and has too little substance to succeed as a drama. the film's uncertain tone is its biggest fault, overshadowing even scott's terrific (as usual) performance.
