i thought i could see something good but... i am tired after seeing this movie, i don't know what i hated the most: the script, the acting, the fx or the music. try to picture the worst power rangers episode and would still be to kind. i've seen better fx in fps games( the touch with the bone sword or his breath that is making the people disappear in a green smoke is touch of genius) and the music seems to come from a spaghetti western. i did liked how the women in the car was screaming, when the "monster" was walking around the car (even if she's looking in the wrong way). so give your self a break and don't watch this thing, at least call somebody up to see a horror movie with you, trust me you will end up playing monopoly for some kicks.
