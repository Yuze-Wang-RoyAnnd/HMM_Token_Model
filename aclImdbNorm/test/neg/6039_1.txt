there can be no worse criticism for a movie than the word boring.<br /><br />some "bad" movies are lots of fun, some "fun" movies are really bad, but to be boring means no-one will ever buy the dvd to watch it over and over again.<br /><br />it appeared to be a movie that employed the drama class from the antartic, they were all too busy running around to stay warm instead of acting. the lead actor, spoke is a near whisper, husky style voice, damn, it seemed that he was gonna seduce someone, and he didn't care who.<br /><br />the movie can't make money if it's boring, i hope this one dies a swift, never to be seen again, death.
