i remember vacationing in florida when this movie aired. i had set up my vcr to record it. the anticipation was killing me. i had known about the movie ever since it was announced some half a year earlier. we came back from florida 4 days after the movie aired, and i immediately watched it. i tried as hard as i could to like it, but i didn't.<br /><br />i am a huge 3 stooges fan. and as such i know quite a bit about them. so it wasn't like i was expecting to learn anything from the movie, and i didn't. i was more interested with the portrayals and seeing how accurate their information was. there were many things wrong with this film. the actors, the script, the reenactments, all could have been much better.<br /><br />paul ben-victor is a tremendously talented actor. but let's face facts, moe howard was way out of his reach. he doesn't look like him, he doesn't sound like him, and thus, he can't act like him. michael chiklis is also very talented, but his portrayal of curly didn't quite score with me, although when curly becomes ill he did very well at that. john kassir's portrayal of shemp could've been rehearsed better. it was more of a bad impression than a portrayal. worst of all was joe besser. they made him skinny, and more annoying than he really was. it was just plain laziness. i don't like the joe shorts, because, as the movie illustrates he hardly ever got hit. but he wasn't that annoying, and definately wasn't that thin. the best performance belongs to evan handler. he had the most accurate stooge portrayal. the problem with larry's character, his hair is way too frizzy and way too red. i know that's too technical, so i won't count that on my list of why i didn't like this movie.<br /><br />back to shemp, who just so happens to be my favorite stooge. he is written as a whining, quivering, chicken. true, he had many phobias, but he wasn't that bad. he didn't leave the group initially because he was afraid of ted healy, although he didn't like him, shemp left because he received an offer from another studio that he simply couldn't turn down. instead of the truth, this movie chooses to make him wet the bed, on larry no less, run into a closet, and shamefully bow out of the group. another problem is that shemp made nearly as many columbia shorts as curly did as a stooge, but only one, fright night, which was his first short, is shown. his career was almost completely ignored. plus, lousy editing caused a terrible and most unforgivable error. shemp was born in early 1895, and died in late 1955. that would make him how old at death? well, here's a hint, it's not 59 as the movie states.<br /><br />now for the writing, which i think was flawed only because this movie was rushed out. some of the lines are dumb and could be developed and/or introduced much better than they were. the one line that really got me was at the very end of the film, when moe is showing the promoter how the eyepoke is done.<br /><br />"that's how we do it, make contact with the brow bone, not the eyes, looks real on film though." this line was poorly written and poorly placed in the film. it's meant to be one of those lines that make the audience say oh! in amazement and i'm sure it did with some people, but the very end of the movie was not the place for this line. a better place you ask? how about when they show up at columbia for the first time and are introduced to the sound effects machine. i know initially there was no sound for the eyepoke, but moe for instance could have said, "what about this?" and eyepokes curly or larry. jules white then says "are you okay?" or "how'd you do that?" there were a lot of misplaced lines in this film which is a clear sign that the script was rushed out. another one involves the origin of the name shemp, although that one isn't as bad, and so i will let that one slide.<br /><br />what does this film do well? it illustrates how the stooges were screwed by columbia, which they were. i'm not sure if moe was an errand boy, but that was the kind of dramatization stuff that is meant to get the viewer sympathizing with them. i know this film was a dramatization. i know not everything is going to be crisp and clean and absolutely perfect. however some of the stuff they made up and the real stuff that they ignored were in serious conflict with each other. for instance curly's stroke is not even close to the way it happened in real life. i know, i know, dramatization, but the purpose of dramatizations is to make real events more dramatic. curly's stroke in real life is more dramatic than what they showed in the movie. here's what really happened. curly was sitting in a chair off screen while a scene was being shot, they called him for the final pie fight scene but there was no response. moe went to go get him and discovered his little brother head slumped, half paralyzed, unable to speak, and tears streaming down his face. moe then said "babe?" and tried to help him out of his chair. poor curly drops to his knees. then the ambulance was called.<br /><br />all in all, this movie wasn't terrible, but it certainly wasn't good, or even ok. this film portrays the stooges helplessly and inaccurately and sometimes goes overboard with dramatizations. there is a very, very long list of inaccuracies in this film. if you don't believe me, check out a fella named stooge's list at the threestooges.com news forum. it is about a page and a half long. some things in the movie i can let slide. but others were unforgivable. the three stooges were geniuses, and a lot of today's comedy is based off of what they did. don't believe me? check out the simpsons, and more so ren & stimpy. but this film fails to capture their genius. it more so inaccurately captures their hardships, which is important, but if the title of the film is gonna be the three stooges, it has to portray their ingenuity and originality more than anything.
