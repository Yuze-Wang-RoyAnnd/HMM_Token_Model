once again bronson's talent is mostly wasted on this shock value 1984 thriller which (uncut) is far more disturbing than most of what is out even today. the fact that "the evil that men do" is very disturbing (in its verbal and visual depictions of torture) is not the problem. it is the shameless gratuity in which it is presented. interestingly, this film seems to symbolize that latter part of bronson's career in which he has tortured many of his fans with the same egregiously predictable and uncreative plots. one hopes this fine actor will rise again.
