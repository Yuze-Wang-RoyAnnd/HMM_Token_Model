with its few touches of surrealism, lwhtrb works as low-grade horror, but as a major follow-up statement to the original, it flounders miserably.<br /><br /> things begin somewhat promising during the telefilm's opening credits... we see and hear several interesting shots and sounds: the baby's black crib with the overhanging, inverted cross; the kitchen knife rosemary carried into the castevette's apartment and dropped in shock (the utensil is shown sticking out of the hardwood floor); and the emptiness of the bramford itself, without tenants or furniture (voice-overs can be heard here from the previous film's dialog). interesting too is the easter egg hunt the titular child participates in (the eggs and baskets are also black). once the story gets rolling, it never really 'rolls'... and what happens to rosemary when she boards that driverless bus, and is whisked away to god-knows-where? <br /><br />patty duke (a poor replacement for mia farrow), ray milland and tina louise (as the southwestern whore who raises the child, "adrian/andrew") head this almost-star cast, with ruth gordon reprising her "minnie" role.<br /><br />although not a total failure, this sequel-of-sorts should have been released in book form first, then maybe we all could have been a bit better informed... and not left totally in the dark. a fairly recent sequel novel "son of rosemary" (1999?) is the legitimate followup by ira levin himself.<br /><br />
