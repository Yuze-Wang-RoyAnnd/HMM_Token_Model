i watched this years ago on television when i was sick (i don't know, i tend to be more complacent with my tv viewing when i'm sick; too much effort to use the remote control, i guess).<br /><br />from what i can recall, every aspect of the movie--casting, acting, writing, directing, etc.--was ill-advised at best. i could have forgiven the historical inaccuracies if this film had created a sense of what it was like to work on trinity; but it didn't. there were attempts to humanize the scientists, but they were insufficient and never transcended caricature.<br /><br />i didn't know very much about the people involved in the manhattan project at the time, but the portrayals in the movie were so cartoonish that i became interested in learning about the real personalities. and i did. so i guess this horrible film has done a very small amount of good, after all.<br /><br />this is not an in-depth review, but fmlb neither deserves nor requires one. you might enjoy it if you're a fan of bad movies.
