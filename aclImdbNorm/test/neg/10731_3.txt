i rented this film out of the local video store one day, you know, the kind of movie with box art that just reaches out and tells you to 'rent me'. well, if you see this dull film in your video store, walk on by. fight the urge, rent a porno, because this film is booooooorrrring. despite the interesting opening, the film lapses into repetitive murders and a hardboiled cop stumbling around, dealing with the usual problems (wife, bastard of a boss, etc). wondering if the fast forward function on your vcr works? rent this film and put your concerns to the test.
