this owes a great deal to the plot of captains courageous. although he is quite grown up, it is partly the story of a wealthy lad who is shanghaied as a crew member aboard a cargo vessel and becomes a man in the process. moran of the title is a boyish young woman also brought up on a vessel owned by her father. when the cargo burns, she and crew members are evacuated to our lad's ship. however, the captain has smuggling on his mind and his intentions are not honorable where moran is concerned. the inevitable ensues - our lad falls for the mannish moran and she for him. in the end evil is subdued and the lovers are united. some interesting dialogue points out that moran belongs to no man -"and no woman." (a nod to sappho here). dorothy dalton is appropriately sexless as moran and not too attractive either. valentino does well in a romantic, action role. his sexy build and physique are shown off to advantage and the role is quite a masculine one. he is very appealing. this is no great film but it passes the time. what it really showcases is valentino's beauty and sexiness.
