i rented this movie, knowing that it would be bad (i have only seen one good disney sequel and that was toy story 2), but it went far lower than my expectations. i am a die hard disney fan and i just don't believe in sequels with disney movies. for somebody who didn't grow up with the classics (either watching them when they came out, or renting them since you were born) it's a cute story. i just feel that the plot was dragged out a little too much, and was to predictable. the one thing that annoyed me the most was the voices of the girl children of lady and tramp. they were too high pitched. although most reviews say that it isn't that bad, i think that if you are a true disney fan, you shouldn't waste your time with this one.<br /><br />hopefully disney won't be making any more sequels to any of the other classics any time soon.
