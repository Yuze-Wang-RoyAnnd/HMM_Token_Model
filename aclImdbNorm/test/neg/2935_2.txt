well, where to start describing this celluloid debacle? you already know the big fat nada passing as a plot, so let's jut point out that this is so pc it's offensive. hard to believe that frank oz, the same guy that gave us laugh riots like little shop of horrors and bowfinger, made this unfunny mess.<br /><br />so, this guy doesn't know he's gay till this actor points it out. ok, sure. if anyone ever says i'm gay, i'll know the truth, even if i currently like girls more than george luca$ likes a dollar.<br /><br />and how to know the true nature of my sexuality? well, if i like classic litterature, dancing and barbra streisand, i'm gay. if i dress like a blind man in a hurry (with half my shirt hanging out), i'm straight. oh, sure.<br /><br />and here's the big clich'e of clich'es: no matter how you look, there's always a very attractive hollywood actor who'll adore every bit of grease under your skin, or a top model who'll love your zero iq, your butt-ugly face and your pointing-out ears. if all those gay common places weren't enough to get me angry, this did. in real world looks matter, folks, and i know for sure.<br /><br />i see it coming: now you'll say "relax! it's a comedy! don't take it so seriously!". if being a comedy gives anything "carte blanche" to suck out loud, i think the world has a serious problem. wouldn't be much better (and funnier) to make a movie to denegate those old tiresome clich'es, instead of magnifying them over and over again?<br /><br />so, one of the absolutely worst movies i've ever seen. 1 out of 10. if giving this rating has something to do with my sexual tendence, please let me know. i'm interested.
