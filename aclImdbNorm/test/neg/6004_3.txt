a bare-faced rip-off of se7en and not fit to clean its shoes. the word 'predictable' must have invented for just such an occasion as this. lambert is wooden, as always (his moments of 'emotion' are laughable, as is his accent). the 'climax' is not that at all as we've had so many signals, and by the end we're simply immune to flesh, rotting and otherwise. altogether a real mess.
