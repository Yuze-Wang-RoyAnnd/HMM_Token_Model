i don't expect a lot from ghost stories, but i do expect a story to make a bit of sense! is that asking too much from the screenwriters and filmmakers? when the bad guy, all of the sudden, becomes a homicidal maniac solely because a bunch of crows start pecking him, then i have a problem spending $9.00 for a ticket! alfred hitchcock would be spinning in his grave. didn't anyone learn anything in their college film 101 class? a good movie has at its roots an interesting story!<br /><br />here are some of the ridiculous messages in this movie: if you have desperate financial problems move from chicago to the middle of no-where in north dakota to grow sunflowers (i kid you not!). if your toddler has serious neurological problems from a car accident move away from some of the best hospitals and speech therapists in the country to an isolated small town, which, at best, has a community hospital. hire a drifter to live & work with you, out of the blue, without checking any references, when you have a teenage vixen daughter, a wife and toddler. ( i'm glad they're not my parents!) <br /><br />a town where everyone knows everything would have no problem missing a triple homicide, just outside of town. and, of course, blame the man's lunacy on a bad crop of sunflowers! (doesn't anything else grow in north dakota?) a couple of days after you buy your rundown house - with huge vines growing everywhere - that it reminds you of jack and the beanstalk, a guy from the x-files, ala smoking man, (i'm glad to see the cigarettes didn't get him, i guess he doesn't inhale!) will just suddenly sneak up on you while you're working to offer you the sale price of your home, plus 15% more, for absolutely no reason!<br /><br />i think you get the picture. i have seen so many godforsaken awful movies in the past month, it just blows my mind! is it that difficult to make a movie that doesn't treat the audience like an idiot? i'm glad at least the crows in this sorry film turned out to have the some brains! i wish i could say the same for whomever thinks they are going to make money off this celluloid piece of trash!
