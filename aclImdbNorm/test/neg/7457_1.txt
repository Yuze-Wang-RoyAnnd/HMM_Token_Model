this canadian "movie" is the worst ever! stunningly amateurish. when the bad guys rob a boat, we see two women with machine guns and one of them says, with a very low voice, "we're robbing your ship!" she blinks and is totally shy! very intimidating. rotflol!!!<br /><br />the two karate chopping heroes are 40something year old, five feet tall twin brothers! they're really bad actors. in fact, everyone involved in this production is a non-actor.<br /><br />there are so many continuity mistakes in this cheap production that it's amazing. in one scene, the guys are wearing one type of swimsuit. in the following shot, they're wearing completely different swimsuits. <br /><br />absolutely terrible! a must see for any fan of bad movies. i have it on vhs. it's very rare. i cherish it.
