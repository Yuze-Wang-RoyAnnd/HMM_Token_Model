yes, why? among the filmmakers that came out in the 80's and 90's gus van sant is one of my idols. there are others, a few. steven sodebergh, pt anderson, tim hunter, danny boyle, martin donovan, harmony korine, wes anderson. idiosyncratic, infuriating some times, but consistent, surprising, unpredictable. their names make me switch on the tv, go to a video store or even buy a ticket and go to a movie theater. van sant's "psycho" however, gives me pause. why? i wonder. a shot by shot massacre of one of the perennial classics. the color was jarring, the performances, atrocious. what was vince vaughn doing? was it a parody? a bad joke? what the hell was it? anne heche as janet leigh? who dressed her? viggo mortensen with a cowboy hat. viggo is a superb actor but in this case he couldn't make us forget john gavin and if julianne moore had been introduced to the world through this performance there wouldn't have been any "the hours" for her, "the minutes" maybe. so, here i am, bad mouthing the work of one of my idols. the crashing question remains: why, mr. van sant? maybe, in the words of president clinton, because he could. i'm afraid that's no excuse.
