found this film for one dollar ($1.00) and the film was a complete waste of time. reb brown,(mark hardin), played a military adviser in south america and was successful in capturing the leader of rebel soldiers operating out of the dense jungles. however, mark joins the opposite side after some horrible tortures were inflicted or women and men. in one scene as mark is having a drink in a hotel bar, his eyes catch the glimpse of sexy long legs sandra spencer (shannon tweed),"dead sexy",01. mark and sandra have the extreme hots for each other and even make passionate love on some very hard rocks, with no time for the comforts of a bed. this is a horrible film and not worth wasting the time to even look at it.
