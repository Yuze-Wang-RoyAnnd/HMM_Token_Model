this movie is soo bad that i've wasted way to much time already talking about it. soo bad...really... ...bad... and i'm not even that critical... ..i'm almost ashamed to admit to having seen it... sandra's few minutes show you how far she's really made it... i mean really anything next to this is really oscar worthy for her... i suppose the only way for her to look at it is there's no way but up after this one...i suppose she had to start somewhere... but really...soo bad... ...awful really... bad is too good a word for this s**t ....but i don't want to get mean now... but really how can u not after wasting 90 minutes... 90 minutes of my life that i'll never get back... 90 minutes i could have spent doing something better...like sitting on my butt and staring into space..that would have been time better spent...
