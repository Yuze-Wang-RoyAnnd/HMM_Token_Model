in a farcical key, gaud'i afternoons can be taken as a mediocre exercise. marcia gay harden and judy davis pivoted a good cast (juliette lewis' new-age freaky character has been incredibly taken from reality, i know an american young lady who squawks like her!!) but ga does not show much beyond its overtoned plot.<br /><br />even though movie-making is all about make believe, there were certain noticeable screenplay inconsistencies. two samples: you pay 14 euro to enter the chapel where cassandra and frankie met, never at 7 am, and you cannot leave a terrace without paying the bill (they'll charge you on the spot if they don't know you) or get off a taxi that quickly (you americans always tip cabbies even though they don't expect to, but the sequences portrayed in the movie were ridiculous). don't believe me, reader: come over and see for yourself.<br /><br />if you've never been here before you might not care about all this, but good movies should be believable disregarding of your origin. nobody knows about ga here, and i will make sure that does not change in the future.
