i was debating between this movie and 2012 but chose inglourious basterds due to it's amazingly high imdb rating. i must say now, what a disappointment. i expected a certain amount of gratuitous violence, but i also expected a lot of witty dialog. i got a huge dosage of the former, but not nearly enough of the latter. i felt shortchanged. the ratio between violence to plot is very important and i think this movie gets it totally wrong. and the plot? it's that believable or really all that entertaining either. save your time and money. i can't believe what this rating says for the gory and violent tastes of the modern masses.
