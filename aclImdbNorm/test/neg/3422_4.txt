the play macbeth was written by william shakespeare between the years of 1604 and 1606. ever since then, many other versions of the play have been produced, including remakes completed in 1948, 1971, and 2006. akira kurosawa even directed a japanese version of macbeth in 1957 entitled, "kumonosu j^o." the play starts out with king duncan hearing about the success of two of his generals, macbeth and banquo, in a recent battle with the irish and the norwegians. after a quick promotion from duncan, macbeth instantly gets an uncanny feeling for lust, greed, and power and does everything in his power to gain access to the crown: even if it includes murder.<br /><br />geoffrey wright tried creating his own version of the famous play in 2006 by setting it in the modern melbourne underworld. just imagine a lowly macbeth slaying hundreds of soldiers with an ak-47 and rapping his own rendition of, "low" at the same time. just kidding about the latter, but one thing he does do is utter the traditional shakespeare. and he keeps it going throughout the whole movie. that's right! shakespeare meets ghetto. it's all you could ever hope for! not
