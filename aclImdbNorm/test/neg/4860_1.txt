i clicked onto the encore mystery channel to wait for the movie i wanted to see, island of dr. moreau. i caught only a few minutes of shadow conspiracy. an old man runs to meet charlie and grabs him by the arm. suddenly, an assassin in a bright rain coat taps the old man in the head (with a side arm) from across the street. after waiting for "c" to turn around and look, the "a" tries to shoot "c" and clearly misses. "c" was a much easier target, the old man couldn't have run far. duh! there is a chase and "c" is on an elevator "a" is on the roof, so he tries to shoot the cable, which is parallel to the "a". he hits and severs the cable, impossible. later, this time with a specialized rifle, the "a" lines up on "c" from maybe 50 meters, but is to stupid to notice a motorcycle coming up and taps the rider instead. how does charlie get his parts? does daddy go to the producers and say "look, my kid needs work..." it reminds me of his stupid sit - com. all the actors are good except, yup ... you got it. i usually have to endue 2 or 3 minutes of that waiting for c.s.i. to come on. let's see, what can i do for the next hour. i know, i'll trim my toenails! much better use of my time.
