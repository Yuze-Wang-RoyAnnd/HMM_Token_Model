i rented a copy of this one from netflix -- big mistake. the dvd version titled "the one-armed swordsmen" was produced by madmen who thought that the fighting sequences would be appreciated better pasted all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent, sequential story. some of the story was left in separate chapters, which you can select from the main menu, but the dvd is still a mess. don't rent or buy it. not that there was anything wonderful about the original story, an absurdly complicated piece of nonsense. much as i liked seeing wang yu in his prime again after all these years, this one is an utter waste of time. i've had dish detergents that made a better film than this. what the chopped-up dvd version shows us is that no matter how silly a chinese script may be, you have to see some sort of story to care about how the fighting sequences turn out.<br /><br />but "the one-armed swordsmen" does offer you do the chance to see both wang and shaw brothers stalwart lo lieh beating up smirking pretty boy david chiang -- it's always a pleasure to see that happen. lo plays a sort of second-string villain here, and serves as a prime example of why some people really need orthodontists. he film is also graced by the participation of taiwanese actor chang yi as the magistrate. <br /><br />another comment above mentions the obligatory fight-in-the-inn scene (there are two, in fact) where wang and chiang are attacked by a pack of comical barbarians using what look like cavemen weapons, making bruce lee noises while they fight. none of this makes any sense, but that's okay if you're not expecting any clarity or common sense. it was fun to watch anyway.<br /><br />another peculiarity of this production is that there are no significant women characters. there are a couple of female roles, but they play no serious role in the action or the plot.<br /><br />if you can find a copy of the original shaw brothers one-armed swordsman movie, the one which explains why he has only the one arm and why he uses a broken sword, go for it.
