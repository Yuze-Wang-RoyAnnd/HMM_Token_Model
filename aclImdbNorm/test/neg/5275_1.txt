i'm a big fan of kevin spacey's work, but this is a sub-standard film. if you think it looks interesting, or you saw it and liked it, go and check out john boorman's "the general". it is basically about the same guy, but is far superior in every way (and doesn't suffer from the hollywood glorifications).
