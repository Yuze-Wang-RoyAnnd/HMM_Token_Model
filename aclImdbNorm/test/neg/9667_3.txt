there's something strange about the antisocial sentiment you can find in some cheech and chong material. one of the songs in up in smoke, well, i often wish more songs these days began that way. but in this excuse for a video, the stoner duo are showing us the videos for four songs from their album of the moment, also titled get out of my room. you hear a voice-over during the opening credits in which some anonymous producer describes the record as being a novelty recording that will just take up room on the charts. unfortunately, this opening voice-over hits the nail right on the head.<br /><br />most music recordings endorsed by the riaa seem to keep to a rule of putting the best material early in the album. often, when one gets past that first song, the discerning listener notices that the recording has little, if anything, to hold their attention. bands that defied mainstream convention, on the other hand, often saved their best material for last, or at least spread it evenly throughout the disc. in this case, cheech and chong appear to have decided to hedge their bets. the opening piece, get out of my room, is a hilariously-themed song with an incredibly bad video. many a viewer of a 1980s music video will find the sloppy direction somewhat nostalgic. cheech's conception of british punk is also incredibly funny.<br /><br />where it all goes downhill is the second number, i'm not home right now. nothing kills interest in a song quite like repetition, and it's tough to get more repetitive than this aural turd. honestly, one feels the urge to slap cheech in the face and tell him that we get the idea, he isn't home right now, so please move on. the next song, along the theme of love being a strange thing, is the absolute rock bottom not only for this collection, but for cheech and chong in general. it's almost as if this song was made for the sole reason of padding out the album's running time.<br /><br />fortunately, the stoner duo saved the best for last, but it is also curious to note that chong is completely absent from this cut. born in east l.a. is a simple number based upon the old bruce springsteen number that mocks reagan's view of multiculturalism. as one is regaled by cheech's tale, one has to wonder how many poor schleps who couldn't speak a word of spanish were deported to mexico simply because their skin wasn't bedsheet-white. racism was an integral part of america's culture in 1985, and it remains so today. if anything, it has gotten worse, so one has to wonder what born in east l.a. would be like if it were written in the current era.<br /><br />unfortunately, two cuts does not an album make, especially when there is so much boring filler between them. the interviews before get out of my room, for example, are quite funny. not side-splitting like much of up in smoke, but funny enough to justify their existence. unfortunately, the two middle songs are reflected in their making-of footage. boring song makes boring filler. if you cut out the middle half-hour of material from this video, you'd have something substantially better.<br /><br />i gave get out of my room a three out of ten. they are earned by the first and last video. i'm pretty certain that the stars look at material like this today and wonder what they were thinking.
