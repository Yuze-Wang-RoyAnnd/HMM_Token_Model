jerry lewis was marginally funny when he didn't write his own material and had a good director like frank tashlin. when he started writing and directing his own films what little talent he possessed was overshadowed by his egomania. whenever his films would fail (and deservedly so) in the american market (they made money in france) lewis always blamed everyone and everything but himself; for example, he blamed the failure of this film on the fact that it was, according to lewis, released on a double-bill with the porno feature "deep throat". if anyone should have complained about that situation, it should have been the producers of "deep throat." this is an absolutely idiotic "comedy" about the world's richest man (lewis) who is rejected for military service during ww2 and decides to outfit a special "squad" to go to germany and capture hitler himself. besides the many faults this film has (the script is mind-numbingly unfunny, lewis' "direction" is nonexistent, the film has the look of a cheap home movie), lewis apparently thought that surrounding himself with no-talent, over-the-hill borscht belt comics like jan murray and sidney miller was a good idea; he must have figured that they would be so bad, they would make him look good. he was half-right; they are embarrassingly bad, but he comes out even worse than they do. for a "comedy", lewis' character is sullen, angry and pushy; the way he heaps abuse on his underlings makes you wonder why they would ever follow a bullying jerk like this on a dangerous mission like trying to capture hitler. the fact that this movie took in any money at all is astounding. it is by far the worst jerry lewis movie i have ever seen--i've heard that "slapstick" is even more pathetic, but i can't bring myself to see if that's true or not--and is to be avoided at all possible costs.
