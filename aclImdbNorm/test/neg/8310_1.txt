bay area residents probably remember paul from the diamond center, an unctuous late night huckster who flogged easy credit and cheap rocks on late night television throughout the 1980s and early 90s. i mention him only because there is an actor in death machines who looks just like him playing the owner of an italian restaurant. he appears in the best scene in this positively dreadful and near unwatchable crime drama about a dragon lady (mari honjo, who wisely hung up her acting spurs after completing this film) who controls the local syndicate. our hero (let's call him not paul from the diamond center) plays the restaurateur with all the subtlety of the simpsons' luigi ("you lika da spaghetti?") and seems unimpressed when one of his patrons complains about the food. no, there's no fly in the soup or hair in the sauce: there's a red buddha in the pasta, the calling card of the murderous crime boss, who sends a statuette to each of her prospective victims. death machines is bad by any measure, and pretty boring, which is an even worse crime.
