this is a big disappointment. the main problem is the acting. sylvestre le touzel is pretty poor as fanny, and the rest are not much better, everybody is very stilted and unnatural. also the camerawork is very 1980's ie cramped and jumpy, compared with the likes of 1995's p&p, for example.<br /><br />the script is, if anything too faithful to the book, and there are some cringe worthy expressions that should have been cut.<br /><br />in every way this is far inferior to the recent film version, which though it took huge liberties with the book, seemed far more faithful to the spirit of the book and was far more enjoyable.
