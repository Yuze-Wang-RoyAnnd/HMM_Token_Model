i was lucky enough to read the book beforehand and i do know a little about tudor england.<br /><br />the writing directing and editing of this tv movie for the most part was truly awful. i felt as if i was watching a really bad drama doc about the period rater then a movie.<br /><br />first there were too many cut's between important parts. and leaving out important events which happened at the time, one is henry's fall out with rome over his desire to divorce katherine of aragon which led to england's breaking away from rome and establishing her own church. they barely stuck to the book at all. i'm all for creative freedom but to a limit, especially when your dealing with a well written book as your starter point. in the book mary give's birth to young catherine first and then she has young henry is born. both their father is henry's the eight. in the movie they show harry's first then catherine. and suggest that catherine father is william carey.<br /><br />there are too many bad moment's in the movie to write them all.<br /><br />i will however say that jodhi may and natascha mcelhone portrayal as the boleyn sisters was probably the best part of the movie.<br /><br />if you haven't read the book and know nothing about hennry's the 8 court i will recommend to stay away from this movie. and for those who read the book the movie will annoy you for it's lack of details and important plot's.
