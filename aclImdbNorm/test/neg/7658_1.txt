actually there was nothing funny about this monstrosity at all!! this movie was a complete abomination. the absurdities in this movie almost made me want to vomit!! i think that the people responsible for this movie took advantage of their viewing audience. they took a relatively decent series of movies (i did say decent, not good!!) and totally trashed it by trying to put money in their pockets. the making of airplane! was a way for hollywood to make up for this crappy flick. the worst part about it is that either nobody in 1979 realized the asinine events of the movie (such as concorde's door popping off at some ungodly high altitude or patroni shooting a flair gun out the window at mach 2 to avoid a nuclear warhead!?!?!?....what were they thinking???)were totally unrealistic or they just didn't care! i think that it is the latter of the two. the writers and director of this "film", if you want to call it that, really tried to suck the airport dynasty dry with this crap!
