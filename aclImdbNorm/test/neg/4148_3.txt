relesed from troma (which is my favorite movie company)unspeaksble is a messy horror film that can be interesting but very dark and twisted.<br /><br />unspeakable starts with a family in a car, they get into an accident which leaves a daughter dead and a mother deformed. the father eventually goes crazy and slashes prostitutes. he sees his daughter in other people. he kills for her. meanwhile his now deformed wife is being raped by her orderly. these are sick people! <br /><br />unspeakable tries to be sick and disturbing and it does manage to do that as a good horror flick this is not. most troma movies have a sense of humor to them but however this one doesn't.
