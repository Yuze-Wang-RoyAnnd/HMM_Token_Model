jacqueline susann wrote several novels all involving sex and melodrama and a few of them actually were made into films including this effort and they all have the distinction of being some of the worst films ever made. story here is about robin stone (john phillip law) and his rise to the top of television by being ruthless and calculating to everyone around him. he's a playboy of the worst sort using and then throwing away every woman he beds including the wife of the ibc network president.<br /><br />*****spoiler alert***** greg austin (robert ryan) is in charge of the television network ibc and when his younger wife judith takes one look at robin she wastes no time getting into bed with him. greg falls ill and has to take some time off and this is where robin steps in and starts trying to run the network but during all this a model named amanda (jodi wexler) who is in love with him kills herself. when greg returns to his job he tries to get rid of robin by using the morals clause in his contract when rumors start flying about his relationship with jerry nelson (david hemmings) who's a gay fashion photographer.<br /><br />this was directed by jack haley jr. who went on to be a very successful producer in both television and movies but this was only his second film as a director and the material he was forced to deal with seems way over his head! the script comes from susann's novel and that would probably be why this resembles a cross between "alfie" and "the valley of the dolls" and i think the reason why her books never could translate well onto film is because the filmmakers made the terrible mistake of taking her stories seriously instead of tongue in cheek. with that, the laughs that come from this are unintentional especially during that totally ridiculous fight towards the end of the film which starts when cannon refuses to give back the slave bracelet to the gay characters! hemmings was a very good actor but his role here is completely over the top and it has him wearing one of the worst beards in history and using the term "chic" in every other sentence. law was not the original choice for the lead but another actor that was cast had a serious accident and law stepped in and delivers one of the more wooden performances this side of miles o'keeffe. the film's script suffers in two different areas in that it's both completely silly and horribly dull and it will test a viewers patience if they choose to watch this. one has to wonder what would be the outcome if a director decided to film one of susann's novels and not take it seriously because the attempt here is ponderous and ridiculous.
