"glen or glenda" was edward d. wood jr's first attempt at directing a feature film. for this he chose a topic near and dear to his heart...transvestism, the "art" of a man wanting to dress in women's clothes. to his credit, wood tried to deal with subject matter that was largely taboo in 1953. unfortunately, wood had neither the budget nor the know how to make the film.<br /><br />the story opens with a prologue by bela lugosi that makes little sense and then moves to the discovery of a dead transvestite glen/glenda (daniel davis aka ed wood). inspector warren (lyle talbot) with the help of psychiatrist dr. alton (timothy farrell) tries to understand why a man would want to live (and die) this way.<br /><br />glen is engaged to barbara (dolores fuller) and is reluctant to tell her of his obsession. and that's it. we see endless stock footage shots of anything from freeway traffic to soldiers landing on the beach, interspersed with shots of wood walking down the same street dressed as either glen or glenda and looking longingly at women's clothes in a store window. poor old bela, who was down on his luck and befriended by wood, keeps popping in throughout the story. i'm not 100% sure but i think bela's scenes were added for his name value after the body of the movie was completed.<br /><br />to add to the confusion of lugosi's narration, farrell as dr. alton also provides off screen narration. lugosi keeps saying, bevare, bevare...take care, take care, as well as, some gibberish about snakes and snails and puppy dog's tails.<br /><br />the story also deals with a transvestite who has a successful sex change operation and tries to explain the difference between that person and wood's character(s). the dream sequences are laughable. a wedding sequence in which someone dressed as the devil appears is a good example. wood also gives us an apparent rape scene with the actors(?) fully clothed but leaving little to the imagination, risqu'e for 1953.<br /><br />this film along with wood's other "classics" were so bad that they became embraced by the public as cult classics over the years. for that reason, they have survived to this day.
