"changi" is an australian comedy/drama set in the world war 2 japanese prisoner of war camp of that name. the story cuts between past events, and the present day, when the aged veterans plan a reunion. this is a much publicised and controversial miniseries, here in australia. the budget ran over ($6.5 million aust. dollars); historians and veterans criticised it's authenticity; and critics pilloried the uneasy mix of comedy and drama (shades of "pearl harbor"). series writer john doyle (half of the successful roy & h.g. comedy team), has tried to defend himself with comments about "the characters are composites of actual people"; "the troops used comedy to cope with the situation"; "it's only based on actual events"; "one of our actors was actually there" etc. i don't have a problem with any of these points. many superb fictional and factual dramas have come out of the japanese p.o.w. camp experience: "king rat", "tenko", "merry christmas mr. lawrence", "bridge on the river kwai", "paradise road", "empire of the sun", "blood oath", and "a town like alice". black comedy has often been used successfully in p.o.w dramas: "life is beautiful", "the great escape", "seven beauties", "stalag 17", "the colditz story", and even "hogan's heroes". so why is "changi" a monumental failure? - the acting in "changi" is uniformly excellent, the music and cinematography is good - it is the writing and direction that have let it down. every scene seemed to give me waves of deja vu. when anthony hayes is made to stand in the blazing sun, i thought "didn't i see alec guinness do this in "bridge on the river kwai"?". the sudden flashes into surreal song & dance brought back dennis potter's "singing detective", but without the finesse. this borrowing happened so often, it smacked of lazy writing by cut and paste, rather than homage. the constant intercutting between the past and present stories left me unable to concentrate on either. flash forward and flash back can be a useful tool - here it left me distanced from characters, where intensity was called for. the "ausiness" is overdone - every conversation seemed to include "stone the bloody crows" & such, that i was saying "i get the point, i know they're aussies". cultural stereotyping extended to the british and japanese too -sadistic young japanese officer; uptight british officer; wiser japanese commandant; fun-loving, rascally aussies etc. i thought i was watching "hogan's heroes on the river kwai". after 3 episodes i'm tuning out.
