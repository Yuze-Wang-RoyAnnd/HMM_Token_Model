i absolutely positively can't believe my fellow imdb reviewers. all the praise about how "original" this movie is, it's like they've never seen "ring" or the million of imitations that's come out in the 10 years since that movie. and some of them claim to be horror movie buffs! i think not! "shutter" is okay. average, i'd say. i give it 5 out of 10, but there's just no way it's original and great and "the most frightening thing i've ever seen" as one reviewer said. puh-leeeze, people. this one is plain. it's predictable.<br /><br />i swear, if i see another ghost movie where the hero traces the past of the ghost in order to find out why she's so mad and after them, i'm going to scream.<br /><br />"original"? give me a break. you people need to get out more. or at least stop calling yourselves "horror movie fans".
