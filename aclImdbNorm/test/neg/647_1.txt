my wife and i saw this in the theater when it first came out.<br /><br />there were only 3 couples there and we all walked out about the same time.<br /><br />this is the only movie i have ever walked out on.<br /><br />it was just painful to sit through.<br /><br />the theater actually stopped us on the way out and asked if we wanted a refund.<br /><br />never had that happen before or since pleae do not rent this you will really regret it i am really sureprised by the vote summary perhaps personal tast has something to do with it
