god! where do i begin? from start to finish, i could not help to hate this movie. vines? vines that make cell-phone noises?! oh yeah, i'm so scared - i'm going to rid the weeds of earth! come on people! the plot went nowhere, when the group discovered the ruin, and the village people (no pun intended) came to warn them and brandished weapons in front of their faces, don't worry, amy (jena malone) was there to take pictures! that whole scene really had me wondering why she didn't take pictures of her beau, jeff (johnathon tucker), sawing off mathias (joe anderson) legs. when the idiots first threw down the rope after mathias, how the rope was at least ten feet from the ground, but how it eventually was able to be a mere two to four feet from the ground. i cannot begin to cover everything that was wrong about this movie, there is just too much to cover. i will say the graphics as far as the gore were terrific, but it amounted to nothing since the acting and script were so terrifically bad.
