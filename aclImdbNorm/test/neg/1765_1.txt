this movie was so bad, i thought i was going to scream in the middle of it. it was all i could do to sit through it. the beginning of the movie where they are at war was promising. only it smacked of "saving private ryan" to me...or at least an attempt at it. only we don't care for these people. there was no build up to the characters. the kid that dies i guess was suppose to make us cry...but for some reason it just irritated everyone. then we have to listen to line after line of sappy dialog that tried desperately to mimic "wuthering heights", which of course was also quoted in the movie. go figure. there was nothing original about the movie at all, it was like sitting through the most mundane parts of every war movie ever made, with a little bit of humor thrown in to keep you hoping that it was going to get better. sadly it doesn't. 3 hours later, i leave the theater feeling cheated. anthony menghilla should be shot for trying to duplicate the english patient, which for it's time was a good movie, but now i wonder....should i rent it and make sure i wasn't just caught up in the hype??? maybe i was, but i definitely wasn't caught up in the hype of this film. i really went to the theater wanting to like this movie. i am a die hard nicole kidman fan. save your money, rent it on dvd and laugh through it, as i did.
