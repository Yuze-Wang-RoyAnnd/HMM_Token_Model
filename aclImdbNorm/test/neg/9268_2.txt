this is perhaps the most ridiculous crap i have ever watched. three unconnected stories about completely stupid and random things are occasionally interrupted by a bus and a boring monologue about relationships by a stupid man. christ knows why so many people got involved in this. highlights: green fridge man reading jean-paul sartre, the slob mans dinner guest and her horse-manure hair products, a ridiculously unreasonable woman in the third short, who suspected a man of foul play just for taking an interest in her generic activities, blowers.<br /><br />i need to use up a few more lines apparently, so may as well mention some more stupid things about the film. the first film involves a man driving a talking car around and obeying its unreasonable demands for absolutely no apparent reason. the only way you would watch this film is if you were blind and had other debilitating defects in your personality and brain. it is kind of funny in an ironic way, but also extremely wearying, like being forced to chew for a very long time on a stained rug.
