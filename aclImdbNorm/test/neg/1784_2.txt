if this movie was made two years earlier it could have been a lot better. but unfortunately, it was made in the decade that had no idea about how a horror movie was supposed to look or act. when i first heard about this movie, people on imdb were classifying it as the sequel to cheerleader camp. oh how wrong they were. yes, betsy russell was in it but uma thurman sure wasn't. i'd really like to find the person who started that whole sequel rumor. i'm sure a lot of us would though. i'm not gonna give anything away because frankly i don't remember how this movie even ends! i'm just gonna tell you to watch a real camp horror movie... the burning starring jason alexander, fisher stevens, holly hunter & the geek from fast times at ridgemont high. a word to the wise - just because a horror movie has the word camp in the title, doesn't mean its gonna be worth watching. oh, and another thing, any horror flick made in the early to mid 90's was ever considered even remotely good!
