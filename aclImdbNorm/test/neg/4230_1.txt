i can't remember when was the last time i have been so terribly disappointed by any movie. probably i expected too much happening (in a way you can expect action in dogma style movies of course). but there is just nothing going on in here. luckily i was watching it at home and could switch channels whenever the silence and dumb/numb faces started to kill me. and that was very often! it really isn't too much of a pleasure watching ugly people who don't talk and move slowly, stroke pigs and french kiss men, not to mention ugly bodies having explicit sex. if only it made any sense... the whole murder situation is ridiculous; seems like it was only created to show one more vagina since zero characters are capable of actually solving the crime. having only four pseudo developed characters and a movie going nowhere it is pretty soon obvious whom the director picked as a killer. and that makes no sence either. despite all the boredom and suffering i must admit that it somehow touched me in an unexplainable way. maybe you should check it out yourself though i don't recommend it.
