i was entertained to see that some of the reviews here were topped with **spoilers** the joke in my family is that the only part of this movie that isn't given away on the back of the box, is given away in the title. perhaps i am just a dense american 17-year-old who wouldn't know art if it bit me in the leg, but i prefer movies that have at least some words. this movie makes the second half of 2001: a space odyssey down right chatty. this movie is just so slow it isn't even art, it is merely boring. we follow this creepy guy who is following this boy around venice. the end was incomprehensible until i read the end of book. a movie shouldn't make you refer back to the book, it should be able to stand alone. this movie has no way to stand. it doesn't even have the bones of a plot to lean on.
