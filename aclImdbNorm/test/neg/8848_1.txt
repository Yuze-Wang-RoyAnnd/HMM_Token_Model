do not see this film. in most cases, such as that of ju-on and the grudge, the japanese film are infinitely better than the american remake. however, this movie was terrible. the ghosts, much like a trick or treater dressed as a sheet ghost moan and wheeze in an attempt to be scary in the absence of good makeup or special effects and the acting is just horrible. the story itself is inconsistent and confusing, not everything is explained leaving the film to go from bad to worse. do not waste your time with this movie, it's not worth it and i am sure that there are more entertaining things to do - like watching paint dry.
