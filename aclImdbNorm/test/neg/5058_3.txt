this isn't a dreadful film, merely insipid. the plot is deeply flawed and implausible. it tries to be a number of genres and fails at each. it fails as a comedy, as a suspense thriller and as a horror movie. it almost succeeds as science fiction. the direction is uninspired and katie holmes, cute cherub face that she is, should be modeling teen clothing, not acting. the only thing that keeps this movie from being a 1 out of 10 is helen mirren. her performance is fabulously nefarious and is (almost) worth suffering through the rest of it. her ability to transmute from imperious to faux sympathetic to deviously manipulate and control her prey shows masterful range. other than marissa coughlin's delightful exorcist rendition, mirren is the only reason to see this movie. a solid 3.0.
