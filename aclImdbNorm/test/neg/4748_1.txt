with this movie i was really hoping that the idea was to make up for the hashed together ineptitude of the first avp, and yet to my horror: requiem is far worse than i could have imagined.<br /><br />my hopes were up in the opening moments of the film inside the predator ship, and i almost breathed a sigh of relief when we finally saw the predator home world (a throwaway digital matte painting, but still nice to finally see it) and then of course, the humans (if such poorly written characters can be referred to as such) are introduced...<br /><br />one must wonder why it seems to be impossible for fox to make a good film out of aliens and predators. at the very least the supposed filmmakers could have done their homework.<br /><br />characters are set up in the same manner in which we would expect from the worst friday the 13th sequel. the pizza delivery scene was cringe inducing as was every other scene of character interaction that followed it. bimbos and teen non actors do not make for a real film, they make for a cheap flick, and alien 1-3 and the predator movies were good because they were produced above the concept (remember that the 1st alien is a "b" movie done as an "a" movie) the strause brothers really missed an opportunity, that could have been rectified by simply knowing their alien+predator roots: in both the alien and predator films we are introduced to characters that are part of a larger group (alien: refinery workers, aliens: marines, alien 3: convicts and in the predator films we generally follow a main hero part of a unit; predator, arnold--special forces, predator 2: danny glover, police) and it's easy to see where the filmmakers of both franchises started to go wrong: in alien ressurrection we have pirates...or something, avp we have...explorers?...with guns?? and of course in avp-r we have teen slasher clich'es. what is there to identify with here? in concept the idea of a convict returning to a small town and a war vet returning seemed a set up for a first blood type of action hero, but like many things it was never paid off.<br /><br />the film-making is equally devoid of rhyme of reason. there is no sense of forward momentum to the action, just small sequences that build the most minuscule levels of tension or interest only to cut away just when they're getting interesting...taking the audience out of the movie at every turn. the action scenes themselves, though much ballyhooed in the trailers, are so darkly lit, it is literally impossible to tell what is going on during the fight scenes when they finally occur. basically, the movie is hindered from many levels. bad actors combined with poor direction and an atrocious screenplay (which as a screenwriter myself i noticed, seemed to hit every wrong note and clich'e that only the most untalented writer devoid of ideas could have hashed together) the writing, if it can be called that, is not even direct to video quality, nor does it demonstrate a shred of respect for the established lore of the previous entries in the series. why does the predalien all the sudden have the ability to shoot alien embryos down a pregnant woman's throat to use her as an incubator for chestbursters? more than likely because the brain dead screenwriter needed a way to have more aliens for the predator to fight (and given the accelerated growth time even more so than the first avp: as quickly as possible. why must meaningless small talk between cardboard cutouts on sticks (meaning the supposed characters)substitute for real character development? (remember a character is defined by what they do, not say). why is the sheriff leading civilians to a cache of guns? (isn't he an officer of the law?) how does the bimbo of all people know where they are? why does the predalien wait for the predator to very slowly remove his mask before it attacks? why are the aliens still falling into that nasty series-post-alien 3 habit of hissing all the time to let their prey know to run? how on earth did this series devolve to a character saying "people are dying...we need guns!" (how this writer even works is beyond me, and reflects badly on fox's already destroyed artistic reputation. it's like everyone involved in the making of this film suffered from a mental impairment or really are that inept at every level of the film-making process. <br /><br />the effects are pretty lousy this time around. the aliens look like men in suits and adi is just getting lazy with their creature design. the aliens look like modified leftovers from alien resurrection, with that same bulky musculature around the arms as if they did not learn from that movie that it was not a good design, nor a good one to recycle. again, everything is shrouded in such a state of darkness not to create mystery or atmosphere, but simply to hide how bad the creatures look. and just like in avp, stan winston is sorely missed when the fake looking predator face is revealed.<br /><br />there are too many faults to list so i will just say this: do not waste your money on this movie. fox is beyond caring about the fans, as this cheap and trashy film is clearly evidence of. i felt bad having taken my girlfriend to see it (though it was free) and apologized to her profusely after. this is one die-hard fan who is done with the franchise.<br /><br />note to fox: what we really wanted wasn't a mindless slasher flick, it was a film adaptation of the original darkhorse comicbook, which was better than anything you've produced for this franchise post 1993.<br /><br />signing off.
