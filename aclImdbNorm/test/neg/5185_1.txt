what makes this movie so damn bad? is it the lame sub-par juvenile humor? could it be the horrid "trendy" suck ass music? perhaps the uninspired go nowhere story? or maybe even the fact that traci lords gives her worst acting performance ever and to add insult to injury keeps all her clothes on throughout the length of this steaming turd sandwich. regardless no matter what the reason this film sucks, the fact remains that it really really does. i have never wished i could be watching a movie with dean cameron in it instead of what i was watching in my life, but "ski school" is a masterpiece of comic genius compared to this travesty.<br /><br />my grade: f <br /><br />eye candy: nikol nesbitt, buffy tyler and suzanne stokes all unleash their tupperware tits<br /><br />where i saw it: starz on demand
