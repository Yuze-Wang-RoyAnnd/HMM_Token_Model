my summary refers to the fact that this film has 1479 votes--just 21 short of making it eligible to be on imdb's infamous bottom 100 list--the 100 lowest rated films on the website. with a paltry score of only 1.8, this would place the film at approximately between #38 and 46 on the list--talk about a very dubious achievement!! my score of 3 isn't that bad--but it does bring the film that much closer to the dreaded list.<br /><br />as for the film, it stars the once-cute aaron carter--yet another prepackaged and forgettable pop star of the 1990s. when he first broke onto the scene, he was a cute kid with some songs that appealed to pre-teens and tweeners on radio disney. his songs, look and image were all scrupulously groomed and created by marketing folks and did the trick--leading to some huge album sales. unfortunately, by 2005, sales were in decline and carter had hit his awkward stage of life--something all kids his age have to deal with eventually. to put it bluntly, he isn't cute any more in this film and is at a very tough stage of life. i assume now he's a gorgeous young man...but in "popstar" he's no longer the heart-throb he once was. here, he is just very normal...a death sentence for a kid in his position as a "pop sensation".<br /><br />interestingly, the film has some appearances by some other ex-teen heart-throbs from the last few decades--including a roles for david cassidy and leif garrett--two guys who also know what it's like to disappear from the limelight. cassidy managed to pick up the pieces and make a niche for himself, while garrett is a great example of a pop star whose life after stardom has been a bit of a joke. hopefully carter will take after cassidy in the future and so far, thankfully, he's managed to avoid the negative publicity and court appearances of many ex-pop idols. i was far from thrilled with the film but seriously wish him best in this department. it's not his fault he was plastered across the radio and television throughout the early to mid-1990s.<br /><br />in this film, carter doesn't exactly need to stretch himself--he plays a pop star. however, despite making millions and being adored by girls, he doesn't "have it all". he's quite dense--mostly because he has little interest in learning. the problem is so bad that his mother decides to no longer home school him--forcing him to go to public school. the problem, though, is that he is rather phobic about taking tests...and making the grade in school is difficult. so, he gets the idea of finding a smart girl to date--one who would naturally be obliged to help him out in school. he picks the cute but bookish jane (alana austin) and pretends to really like her in a sad attempt to make this scheme work.<br /><br />this plot, by the way, isn't bad and could work even though it seems a lot like an episode of a show like "the brady bunch" or a nickelodeon sit-com. sure, it's predictable and you know that the formula will mean that she will eventually learn his plot and be hurt and he will eventually realize that he actually does care for her and by the end of the film, all will be forgiven and they'll be a real couple. but, given good acting and competent direction, this could be worth seeing for his teen fans, as predictable isn't always bad. and, as it turned out, this isn't exactly where the plot went...but it was awfully close.<br /><br />there are a few good things i liked about the film. seeing tom bosley and stella stevens playing jane's grandparents was very nice--their role was quite sweet and it was good seeing them again. also, 1970s made for tv movie star andrew stevens appeared in the film--it was nice to see him again--though part of me hated him, as he looks so great after all these years and i look ever bit of my 45 years! he did a fine job and it was nice seeing him in the same film as his mother (stella).<br /><br />as for carter, with his many prior experiences on tv, he was, not surprisingly, pretty good. while his relationship with jane didn't seem very believable, he and ms. austin gave it their best. the film wasn't great, but they did try and i think most of the problems with the film were in the writing--with a better and less formulaic plot, it could have worked much better. plus the whole "testophobia" angle seemed pretty contrived...and rather insignificant. who cares if a mega-millionaire star gets anxious taking tests in school?! overall, not a rotten film as the current rating would imply, though there isn't much here to attract a wide audience. people who grew up loving carter probably will enjoy the film. older folks will probably care less as well as really young people who probably haven't heard of him. for them, there is no nostalgia value in the film.<br /><br />my favorite part of the film...leif garrett giving aaron advice. i felt like screaming "don't listen!!" but didn't!
