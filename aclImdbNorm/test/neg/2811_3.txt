i haven't seen any other films by antonioni and the people that saw this one with me agreed that it shares themes and imagery with the rest of his works. maybe if i had seen other stuff by him i would have enjoyed this one, knowing what to expect. <br /><br />i saw it as an almost complete failure for so many reasons. first of all, the film introduces interesting, deep issues about social relationships, feelings, the nature of reality versus fiction, but this is very often done in the clumsiest of ways making the characters speak as if they were delivering speeches, rambling on and on, juxtaposing declarations rather than having dialogues. the scriptwriters seem to be so worried that we will not get the point that they prefer to tell instead of showing.<br /><br />secondly, the movie has no rhythm, especially in its first half. it is not only that it is slow. some slow films have been made with an excellent sense of pace and rhythm (el sur by victor erice or scorsese's the age of innocence are examples i like), but for that to be successful it is necessary that we find the characters so engaging or the story so moving that we can adapt to it. this does not happen in beyond the clouds, where the first episode seems to drag endlessly, and the relationship between john malkovich's "reality" and the love stories "fiction" is at times fluid, others abrupt, others confusing.
