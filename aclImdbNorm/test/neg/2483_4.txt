this show had a promising start as sort of the opposite of 'oceans 11' but has developed into a shallow display of t & a. actually, according to my little brother thats the only good part of the show. <br /><br />the first season was by far the best, it was new and interesting things just went downhill after that. the only redeeming point of this show is jamescaan, the other actors are lack-luster. the characters lack depth and they seem to be incredibly selfish nd generally un-likable people. <br /><br />to quote a friend "las vegas is like baywaych in a casino" in my opinion thats way to generous, baywatch was way better, and much more realistic.
