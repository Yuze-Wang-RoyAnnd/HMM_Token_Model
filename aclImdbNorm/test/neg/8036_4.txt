this late-ish effort from freda plays as a modern day (70's that is) gothic thriller, but comes out short of thrills. certainly it's not a dreadfully bad film, it's jut got that feeling which many of freda's later films have of someone who has given up when he's seen the first daily's. it starts out good enough, almost giallo like in tone, then takes a turn into gothic territories with a decent (albeit terribly clich'e) set up. then suddenly freda seems to have lost interest in the film and all we get is prolonged shots of camille keaton and burning candles. then circa an hour into the film we get some sort of violent climax with decent-to-poor special effects. this is followed by a slow paced outro with a very obvious twist ending (if it's even intended to be a twist?). and throw a few very halfhearted explanatory scenes along the way and you got tragic ceremony. thus in parts it's got its qualities. but then suddenly stumbles and collapses in front of you. a pity.<br /><br />btw stay away from the sharoma dvd, a useless murky pan& scan edition which kills of what could be a good visual experience.
