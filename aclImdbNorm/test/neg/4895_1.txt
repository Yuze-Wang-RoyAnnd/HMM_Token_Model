how do you make a totally unappealing movie out of a story by one of america's most famous authors? watch this film and find out. maybe i am overrating author carson mccullers, but i was impressed by "the heart is a lonely hunter" and was hoping for something memorable here, too. forget it.<br /><br />vanessa redgrave looks like a man with her short haircut and clothing. i never found her much to get excited about in almost any movie, anyway. rod steiger as a preacher? how insulting is that? unlikable characters, one after the other. well, maybe that's the book, too, and i am being unfair to this film. i am not familiar with the story other than what i saw on screen and this was so unappealing a movie that i could never recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />it's just one backwards person after another in a backward town. outside of some nice cinematography here and there, there is nothing to recommend. how anyone could sit through 100 minutes of this is amazing.<br /><br />i didn't even go into how bad this is directed. there is good news: this was the only film simon cowell directed.
