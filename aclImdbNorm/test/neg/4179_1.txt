if you want to enjoy the money you would spend to rent this money, go buy a bag of ice and watch it melt. that's more entertaining than this movie. <br /><br />bill cowell, shame on you. <br /><br />or if you wanna see this movie plot, go in a corn field, bring two of the most annoying little girls you can find, run around for a couple hours having the girls scream as loud as possible. then send me the couple bucks you woulda spent.<br /><br />i enjoyed the first dark harvest, after watching the sequel, i'm going to cry myself to sleep.
