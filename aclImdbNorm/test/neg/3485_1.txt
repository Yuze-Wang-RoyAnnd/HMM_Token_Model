i was lucky enough to grow up surfing in san diego (not the biggest waves in the world but it was a hell of childhood, i'll tell you that) and i have seen a lot of so-called surfer flicks in my life. after watching north shore for the first time just now, all i can say is thank god i never saw this as a kid. if i had seen this and mistakenly thought that this was a realistic portrayal of the surf scene, i would sold my board and totally gotten into, i don't know, accounting or something.<br /><br />seriously, this movie has a as much in common with real surfing as top gun has was real military life. the acting is terrible, the music is worse, the cinematography is iffy at best and oh my god what was laird hanilton thinking?! wow!!! do not see this movie!!! it sucks!!! if you want a real surf flick, see riding giants. hell, watch surf's up instead of this. seriously. sucks. sucks bad. sucks real bad. brah. ;)<br /><br />ps: had to change my summery from "wtf?!" to wtf because, apparently, we are supposed to whisper on this site. no yelling!!! (shhhhhh!) ;d
