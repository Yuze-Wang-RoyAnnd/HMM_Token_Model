this piece of garbage belongs in the basement of some moldy old mansion where it will never see the light of day again. the only thing scary about this junk was the price of admission. i was only amused when the ending credits started rolling and i was free to vacate the auditorium. what an unmitigated bore; a complete waste of 1 and a half hours. when i die, i pray i can come back as a ghost and give a fever to the moron who penned this gibberish.
