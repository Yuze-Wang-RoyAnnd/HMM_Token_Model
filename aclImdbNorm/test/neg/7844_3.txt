burt reynolds plays gator mcklusky, a likable ex-convict just released from prison who helps the feds nab a corrupt small town sheriff. laid-back reynolds was often accused by critics of merely phoning these 'good ol' boy' performances in; true, he's on auto-pilot throughout. but in his day, reynolds knew just how to make a low-key effort work well for himself. ingratiating and handsome, reynolds comes as close to winking at the audience as he can without breaking up; he seems to know these backwoods as well as any movie star, while director joesph sargent provides an easy pace and a sweaty ambiance which brings the south alive. unfortunately, the story isn't much, and supporting actors ned beatty and bo hopkins overact (as usual). diane ladd is fine in a small part, and real-life daughter laura dern can be glimpsed in the background. reynolds returned to this character for 1976's "gator". *1/2 from ****
