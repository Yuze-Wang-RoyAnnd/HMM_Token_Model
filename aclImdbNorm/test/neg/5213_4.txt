this is an admirable attempt from first time filmmaker ham tran, offering little-glanced perspective dealing with vietnam war victims struggling for liberation, but plays out as a glorified history special. with clunky, self-consciously informative dialog and sub-par acting, even a relatively impressive budget with attention to detail will not spring to life this sagging, albeit historically worthy, melodrama. paying no mind to the often distracting disconnect with the actors to the reality of situations on screen, and you should be left with an informative, if somewhat impersonal educational lesson in vietnamese post-war history.
