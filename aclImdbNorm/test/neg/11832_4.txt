"the death of a performer at a broadway stage play brings a theatre critic and a police detective together as an unlikely crime-solving duo. the dead performer's niece becomes not only the object of affection for our critic, but also a prime suspect in this death, and some other murders that occur at the theatre. 'the phantom killer' sets his sights upon the young woman as his next victim; so, it is a race against time for our heroes to catch the killer," according to the dvd sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />milton raison's screenplay puts a little spark in this low-budget mystery whodunit. helpfully, dave o'brien (as anthony "tony" woolrich) does well in the lead role; his skills as an actor appear to be much greater than the productions employing him. o'brien and cab driving sidekick frank jenks (as egbert "romeo" egglehoffer) would have made a fine 1950s tv detective team. leading lady kay aldridge (as claudia moore) and the supporting cast are also good. unfortunately, the story becomes meandering, and anti-climactic.<br /><br />**** the phantom of 42nd street (5/2/45) albert herman ~ dave o'brien, kay aldridge, frank jenks
