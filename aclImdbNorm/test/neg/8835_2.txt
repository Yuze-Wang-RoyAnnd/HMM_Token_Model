i haven't any idea how commentators could regard this as a decent b western. or how one commentator said the plot was more cohesive than most. nothing could be farther from the truth! this movie is one huge non-sequitur! it is an affront to the noble b western films of the '30's. i have seen many of wayne's early lone star and republic westerns, and this one is easily the worst.<br /><br />the bad guy is known as the shadow - for crying out loud! initially, the shadow's scheme is holding up open-sided stage coaches. simultaneously, his gang rustles all of the cattle in the territory. then they decide to move on to bank robbery. to do this, they need to shoot up the town with a machine gun - no explanation of why that's necessary or how he got that neato little toy!<br /><br />no single scheme is revealed in enough detail to suggest a plot here. the shadow is obviously just a generally bad guy with all kinds of generally evil schemes. <br /><br />he imparts his instructions to his gang through a fake wall-safe. (knock-knock, who's there?) he is apparently clairvoyant, because whenever his henchmen need to talk to him, they knock on the wall, the safe opens and - presto - he's there. (i can just imagine that he has met them face-to-face and says,"i have some secret, nefarious instructions to give you about our next evil deed - meet me at the wall-safe and i'll give 'em to you.") just why the shadow requires the safe to communicate with his army of outlaws is, like most of the elements of this mess, never explained.<br /><br />he has a nifty tunnel to the ol' hollow stump across the street from which vantage point, various of his baddies perform assassinations. he also has a hidden panel not in his secret lair behind the fake safe, but out in the main room.<br /><br />when not behind the safe, he hangs out on his cow-less ranch, masquerading as rancher matlock. we learn that he has murdered the true owners of the ranch - two brothers - and assumed the identity of one. the daughter of the dead brother has recently arrived from 1930's nyc (judging by her wardrobe), and she apparently never met her real uncle, because he dupes her, too!<br /><br />if you thought that bad guys always wore black hats and good guys white hats, you need to see this movie. here, the good guys all ditch their hats in favor of white head-bands that make them look like they have all suffered head wounds before any shots have been fired! it's like a game of pick-up basketball - only wayne has them tying bandanas 'round their heads instead of just taking off their shirts.<br /><br />perhaps the weirdest of all is the ending. immediately after subduing the shadow and his gang, we jump far enough into the future to see wayne and his wife (the erst-while niece) on the front porch of their home. (never mind that there has been scant romance.) there, yak is playing with wayne's 3-4 year old son, dressed up in injun garb! (hiyoo, skookum fun!)<br /><br />no thanks to this nonsense, wayne went on to become a screen legend. only a super-star (packer or not!) could surmount this entry in a film resume. long live the duke!
