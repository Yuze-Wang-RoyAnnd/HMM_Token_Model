i wanted to like this film, and certainly there is room for a psychological character-driven movie which doesn't go for the cheap thrills. yet, for the enjoyment of a movie, one requires a believable plot, some pacing and editing, and a feeling of involvement. in the clearing, what starts out as an intriguing mystery, with a kidnapping and unknown motives, turns into a slow draggy pointless exercise. nothing much really happens, and the so-called character-driven angles (as expressed by the director in his commentary) really don't add up to much.<br /><br />fine actors are wasted here. robert redford does his best trying to engage and outwit willem dafoe. dafoe brings a bit of nuance to his character, insofar as one can feel somewhat sympathetic towards him. it's unfortunate that dafoe has been typecast as a villain, he's gone into the christopher walken hall of fame of typecasting.<br /><br />wendy crewson is usually good but her character's entry into the movie was brief and contrived, and i was wondering why they even bothered to introduce her character. by far the biggest waste of talent was helen mirren. in the director's commentary, all i heard was how fabulous a talent she is. i agree, she's a great actress. then why was she not used properly? only towards the climax of this movie does she get to show herself, but by then the viewer has quit caring.<br /><br />too bad, i liked parts of this movie, but as another reviewer wrote, once you're halfway in you know the film is not going to get much better.
