the movie is about a day in the life of a woman who is going insane. to show that she is mentally ill, she overacts a lot and the narrator tells us she's "going mad". along the way, she goes out with a fat guy who looks like he could be orson welles' brother and he later takes a header off a building in one of the only interesting moments in the movie.<br /><br />this is a strange little film that is very cheaply made--and it sure shows. the film was shot without sound (probably using 8mm or some other cheap type of film) and had some sound effects and an overbearing narration added later. in fact, the narration was the most obtrusive and unintentionally hilarious i have ever heard and it is said in such a silly and over-the-top manner you'd just have to hear it to believe it. as a result of these cost-cutting actions, it's not surprising that the film is bad, though the idea of trying to make this sort of film was pretty original. plus, it's very hard to make it through the entire film.
