i can barely find the words to describe how much this piece of trash offended me. why is it that american filmmakers always go out of there way to portray jamaicans as a bunch of backwards ass bush babies and worse yet, cast people to play jamaicans who sound utterly ridiculous when they try to imitate the accent? we are not all extremely dark, we do not all walk around carrying machetes whether for work or protection, we do not walk around naked in our homes and we do not practice voodoo!! we are doctors, lawyers, architects, businessmen and women, musicians, actors and filmmakers. i am sick and tired of watching all of these portrayals of jamaicans as a bunch of dreadlock wearing rastafarians who do nothing but sit around all day smoking weed on a beach or shooting guns in the air (when we're not living in our tree houses). yes, we wear clothes. yes, we have electricity. no, weed is not legal on the island and chances are we speak better english than you! the worst part is, this isn't just me being angry and bitter, these are actual answers to questions that most jamaicans who have traveled overseas have been asked at some point. read a book before you assume what's it's like in another country and worse yet, decide to make a movie about it.<br /><br />welcome to jamaica! the land where all we do is murder white people and beat our bongos drums...tales from the crypt has officially sickened me, along with the entire crew of people who worked on this garbage, especially the writer.
