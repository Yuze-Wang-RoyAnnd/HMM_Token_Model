ok, let's see... a handsome young stranger is new in town, and walks around on the local boardwalk. he meets a pretty girl, meets up with the obnoxious leader of the local hip young vampires club, is dared by them to follow them into this cave, gets into a conflict over the pretty girl, an epic fight ensues...<br /><br />no, it's not lost boys, although you'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference, since i think even some of the carnival music is the same. (do you have to pay royalties for sampling a movie?) even the ending of this stinkbomb is ripped off from lost boys. the make-up is below par, even for a low-budget thriller, the characters are one-dimensional, and just exactly how many "oh, i had this horrible experience" scenes of teen angst does one movie need? the humor is flat and stupid, and everything else is sadly predictable. yawn.<br /><br />the only scary thing about this turkey is the promise (threat) of a sequel, an idea that hopefully every distributor in the country will drive a stake through.
