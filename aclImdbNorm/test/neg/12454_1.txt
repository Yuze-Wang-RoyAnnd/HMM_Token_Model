this film has recently been televised by turner classic movies. it may have been considered racy in its time, and may have made money, but even the most die-hard jane russell fan will find it hard to sit through this dreck.<br /><br />there are many movie musicals from the 1950s which can withstand the test of time, even though dated by current standards, but which can still be enjoyed because of good music or dancing or an amusing plot. "the french line", however, fails at all of these aspects.<br /><br />it doesn't matter that russell was a fine singer when she is given lousy vocal material. the entire cast is dragged down by a boring, trite plot and dialogue.<br /><br />it's not even worth recording and skipping through to only the musical numbers--they're crummy.
