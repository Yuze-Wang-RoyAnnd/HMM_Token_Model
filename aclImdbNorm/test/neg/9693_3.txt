dramatic ? yes......historically accurate ? not quite !.... this movie twists the bibles details of the deluge by placing lot meeting noah during the building of the ark. fascinating time travel for lot made in part by nbc !....being lot had not been born until 2136 bce, 234 years after the floodwater's (2370bce)....thats like having george bush meet with william shakepeare ! and whats with this guy floating around selling items & nicknack's to noah ? <br /><br />you can make a movie based on historical facts dramatic, but don't twist it around placing people where they weren't....especially when it comes to gods word.
