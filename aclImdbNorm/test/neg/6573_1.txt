... once. "manos, the hands of fate." that was worse than this, quite a bit worse: but it did have one thing: it had beautiful women in negligees wresting each other -- for about 20 minutes. this has a fat 45 year-old with 3 tits and a tail, in a cantina scene cloned directly from "star wars." not to mention an obese, blue seductress uhura, her fat legs and ass hanging out of some sort of insane bird costume, in this method acting mess. she always wanted to perform before a "captive audience"? she must have meant the poor slobs who shelled out 8 bucks hoping to see another "wrath of khan," or at least a "voyage home." captive" is right. i wonder how many people in the theaters tried to slit their wrists while crying out: "mother, make it stop."<br /><br />no question about it, "final frontier" is not just an unmitigated disaster, it's cruel and unusual punishment. this is star trek from hell. this is shatner on mushrooms -- or maybe peyote. this is where no man has gone before and wished he never had in the first place. or, to paraphrase a review of "heaven's gate: "it's as if gene roddenberry sold his soul to the devil for the success of a tv series, and devil is just now coming around to collect."<br /><br />and don't even get me started on a drunken kirk and a grinning mccoy singing "row, row, row your boat" together, like they were lovers in some sort of demented gay fever dream. then we've got the hideous dynamic duo of sulu and chekov, hiking through the woods together... probably en route to a barry manilow concert. then there's laurence luckinbill as spock's brother???!!! yeah, right! amazing how these relations we never heard of suddenly crawl out of the woodwork when we need a new plot line. and not to forget spock rocketing through the air after kirk when he falls from a cliff in yosemite. sure. he catches up to kirk and saves him one foot away from the ground. where'd you get those nifty rocket shoes, spock?!
