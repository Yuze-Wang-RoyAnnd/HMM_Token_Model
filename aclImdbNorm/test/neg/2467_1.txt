this is by far and away the stupidest thing i have ever seen on celluloid. i mean, we started watching it assuming it was a "skinemax t&a flick", but aside from a couple boobs, that was it. i mean, i get the point of making stupid movies in order to show some sex scenes, as they are the sole reason for a movie of that kind to be made. this movie, however, has no sex scenes, and really has no point at all. there is no linear time, the scenes travel around like a fart in the wind, people show up for no reason, then leave, and it is never explained, the plot is never advanced, and nothing happens. i have never been as flabbergasted at how bad a movie was until i saw this. has the director even been to a film school? has he ever seen a movie? i don't know, but from the looks of it, he seems to have made some moron proud with this piece of crap, as he is still working. i literally walked away from this movie dumber, but i still recommend watching it, as it should be shown in every film school of the country as an example in what not to do when making a film. move over plan 9 from outer space, you have a new contender for worst movie ever made.
