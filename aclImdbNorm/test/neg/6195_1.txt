okay, i sensed that a film by mormons, about mormons, for mormons would be a disaster waiting to happen, but little did i know how so very painful it would be. a little known fact is that mormons have always made exceptionally fine propaganda films. the church's official cinematic campaign has produced rare and lasting gems that transcend the mormon community, including the wonderful short film "cipher in the snow" which ended up making the rounds as an educational film in the late 70's. then there's neil labute's disturbingly masterful ouvre....<br /><br />however, the success of these films depended largely on the fact that they didn't focus on mormons or any specific mormon theology. instead they opt to focus on a universal theme and deal with it on a basic human level. "god's army" abandons any pretext of universality and runs headlong into the stilted and myopic world of the orthodox. while this might be enough to alienate anyone but the most devoted mormon, director richard ductcher's ineptitude as a filmmaker and his juvenile approach to storytelling are sufficient grounds to judge "god's army" unwatchable by almost any standard.<br /><br />dutcher's own appallingly wooden acting sets the tone for his army of the least interesting mormons you're ever likely to meet. of course the cast's sorry performances aren't helped any by dutcher's pathetic script. he should be given credit for not avoiding some of the more controversial aspects of the church, but, as can be expected, he conveniently frames these controversies in a sympathetic light. it should also come as no surprise that most of the answers to the church's darker side are addressed with little other than faith. at one point an african-american missionary is scolded by a black couple for joining a church that was segregated up until 1978 (some ten to twenty years after nearly every congregation in the most degenerate parts of the deep south had already done so). instead of addressing the church's actively racist history, perhaps the sorest spot in mormon theology which even church leaders don't defend anymore, dutcher's troubled character instead ponders joseph smith's murder--an obvious and perhaps outrageous allusion to lynching. top off this syruppy milktoast with third grader leper jokes passing as comic relief and you have a strong case for the revival of silent films.<br /><br />if you knew little about mormons before watching this film, you might become prone to avoiding them at all costs. if you are mormon, this film offers absolutely nothing to be proud about.
