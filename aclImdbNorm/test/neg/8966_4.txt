**** spitfire (1934) john cromwell ~ katharine hepburn, ralph bellamy, robert young <br /><br />mountain hillbilly katharine hepburn (as trigger hicks) is a religious back-woods laundry woman. "going on 18", she begins to attract male attention, and responds by throwing rocks. the arrival of a dam-building construction crew triggers dreams of romance in ms. hepburn. she quickly attracts the attention of suave engineer robert young (as john stafford), who flirtingly hides his marital status. supervising engineer ralph bellamy (as george fleetwood) is also interested in hepburn, but for different reasons; mr. bellamy wants to know more about jesus christ, whom hepburn worships.<br /><br />after hepburn employs the power of prayer to heal a child, neighborhood folks suspect she is a witch.<br /><br />if it weren't so serious, "spitfire" might be more amusing; it is an atypical and wildly inappropriate vehicle for its star, who is thoroughly unconvincing. of the leads, mr. bellamy performs best. however, the best characterization is essayed by sarah haden (as etta dawson), who appeared in george cukor's stage version, along with louis mason (as bill grayson). will geer (as west fry), "grandpa walton" in the 1970s, has a small role. an unexpected ending helps.
