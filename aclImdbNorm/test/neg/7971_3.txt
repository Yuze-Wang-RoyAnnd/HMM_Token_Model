first i have to say that i have read everything about this subject and i know it inside out, and i was excited about finally seeing it, too. but you have to read only the book this mini-series is based on to realize that it's not the true story of what really happened almost 90 years ago. it's loosely based on the facts, the rest is taken from the scriptwriter's imagination. and unfortunately these changes are anything but successful and mostly totally unnecessary.<br /><br />where do i begin? vita and violet didn't use the names mitya and lushka until their affair started, and during it violet also called vita dmitri and julian. it was violet who chased vita with a dagger when they were teenagers. the 'seduction' scene when their affair started violet was much more passive than represented here and certainly didn't kiss vita first. i could go on and on, these examples were all included when the series was only just started. besides all these alterations from the facts, the characterizations are also all wrong. at times vita behaves like a mad woman. especially the scene where she saw from the newspaper violet's engagement announcement is just ridiculous. vita kept her surges of emotion inside. it was violet who was temperamental and let her feelings (good or bad) show. all vita did when she read it was that she nearly fainted, that's all. being a gentle nature, harold avoided confrontations in real life, but here he is sometimes pretty stern and accusing. harold and vita always discussed their intimate things in letters, not verbally. and violet... i know that this series purposely concentrated on vita and harold, but that doesn't mean that all the other characters have to be mere puppets on the sidelines. here she is totally one-dimensional character, and the lines gave to her are mostly embarrassingly shallow. actually she was intelligent, gifted, quite an extraordinary woman who has rarely given the credit she deserves. i have always thought her much more interesting person than vita. in this series her unhappiness, loneliness and her problems with her mother are totally ignored. viewer has also little clue of her background and family, what kind of relation (and marriage) with denys trefusis she had or how hard she battled over vita. vita was the only love of her life, her raison d'etre, and if harold suffered during affair, so did violet. after it her life was in ruins, and it took time that she could pull herself back together again. statue could have acted the role of denys, that much depth his character has. lady sackville-west is just a badly drawn caricature; an annoying chatterbox with exaggerating french accent. <br /><br />the series ends to the totally badly written scene in amiens, and that was the end of this affair, according to scriptwriter. no, it continued a whole year after that, and it's ending was much more lingering and sad than what was presented here. but what one cares about the stupid ending if the whole series has been stupid from the start. i have to give some credit to actors, they tried to make best of those roles given to them though janet mcteer as vita is the only one who really shines through. one can't complain the settings either. all complaints go to director and most of all, scriptwriter. instead of insightful character studies, there are too many sex scenes and bland conversation. many of the scenes are too long, some are pointless and don't bring anything to the story line. on the other hand many details are shortened or omitted altogether. especially there should have been more information about vita's and violet's youth, and how their friendship developed. this is one fascinating story which would have deserved a much better adaptation. maybe someday someone will do it. at the moment one can make much more of this story by reading the actual book or violet's letters to vita, which are brilliant stuff.
