whoa!terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, did i mention terrible?you can tell just by the dvd cover not to get this movie, but unfortunately that wasn't the case for me.well, someone brought this home for me to watch, and when i looked at it i just wanted to strangle the person, because they used my money.i will certainly be taking it back soon, but i might as well tell you about it while i have it in memory, for i definitely want to forget it.this movie doesn't deserve to even be called horrible.it's beyond horrible.quite possibly, the worst film ever.the acting was so, so, so, so horrifically disgusting, as well as the deaths being so entirely lame and predictable.i didn't even laugh at how bad this movie was, which kind of frightens me a little.don't see this film, shame on you if you're even looking at this movie page, and i have extreme pity for you if you're looking at this movie page, because you think this will be decent.final word: yuck!!!!!!!!!!
