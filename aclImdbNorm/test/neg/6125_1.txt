the french either make pro-marxist films or anti-marxist films - with a few in between. "merci pour le chocolat" is the latter of this genre. from the opening credits telling the viewer what music is going to be played and by whom it was who composed you know that you are going to be swathed in middle class pretension. it is an old man's film with an excess of 40's plus people. it is also directed by an old man along with an old crew who have nothing to say about life to the viewer. the plot is not only banal but preposterous. how many films reveal the plot through dialogue only to repeat the same message via flashback some five minutes later? maybe the director and actors had a low retentive capacity? in truth their is no tenable plot at all. it is riddle with holes like a good piece of french cheese.<br /><br />whether intentional or not, it is a film about the bourgeoisie. at least a third of the film focuses on the piano and the pretentious twaddle espoused in each scene. i concede it has some well framed shots though they couldn't have used a steady-cam in this film - it would have woke them all up! other than it being a nonsense story, the film allows the upper middle class to parade their values and vanity in a very comfortable swiss location. a telling line of the film is when rodolphe pauly tells anna mouglalis that she need not lock her car while in the resort! oh dear me.<br /><br />on the dvd, miss huppert makes a comment about shedding a false tear for a scene. smirking she says: "like they do in the american actor's studio!" i think miss huppert and the rest of the cast could learn well from the actor's studio.<br /><br />if there is one statement that stand out in my mind it is when huppert remarks 'we are having friends for the weekend and all the servants are away'. no doubt they had all escaped from the mind numbing set lest they be associated with such an appalling film.<br /><br />safety medical note. in the film they show a hot water scald being covered with ointment and a bandage. this should never be done. only cold water should be used.<br /><br />minus 10 marks.
