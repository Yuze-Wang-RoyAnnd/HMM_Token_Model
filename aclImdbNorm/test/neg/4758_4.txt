this frothy romantic comedy is based on the kind of story i loved as a teenager, but now find rather distasteful. in the case of may-september attachments, doubtless what is on the mind of the elder party is either lust, or an inability to face the reality of aging, or both. and the younger is most likely looking for the kind parent that she (or he) lacked as a child. these underlying agendas seem more pathetic than romantic to me now; there is also something rather predatory about them.<br /><br />dick powell looked a bit embarrassed--as well he should--at playing the elder lover in this silly story. he was, at fifty, attempting the role of a thirty-eight-year-old man romancing a teen-ager. but young debbie reynolds was a knockout--pretty and saucy and full of vinegar--as a misbehaving seventeen-year-old presented as a kind of "gift" to the morally upright and honest screenwriter, as a subject for him to study. her spirited performance wrung from me a better rating than this film would otherwise deserve. anne francis was cast as powell's beautiful, but brittle fianc'ee, and handled her small role deftly.<br /><br />some of the dialogue was quite amusing, too, so it's not a total washout.<br /><br />5/10
