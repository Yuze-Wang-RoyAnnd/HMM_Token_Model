this movie was utterly and unequivocally terrible. the plot was so predictable and boring and the script so corny and pretentious that by the end i wanted to stab my eyes with the nearest pen.<br /><br />normally i don't write reviews, but i was astonished by the number of positive reviews it got. while i admit that the acting was okay at some parts, the script's deficiencies more than outweighed the decent acting. the only reason i watched this was because a few of my friends were watching it, introducing it as most likely the worst movie ever made, judging by the trailer. we were not disappointed in the least. its only saving grace is that it contained my new favorite pickup line:<br /><br />brandon: i just want to get to know you.<br /><br />girl: you just want to get into my pants.<br /><br />brandon: i want to get into your mind, your heart, your soul. i don't see you wearing any pants in this equation.<br /><br />overall, i would rate this movie as the worst movie i ever saw that took itself seriously.
