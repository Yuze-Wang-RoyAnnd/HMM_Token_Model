now don't get me wrong, i love a good film and after watching the thin red line (and loving it) i was eager to track down terrence malicks two earlier films, and, having just watched days of heaven, my enthusiasm to see badlands has virtually disappeared.<br /><br />i have noted much rave about the beautiful photography, but i saw this film on a terribly old vhs tape which made it look pretty awful. all i can say is i hope the photography was superb, because it would have been one of the only things of interest in this film. not since the replacement killers have i fallen asleep during a film. this film felt so long (and it wasn't!), the editing was choppy and disjointed, the storyline non-existent, the voice over was an incoherent ramble, the characters weakly developed, and the whole thing was uninvolving. i know that malick was uncertain of how to do the film. he consequently shot a heck of a lot of footage then spent around two years editing in an attempt to piece it all together. this is very apparent on screen. everything looks chopped up, every time a scene seemed to gain some momentum (or some character development) it would obtrusively cut to boring scenes of people doing boring things. it was as if someone had tried to cut together a story out of stock footage of people farming. the few good points are the music and the chase scene near the end, but those things are no where near enough to maintain interest. i would normally let a bad film pass by without being too vocal but when it is so highly over-rated something must be said.<br /><br />maybe a farmer would like it...?
