let me tell you a story.<br /><br />one day on the streets of athens a film director bumped into a male prostitute and decided that the world just had to know his story because...you know... he's deprived...and he takes his shirt off a lot and...so on.<br /><br />this film is the result of his revelation. repulsive, depraved, homophobic, misogynist...but of course filled with pretty guys with their chests showing. if this is your idea of a good film then enjoy, if not avoid it like the plague.<br /><br />it's put me off ever going to greece that's for sure.
