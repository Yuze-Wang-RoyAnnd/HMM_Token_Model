up at the villa (2000) **1/2<br /><br />warning: you may find some spoilers ahead<br /><br />it's hard to know what is the point in up at the villa, a gorgeous but shallow period piece, one of those made with the only objective of earning oscar nominations for best costume design and art-set direction (one for cinematography and another for score are also welcome). it has the same basic idea of thousands of period pieces produced every year: a good-looking, intelligent woman trying to find love in a strange place to her. she has many difficulties but ultimately finds her happiness in the arms of a man that is not the one that she had an accomplishment with. in this case, our lady is in florence, some time before world war ii. she is an english widow engaged to a rich-but-old man (whom, obviously, she doesn't love). one day she meets another man, who has not a good reputation but for whom she falls in love. of course there is her friend who will help her for better or worse and a third man- who commits suicide here, in the lady's room, setting up a risky situation for her. guess how the story ends...?<br /><br />up at the villa is not a bad film. i was always quite interested in the story, but never got excited. the problem is not the slow pacing, but the screenplay. adapted from a novel, it needs something more spicy, exciting, twists and suspense. every time you think the story will get warm, it gets cooler again. if you think there is a conspiracy involving the mean police chief of florence, well, there is, but it doesn't change almost anything in the story. it just keeps going and going, till the predictable ending.<br /><br />as i said, up at the villa is not bad. if it is a bit bland, it never gets sappy and too sentimental. the acting is half and half, but surely convinces. kristin scott thomas made some really bad choices after the english patient (the saaaaaaappy romantic drama the horse whisperer and the dull/irritating random hearts). up at the villa is undoubtly better than those pieces and kristin is also better, but she can do more than that. sean penn is good as always, even if his character is a big dude. anne bancroft is a terrific actress (the graduate, my god!), and here she doesn't let her character become ridiculous. now, the supporting actors are pretty bad (jeremy davies is sooooooooooo irritating!).<br /><br />the directing is good, but not audacious. it was interesting to know that the director is the same of angels and insects (also starring kristin scott thomas), another so-so period drama, but more audacious than this. what matters here are the visuals. florence is wonderful, the costumes are great, the scenery, the music...<br /><br />in the end, up at the villa is an average romantic drama, but of course it could have been much better. it is watchable and interesting, but don't expect a suspense film- it is not! this film kind of fails because it wants to have some mystery, something to behold... however, there is not much to say mainly because of the shallow screenplay. now, about the oscar nominations, don't worry- it will probably get them.
