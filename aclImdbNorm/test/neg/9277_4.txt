the problem this film has is the same problem the tv series had and that`s the laddish stan and jack . there`s nothing wrong with laddish characters but stan and jack are played by actors who seem to be in their late 40s/ early 50s ! and there`s something objectionable - not to mention crediblity defying - as they cop off with girls young enough to be their daughters<br /><br />as for the rest of holiday on the buses , i found it instantly forgettable . it`s basically a 30 minute episode spun out to 90 minutes with having all the action take place at a holiday camp instead of a bus station<br /><br />amazingly almost a third of voters on this site have given it a 10 ! come on guys , this film doesn`t deserve more than a 5
