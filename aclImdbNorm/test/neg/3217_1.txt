it's amazing that this no talent actor chapa got all these well known stars to appear in this dismal, pathetic, cheesy and overlong film about a low life gangster who looks white but is half mexican, much of the acting is bad and many of the well known stars in this trashy movie are given a script that seems made up by a 16 year old, i'm sure this movie is the career low point for actors such as dunaway, wagner, keach, tilly and busey who i'm sure are very embarrassed that they ever appeared in this turkey of a film. i doubt many people have ever heard of chapa and after this terrible movie i'm sure he will disappear into oblivion where he belongs.
