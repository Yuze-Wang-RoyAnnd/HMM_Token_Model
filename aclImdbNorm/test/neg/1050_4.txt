this really is a film of two halves. the first detailing the lives and friendship of two boys (one a privileged pashtun and the other a down-trodden hazara) in late 70s afghanistan before the invasion by the ussr works extremely well. the young actors turn in convincing performances and seeing afghanistan as it once was throws the present situation there into stark relief.<br /><br />the real problem comes when we move into the later phase of the story where we join the pashtun as a man living in america. ancient debts to his young friend lead him to return to his homeland and it is really at this point that things break down. the central adult character is clearly supposed to be sympathetic, but in fact comes across as wimpish and wallowing in self pity. it is hard to really care for him and one cannot help but feel that the really interesting story is the one we do not get to see - that of his boyhood friend.<br /><br />once he returns to afghanistan the narrative becomes bogged down in a series of highly contrived coincidences. most remarkably he manages to come across his childhood enemy after all these years almost immediately (even though he is not looking for him), despite the chaos that has since consumed the country. this enables him to confront past demons in a way that is simply too convenient to be credible. the resolution of the narrative is also run through with an awful, mawkish sentimentality which undermines any really serious points the film may be trying to make.<br /><br />although it is possible to start seeing characters and the abuses of their lives as symbols of a state which has been torn apart by world politics it is hard to really see this as a film which engages with any wider political discussion. instead the narrative becomes reduced to one character's emotional journey of self discovery and healing. unfortunately this character is so dull and wrapped up in himself that it is hard to really become engaged in his story, while opportunities to make a really interesting film about afghanistan itself are wasted.
