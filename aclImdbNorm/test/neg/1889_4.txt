i've been a classic horror fan my entire life. many nights stretched until the early hours of the morning watching the universal films on "horror incorporated" and "creature feature night". sadly, i viewed this film in the early evening and yet it still almost put me to sleep.<br /><br />i don't think i've ever seen a "horror" picture where everything was so matter of fact. dr. edelmann doesn't seem to believe in the supernatural, yet before long he's medically treating dracula and watching larry talbot change into the wolfman while hardly blinking an eye. he and talbot discover the frankenstein monster like it's an everyday occurrence. edelmann is all fired up to bring the monster back to life, but after talbot, miliza and nina protest he's like "aww, you're right. no big deal". after realizing dracula's treachery, he opens the count's coffin to sunlight and poof!, he's gone, just like that.<br /><br />the only person who didn't appear to just be phoning in her lines was jane adams as nina. her reward is getting bounced off the hump in her back into a pit by the frankenstein monster at the end of the film...and no one even tries to rescue her! she, dr. edelmann and the monster all perish, while talbot and miliza casually leave the castle.<br /><br />definitely the low point for universal during it's classic horror years.
