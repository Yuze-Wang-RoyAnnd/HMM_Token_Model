caddyshack ii is one of those pictures which makes you ask 'why?' as in; 'why was it funded?': 'why was it made?' and 'why was it released into the public domain?'.<br /><br />to say the least it's a bad film. it serves little purpose but to underline how superior its prequel was by setting an almost identical set of characters against each other in a similar storyline as a 'new money' land developer attempts to buy out the establishment's golf course sanctuary. <br /><br />right off the bat making the follow-up a whole 8 years after the original is somewhat bizarre. i mean if your going to cash in on highly successful picture such as the first one then you have a window of a few years to do so. but leaving it 8 years means that the formula is hardly fresh enough to simply do a follow up, or poor imitation as this is, so your sort of obliged to reward fans of the original by giving them at least reference to if not indeed actual contributions by the actors who made the first one so memorable. but there's little if any of this.<br /><br />instead we get cheap imitations. okay the passing of ted knight in the interim years would have made it impossible to bring back the memorable judge smails but robert stack's inclusion as 'chandler young' (a fellow wasp elitist akin to the smails character) is unimaginative and seriously lacking in the sort of anarchic frustration that made knight's turn so watchable. jackie mason's 'jack hartounian' is a feeble attempt at recreating the non stop wisecracks delivered by the al czervik (rodney dangerfield) character of the first. while dangerfield's role was endlessly quotable mason's is completely forgettable. <br /><br />bill murray's laughably ridiculous groundskeeper 'carl spackler' and his war of attrition with the pesky local gofer is substituted for his ghostbuster's co-star dan ackroyd's role as the militant 'capt. tom everett' who's high pitched voice just splits your sides with frustration as opposed to the intended laughter.<br /><br />randy quaid , brilliant as cousin ed in the national lampoon's vacation series, is quite the opposite here playing hartounian's unstable lawyer. the looks of disbelief shown by the actor's looking on at quaid's character's intended to be hilarious acts of inappropriate violence echo that of the audience. your not laughing. your just asking 'what the hell is he doing?'<br /><br />chevy chase shows up, all be it occasionally and wisely rather fleetingly considering the disaster that's perpetrating itself around him,as club pro 'tye webb' in the films only direct reference to the original not withstanding the golf course itself that is. with his deeply tanned skin and loud hawaiian shirts chase looks like he's just got back from a lengthy summer vacation and needs a paycheck. he distances himself from the events in the actual picture enough that he takes little of the blame and leaves with some, all be it little, credibility still intact. <br /><br />jessica lundy as mason's daughter 'kate' takes over from the 'danny noonan' role of the original as teenager struggling against class divides. sounds ridiculous doesn't it? at least in the first danny (an irish catholic from a blue collar family) and his laughable attempts to make inroads into the white-anglo-saxon-protestant dominated world of the golf club mover and shakers was played out to some memorable set pieces such as being dismissed by the resident lutheran bishop as well as being mocked by the offspring of the local yacht club. lundy's embarrassment of her father's inability to fit-in is hinted at being because of his jewish roots. that aside it may also have to do with him being a classless moron but such intricacy's are swept aside though i stopped caring long before they were resolved. at the end of the day noonan was trying to get ahead in life. miss hartounian's biggest problem is getting the hob nobbers at the local golf club to like her multi-millionaire father so that she can get a date with the club's prodigal white kid. or so i gathered. <br /><br />anyway in summation its poorly written, badly scripted with lame set pieces and wastes a lot of talent. indeed kudos if you were able to sit through it to it's conclusion. it really is a penance. there is that question mark though of why did so many of the original actors not return as opposed to being replaced by performers who on paper at least looked their equals. maybe they just weren't asked. or perhaps i suspect they actually read the script. stick to the original!!!
