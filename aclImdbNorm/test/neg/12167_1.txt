i really hated this movie and it's the first movie written by stephen king that i didn't finish. i was truly disappointed, it was the worst crap i've ever seen. what were you thinking making three hours out of it? it may have a quite good story, but actors? no. suspense? no. romance? no. horror? no. it didn't have anything.<br /><br />it's got this strange, crazy science man with einstein-hair, the classic thing. not real at all. and a man keep getting younger all the time. it seems like they just used the name of stephen king to make a crappy, too long movie with nothing exciting at all.<br /><br />i give this movie "1 (awful)". if they had like -5, i would probably take that instead. it was a total waste of time.
