this film doesn't know what it wants to be: is it making fun of action movies in general? is it satirical? is it supposed to be a black comedy? this is truly one of the worst films ever made.<br /><br />lori petty is annoying. there, i said what everyone else is thinking. it's bad enough that she's such a terrible actress (route 666, bates motel), but she doesn't even qualify as a mediocre b-movie actress. her screechy voice, strange mannerisms, and poor comic timing dot this film from start to finish, until you just want to put your head in a vise and end the pain.<br /><br />do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs. you'll be glad you did.
