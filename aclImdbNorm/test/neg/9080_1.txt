this is one of the few movies - maybe the only - that truly haunted me for years. it was the first i had ever seen people tortured, so much that blood was flowing of their mouths from gritting their teeth and screaming, etc. it was brutal; the worst thing i had ever seen on film.<br /><br />dr. clement molloch, played by joseph mayer, is still one of the most evil characters i've ever seen on film, and i've viewed thousands. he was so sadistic that i would never watch this movie again, nor would i recommend it. he makes hannibal lecter look like mr. rogers. if seeing people tortured is not your idea of fun, then stay away from this film.<br /><br />i know there are a lot of sick people out there, many of them professional film critics, who probably enjoyed this sordid, sick story. it's a "b" movie, anyway, with stupid dialog and some wooden acting by charles bronson. this is not one of his better efforts. even if it was, there so many horrendous scenes in here you wouldn't want to watch. trust me on this one.
