this film was really terrible.<br /><br />however , it's worth seeing , as it features the worlds most unnecessarily extended sex scene ever. i mean , this thing went on for about 7 - 8 minutes (repeating the same 'moves' over and over), thats almost 10 % of the whole film! i haven't laughed as hard as i laughed at that for a long time.<br /><br />there were some seriously strange and pointless goings on in this film, but the one that i found funniest was when (for no reason whatsoever) a helicopter lands and 5 or 6 guys in orange suits run in to the complex near the end. 2 minutes later they run out again. what the hell was that for?? also , the tiny white forklift that magically changed into a huge yellow digger was pretty classic. i'm led to beleive that this is because they used footage from the 'carnosaur' trilogy to patch up this absolute donkey. i'm gonna have to see those now!<br /><br />the film is worth watching for a laugh or two , but if you dont find bad movies funny, stay away!
