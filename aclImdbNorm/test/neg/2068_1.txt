as the film reviewer for a local gay magazine i automatically get sent any dreck if it happens to have a homo in it. chicken tikka masala is churning on in the background as i write this. i gave it my undivided attention for 53 minutes before i found myself involuntarily shouting - like a tourrette's sufferer -"this is the sh**test film i have ever seen". we're just coming to the emotional climax where the son is giving some coming out speech to his father at his wedding. father seems to be taking it quite well. an attempted honour killing at this point would at least have livened the film up a bit. and made it funnier. <br /><br />i didn't particularly like beautiful thing, for example, but could at least see why other people did. it was made with some professionalism and i seem to remember it had at least a couple of good lines. the lack of wit in this film is quite astounding - even the most mediocre sitcom will tend to have recognisable jokes. the nearest this movie got to being funny (at least in its first 53 mins) was the subtitled comment delivered to the fat unattractive female lead "look at her with her legs wide open - she's like the mersey tunnel." completely witless and i didn't crack a smile but i could imagine someone with a low iq (who perhaps works in a chip shop) enjoying it.<br /><br />i'd imagine it's some lottery-funded atrocity. if not i can at least console myself with the fact that the backers will lose a substantial amount of money as even a low-budget british film will still set someone back a couple of million. seriously, if i met the most handsome bloke in the world and, on going back to his place to make sweet love, i found a copy of this in his dvd collection ("man, i love this film") i'd probably kick him in the nuts and leave forthwith. and this from someone who's gone about six months without any of the aforementioned sweet love. <br /><br />oh lord i hate this film.
