dear friends, i've never seen such a trash movie as night of the demons (1988). it seems that the director kevin tenney had the intention to copy classics like the evil dead by sam raimi (1978) or george a. romero's return of the living dead from the same year. the cinematography was lousy, the movie was very dark, so i had to turn the brightness control to the maximum. indeed, horror pictures have to be dark, but not the way like night of the demons. the entire movie was ridiculous, no suspense, worse actors except alvin alexis in the role of rodger, and horrible make-up effects. an average vote of 5 stars for that movie? i can't believe this. perhaps the users were pleased about the tits, asses and pussies of the actresses, they were indeed worth 5 stars. regards, hans-dieter
