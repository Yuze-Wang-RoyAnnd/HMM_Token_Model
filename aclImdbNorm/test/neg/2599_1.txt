family guy is easily one of the worst shows i've ever forced myself to watch (not at the bottom, though - i've seen the jersey shore). a popular hit with high school and college kids who mistake immaturity for edginess, this show is unoriginal and stale.<br /><br />as this has been dubbed a comedy show, let's take a look at its "humor." 1. random flashbacks/cuts to celebrities or movies or politics or anything that can be cut to for a knee-jerk laugh. it got old after the 5 or so repetitions per episode. simple solution: every time you hear "this is worse than/like the time...", plug your ears.<br /><br />2. inappropriateness for its own sake. this show is notorious for inserting inappropriate gags that have little to do with the overall plot. solution: watch south park. they did it right.<br /><br />the bottom line is that family guy is not worth your time, and doesn't hold a candle to the simpsons.
