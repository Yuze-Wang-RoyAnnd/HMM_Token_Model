do not be misled. this is not a zombie movie. take it from a guy who loves zombie movies, and who rents them all: the good, and the horrendous. yes, this movie has an extended zombie sequence, but it's basically an artsy-fartsy exercise in existentialist dread, which is a long way of saying it's boring. if you've worked hard all day and want to spend a couple of hours being entertained, rent something else.<br /><br />"rise of the undead" has cheap special effects, mediocre acting, and crummy dialogue. all of that is understandable in an indie, low-budget film, and i can forgive such flaws as long as a movie has an entertaining story to tell. unfortunately, "rise of the undead" hardly has any story at all. moreover, the acting is not laughably bad so much as non-existent. all of the actors seem to have studied at the buster keaton school of wooden faces. would it have killed them to show some emotion? (and no, yelling does not equate with emoting). the one character who actually had some pizazz was killed off first. granted, there was another character who briefly held my interest. he looked and acted like kyle mclachlan channeling norman bates, but it was too little, too late.<br /><br />the filmmakers seemed to have forgotten a tiny detail: film is a visual medium. that means lighting your scenes well enough for the viewer to actually view what's going on. and all those artsy jump cuts and close ups might have seemed cool at the time, but all they did was make watching the film jarring and confusing. there is nothing wrong with telling a story in a simple, clear fashion -- just look at george romero's low-budget "night of the living dead" to see how it's done superbly. and i know these folks had a small budget, but if you can't hire the equipment and technicians necessary to actually make the dialogue audible, then just go ahead and make a silent movie (then those buster keaton wooden faces might actually work).<br /><br />i will say this for the film: the zombies were creepy. unlike most zombie movies where the undead are shown in all their decomposing glory, the grosser the better, the zombies here were just shuffling, bloody-faced people. it actually worked to make them more like us, and therefore, scarier. that's the reason i gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1.<br /><br />the sad part about all this is that despite all of its flaws, "rise of the undead" does not insult your intelligence. the filmmakers seemed to have actually wanted to make a smart, scary, original movie, and it's a shame that they failed so miserably. if they could just forego the too-fancy editing, buy a few extra lightbulbs, crank up the dialogue, and come up with a real story that actually goes somewhere, then i think they have the talent to make something really good.<br /><br />trust me: do not waste your time on "rise of the undead."
