i don't know about the real cobb but i got the distinct impression that the filmmakers' aim was to try to soften his jagged edges and reputation, not give us a true portrait of the man himself. in the movie, besides a few racist remarks, he's shown to be just another hard-nosed, cantakerous old coot (he's so full of life!) with a heart of gold(more or less). this is also the worst acting i've seen t.l.jones do(he brings nothing new or subtle to his stereotyped character). he just doesn't flesh out cobb in a way that pulls me into the movie. not for one minute did i forget that it was tommy lee jones on the screen pretending to be ty cobb. robert wuhl didnt impress either. the "comedic" elements in this movie were just distracting and didnt ring true at all. a bloody waste of time, it is
