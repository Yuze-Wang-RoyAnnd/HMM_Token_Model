well to start off i was like, wow this is new, so when is the film starting, and out of this in between stuff. but it never ended. the film is just one big in between! and after 10 minutes of waiting for something to actually happen, apart from water splashing around, i just started getting angry! there is nothing in this documentry and nothing will be learned. completely boring and rubbish!
