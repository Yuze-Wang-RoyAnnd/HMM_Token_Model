i understood before watching this film that it would be a low budget gore film. but even by those low standards this film doesn't cut it. <br /><br />the problem isn't so much that the filmmakers had a low budget or had bad acting, writing, directing, sound, music and editing. i expected all of that to be bad, and it is.<br /><br />the biggest problem with this film is that it didn't even do a good job on the guts and gore. most of the 'action' takes place off screen and all we get to see are the after effects, which look very fake -- even by the standards of low budget gore films. <br /><br />there really is no excuse for the gore being so poorly done. peter jackson made the equally low budget 'bad taste' at about the same time and he somehow was able to make much more convincing guts and gore than was shown in this film.<br /><br />a failure on just about every level, i can't recommend this film to anybody. steer clear of it.<br /><br /> <br /><br />
