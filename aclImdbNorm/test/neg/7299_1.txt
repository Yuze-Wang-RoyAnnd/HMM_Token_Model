my house mate and i foolishly purchased the video of 'the roller blade seven' from our local second hand video shop in the hope of finding a bad film to laugh at. this film isn't even laughable, it's pathetically poor, worse even than jack frost 2-and that's saying something. the script, acting, production, stunts, sound, sets, everything is absolutely terrible. in some parts the actors haven't even learned their lines and are blatantly ad-libbing or in one case actually having the lines read to them off set and simply repeating them. set in the post apocalyptic 'wheel zone',the film obviously consists of about 45 minutes of film, many parts of which are edited badly or repeated ad nauseum from various different camera angles to make the film longer. this gets tedious very quickly. the plot makes no sense whatsoever (it is apparently an amalgam of two books written by scott shaw), there aren't even seven of them, most of them aren't on blades, they're wearing roller boots, and it seems to me that mostly the film has been completely sold on the fact that there's about 3 minutes of female semi-nudity in it. the writer and star scott shaw obviously fancies himself somewhat of a samurai and throughout the film performs some very poor stunts and made up sword fighting moves that look massively amateurish. despite all this, his website states that the film should never be compared to a traditional film because it really pushes the boundaries of modern film making. my house mate and i were left speechless by the whole ordeal, and despite my frequent attempts to burn the videotape, she has decided it may be some kind of ring-esquire video curse that needs to be passed on. if you see the video in stores, take it from me! leave well alone!
