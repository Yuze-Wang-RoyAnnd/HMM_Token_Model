i have nothing at all against paul schrader. in fact, hardcore (1979) is one of my very favorite films. but some horror movie fans were in a premature uproar when his original version of the exorcist prequel (dominion; this one you're reading about right now, as it turns out) was scrapped by warners, and when renny harlin was substituted to spruce things up and make a new version that was "more scary". in my opinion, some viewers were prejudiced and became automatically juiced up for hating renny harlin's take on the subject (exorcist: the beginning) before the first frame of film was ever even unspooled for them to judge. and i ought to know; because i myself went into the theatrical premiere of beginning with stubborn arms folded, and prepared for the absolute worst, which i was sure had to come. imagine my surprise when i found harlin's beginning to be much more serious than i ever could have conceived, with a good performance from stellan skarsgard as a young version of father merrin, who was struggling with his faith in god. it wasn't a great film by any means, but it was nowhere near the garbage i had prepared myself for, well in advance, sight unseen.<br /><br />well, now i finally have seen the true garbage version - and it's paul schrader's dominion: prequel to the exorcist. it was relentlessly talky, uninteresting, and insipid. stellan skarsgard's troubled priest was nowhere near as interesting as he had been for me in harlin's film, and the actor himself not as good in the part. for all those who pointed out the obvious cgi effects in beginning, guess what? they're here in dominion as well. remember the silly ending in harlin's rendition (which i'll also agree tainted the rest of that movie)? well, you're going to find that this ending from schrader isn't a hell of a lot less lame.<br /><br />let me also say that i resent the nonsense that's been presented by those who appreciate this film better than harlin's, by saying that we're "retards" or "cannot appreciate subtle film-making". as a person who despises stephen sommers' mtv-fashioned mummy of '99, and being a true fan of the very suggestive and discreet old horror films of the '30s and '40s, i can assure you this is not the case with me. at least there was "some" degree of terror and exorcist-type goings on in harlin's beginning; this one here is just a real exercise in tedium and a great challenge even for the most certified of insomniacs. it's going to be quite interesting to hear horror fans try to convince themselves that dominion: prequel to the exorcist was as good as they'd already made their minds up for it to be in advance; just as they were already pre-disposed to lambasting harlin's beginning the second they learned paul schrader's name was getting soaked with the white-out.
