and you know why? because they thought (or at least made horror fans think) that a bunch of obnoxious, foul-mouthed, screaming teenagers, some stupid demons (where do they come from? what is their purpose? who knows?) and a dark mansion are all you need to make a horror movie. needless to say, they were wrong. you also need a script, some logic, some rules, and some invention. this flick does have one scene that lives up to its reputation (the lipstick scene, of course), and a couple of funny moments (the kid brother's description of his mother's cookies, linnea quigley's "don't look at me" scene). it also has more profanity than any movie i've watched since i last saw "reservoir dogs". literally every fourth or fifth word is a "f***" or a "b****". then again, when a movie begins with four false scares in its first 5 minutes, you know not to expect anything resembling good filmmaking.
