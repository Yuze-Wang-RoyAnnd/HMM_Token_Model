when i saw the first octopus movie it was a laugh see the cheesy acting and appalling effects. this film seemed to make up for the acting, but not the special effects. after jaws and piranha, sure, why not make a film about a killer octopus? the octopus invades the new york waters, where 2 police investigators try stopping the rampaging beast before the 4th of july.<br /><br />a pretty clean plot and descent happenings but the octopus was pretty much appalling, its nice to see they actually made it this time but it looked like a piece of plastic... better on a big budget really, this film could have been a good watch. there's a continuous amount of errors where it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't research the way octopus live...<br /><br />watch this if you like cheap dvd sequels, otherwise your better watching jaws.
