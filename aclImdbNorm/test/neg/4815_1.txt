addle-brained stupidity that the cartoon "bullwinkle" made fun of a quarter-century beforehand, no dead heroes proves that you can rip off a good movie (the manchurian candidate) without copying a single sliver of quality from the object of your plunder. the acting barely registers on the cable-access tv scale, the plot is less nuanced than an old "sgt. rock" comic, and only boris j. badanov-style "bad guy" mustaches are missing from the commies. this movie achieves the unusual feat of being too bad, too stupid to be enjoyed by anyone with opposable thumbs.
