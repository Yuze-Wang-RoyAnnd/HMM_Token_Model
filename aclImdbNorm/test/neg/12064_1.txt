i am a fan of slasher movies, especially of scream 1-3, but this one is just one killing after another. to my astonishment: part ii is far better and you get the whole story of part one summarized! so don't waste time on this one and move right on to part ii, you won't regret it cause part 2 actually has a plot and is quite self-ironical. first part: 1 out of 10 second part: 4 out of 10
