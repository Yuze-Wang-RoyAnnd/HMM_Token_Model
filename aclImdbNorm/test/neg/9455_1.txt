bought for lb1, project vampire is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. wooden acting,lame effects and a terrible storyline all add up to be a movie you have no reason to even want to see. pv is one of those movies that don't even have the good grace to be bad in an enjoyable way, instead this bile seems to try to make itself as offensively dull,stupid and crap as humanly possible.<br /><br />a vampire has created a serum he sells to old people as a life-enhancer, and those who take it fall under his control. a former lab intern teams up with a nurse to try and stop him. someone should have stopped the makers of this rubbish.<br /><br />no one has any reason to see this movie, and i am actually appalled at the human race on the grounds that at time of writing 2 people have given this atrocity 10 out of 10.
