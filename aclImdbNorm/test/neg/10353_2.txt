i watched the first episode and i found it to be a very wooden performance.<br /><br />i have watched the original from it's early days on big girls blouse to the last series on channel seven. kath and kim was a great mocumentary and it's humor is something that most people get.<br /><br />however in this american version i found it to be dull, molly shannon is to fashionable to be kath day, kath's wardrobe is supposed to be stuck in the 80s with her frizzy perm. while selma blair's figure hugging clothes isn't as good as what the original kimmy wore. i also found that selma seemed to be puffing her belly out a lot, she is obviously a (australian) size 12 where kim should be (australian) a size 16/18.<br /><br />the exchanges from molly and selma is obviously so scripted and there is pauses where there shouldn't be pauses or the pauses are a bit long, as someone suggested there could be a laughter track in there during those pauses. it's like molly and shannon are not used to each other, there is no mother/daughter chemistry.<br /><br />phil was okay he had the eccentric air around him like kel. however craig was to handsome and not the sweet plain humble brett from the aussie version.<br /><br />i found watching this was like watching a very bad stage play. the acting was pretty much wooden and the exaggeration of selma's expressions wore the funny off after ten minutes. especially her sulking scenes.<br /><br />to sum up, i find this show to be a waste of time, the script obviously has been dumbed down for americans which most on the board say they prefer the original. if nbc wanted to show kath and kim why not pay the producers the money to screen the original.<br /><br />all i can add is magda you are one smart cookie for not letting the producers use your character of sharon.
