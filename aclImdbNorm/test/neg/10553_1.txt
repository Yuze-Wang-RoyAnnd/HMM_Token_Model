what can i say? this was one awful movie to watch. i am normally not very critical of gay cinema in general, due to the fact that most are usually low-budget, but this really pushed me up the wall. i mean, is this was has happened to gay cinema? haven't gay producers and directors learned anything from gus van saints and ang lee's films?. just having to sit through the entire movie was like being in a dentist's chair and having my wisdom teeth extracted. i kept on praying for moments where i would feel any sort of connection with any of the characters, but that never happened. most of the characters performances were just not very convincing. it was like watching one of those badly produced made-for-tv movie specials on a local access tv stations. i cannot tell u how greatly disappointed it was seeing this film after being a big fan of tori spellings other works and the directors last work on "latter day saints." it was definitely not worth the wait. definitely, a few hours of my life i will never get back and will certainly not be purchasing it on dvd.
