this movie was really stupid and i thought that it wasn't so bad and i could tolerate a movie about a bed eating people. then the part near the end where the guy has skeleton hands ended up being the cherry on top of a bad movie. i could see the screws in the plastic skeleton hands for goodness sakes. the brother was still alive and moving when his hands were bare bones. the funny thing was that he could still move his hands that was just not right. without muscles, you really can't move your hands but he did. the brother should have bled to death even before he was moving his hands. the movie wasn't great but it was okay until the hand scene. i was laughing so hard that i don't really remember how it ended. it had something to do with foam or something.
