i have heard that novo was compared to memento for the simple fact they both rely on main characters suffering from short-term memory loss. well, that's like comparing the silence of the lambs and friday the 13th as both involved a character that killed multiple people. they couldn't be further apart in ideas.<br /><br />novo deals with a copier man at a company who does have short term memory loss. he is consistently followed by another gentleman and his boss likes to have sex with him in the office. in comes a temp who also gets involved with him and may/may not use him for sex. needless to say, he has a lot of on-screen sex.<br /><br />wait, there's more. there's a boy who runs into the troubled amnesia male and it's obvious there's more to this boy just bumping into him. and there's a notebook the man keeps to try and remember important clues.<br /><br />i admit i am not one for foreign-made films. i don't mind reading the subtitles, but i do mind that sometimes that takes away from one of my favorite aspects of a film: great dialogue. since they have to translate, or i wouldn't be able to understand for the most part, i truly believe they simplify what the characters have to say. this movie was no exception; the dialogue was just, well, blah.<br /><br />as for the story, it was interesting enough to keep me around for 98 minutes. weird, yes, but then again i don't live in france, so i am not as familiar with their likes/dislike or lifestyles.
