this movie isn't even good enough for the $1 bin at the grocery store.<br /><br />i only purchased it because terrence howard was in it. guess he couldn't be too choosy about his roles during this time. <br /><br />the movie in itself was hard to sit through. it seemed they were grasping at straws with a storyline. the "guys night out" had to be the most boring i've ever seen. one minute they are talking and the next reciting poetry? even the arguments were hard to follow. most of the acting lacked any depth.<br /><br />i have no idea what they were going for with this one but they certainly missed the mark.
