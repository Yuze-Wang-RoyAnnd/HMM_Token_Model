three words: what a pile..... two words: don't bother! one word: sucked! there are zero reasons to see this movie. even those seagal groupies should shy away from this movie. the martial arts, the typical aikido, are horrible. the martial arts moves themselves are fine but the cinematography is pathetic. the movie actually goes into slow motion whenever seagal give his "kill move" to his victims. worse yet, is shows the same move three times in rapid succession from three slightly different angles. how stupid. seagal's acting was plain stupid, but i still give this movie a "6" for acting because of the supporting cast whose "villain" roles were actually quite entertaining.<br /><br />the plot is just dumb. seagal plays a federal express agent with a license to kill. his character also has that dedicated work ethic which means all of his packages get delivered to the correct people on time - at no extra charge - and nothing stands in his way. not assassins, political leaders, explosions, or even death.<br /><br />i expect a certain level of violence in a martial arts film, but there are several scenes in this movie of random and horrible acts of violence that lend itself in no way to the advancement of the movie or its story. there is a reason this movie went directly to video and there are tons of reasons to avoid it. no one should bother with this tripe.<br /><br />
