i heard legends about this "film" (quotes used so as not to insult films) for a while, so when i finally got the dvd with it, i impatiently started watching it. by the end, i *had* to fast forward through just a few of the most moronic, ineptly made, nonsensical scenes of this pointless childish mess to make it end quicker.<br /><br />this may be the worst film i've even "touched" - and i used to be associated with troma for a while. "manson family" makes the bottom of troma's entries look like daring and groundbreaking art-house filmwork. i could go on and talk about the syphilitic skeleton of a "plot" it has, the revoltingly bad "acting", the painful, inept "directing", the sets and props with their "dollar ninety nine" look (i especially "loved" the plastic toy guns used in the tate murder scene!) or the nauseating look and feel of this whole bag of garbage (i think it was supposed to represent a drug-induced hallucination; i have absolutely no idea how a drug-induced hallucination looks or feels, nor do i want to find out - but i guess drug junkies with burned out "brains" will love this "film" (they seem to be the ones who made it) i've seen many films from various "worst 50" lists, traditionally opened by eddie wood's ones - and eddie wood would be appalled by the sheer ineptitude and talentless of van webber (or whatever his name is; i certainly don't want to remember it) i've never seen "superbabies" or its sequel, but i strongly wish that "manson" joined them on imdb's rating. fortunately, this obscure garbage probably won't be seen by enough viewers to warrant it sufficiently many "1" votes - and so much the better!
