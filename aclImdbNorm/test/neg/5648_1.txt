words fail me for this appalling waste of two hours of anyone's life. the story is contrived to the point of complete incredibility. <br /><br />the acting is leaden and so much of this is laughably dreadful. vinnie jones - so wonderful in lock stock and two smoking barrels, is unbearably awful and unbelievable as mike sullivan, journalist.<br /><br />i honestly can't ever remember seeing a worse film. it's only worth watching for the appalling continuity lapses. after jones is handed a huge beating he emerges without a scratch on him. his girlfriend upends a drink over him and he chases her, emerging from the pub bone dry. it's quite dreadful, made all the worse by the talented actors who appear in it.
