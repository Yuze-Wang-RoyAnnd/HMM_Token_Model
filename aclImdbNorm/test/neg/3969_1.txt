slooooooow, tepid, poorly produced 70's schlocker made moore cowvincing because of today's headlines; nonetheless, this film is worthy stink-fodder because of uncowvincing acting, absent direction, and silly 70's clothing(sadly, the moocow remembers when adidas clothing was all the rage...). this has the same sort of feel to it that some better 70's sci-fi moovies accowmplished, namely "westworld" and "logan's run". while the premise interesting(rich people clone themselves to keep a ready supply of body parts to keep them alive theoretically forever), the film makes the mistake of saddling us with richard(tim donnelly), a clone who is at once both boring and irritating. hollow acting by donnelly doesn't help, but fits right in with the rest of the cast. even such b-illuminaries as dick sargent("bewitched" tv series, "ghost with 1,000,000 eyes), keenan wynn("dr. strangelove", "the dark", "laserblast"), and peter graves("beginning of the end", "killers from space", "it conquered the world")provide only the moost tepid performances. produced, directed, and edited by a bunch of nobodies, it's no surprise that "clonus" fails to horrify anyone in the least, much less keep anyone's attention! truth be told, there's nothing in the feeble flick that even schlock-fans would love - wanna see some realllly bad, funny 70's films, put on anything by greydon clark. "clonus" is no bonus; the moocow says even the mst3k-version is a yawner, so proceed at yer own risk! :=8p
