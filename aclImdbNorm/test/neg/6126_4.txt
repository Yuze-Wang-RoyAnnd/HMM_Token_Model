the beginning of the film is promising. when jeanne pollet(anna mouglalis) hear the story of the incident that happen on the day she was born that raise the possibility that she is the daughter of a famous pianist, andr'e polonski (jacques dutrone), she set to find out whether it's true or not, and giving the fact the she plays also the piano that's not such a remote idea. jeanne meet andr'e and his wife "mika" muller(isabelle huppert) and their son and on the way uncover the fact that there are some secrets in that family as much in her own.<br /><br />o.k. we have seen this before and it has been done in a more interesting way than here.the character of "mika" muller is left with out us understanding her motives to her action and she is not interesting enough to care for her. the piano scenes look fake and the whole piano sub-plot doesn't add anything to the character's insight but serve as to make the film longer than it should have been in the first place.<br /><br />in short a very disappointing outing from chabrol, who can do better than this
