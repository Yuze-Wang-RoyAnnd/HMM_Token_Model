warning:i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.<br /><br />if you plan on watching this movie don't! i warn you... this movie is terribly boring and basically horrifying, not in the horror movie kind of way, to watch. i mistook this piranha movie for another piranha movie and when i had noticed i made a mistake i decided to watch this one anyway. i wish i wouldn't have. this movie is so horrendous and so intolerable in every piece of material that i couldn't bare to let anyone say this movie was halfway decent. for one thing, this movie should be called a boring talk about wilderness instead of piranha. they only show piranhas once! at the same time, the way this film sounds so poorly heard, i got sleepy only 20 minutes into the thing. at the end my mouth was hung wide open and i stared gloomily at the blank tv screen. it is a very poorly directed and badly filmed piece of junk that i was afraid i brain dysfunction after watching it...
