i am in awe of the number of people who consider this film to be decent...much less great! do the majority of people even have basic standards for a film they watch? i just don't know anymore.<br /><br />this "commercial cinematic product" doesn't really deserve the respect of being called a film. to call dean cain talented is a gross injustice to anyone who actually has talent. i have had a lot of respect for lori petty but most of that has gone right down the tubes. at least her role was extremely small. maybe she had a bill that desperately needed to get paid.<br /><br />the ignorance i saw while viewing "firetrap" was amazing. let me start out by getting this off my chest: if you can't show fire realistically then don't show it at all. okay?!! it's an embarrassment to all involved when you show lame effects that don't even come close to simulating an actual burning building.<br /><br />some interesting tidbits: 1. a janitor opens the door to a large storage closet and finds the entire room engulfed in flames. what does he do? he tries to put out the fire with his broom! 2. the same janitor (who knows the building is on fire) later comes across a door marked "hazardous materials". his brilliant mind tells him that it would be a great idea to open said door. big mistake! 3. a woman is giving a fantastically generous donation of $100,000 to a greyhound rescue fund but...she's wearing a fur coat to the charity event they're holding! (wouldn't people who care about animals kinda frown on that sort of thing?) 4. several of the people in the movie are forced into a vault of some sort with massive steel walls that even an electromagnetic pulse(!!) couldn't penetrate. yet they have a spacious air vent leading right into the back of the thing that anyone could crawl through. that sure seems like a lapse in security.<br /><br />i could go on and on but i have grown tiresome thinking about this lame movie. our "hero" whom we are supposed to be cheering for is a career criminal who early on tries to kill some police officers. what a swell guy! if the general public wants to waste their minds away on this drivel then more power to them. i just wish i could have it erased from my memory. 1/10
