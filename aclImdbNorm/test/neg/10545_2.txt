the first toxie film was dark, gory, and hillarious. this film is un-gory battles to cheezy jazz music, no real gore at all, and the worst toxie mask i have ever seen! his deep voice is now a light, happy voice, characters from part 1 reappear by actors that look nothing like them (claire, mom junko), characters names change (claire or sara?). it is lacking all the brutal violence, dark humor, and political incorrectness of the first film. if it weren't for nudity, this movie could have been rated pg. really lame. i am a huge fan of part 1 though, just cant stand this one.
