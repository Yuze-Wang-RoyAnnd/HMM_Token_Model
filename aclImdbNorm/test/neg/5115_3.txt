this movie is exactly the same as ridley scott's, "someone to watch over me", which is a classic. it stars tom berenger and mimi rogers and the bad guy from the fugitive. it's a quality movie, with good direction and great acting. this movie is the polar opposite. it's the same plot, just minus any good acting and adding tv movie direction. i do have to say i like the interaction between lowe and the woman. she's hot and their romance is believable on many levels. unfortunately, that alone cannot save this carbon copy of the classic ridley scott film.<br /><br />usually crappy tv movies have some redeeming quality that makes them watchable at the very least. i think for me, this film's redeeming value is that rob lowe and the lead female have chemistry. that and i was able to watch and compare the plot to another quality film.
