for connoisseurs of bad movies, galaxina is a true gem. with truly horrid dialog, acting, and directing, it's no choice for people seeking a proper movie. but as one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies of its genre, it's priceless for a good laugh. in particular, the scenes involving the harley davidson-worshiping motorcycle cult are especially good, and many other scenes present an opportunity for a cheap laugh.<br /><br />sadly, the scenes with dorothy stratten really fail to deliver, but since she's playing an android, i suppose one can excuse her for wooden acting.<br /><br />bad movie-lovers, don't pass this one up!
