and it's only january, still i'm sure of it!<br /><br />by far this is among the worst swedish movies i've ever seen and to be honest swedish movies ain't that good in general. it have been claimed to be "original" and perhaps it can be seen as that for people who never seen a english speaking movie, for us who have been to the cinema the last 10 years it can't help but to feel like mans marlind and bj"orn stein have been sitting down one weekend going through the most successful movies from the last years and tried to squeeze it all together in to one swedish package. what can i say the outcome can just be...poor. first of all the story is just weak to begin with, even worse when it's not just a poor story it's a wish to combine to very poor stories - first a failed try to make swedish action 'a la matrix and then combine it with a really bad moral story. and if you thought it could not be worse you'll notice all the "cool stuff" that just have been thrown in there for absolutely no reason at all more than in a bad way trying to show that sweden also can do hollywood movies - which we can't nor should try to. for example the main plot is tried to made deeper by letting youths play a computer game called storm having absolutely nothing at all with the story or for example how there is a internet side about "storm" while all the sudden it just is the main characters consciousness - really i don't think even stein or marlind can see a point with three quarters of the movie, more than just trying to show off poor extra effects. for the actors, i've got to admit eric ericson does a pretty good job except he does the same job the whole movie through, even tough storm tries to be a movie about the personal development of dd he does not change one bit in his way of acting. jonas karlsson, well to be honest i thought he was a fairly respected actor but judging by storm... really he just have to be ashamed of this movie, his character and his scar. lastly eva r"ose is just beyond critic, both her character and her acting. the only reasons storm succeeds of not getting a 1/10 is for eric ericson and, what can i say, at least it tries..
