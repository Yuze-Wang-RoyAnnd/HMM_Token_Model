the first half of this movie was quite good. it was interesting and suspenseful. the second half was pretty bad. the comic book revenge story came full circle and we see lots of comic nazi characters and some badly acted "good guys" blowing them away. there's a lot of violence in this movie. i'm not squeamish about violence but i think it should at least have some purpose in a movie. there was little purpose to the violence here except to create a genre film where we see lots of people getting mowed down with rifles. we're somehow supposed to be amused by this.<br /><br />i watched reservoir dogs recently. there was a movie where violence was employed effectively. it was realistic within the world the movie created. there were never any over-the-top sound effect. it was a crime movie which played it straight. inglorious basterds should have played it straight but didn't. i was rolling my eyes at how the violence was exaggerated with sound effects and extra bullets to the head and face.<br /><br />none of the back-story of any of the basterds is really explained either, they're simply nazi hunters. we don't really get to like any of them either because they're too busy cutting scalps off and shooting people in the face. it's all about "revenge" and very little else.<br /><br />there was 2 1/2 hours to work with here but few of the basterds were really examined in depth. this seems like it was simply a revenge flick pure and simple. we saw that in tarantino's last flick, "death proof" which i didn't care for either. it suffered the same problems. the characters were almost interchangeable.<br /><br />the first half again, was pretty good. i wanted to see the exploits of the inglorious basterds across europe. i was presented with a much lamer movie about the resistance movement plotting revenge against some comic book nazis when they all go to one movie premiere in france.
