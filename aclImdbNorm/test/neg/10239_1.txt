i've seen several stage and film adaptations of alice in wonderland and this one has to take the cake as the absolute worst. my family bought the dvd unsuspectingly and couldn't even make it through the first half. i later went back and forced myself to watch the whole thing (it had been a christmas gift to me) and was just appalled.<br /><br />the only redeeming factor (and it's hardly redeeming enough to save the whole show) is mark lin-baker playing the mock turtle with a yiddish accent. it's one of the few moments in the piece that has some real charm and can be taken somewhat seriously. other than that, the songs are half-songs, the melodies are half-melodies and even meryl streep cannot make this direction look good.
