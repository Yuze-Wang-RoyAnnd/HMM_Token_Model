i have read almost all the books by now, and have seen the musical production in two different languages. i absolutely adored everything that i have been acquainted previously. but lately i've been running out of resources to sustain my fancy. i still have couple of books left, but they are either in transit or they are the sequels which i am not in a hurry to read. so an idea dawned on me - sink me! there are movies which i have not watched! thus, i must watch them immediately.<br /><br />the first five minutes of these series were... acceptable. in fact, i quite enjoyed the variation of the reason for the denunciation, however different it had seemed. it went all downhill from there, though. chauvelin was too... foppish? and, i daresay, too old for this role. not nearly that dark and dashing figure with his dreadful either-or. (and what was that with random bed scene featuring him? it was way too creepy - wasn't his only love the madame guillotine, and his only interest - his job, and his only obsession - sir percy?) marguerite... prettiest woman in france? cleverest woman in europe? i think not. although, whatever compelled her to break into the study of sir percy i haven't the faintest idea. and whatever my lord tony has done to deserve this death? yes, every member of the league did pledge his life to sir percy, but he would have never endangered any of them nor would have run away like a coward when his dear friend faces mortal danger. and if by any means he had to mourn his companion, he would have done that, mourn, not just move on as if nothing had happened. which brings me to another point, sir percy. his portrayal was most dreadful. he was neither a lazy fop, nor a gallant and elusive hero who is a master of transformations. nor did he care too much about cravats (his pronunciation of that word alone made my ears bleed) and with his own hands he had never killed anyone. so what was that with him randomly walking around and slaughtering people?<br /><br />the costumes were just too flashy for that time period as well. this is post-revolutionary france we are talking about! not pre-revolutionary. people in dresses like that stand out in a crowd quite easily. it was all just... gah!<br /><br />although, i must admit, after i watched other parts my opinion did change slightly. watching it as a separate work, independent of scarlet pimpernel series, it was tolerable. just your other average hero in the mask. but for what they tried to pass it, it is still miserable.
