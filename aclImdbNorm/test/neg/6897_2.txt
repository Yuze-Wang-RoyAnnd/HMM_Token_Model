...i normally hate puns, but this seems the only appropriate summary for "barnyard". i suspect i am not the first. and i'm sure many, many comments focus on the idiocy of bulls with udders. it certainly bothered me right off the bat. but there's much more wrong with this movie than a fundamental lack of knowledge about how mammals work.<br /><br />personally, if i was a parent, i would be irritated by the violent turn it takes near the end in the showdown with the coyotes. (although for me, it at least injected a little action.) and from a conventional screen writing point of view, you might expect the coyotes to play a greater role in the conflict(gee- you have a "widow" cow...maybe her "husband" was killed by coyotes? nope...there's a much dumber explanation.) and what kind of a farm is this? otis vows to protect all the animals from harm, but there certainly seems to be no threat from humans. they make reference to the farmer being vegan, but what is he raising pigs for? in all children's animal stories- babe, charlotte's web, you name it...the reality of farm life is at least touched on. perhaps our friendly farmer is running some sort of rescue shelter (there is some reference to this, but it's never explained.) but all the farmer gets in return is abuse from a horse in a scene that is supposed to be funny, but left me seriously wondering if he was going to wind up buried in a shallow grave behind the barn. and what the heck is the deal with "wild mike"? it was like the gimp scene in pulp fiction without the ball-gag.<br /><br />add in some truly awful attempts at emotional scenes, a nearly complete lack of laughs, and those udders, and you've got the worst kids movie i've seen in ages. i generally only post to imdb to highlight a film that's not so well known- not to slam the current #2 box-office hit. but this movie angered me. it was taking up space in my local theater, space that could have been used to show something worthwhile. there's been plenty of good family entertainment this summer- in fact there were at least 2 more kids films playing at the same multiplex. but i'm not allowed to see something like "little miss sunshine" so viacom can cheat families out of an extra $30. at least i had a free pass.<br /><br />i know that as a 35 year old with no children, this film was not designed for me. but there's just no excuse for such a lazy, dreadful children's film as "barnyard" in the age of pixar. i was bored by the "ice age" films, but they certainly didn't anger me like "barnyard". "shark tale" was a weak attempt at street hipness, but it had quite a few laughs. for that matter, you could turn on nickelodeon at any time of the day, and see something more entertaining and intelligent- which is why they should be ashamed for putting their name on this garbage.<br /><br />i'm giving it a 2 out of 10, only because pip the mouse was sporadically amusing, and maria bamford had a few amusing lines as the farmers wife. well, not the farmer's wife. some other farmer. they didn't really explain who she was. they didn't explain a lot of things. especially not why sam elliot- the ultimate "man's man"- had an udder jiggling around down there. creepy.
