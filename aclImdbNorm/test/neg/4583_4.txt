but like the disney film of two generations ago, this film fails as well in the accuracy department. but at least disney used a skye terrier.<br /><br />is the true story to mundane for movie producers? i don't think so. there is ample documentation to accurately portray they true story instead of the fictionalized accounts we have had to suffer through. <br /><br />some day, a movie will correctly portray bobby's owner, john gray, as the edinburgh policeman that he was, and correctly portray bobby's license a being paid for by the lord provost. when that happens, i'll be at the theaters.
