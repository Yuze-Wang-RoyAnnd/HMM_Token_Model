ok, i wanted to see this because it had a few good reviews, but this movie was awful... just plain awful. the characters were 1 dimensional and nothing the actors could do could ever breathe any life into them. the story was abysmal... the wind stopped becoming a plot device halfway through... it just completely becomes forgotten. the visuals while were cool were sooooo drawn out... 5 minutes of a guy crawling on the ground, 3 minutes of a girl putting on her makeup. i don't know what this guy is trying to pull off... it's like he had no plot no dialog and the movie needed to run just so long so lets not edit scenes at all... foreign films are great for creating a story without using a lot of dialog, this movie makes me think that there is no way american cinema can ever do this. i want to give up watching movies altogether... bad bad movie!
