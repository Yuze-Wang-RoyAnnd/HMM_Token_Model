1st watched 7/29/2001 - 4 out of 10 (dir-mark dindal): fast-paced, frantic animation effort by ted turner's feature animation group plays a lot like tv cartoons and leaves a lot to be desired in the area of likeable characters, but definetly has extremely unlikeable villains. i'm not even sure why the kids would like this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that kids know very little or nothing about. mediocre effort at best despite raves on the box comparing it to disney efforts like aladdin and lion king. don't let this fool you -- there is no comparison in story or quality.
