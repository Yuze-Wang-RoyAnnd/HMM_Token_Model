while the premise of the film sounded unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the film i could have stopped there and gone on with my life. she does get some interesting comments and reactions from her subjects, but not really enough to add to the validity of the film.<br /><br />i also felt she went a bit overboard with many things. if a guy said a filthy comment, grabbed her, or made some disgusting gesture to her, i would say go for it, bring him down, he's a pig. what bothered me though is she would walk around in revealing clothes and be surprised when guys would look at her and give them hell about it.<br /><br />i think somehow she forgot that being attracted to other people is a part of human sexuality and a big part of who we all are. guys will look at beautiful women, especially when they dress provocatively, just like women will look at men when they are wearing a tight tank or no shirt at all.<br /><br />some women may hate me for this, but i hope not. i have much respect for women. i was raised by one. i also come from a spanish family and we are very matriarchal. my grandmother was the center of my family for years, but i don't really feel this did anything to help women's rights and from what the filmmaker even said herself, some women were offended by her project.
