okay,<br /><br />i realize that there are some doubting thomas's out there...i was one of them...but then i saw this masterpiece of celluloid.<br /><br />all i can say is that the scene in which george wendt gets sucked out of the spaceship by his a** left me trembling. i sometimes sit bolt upright in my bed, screaming like an old man on a proctologist's table thinking about it. if the director is reading this... i would pay to be an extra in the sequel.
