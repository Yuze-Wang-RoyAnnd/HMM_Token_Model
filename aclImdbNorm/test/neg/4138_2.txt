how pointless, hideous characters and boring film. saved by brief sex scenes, mad witch, gorgeous desert island and brooks body. the plot is tenuous, the characters are shallow and unlikeable. having said that i did manage to watch it all, mainly because i was totally transfixed by the jiggling and kind of hoping that her character would come good in the end. the film was well shot, well directed but perhaps the casting let it down in some ways. disappointing. really summed the review up in the first line but this website dictates that you need to write 10 lines minimum. it would be better to spend the time watching another film.
