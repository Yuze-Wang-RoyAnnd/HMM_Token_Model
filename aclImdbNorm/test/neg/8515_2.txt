i'll give it a two because it has a lot of music, otherwise it would be a one.<br /><br />i saw this movie for the first time tonight and it's the first "road" picture i've seen. i was expecting waaaaay better. robert osborn says this is the best of the road movies. if that's true i needn't bother to see the others. the best thing about this movie is that it has a lot of songs in the first half, but that's balanced out by only one production number with dancing in the entire movie.<br /><br />i didn't like the movie. neither hope nor crosby came across all that well, their characters weren't very charming, the movie was not funny at all, most of the dialog was just lame filler, there wasn't much action, there wasn't much spectacle.<br /><br />the movie wasn't what i expected. i was expecting more "road," but there isn't much. they quickly make it to the palace and then most of the movie takes place there, until the end. i was also expecting a lot more of the famous "road" style of breaking the fourth wall, wherein the characters talk directly to the audience or comment on the plot. there was only about 4 instances of that. one of those is an example of the non-funny humor of this script:<br /><br />(hope recaps the plot up to now to crosby) crosby: i know all that! hope: yeah but the people that came in half-way through the picture don't. crosby: you mean they missed my song?<br /><br />those are two weak punchlines, but at least they are actually jokes. much of the rest of the script doesn't even have any jokes. an example is: <br /><br />crosby: remind me to throw you a piece of cheese in the morning. (indirectly calling hope a rat).<br /><br />that's not funny at all, it barely even qualifies as a joke, but that's the kind of non-joke dialog that carries most of the movie. many of the scenes don't even come that close to a joke, just using generic uninteresting dialog like:<br /><br />crosby: hey, whadda ya' take me for? you think that you can just throw me to the dogs? hope: well why not, you did it to me didn't you? crosby: yeah but that's because i was lookin' out for us. you're not lookin' out for nobody. hope: oh yeah? well then why did i pay the check?<br /><br />(the above is just from my memory. it's not exact but it illustrates to you what i mean).<br /><br />and so on....just generic dialog with no jokes at all.<br /><br />my grade: a waste of time.
