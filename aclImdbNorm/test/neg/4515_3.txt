the only good part of this movie was the ending. you know the part of the movie where the lights come on and you leave to go home. no no that may be a little harsh - the dancing in the film was sensational but unfortunately that is where the plot ended. as long as the cast was dancing and not talking the movie went along well. as for chayanne's debut - not too bad but hopefully his next film will have a little more depth. as for going to see the movie wait for the rental or tv. do not make the same mistake i did and pay 8.50
