help! once again, paul schrader has sabotaged his own intentions with dull, pedantic storytelling. i rearranged a vacation so that i could see this "world premiere." what a mistake! why did schrader even want to make an exorcist film? lofty intentions are fine, but if i wanted 2 hours of theological babble, i would visit my nephew's sunday school. father merrin's struggle with his faith, as presented in his younger days, is a potentially interesting subject. but an exorcist movie needs more! the relentlessly draggy presentation, along with ridiculous special effects, makes for a strange production. who is this movie for? i didn't bother seeing the harlin version, but at least they apparently tried to deliver some sort of visceral thrills.<br /><br />the exorcist series has been quite strange. the first film was excellent, but every sequel has been unloved and pointless. why do they keep making them? i suppose schrader made it so that he could get a lot of money. but why should we go?
