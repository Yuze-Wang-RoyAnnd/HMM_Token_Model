a single mom,her son and daughter and their hippie chick friend are camping in the woods.a muscle bound,machete wielding maniac in a yellow ski mask appears.he starts terrorizing and sexually violating the family before murdering them with a machete."wet wilderness" is loaded with ugly hardcore sex,forced incest and blatant racism.it's as politically incorrect as xxx roughies get.the score is stolen from seminal hitchcock's horror classic "psycho" and also "jaws".the acting is hilariously awful,the editing is bad and there are some huge lapses in logic.the repetitive nature of the sex scenes grinds the movie after while so the brief running time is a blessing.the scenes of violence are quite nasty for example the hippie girl is stabbed with the machete in her groin and one can see blood on her crotch.3 out of 10 and that's being generous.
