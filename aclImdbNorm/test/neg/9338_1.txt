in short this movie was awful.<br /><br />i understand it's a disney movie, which are generally shallow movies with mediocre plots and bad acting. however, i must say this is the worst of all disney movies, with bad acting, lots of irritating shrieking teen girls(my god), and an extremely unrealistic plot. even as a 12 year old there is no way i would have liked this movie. the only way this movie could have been any worse is if they attempted to put it in theaters or tried to sell it in a local video store. <br /><br />do yourself a favor and change the channel before watching this, no matter how bored you are on a sunday afternoon.
