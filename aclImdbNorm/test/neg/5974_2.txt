i'm sorry to say that, but this is actually one of the worst documentaries i have ever seen.<br /><br />due to its name "darwin's nightmare" i expected a documentary on problems relating to the nile perch in lake victoria.<br /><br />what i actually saw in this "documentary" is a loose accumulation of individual stories, most of which have no relation to neither fish nor lake. and for a large part you can hardly call them stories - it's more like some accumulated scenes that lack a meaningful connection...<br /><br />why does this movie waste time on: - showing us non-relevant information on the families of the russian pilots (several minutes are wasted for example on their private digicam snapshots of wives and daughters) - mourning the death of an african child who got bitten by a crocodile (as if that could not have happened without the nile perch) - showing us about 100 times how planes land and start at the airport - showing us strange religious events for several minutes - discussing in detail the life and death of a whore at the airport - talking to kids about their mothers, fathers - what they work and/or how they died (well, guess what: some died of hiv - who would have guessed that?) those are just some examples, i could go on for several pages...<br /><br />this movie is absolutely unfocused, and does not know at all what it wants to tell the viewer. if you have never heard of africa and have no idea that this continent has social/health/hiv/violence/war problems then this movie might be right for you. if you haven't had your eyes closed for the last decades 90% of what this movie shows won't be new to you - and the way it's presented here will try its best to make you fall asleep.<br /><br />perhaps my expectations on this movie were to high, but i really didn't like it even though this is a topic that i would generally find interesting. if this movie wants to show how the poverty is related to the nile perch, than it perhaps should have spent some time on discussing that matter...
