i just finishing watching goliath awaits that i ordered from my library. i remembered it vaguely from years ago and wanted to watch it with my son. anyway, the movie was less than 2 hours running time and i thought it was much longer when i first saw it. the back of the vhs box states that the goliath "emtombs a nazi file whose secrets could destroy the free world forever." the divers were supposedly on a covert mission to retrieve the demonic document. there was nothing even spoken about retrieving this document. also, the box says that the "bestial ship's insatiable boiler feeds on human blood." that would make this a horror movie and there was also nothing revealed in the movie about this. i can't remember the details when i watched this years ago on tv...but could the back of this box actually be true? maybe the 3 hour movie revealed more details??<br /><br />just wondering if anyone knows anything about this.
