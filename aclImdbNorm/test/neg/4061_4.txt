as a massive fan of dm, it goes without saying that i have seen this film numerous times. however, i watch it purely for the concert footage...the rest of the film is, um, pretty dreadful, sad to say.<br /><br />famed rock music film director da pennebaker followed mode around on their late 80s music for the masses tour, which promoted the superb album of the same name. the title 101 derives mostly from the fact that the concert material included is from the 101st and final concert of the tour at the pasadena bowl, but is also a reference to the movie being a 'beginners course' on the band and how it ticks ie depeche mode 101. amidst footage of the quartet playing live and exploring america is a second story thread covering a group of dm fans who've won a competition to meet the band, go on the tour in their own coach bus and attend the finale gig.<br /><br />now, as i said above, the concert footage is great. mode are here on top of their form as stadium rock gods, which was a somewhat unusual achievement for an electrorock band back in the late 80s. though the film catches the band before they recorded their 1990 masterpiece "violator", there are still countless excellent tracks seen and heard here eg behind the wheel, the majestic never let me down again, everything counts, just can't get enough from the vince clarke years, shake the disease and many more.<br /><br />when mode are onstage, they are brilliant. when they are not, they're, well, very boring. nothing even vaguely of interest happens to the lads as they check out the us in the dying days of the reagan administration. as an example, the probable "highlight" of the material is a visit to a country music store to buy cassettes. not exactly thrilling stuff. i know all bands don't have to be wild and reckless idiots, but these guys make the mormon tabernacle choir look like rammstein.<br /><br />the only real excitement comes from various clips centring on the band's lead singer dave gahan. gahan comes across in 101 as being mildly psychotic, talking about a violent power inside himself he can't control, recalling a bizarre rage attack involving a taxi driver and so on. there's one point in the film where he throws a prima donna tantrum at some poor guy backstage - truly embarrassing. the man clearly had issues back then, which thankfully have been resolved. songwriter martin gore and keyboardist andy fletcher are presented as very articulate, clearly massively talented, but also utterly colourless men; while the somewhat enigmatic fourth member alan wilder is the only one of the quartet who pulls off the rock star persona with any sort of aplomb.<br /><br />and as for the 'fan tour' thread, well it's unwatchable dross. let's not kid ourselves. maybe it's just because it's all so *very* late 80s, but the gaggle of young devotees do little for me but raise a feeling of irritation. they are, to a person, singularly shallow and vapid people, whose antics are banal when they aren't hide-your-face cringeworthy. let me reiterate....*nothing* happens in the footage that isn't onstage that is of any interest. nothing. endless scenes of kids spraying their hair, arguing pointlessly, changing their clothes, getting lost in cities on the way to gigs and finding their partners in bed with another competition winner makes me wonder just one thing - if cure fans were this mind bendingly dull back in '88/89. the love the youngsters have for the band is something i can definitely relate to, and is at times infectiously joyous, but if what we see was the most interesting stuff out of what was filmed of them, then i'd hate to see the outtakes.<br /><br />but the music is all that matters, and in this regard 101 excels. the pasadena concert, one of their all time best gigs, makes the film worth seeing. the recent dvd edition of the movie comes with a bonus disc containing what remains of the unedited concert footage (a good 80% of the performance), and thus makes the dvd an absolute must for fans. the audio commentary by the band (minus wilder, who left mode in the mid-90s) on the first disc is also, oddly, far more interesting than the film itself.<br /><br />as a document of the boys from basildon during their amphitheatre idol period, depeche mode 101 is invaluable. but if you're looking for excitement, you're better off getting the accompanying double live album (now available in super audio cd format).
