after watching this film i decided that it was so awful that i must join imdb and write a review to warn other people of the pit falls of renting/buying this film. to be fair to the film there is only one good section to this film and that is the end credits cause then you know that this crap is well and truly over. i watched it to the end in the hope that i may get a little bit of pleasure out of the film. just tunnels more tunnels and an old man talking to himself (if you watch this film too many time so will you). as for val if he keeps selecting films like this he may as well kiss goodbye to his acting career. there is no point in even writing about what is in the film as that has already been done. keep your money and sanity and keep well clear.
