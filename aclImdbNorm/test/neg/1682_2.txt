i give the show a six because of the fact that the show was in fact a platform for damon wayans as the cosby show was for bill cosby, it dealt with a lot of issues with humor and i felt that it in fact tailored to getting a laugh as opposed to letting the jokes come from the character. <br /><br />michael kyle an interesting patriarch and a wisecracking person. he is phenomenal in movies, but in the show he was there for the wisecrack and though i loved it, i felt that the laugh was more important than plausibility.<br /><br />jay kyle i have loved her since house party and have enjoyed her in school daze and martin, this was a great role for her and she made a great choice in picking this sitcom to co-star in. i also feel that jay and michael were more like equals in the show but jay was more the woman who fed her crazy husbands the lines and went along with his way of unorthodox discipline because she may have felt that it worked<br /><br />jr just plain stupid, his character should have been well developed and even though he does have his moments of greatness, we are returned to the stupidity as if he learned nothing, which drives me nuts!!!!!!!! not to mention that most of the situations (in episodes i've seen) seems to center around him<br /><br />clair the attractive sister who dated a christian, i found her boyfriend's character to be more interesting than she was (she'd be better off sticking to movies, the writers should have done more to show her intelligence but it's not stereotypical enough)<br /><br />kady lovable and the youngest daughter. i think the writers established her character most on the show aside from the parents and franklin<br /><br />franklin i love this character and i think they derived it from smart guy (t.j. mowry) which only lasted one season. they did a great job of casting for this little genius (the effort would have been made if jr would have been the smart one but show the down sides also)<br /><br />all in all, this sitcom is a wonderful thing and it's homage to the cosby show is well done, i love the show and wished it would have stayed on longer than that. i can't wait to see the series finale
