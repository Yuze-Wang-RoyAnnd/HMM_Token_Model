jeff powers (lou diamond phillips, "young guns 1&2"), a cop with a history of roughing up criminals, is recruited into an elite clandestine lapd division. this doesn't sit well with jeff's newspaper reporter girlfriend, kelly (chelsea field) who's looking for a story on the squad. soon enough jeff's conscience gets the better of him which puts him at odds with dan vaughn (scott glenn, "the hunt for red october" & "backdraft"), the leader of the unit.<br /><br />this is a fairly routine, dare i say mundane, cop-action/drama that holds no surprises thanks to a cookie-cutter plot that's content to go strictly from point a to point b. the acting is all right for what the actors were given to work with however that's no real reason to watch the film. kinda sad seeing as the six previous mark l. lester directed films right before this one (from class of 1984 to showdown in little tokyo) were all highly entertaining vehicles. <br /><br />eye candy: chelsea field gets briefly topless<br /><br />my grade: d+
