ok the box look interesting, the opening have great music and its kinda original, to that its all ok. but when the movie start...well its not my first videoville movie, i watched ghost lake, and its very similar of this movie except its ever worse here. the story at first sounded interesting but the whole movie look like a movie shot by a bunch of university student, with specials effect that me laugh, the blood look like a mix of red and white paint, the fire effect on the demon face look like it was done with a program i could buy at my local computer shop. all the movie is shot in day(very great for a movie supposed to be horror) and there like no gore(1 scene only and it look so home-made and not credible) and near no blood(it can be considered a great thing considering the look of the blood show) and 1 demon for the whole movie. the story is going nowhere , it give you the impression that it never start, there so much useless scene done only to give the movie the average duration time(when the demon search the guy in the dogs thing for about 4 minutes...) way too much slow-mo things. well lets just say this movie is a z-series one and a very poor one. all cool idea lost themselves and you get a cheesy movie. it bored my all long and i'm not the guy who get bored very easily with horror movie, man i even like house of the dead and alone in the dark from uwe boll and you probably know the name for being one of the worst director but here it look too much like some guys wanting to make a movie for fun. plus for us french speaker(tough i understand english i prefer to watch movie in my native language) there the usual videoville bad translation. in normal movie you can barely see its not the actor speaking(you have to check on lips etc) here you just have to listen to it and you know it. very cheesy
