think jumanji but with a death curse. a bunch of surfer dudes get their hands on a game that takes the life of some one who is playing it. supposedly it was made from the skin of a witch during the spanish inquisition and carries a nasty curse. <br /><br />okay, undemanding and just sort of watchable tale isn't anything you haven't seen before.frankly its a been there and done that story that hits all the right buttons in such away as to have no real surprises. far from the worst thing that syfy has run but certainly its not the best. there are better choices out there but if this is your only choice you won't completely hate it.
