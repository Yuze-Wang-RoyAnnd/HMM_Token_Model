we rented the movie and it maybe the worst movie ever. the box they had in the video store had a cool looking monster on the cover but in reality the monster was a creature from the black lagoon mask. awful, awful, awful...you actually might have to rent it it's so bad. it feels like you are watching a bizzare-o home movie.
