this well-meant film falls just a bit short, and unfortunately in too many areas.<br /><br />the scenery is gorgeous, with vistas of north-central vermont providing the setting for this mid-century tale. quebec bill endeavors to go back to his whiskey-running past in order to save his farm.<br /><br />going back and forth between scenes of magical realism and straight-forward action, this film rarely hits its stride.<br /><br />kris kristofferson as quebec bill seems pretty stilted, or else it's his lines; or else his cross of yankee and quebecois accents. anyway, he just comes off as a low-key blow-hard. his dialogs with gary farmer's coville character do sparkle, though. william sanderson's rat kinneson is solid. charlie mcdermott shows some real potential as young wild bill; but his part's not large enough to carry a scene and he never steals one. luis guzman shows up on lake memphramagog (with a fine stand-in performance by lake willoughby) as a monk with a boys'n'the hood accent: who knows? and then there's bujold's cordelia: an oracle like her namesake, she channels yoda as she intones lines like "you will marry a quebec woman!"?!? just too weird and nowhere near enigmatic enough.<br /><br />the end gets really choppy. again a bad mix of magical realism and the concrete. and yoda never provides an answer we can understand.
