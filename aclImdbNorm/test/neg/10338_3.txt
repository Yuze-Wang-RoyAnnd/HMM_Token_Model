this forth film in the "angel guts" saga, which at only a few minutes above an hour (it just feels much longer) , is also the shortest, which is perhaps just as well as it's also the most uninvolving of the series.nami, a department store clerk, is interested in another part time job. her fellow worker at the department store introduces her to modeling for a porn mag called 'red porno'. but when her other employers found out about her naughty pictures they decide to fire her. and she gets some unwanted admirer. oh yea and she likes to masturbate ..alot. using various household items. the wall to wall sexcapades masks a lack of discernible plot and pushes this one far too much into exploitation territory, not unsurprising though given that the director of this one is toshiharu ikeda ("evil dead trap", "beautiful prey"). perhaps his sensibilities just weren't suited for an angel guts film.<br /><br />my grade: d <br /><br />dvd extras: commentary by jasper sharp; bio/filmographies; a 36 minute interview with toshiharu ikeda; original sleeve art; and trailers for this and 4 other angel guts films (high school co ed, red classroom, red vertigo, & red porno) all available in artsmagik's box-set, but for some reason the 6th film "angel guts: red flash" is not in the set
