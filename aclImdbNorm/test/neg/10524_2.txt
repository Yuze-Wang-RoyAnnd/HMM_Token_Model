the worst movie i've ever seen, and i've seen allot. acting is horrible, plot is awful, idea is terrible, and no research was done what's so ever! ok, i admit, `air bud' was a pretty good movie, but not `soccer dog'. this "dog" is smaller than my cat! how can he possibly play soccer? even for 10 years old kids it won't be a problem to kick the ball hard enough to brake the stupid dog in half! it's horrible, don't watch this movie.
