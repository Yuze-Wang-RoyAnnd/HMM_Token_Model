i watched this with great trepidation, and my trepidation was well founded, it seems. what was this movie about? knight? the season? the players? what? it was all over the place all the time. it had no tension (sorry, we all knew bobby was going to curse and throw things) but brian denehy, a fine actor, comes across as mailing in the anger and delivering zero tension. cheaply shot, like a macgiver episode. contrast this thanksgiving main course with the job hbo did on the don king movie "only in america" to show how to do sports biopics, warts and all. notice that espn promoted the hell out of it and then never showed it again?
