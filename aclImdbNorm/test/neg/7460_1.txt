no,i'm not a radical feminst bashing the hentai and yaoi genre,i just find it really boring and pointless.my god,i was made to watch this for initiation from some stupid punk and my my,even an mst3k movie has a storyline,not to mention that this hentai crap is what's giving anime a bad name world-wide (watch out sailor moon!).sadly,people don't realize that not all anime(or any other asian style) is sleazy porn.death to the stereotype!!!<br /><br />*starts casting ultima*
