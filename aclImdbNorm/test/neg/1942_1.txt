this is by far the worst and most stupid show i have ever seen on tv. it is almost physically painful to watch an adult (well in his twenties) doing nothing but torture and mock his parents, who always seem to have no clue what so ever about the stunts they are forced to endure by their dimwitted son and his equally stupid friends. of course i know his parents are in on it, but i really hate how they always act like they are caught completely by surprise. it seems fake through and through. and i really hate the intro of the show, in which a voice over asks "bam margera, what will he think of next?!?!" (i think that's how it is, anyway), and bam himself answers: "whatever the f^*k i want!" - wow! bam is really a hell raiser - living at home with mum and dad! -of course the word "f^*k" is replaced with a tasteful beep, but we get the message. bam is the real deal rebel - at least in his own eyes. of course bam and his posse of numb sculls aim at an audience of teenage boys, and of course it's a mtv show, but please, raise the bar a little. it's painfully predictable and stupid, and therefore nothing but boring.
