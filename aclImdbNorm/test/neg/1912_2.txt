one can always tell if i'm enjoying a movie by the number of times i cross my legs, switch positions, make slight rustling noises, etc., etc. the lesser = the better. i moved so many times throughout this movie that i succeeded in knocking over my friends giant tub of popcorn and getting a huge thigh-strengthening workout.<br /><br />sobieski, a young actress who at some points in "a soldier's daughter never cries" gave some promise for her thespian talents, played poorly in a poorly-written part. depressing fact number one. number two: chris klein was in it. depressing fact number three: chris klein had lines. number four: chris klein played a valedictorian. woah. dummies from rich families unite! even worse, he actually tries to act, but only succeeds in sounding like a mentally disabled overactor in an increasingly sappy independent version of a cecille b. demille film. go back to humping your american pies.<br /><br />this movie was terrible in almost every sense, save josh hartnett's mildly endearing performance as leelee's stiffed boyfriend jasper. luckily, he refrains from trying to have too many "moments," unlike all the other characters. of course, this is why he's much better than the rest and he actually shows some mettle here. if you like josh or are thinking of casting a kid who knows a few things, he's your man. <br /><br />hartnett is a sharp actor, but the rest need no further lambasting.<br /><br />2 out of 10 (for poor hartnett in this terrible film)<br /><br />
