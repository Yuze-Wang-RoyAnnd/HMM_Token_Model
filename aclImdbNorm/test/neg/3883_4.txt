i saw this with high expectations. come on, it is akshay kumar, govinda, and paresh rawal, who are all amazing at their comedy, i was really hoping for a laugh riot. sadly, that is not what i got at all...<br /><br />unfortunately, nothing in this movie really made me laugh out loud. there were times when i chuckled at one or two things, but nothing really made me laugh. in short, it was badly attempted comedy, and in a way, a bit of a hera pheri wannabe.<br /><br />out of the three main guys, i think paresh rawal's role was the most powerful. it wasn't the biggest role, but it certainly stood out more than govinda or akshay. their performances were okay i guess. nothing special, just mediocre. though govinda stole the limelight from akshay in more than a few scenes. lara dutta and tanushree dutta also make appearances in this film, and both of them were pretty bad. lara's role did not move me, or make me laugh, and tanushree dutta's character just got on my nerves! the music seems to be the only good thing about bhagam bhag. my favourite song is "tere bin", followed by "afreen", which i really liked. "signal" and the title song "bhagam bhag" are also worth a listen.<br /><br />you either will like it or you won't. and judging by the poor comedy and lack of direction, i don't think you will.
