i can't give it less than a star, i tried. at this moment, im not sure if im halfway through it or not, but i stopped actively paying attention around the time part of it was revealed to be a dream. or not. or maybe it was. i think viewers who posted a comment that didn't include the descriptions "horrible" or "awful" or "made me want to swallow a bullet" are probably being nice because it is an indie film. don't listen to them, listen to me- there is no nudity in the movie, skip it. i needed ten lines to submit this warning, so i will also say that the goth girl that some users have described as "hot" is fat. she has fat elephant legs.
