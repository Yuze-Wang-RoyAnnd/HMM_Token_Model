... with a 500$ budget and a bottle of ketchup.<br /><br />if you are a fan of c movies with no talented actors whatsoever, a ridiculous story, cheap effects and lousy camera-work, this film delivers.<br /><br />all others be warned. you could probably make a similar movie with a couple of friends in your backyard and a home camcorder.<br /><br />the film is good for some laughs though. watch it with some friends and discuss how not to make a movie.<br /><br />2/10 for unintentional comedy.<br /><br />why the hell do you have to write 10 lines? i have seen comments with less lines and writing this is just a lame filler.
