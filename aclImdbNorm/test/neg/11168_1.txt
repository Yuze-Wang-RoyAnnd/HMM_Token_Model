stay far away from this film. the fact that you're reading reviews tells me you may have already been tainted by the awfulness it carrys. this is a truely horrid movie... so let's get down to the problems. writing and direction: it wouldnt surprise me if these were handled by a group of overactive gradeschoolers that watched 'scream' and 'i know what you did last summer' a few too many times. giant gaping plot holes abound; while i can't congratulate them for this movie, its nice knowing they're finally potty trained. actors(or lack thereof): only the finest for this film... the finest extras ever to grace a screen, now starring in their speaking role debut! as a disclaimer, i have to note that i am capable of watching and enjoying just about anything. i recognize a good movie when i see it, but i can still giggle and smirk during bubble boy (yes folks, its true); so when i say to avoid something, you know i'm not kidding.
