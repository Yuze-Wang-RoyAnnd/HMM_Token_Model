i couldn't make heads or tails out of this terrible film noir.<br /><br />the plot was confusing, the acting was alright, but the picture quality was awful! though i bought this at a "gansters double pack" (8 movies on two discs) at walmart for $5.50 and when you put the dvd in, it apologizes for the awful picture quality that some of the movies may have.<br /><br />the plot was flip flopping everywhere i couldn't understand it and had no idea what was going on...then "the end" popped up and the movie was over. <br /><br />what a waste of my time!<br /><br />i say don't waste your money or time on this! or if you too bought that gansters double pack then just skip over this one...<br /><br />2/10
