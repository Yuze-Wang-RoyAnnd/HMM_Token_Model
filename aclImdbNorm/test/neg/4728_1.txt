this is not the true story. it is the darkest possible fiction derived from the events. it endorses suicide, morose obsession with death, a totally gratuitous sideswipe at organized religion in general (and the anglican church, in particular) and generally provides a nihilistic, pointless world view from which filmgoers, i suppose, are intended to walk away, richer in their poverty and more hopeful in their hopelessness.<br /><br />utter trash, though attractively performed by a capable cast. that anyone would suggest this is a true rendering, however, is very much false advertising. you want the real story? rent 'fairy tale'. that's the real story. see if you can find any correspondence between the facts presented in either case. i only found one: the girls who made the original photographs were pre-pubescent.
