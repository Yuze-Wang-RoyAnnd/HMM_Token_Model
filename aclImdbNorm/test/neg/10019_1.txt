this is truly, without exaggerating, one of the worst slasher movies ever made. i know, it came out in the 80's following a tendency started by "friday the 13th". "the prey" copies the fore-mentioned movie in many aspects. the woods setting, the killer, the dumb teens, the gore, etc.<br /><br />but "the prey" is as bad as you might expect. i didn't even remember about it if it wasn't for coincidence.<br /><br />well, the killer is in fact human so don't expect a supernatural killer in the likes of jason. the situations rather boring and lack of tension, gore, violence, etc. it just does not works for a slasher flick.<br /><br />the acting is simply horrid. the score is horrible! a combination of boring instruments with cheesy 80's tunes?! i won't even mention the technical aspects of the movie because believe me, it seems that it cost only 20 dollars.<br /><br />please avoid this one like the plague. it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen, and that's something to say. thank god it seems to have vanished from earth.
