why bother to see this movie? it probably rates an award for being the worst career move of a major movie star since clark gable's laughable playing of an irish patriot in parnell.<br /><br />it's inconceivable that bergman would choose both this movie and its director over a lucrative hollywood career where she could choose among the finest scripts and directors being offered at that time. to begin with, there was no script to work with except a few notes. then we are supposed to believe the polished bergman as a poor refugee willing to do anything to be released from a refugee camp, including marriage to a poor italian fisherman she doesn't even love. i read where anna magnani was the original choice for this part. if so, that made a lot more sense than to cast the luminous bergman in such a proletarian part. but since she was in love with her director, common sense flew out the window.<br /><br />so she goes to live in this poor village where the men must toil to extract a meager living from the sea. a place she obviously hates to be and where she doesn't fit in.<br /><br />her only friend is the village priest who knows she's not suited to the life of a poor fisherman's bride, but tells her that for the sake of love she must repress her true feelings of revulsion, and accept the poverty and despair she encounters each day. on top of all of this, there's this volcano always on the brink of erupting and drowning them all in hot lava. but like a true heroine, bergman revolts against her misery by declaring war on just about everyone else in this dreary film. she even goes as far as trying to seduce the village priest, in a scene that would generate laughter if it were not so pathetic. since her poor slob of a husband must lock her in a room to keep her from running away, she's forced to use her body to bribe a married man to take her off the island. to her, no sacrifice is too great; no man unapproachable if he is willing to help her to escape the island and her misery. i won't bother to tell you how this all ends. the no-script movie ending is as plausible as the rest of stromboli. i even remember (from seeing it on late night tv) that it had two different endings! so be warned if you should feel brave enough to sit through this king-size turkey and catch the miscast bergman. it led to her downfall in hollywood for the next seven years and she was condemned for sleeping with her director while still married to peter lindstrom. none of the movies she made with this director(whom she later married) are noteworthy except as proof of a career gone berserk. i kid you not. it's pretty embarrassing.<br /><br />- - soundtrack
