if you are in to bad movies for the entertainment of witnessing bad movies, bad acting, bad production etc..aka mystery science theater 3000 quality....you will love pacific inferno. jim brown will be forever remembered as one of the greatest football players to ever play the game...as an actor he will forever be remembered as one of the greatest football players to ever play the game... i am not sure who rolf bayer was...but i am hoping he was 15 or 16 years old when he directed this, perhaps he may have been the next spielberg in the making...because if he was a grown man directing this...a 15 or 16 year old could have done better.... the basis or plot for the movie probably had some historical merit and maybe even truthfully accurate...but the actual film may be one of worst movies made in american film history...i kept waiting for lee marvin, william holden or charles bronson to pop in to somehow save whatever "face" was left of this film. i would have loved to have been at the red carpet, black tie gala for the hollywood opening when this movie previewed...as this movie had to have many a viewer laughing and cringing under their breath... it is on the dime dvd racks now....look for it for entertainment value...this movie is so bad it is too good to pass up...
