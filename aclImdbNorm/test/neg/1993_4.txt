it's okay ... a few years later chayefsky's classic "network" will be his true cinematic big home run ..., but for now, this dark comedy isn't the classic it aspires to be. it's mostly awful, although it has some good scenes: the first murder victim being found, the e.r. clerk responsible for billing patients making a surprise discovery, drummond's delusional confessional, and the very last scene where scott's character regains his professional integrity and self-respect. it also has some ludicrous scenes: scott's character's whiny monologue during his early visit to the hospital psychiatrist, scott's character's raping rigg's character, dysart's horrible mugging in his brief scenes, and the o.r. doctor pouncing on the operating table to resuscitate the wrong patient because "i already have one malpractice lawsuit".<br /><br />chayefsky also tries too hard throwing every conceivable hurdle at this one hospital (i.e.- the murders, the administrative mistakes, the poor people protesting outside, etc). it might have worked better as a look at the industry as a whole. acting-wise: scott is passable, rigg seems miscast, hughes is inspired, and dysart mugs through out his brief performance. the rest of the cast is too one-dimensional.
