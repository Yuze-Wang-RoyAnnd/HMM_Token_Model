having not read the original book or seen the earlier film, and indeed knowing nothing about the storyline of either of those or the current film, i came to this film with an open mind.<br /><br />it's really difficult to know where to start a comment on the film, because the whole thing seems so confused. it seems like there is a point or a message or something in the film, but what that is remains completely obscure.<br /><br />the effects were fantastic and very well judged. the idea was set up really well with the motivation for time travel clearly made out. however, it was downhill from here.<br /><br />all of the time travel seems to have only the vaguest connection to the quest that was set out at the start. there are some nice ideas, but they seem to be isolated occurrences that really do not flow and make the film seem disjointed and lost. at one point one wonders whether the main story in the film is the fate of the moon.<br /><br />when hartdegen arrives in 802,701 a.d., the film becomes very frustrating as he seems to be unable to discover anything of importance about the eloi, and while it seems clear that there is something to find out, what it is remains annoyingly elusive. this is quite an odd change from the previous time travel instances and one wonders why all of this has suddenly been abandoned for what seems like a completely new story. so many things happen that there should be an explanation for, but there is no discovery. i really, really wanted to know what the film was "getting at", what there was to uncover, but to no avail. having read a summary of what happens in the book at this point, it seems like there has been a very half-hearted attempt to render this in the film but it has been so simplified and "dumbed down" that the meaning and context is completely lost.<br /><br />just as we hope that we are finally to discover where this is all leading, the film suddenly takes another significant change in direction, and becomes a mindless action film without any real action. it is as if by this point the director has simply given up bothering to put any meaning into the film. by now countless significant things are happening without any explanation. hartdegen fails to take the opportunity to return to the past on two occasions for no reason, and then suddenly loses all interest in time travel for no reason. the film comes to an abrupt end as hartdegen decides to stay with the eloi.<br /><br />in summary, after a good start the film is very disappointing. too much time is spent on hartdegen's adventures before arriving with the eloi. however, the worst part of the film is what i think is the most important part: the setting up of the situation with the eloi. the whole point is completely missed, and this undermines the rest of the film. after this the film concentrates too much on effects and action and all attempts to return to the meaning and core of the film seem forced and out of place. with so many things happening without explanation, the film just seems to get lost and lose direction. however, the finale where hartdegen decides he is no longer bothered about time travel is the most inexplicable of all.<br /><br />ultimately, the whole film seemed like a collection of unconnected incidents. the meaning and context was lost, although the gaping hole where it should have been was very obvious. what was so frustrating about it all, though, was that there was clearly so much potential here: it wasn't by any means a bad film, it just so easily could have been so much better. the start was very promising, the time travelling looked fantastic and would have worked had it not gone off on tangents, and hartdegen's experience with the eloi could so easily have worked had a few more of the right questions been asked, and had there not been such a temptation to "dumb down" and simplify. i just wish i had a time machine so that i could travel back in time and advise against the mistakes that were made.
