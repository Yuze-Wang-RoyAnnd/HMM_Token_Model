combine good casting, bad writing, good orchestral scoring, bad dialogue, and good story idea with lots of potential but is never realized then you have slipstream. <br /><br />just bought the movie for a buck, it is worth it, but not much more. <br /><br />good to see mark hamill act again. <br /><br />there should be a decent sequel made to remedy the damage from the original. or at least give it the proper attention it should have received in the first place. <br /><br />berstein's score gave demanded your attention from the opening credits, however, the long shots of slipstream planes and the even longer revealing of interesting plot points mutes his attention getting score. <br /><br />it is really easy to dog a movie like this, after all it is by the producer of starwars and the director of tron and a tremendous cast but it is what it is. and that ain't much.<br /><br />favorite line- "we're going to make it, ha-ha!...(boom!)"
