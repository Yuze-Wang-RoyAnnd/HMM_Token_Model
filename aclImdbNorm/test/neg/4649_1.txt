legendary cameron mitchell turkey about an actor/makeup man who is burned by the head of a studio when a drink is tossed in his face as he is lighting up a cigarette. reduced to a scarred mess and wearing an eye patch mitchell works at the movieland wax museum . he also kidnaps and kills people using a solution which paralyzes them so he can turn them into displays. genuinely bizarre bad movie that defies description. watch as the various wax figures try not to move, watch as the entire tobacco out put for several southern states is consumed
