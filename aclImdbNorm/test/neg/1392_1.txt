what is it now-a-days that minority comedians feel its okay to slander their minority and expect to get away with it? <br /><br />carlos mencia is no george lopez. there is a difference. when watching comedian carlos mencia, i think he hates his own people. and more than that, i think he was forced to pattern his show as the "hispanic/latino/spanish" version of the dave chappelle show. what a horrible mistake. (note to mencia: please do not do a "block party" movie. as much as i would like to see santana, tierra, el chicano, christina agullaria, jennifer lopez, shakira and the reunion of the cast of "xica da silva" on one stage, don't.) <br /><br />carlos mencia likes to use the word "beaners" as much as dave chappelle liked using the "n" word. neither is funny and neither is acceptable, even if it's from 'their own people'. carols mencia also likes to say, "if you're offended, too bad". it's not the offense, it's the defense because of what is being said and asked to be accepted.<br /><br />carols mencia goes further - he disrespects everyone for what he assumes is comedy. it's not comedy, it's not funny. there is a finesse to being able to look at yourself and make others laugh out of comedy and not laugh out of enforcing stereotypes that other races believed in the beginning.<br /><br />mind of mencia needs polishing because carlos mencia needs polishing. find out what is funny and not what will set more prejudices in motion and then - do it. until then, the show, mind of mencia is a pass.
