a group of teenagers discover a bootleg video game, but once they start playing it, they each start dying just like they do in the video game. as they become addicted to the game, they need to find a way to beat the game's central villain, the blood countess, before she kills them all.<br /><br />the premise does sound a little stupid and familiar but this film could have still been mildly entertaining. however, this "horror" movie is not scary at all. it's actually more of a comedy than anything else. the film takes itself way too seriously and the movie is not a lot of fun to watch. sure, there is the occasional laugh but for the most part, the film is very dull. pg-13 horror films can still be good like the ring or cry wolf. the ring and stay alive aren't really the same type of horror film though. stay alive is more of a slasher movie and since its rated pg-13, the death scenes are very tame. it should have been the movie's main sell and since it had an interesting concept the deaths could have been really good. unfortunately, the studio wanted a bigger audience and the film had to be altered.<br /><br />the acting is a complete joke and most of the cast give awful performances. jon foster is not a very good leading man. he lacks charisma to really engage the audience or for the audience to care about him. his character isn't unlikable just very bland. samaire armstrong actually gives an okay performance though a little too bland to truly stick out. frankie muniz probably gives the best performance in stay alive. that's an honor on the level of being the best player on the houston texans. sophia bush is absolutely terrible as october. her performance feels so rushed and so fake. the most annoying character in the movie is phineas played by jimmi simpson. his character is so unlikable you will be rooting for him to die.<br /><br />in fact, most of the characters are pretty unlikable so that makes it even harder to become interested in the film. it's just hard to feel sorry for some of these annoying kids and it's a lot more fun to watch if you want the characters to actually survive. the only real good thing about the movie is the atmosphere. it's a little old but it still kind of works. the film is also really short so it's not too much of a pain to sit through. i wouldn't really blame the cast though because they were working with an inexperience director and writer. the direction is not very good and the screenplay isn't much better. stay alive is actually not the worst horror film of 2006. that honor would go to when a stranger calls. stay alive is still a missed opportunity though. in the end, this cheesy and lame horror film is better left on the shelf. rating 4/10.
