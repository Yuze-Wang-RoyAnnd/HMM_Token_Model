necessary roughness (1991) was a bad comedy/ drama that tried to hard on every level to be a serious film about college football. a lot of current and former superstar athletes appeared in this production during one of the film's comedic highlights. other than that it's a very mediocre movie. they should have just stuck to making a straight out comedy filled with no realism. instead the film makers try to play both fields and they end up on the short end of the stick. when will somebody make a decent film about college football that's funny and realistic?<br /><br />not recommended, unless it's for free on t.v.
