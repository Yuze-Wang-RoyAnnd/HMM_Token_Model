there was some good build up of suspense throughout. the cinematography was surprisingly good considering such minimal budget. we witness occasional spells of good acting, however, this is quickly deflated by some quite cheesy lines. understandably there would not be much of an intellectual conversation to be had, sitting up on trees while a crocodile is stalking you. silence would have been golden here. there could have been a bigger play on suspense than dimly uttering, "i sat in the cupboard for fear of my brother..." something tells me there's a slight difference in getting a beating from your brother than being eaten by a mighty 15ft croc. you decide. throughout the film i can't seem to find a connection or for that matter, sympathy with the characters, perhaps thats because they don't develop one throughout the film, character that is. there are some occasional good scares when the crocodile sneaks up on the characters, overshadowed again by some questionable scenes. in one instance we should be terrified by an ear floating in the water but later we sit beside a decapitated, limbless corpse and only worry about a broken finger. a definite roller coaster of a film when it comes to logic.
