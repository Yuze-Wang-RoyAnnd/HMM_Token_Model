ridiculous film where two swinging college graduates move out to california and one becomes a movie star and the other his manager.<br /><br />as 10 years pass, the star's popularity is decreasing so it is determined that there will be a television show where women will compete for his affection. <br /><br />the film is obnoxious and ridiculous. the girls who vie for lover boy are made to look foolish. only one girl seems to be the choice of the producer of the show. she is really an amateur up against some of the other women, but she is wholesome and brings good ratings to the show as well.<br /><br />by the third scene you realize that the manager is falling for her.<br /><br />we know that ryan really was meant to be a bachelor. while the ending is somewhat cute, you really know where this was going.
