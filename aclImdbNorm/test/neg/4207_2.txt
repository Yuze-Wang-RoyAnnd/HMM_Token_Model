i caught this movie a few years ago one night, and it was one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. however, since it is supposed to be an action movie, i cannot give it more stars since the humor was unintentional.<br /><br />chuck norris plays a truck driver who comes home from the road to see his family, and within the first five minutes the conflict arises which leads chuck to seek vengeance for the rest of the film. good thing too, 'cuz the sub-par acting by everyone involved was starting to get old very fast. actually, the judge was pretty good, but i can't really describe what makes him work, you'll have to check it out for yourself.<br /><br />and the custom van chuck norris drives is hideously classic!
