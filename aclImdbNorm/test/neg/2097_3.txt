overall, this is a pretty bad film. but for $5 at pathmark, it wasn't a total waste.<br /><br />the whole scenario has to do with a guy who is with this lady infected with snakes, supposedly from a magic curse. the actors/actresses aren't names that are big (even though some look like from tv shows), so i won't do my usual troy mcclure thing.<br /><br />for awhile, the film holds your interest as the couple hop a train and travel to l.a. to see a shaman to undo the curse. there's a bit of other plots going on too; like two ladies smuggling drugs.<br /><br />but the last 20 minutes turn out to be a total let down. as violent and gory as the whole film is, the grand finale is just totally computer animated.<br /><br />i saw the unrated version which had tons of language, gore, blood, violence, everything! the bonus features were ok.<br /><br />overall grade: d-
