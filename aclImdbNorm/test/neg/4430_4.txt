this tatty am dram adaptation scrambles soulessly through the plot of dickens' wonderful book, replacing the emotional impact with hurried transitions and any exterior locations with drawings. it's not the fault of the actors and the production team that the budget is so low, of course, but you have to question the point of making this in the first place when there's neither the time nor money to do it justice. michael hordern's scrooge is far too gentle at the outset, making his transformation lack power, and this isn't helped along by a lack of reaction from him as he watches the visions. the other actors range from acceptable (clive merrison, paul copley), to non-committal (bernard lee) to seeming like they're about to forget their lines (john le mesurier). it doesn't even score points for effort, to be honest.
