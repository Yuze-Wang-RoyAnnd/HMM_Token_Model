always enjoy the classic horror films, however, this film was really a big waste of time and if it were not for john carradine playing the mad man doctor who is able to control human beings through his experiments. this film was made during ww ii and john carradine was a german nazi working to find a human weapon against the entire world. bob steele playing in many roles as a cowboy or gangster and in this picture bob seemed bored to death with his role in this film and acted like this was his first film. mantan moreland, (jeff) gave an outstanding performance with great comedy which helped keep the audience attention. i hate to criticize a film made in 1943, but this is really a big disappointment. if you like john carradine and the roles he played as count dracula throughout many films during the 1940's, you just might like to watch john doing his best.
