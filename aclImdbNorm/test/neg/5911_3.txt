just read through the other comments here, and was a little surprised to find that no one had said anything about the acting or plot.<br /><br />richard pryor and eddie murphy can both deliver an amazing stand-up comedy show. great actors they are not. enough about that.<br /><br />as for the plot? oh man. every time the movie tries to "fool" you into believing the good-guys are going to lose, you know those scenes: "what? the good-guys loses? oh.. i see, it was just a trick", it's done so terribly bad, you can spot it a mile away.<br /><br />it had 2 or 3 funny moments, but not enough to save the day.<br /><br />it's a little silly that these comments has to be 10 lines now. a lot of people will fill it up with crap, for it to be eligible. being brief is an art.
