after reading other reviews on this site, we weren't sure if we were going to be able to critique this movie because it didn't sound bad enough. however, 2 minutes into the movie, we knew we were in for another flop. no summer is complete without ice cream, but this movie served up a melted, sour, broken-bottomed ice cream cone (you know, the kind that leaves you sticky and dirty and looking for a wet-nap). the biggest problem with this movie was the plot. what was it? it appeared to be a psychotic ice cream man driving around the neighborhood. that's it. nothing else happens. first of all, what are the qualifications for becoming an ice-cream man in this crap town? 1. spend several years in the most ridiculous mental hospital known to man. this hospital was plagued with clowns, graffiti, fake plastic sunflowers, and oversized syringes to the head. 2. have extremely poor hygiene and a mutant face to scare the kids away. 3. make sure your truck is stocked with severed body parts, roaches, and don't forget the eye whites!<br /><br />the actors in this movie are pure b-movie caliber. mixed in with a bunch of unknowns is, who other than....a trailer-trash version of macaulay culkin!! even his bratty charm couldn't save this kick in the pants. there seemed to be no rhyme or reason for any of the murders in this movie. the whole concept of the movie reeked! who would kill an ice cream man in a drive-by shooting? gangsters? fiends? vanna white? who? we are still struggling with this question.<br /><br />whoever was in charge of the wardrobe for this movie should be immediately blacklisted from hollywood. did they honestly think a pillow under a kid's shirt would make the audience believe that he was really fat? did they forget about the arms, face, legs, and all other body parts? second of all, this movie was made in 1995, yet the wardrobe seemed to be picked from a lame 80's movie, evidenced by the big brother's white, crotch-hugging high-water pants.<br /><br />while we were watching this shotty production, we both developed severe cases of add. we found ourselves leaving the room to walk around aimlessly. at many points it the movie, we found that staring at a blank wall behind the t.v. set was more entertaining than the actual movie. we were stunned that this movie didn't make it to the bottom 100. afterwards, we took the tape out of the vcr and left it on the black top to melt like a sub-standard ice cream cone.
