'tycus' is almost as bad as a science fiction film can go.<br /><br />i can hardly find something good to say about this film. the premises are completely wrong. a comet is supposed to hit the moon and cause catastrophic damage to earth, but nobody believes the scientist who predicts this.a whole underground city plus a launching pad for nuclear armed rockets is build in the california mountains without anybody noticing. when the comet nears earth the news make it to the tv and newspapers hardly a day before the event. and so on, and so on ...<br /><br />neither does any kind of emotion make it to the screen. is the genius who discovers the comet and builds the underground city a savior of humanity or a beast? the director or dennis hooper who is playing the role did not seem to decide until the film was done, and actually it does not make any difference because acting and directing is so confusing that you end by wondering what does this film try to say. the special effects are so cheap that not only that they cannot be convincing in the era of computer effects, but they could not have been convincing even in the 50s, four decades before this film was made.<br /><br />a total waste of time.
