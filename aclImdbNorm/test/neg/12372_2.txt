this terrible moovie is fun on many levels - the moost obvious is the lame, fake-looking bird puppet which floats around the cheap sets, without ever flapping it wings (like it was on a string, perhaps?), attacking model trains and toy cars. the "science" is asinine - a masonic atom gun?? and what's up with the enormous amounts of brylcream in everyone's hair? i guess the 50's were the slimeball decade! well, this bird puppet apparently comes from "some god-forsaken anti-matter universe", and it's here to build a nest & lay eggs in new york. seriously. that they manage to kill the puppet is almost a shame. i give it 1 hoof out of 4 - it's silly and stupid, but moore fun than armageddon. :=8)
