this is the worst film i have ever seen, so bad it is astonishing. i am glad that i have never seen that black sidekick in any other film: ok, it wasn't his fault that someone gave him those lines, but he could have refused the role, and tried to learn how to act instead. how did anyone get the money to put this film together. is there some corporation in hollywood that deals with trash for male college students with no brain? "oh yeah, they will love this one: it's got no believable plot, some kungfu movements, chuck norris, a black sidekick with bad corny lines, a sweet little israeli (or is he an arab, or does anyone care?) boy pickpocket, and the devil." brilliant, and many thanks to all concerned for enriching the human race.
