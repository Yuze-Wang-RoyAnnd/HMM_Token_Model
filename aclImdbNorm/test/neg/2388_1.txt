four guys (jacks) go into the restaurant business with a fifth guy and lose all common sense. they allow themselves to be abused worse than textile workers at the turn of the century without simply leaving the situation. this is truly one of the worst films i have ever seen. i just hope i can resell this item to someone who might like it. <br /><br />it is true that it holds your attention if you can let the illogical plot developments not bother you too much. it is very silly throughout however especially once a stranger enters the restaurant. who is he? guess.<br /><br />
