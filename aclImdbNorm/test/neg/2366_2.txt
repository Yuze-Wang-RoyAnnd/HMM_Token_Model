a good ol' boy film is almost required to have moonshine, car chases, a storyline that has a vague resemblance to "plot" and at least one very pretty country gal, barefoot with short shorts and a low top. the pretty gal is here (dressed in designer jeans)-- but the redneck prerequisites stop there. jimmy dean is a natural as a sausage spokesman but as a tough guy former sheriff, he comes up way short. big john is big, but he isn't convincing with the "bad" part of his moniker. bug-eyed jack elam is a hoot as always and bo hopkins has been playing this same part for decades; ned beatty also does his part in a small role... but there is no story. it smells more like an episode of in the heat of the night than a feature film. cornball cornpone with easily predictable sentiment. perhaps the most glaring problem with this movie is charlie daniels singing the theme. you know the one; it was made famous by... jimmy dean.
