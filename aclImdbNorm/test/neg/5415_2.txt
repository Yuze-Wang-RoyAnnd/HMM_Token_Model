this movie tries to rip off predator, but that movie is much better. this movie has truly terrible special effects and a mindless plot. the team that enters the forest to find the cause of the disappearances of military and scientist is a combo of rough and rugged male delta commandos and pretty but tough female rangers. none of them are too bright. all the characters seem to be more than willing to run off into the forest alone and headfirst into a spear or sword and their death. some of the pyrotechnics are very big and must have cost a bundle. but the close-ups of the creature are laughable as are most of the death scenes. every clich'e that the writers could think of was used. if you're looking for a mindless slaughter fest, this may fill the bill. the night i watched this was very slow so i sat through the whole thing. i have to admit that it's been a while since i watched something this bad. there is very little to redeem this movie. i'm amazed that junk like this gets produced.
