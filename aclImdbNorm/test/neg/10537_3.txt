this is, for different reasons, a very very bad action movie. first of all, seagal is terribly out of shape. he looks old and fat, plays like he has to fulfill an annoying obligation and his fight scenes require creative editing or plain replacement. secondly, his opponent is a very weak villain. this is about a smart and mean masterbrain and chestnut does not deliver. so what about the action ? well, the two parties permanently shoot at each other in different locations of the alcatraz jail. they shoot wild and bad, because compared to the amount of required ammunition, the bodycount is rather low. there is nothing to save this movie. there is not a single good line and not a single good joke. the little psychological interlude with 49er one and judge mcpherson is ridiculous. so what does it have? well, the usual bell helicopters, silhouettes moving in blue light and slow motion, doors riddled with bullets and 1000 watt lights shining through the holes, characters jumping through the air while shooting, loads of weapons coming from nowhere, a long black coat containing a bold black guy and a thin wooden box containing 25 tons of gold. the pain continues to the very last take, a hopeless approach to lighten up the closing credits. californian beachboy don michael paul was writing and directing. at least this mountain of boredom comes from just one simple mind.
