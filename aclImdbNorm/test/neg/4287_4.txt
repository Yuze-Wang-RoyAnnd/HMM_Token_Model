in this film gary oldman plays a defense attorney, who was formerly a prosecutor. he is a bit tormented, but is more or less playing a regular guy rather than some sort of figurative or literal monster. funny thing is, he doesn't quite pull it off. i guess you can't quite get to normal from there. kevin bacon was sufficiently creepy. the scene in the park was way too long with way too many false scares. and the odd sex scene with oldman and karen young seemed to have come from a different movie, although the rest of the time miss young did just fine. this film suffers from oddness trying to cover up the predictability. and failing. don't bother.
