it's literally the three stooges all over again, without the charm. this show's nothing more than the worst slapstick. i'm surprised they actually have writers. the so-called jokes are completely haphazard, and 'controversial' for no other point than trying very (very) hard to be controversial. and people think this is 'edgy'?? get a clue: this show takes absolutely no thought, time, effort, money, or creativity/originality to produce. any references present are geared toward anyone between the ages of 6 and 16 who would occasionally browse people magazine. but i suppose this is only what all the kiddies want, like and need today.
