it may have been thrilling for an audience in 1946, but the movie is now a bit boring. i had a hard time sitting through the whole thing, and it was very predictable: i mean, we know from the beginning of the movie that welles is the nazi war criminal, and i'll give you one guess as to whether he is caught and appropriately punished in the end.<br /><br />not worth watching. it's sad that welles only made three movies worth seeing in his long career: kane, ambersons, and a touch of evil.
