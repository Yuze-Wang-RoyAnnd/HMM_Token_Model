i liked the first the grudge. it really creeped me out and it had something to it that made me want to see it twice. that something was missing from this sequel. there was no creativity, nothing new or original, nothing that really sticks to your mind. it's people dying because a scary ghost comes out of the shadows and says boo. and most of the time, it wasn't even all that scary.<br /><br />plot-wise this movie is a dead end. amber tamblyn is a good actress, but she was given nothing to do, and karen's death seemed really unsatisfactory because it came so quickly. i was also disappointed in the kayako's mother subplot. i was thinking that she might provide some way to fight the grudge, but she dies in the hands - hair? - of kayako. that was such a stupid twist. all in all, it's difficult to feel for characters that you know from minute one are going to die. all in the same way. and there's nothing they can do. it doesn't feel like a cruel destiny awaiting them. it's just boring, because you know what's going to happen. if they had anything to fight it with, that would have added suspense, even if they failed. if there was any hope, it would make the scares more justified. now you're just waiting for them to die.<br /><br />kayako was really scary in the first movie, but this time we saw her too many times and that took away some of it. i was still scared during some scenes, but i actually got used to the huge eye and blue face. the makers obviously realized this would happen as they added other scary ghosts. yes, i was scared at the school psychologist scene - even if i knew where it was going as soon as she said "i've been to the house". a nice touch. toshio, however, was not scary at all in this movie. i was much more creeped out by the non-blue toshio with black eyes and a blank stare that sometimes appeared in the first movie. a blue boy sitting in the corner does nothing for me.<br /><br />some of the characters seemed really unnecessary - the notorious milk-scene with the girl whose name i can't even remember comes to mind. i wasn't scared, it was just "huh?" i'm not sure if the schoolgirls were even really needed. karen could have brought the grudge to the us with her. it could have killed people related to her life, everyone at the funeral, or something like that. even so, it would have been dull to watch them all die, but being introduced to so many unrelated people really felt annoying. hated the "i won't call you mother" scene. aubrey's mother issues were equally dull. the little boy was a touching character, though.<br /><br />the ju-on sequel was much scarier than this one. it had some new twists - dreams and reality blurring much more, for instance - and even if it left me feeling quite down, i was also somehow satisfied. i got to think a bit and be left wondering. this movie only provided cheap scares.
