i'll say one thing for herman, usa: it will probably always play well to minnesota audiences. i can't imagine that there's another place in the world where a reference to the fast life of bemidji or a line like "i knew there was something wrong with iowa guys" would bring down the house. i actually quite enjoyed the first hour or so. basically, a bunch of lonely country boys take out a personals ad and find their town beset with willing female suitors (is suitors a gender-specific word?). it ain't progressive, to be sure, but it's sorta charming in its own right. pity that the filmmakers felt the need to tack on a contrived subplot about a conniving golddigger and her violent husband. overall it's just too cloying for its own good, but you've got to give some props to a film with the guts to give a guy with kevin chamberlin's build a nude love scene. i will always applaud the depiction of people who don't meet the usual standards of beauty as sexual, caring human beings, but that's not enough to redeem herman, usa. to paraphrase jello biafra, it's nostalgia for an age that never existed.
