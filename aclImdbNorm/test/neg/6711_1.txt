two things are changed from then.first of all i am not a kid anymore,and second most of new seagal movies are just terrible.this is on my opinion the worst movie ever made with derailed starred by jean claude van damme.there is no plot in this movie,the plot is just an excuse to shoot some terrible action scenes which are painful to watch.i love action movies,but this is not an action movie....this isn't a movie...this is a group of irritating scenes which are connected in annoying way to kill the viewers love for the action movies.i am sorry but i don't have any respect for anyone who liked this movie.he has a serious intelligence problem then.i hope that seagal will make some new good movies in the future.good luck for him !
