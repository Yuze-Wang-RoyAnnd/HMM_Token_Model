when i attended college in the early 70s, it was a simpler time. except for a brief occurrence in 1994, i've been totally free of the influence of illegal substances ever since and i've never regretted it...until now. db:tbte has got to be, hands-down, the best movie to watch when stoned. the odd, dreamlike state it creates is very strange when you're not smoking anything, but i'm sure that it would seem completely normal after a big doobie. (not that i'm recommending this, you understand.) the soothing narration, provided, as it usually is in quality cinema, by a tb victim trapped in a painting, would be ideal to help the stoned viewer to follow along as things get complicated. plus, everything in the film is pretty organic...from old-fashioned natural breasts to the bucket of fried chicken.<br /><br />now, there's also no question that the young man with the (ahem) "hand problem" is absolutely sailing away in the film. at one point, you just know that he's going to say, "hey! when i move my hand, it leaves trails!!" trust me...you'll know when you get to that point.<br /><br />the only other thing we have to address is this: how good can a film be when at least half the budget was spent on moving a huge bed frame around for interior and exterior shots? <br /><br />definitely a must-see for horror aficionados, but suitable for the general audiences under the right conditions (if you know what i mean, and i think that you do). it only earns four stars because i can't actually say that it took any talent to make.
