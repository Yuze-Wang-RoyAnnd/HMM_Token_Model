all the airport movies are stinkers, but this one is the biggest turkey of them all. the formula was different for this one because it focused on two disastrous flights and a lot of plot occurring on the ground, while the other movies focused on just one disastrous flight and less plot on the ground. the stunts with the concorde are worth watching for the laughs, although the special effects aren't as terrible as i'd expect for a movie of this quality made in 1979. george kennedy's sexist remarks are disgusting and his rendezvous with a prostitute in paris is totally unnecessary (and made me gag a little). poor martha raye was relegated to a role where she did nothing but relieve her bowel over and over in the concorde's bathroom. there are no big stars in this movie compared to the previous films, giving you one more reason not to watch this one.
