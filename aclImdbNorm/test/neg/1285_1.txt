what a waste of precious time! my 5-year-old daughter brought this home from my mother's house, and we watched it as a family. none of us liked it. this wretched little film, rife with glaring inconsistencies, overt christian themes and horrible film quality, is not worth watching even on a dare. it felt a bit like a bad high-school drama class attempt at film making. how sad to see talented actors (chris atkins, gary busey, and company) flounder their way through this trite and insipid storyline. the only good thing i can say about this movie is that the dog is cute. the film can should have gone straight to the pound. avoid this film - your time is better spent watching paint dry.
