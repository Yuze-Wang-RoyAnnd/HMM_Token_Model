"death machines" takes a fairly decent premise for an action movie (unstoppable martial arts killing machines sent out to eliminate a crime boss' opponents) and turns it into an unwatchable mess. i have rarely seen such a breath taking combination of tiny budget, bad acting and incoherent script released as a so-called "movie". it's easily the worst martial-arts/action oriented movie i've seen in years, eclipsing even "ninja holocaust" (which at least had some good energetic fight scenes). <br /><br />the actual "star" of the movie is the white "death machine", (it's basically his vehicle) so he is featured prominently in many more scenes than his two cohorts. he's in good shape, and he's not bad looking, but as an actor he's barely there - think chuck norris in "the octagon",only without any energy or emotion.this is obviously a deliberate choice on the part of the actor and director...but you have to be arnold to pull this kind of thing off, and this guy is no arnold.<br /><br />the movie (and the director) can't seem to find the time (or the budget) to film the scenes that would have answered the basic questions that it originally posed, like: who was the shadowy figure giving the marbled-mouthed asian lady her orders? how did the "gang war" end? why did the mush-mouthed asian lady decide to have her zombie assassins killed? and what the heck happened that left her assistant dead and her wielding a katana like a broom stick? <br /><br />it does, however, find the time to film a completely extraneous bar fight in which a sailor (well, he looked like popeye) destroys a bar because the juke box didn't work. it's only related to the rest of the film because in the process he also k.o.'s the movie's "hero", a bartender/karate student who was a victim of the "death machines" first major assignment (he got his hand chopped off while they were killing his teacher). it follows this up with one of the most un-called for "love scenes" between the hero and his girlfriend i have ever watched. the segue makes no sense - at the end of the bar-fight, she's grimacing over his splayed limp body, and the next thing they are in a "tasteful" shadow montage of sex and love that looks like it came from a hallmark card. btw, we never see the sailor again. <br /><br />and wait until you see the showdown between the homicide detective and his captain - it plays as if the director and screenwriter never actually saw a movie scene placed inside a police station, but had heard of them second hand and decided to include some without really knowing how they worked. <br /><br />the movie is a textbook case of poor casting and community theater-level actors floundering without decent direction. the three "death machines" come across as clods; the "hero" knows his lines but can't carry the movie, given that his character is an ineffective wimp; his girlfriend is a charisma vacuum; and all the other minor parts are barely watchable. all this makes for a fairly poor movie- but the "dragon lady" does more to drag the movie into subterranean stinker territory than anyone or anything else. she looks ridiculous; her tiny, inexpressive face is overpowered by her ton-o-hair skyscraper wig, she wears her red silk dress like a bathrobe, and she talks with a terrible mush-mouth delivery that screams "needed time with a dialog coach". poor lady - she was obviously way out of her element, and as far as i know, never appeared in a film again. <br /><br />add to this a low-budget one-synthesizer soundtrack that never shuts up and never plays anything appropriate or interesting; crappy film stock and lighting; fight choreography that is strictly from hunger; and a general all around dreariness and lack of energy in the blocking and the stage business...and you have one lame movie. <br /><br />i got this as part of a 50 movie dvd compilation, so it probably cost me about 50 cents to watch it. it wasn't worth it. feh!
