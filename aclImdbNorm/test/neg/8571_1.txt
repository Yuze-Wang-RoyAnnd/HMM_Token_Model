review: nunsploitation films. they've been around since forever. a few that pop to mind are the mexican devil worshiping movie alucarda, night of the demons 2, the convent and of course dante tomasellis desecration. cant blame somebody for trying to exploit a religious/holy image and twisting it around to make it scary. if done right, it works. here comes the most recent addition to the nunsploitation sub-genre simply titled the nun.<br /><br />the story is about this group of girls that live in a catholic school. in this school there's a nun who is particularly cruel to one of the girls. the girls acting in self defense against the abusive nun accidentally kill her and then decide to bury her and tell no one. fast forward 18 years later and the nun is back searching for revenge from those who killed her.<br /><br />this movie was produced by brian yuznas fantastic factory. you know, the company that makes horror movies in spain. need a reminder of the kind of movies that this company churns out? well heres a small reminder: arachnid, darkness, romasanta: the werewolf hunt, rottweiler. you get the picture. about the only really good movie that this company has produced (in my opinion) was stuart gordons dagon. thats it. oh no, wait, i believe they also produced the excellent christian bale vehicle the machinist. but thats it. so when i consciously rented this movie, i knew i wasn't going to watch anything that was mind blowingly good. still, with all that mental preparation i was disappointed.<br /><br />one of the only good things this movie has going for it is its slick look. the movie has some nice cinematography. it doesn't look like a cheap horror film. the movies special effects were alright, with the nun being able to travel through water. well, that was an image that lended it self for some cool fx moments that sometimes scratched into cheesy territory but sometimes were cool enough to watch. i dug that scene with the nun hurling herself at people like a bucket of water. its not a particularly deadly move, but it made for a cool visual. there's some gore here but not a lot of it. one particular scene involving an elevator death was cool, but sadly the movie hit its peak with that scene. and it was only half way through. after that, nothing really cool happens and the movie deludes into an incredible borefest.<br /><br />the movie just turns into the nun popping up every now and then to give us a boo scare, she would kill someone and then cut! we get back to the characters talking crap, going through rooms, opening doors, you get the drill. and i just personally hate it when a horror movie turns into that. people opening doors and going into rooms. boring! and when the characters do talk its terrible dialog. in one particularly stupid scene a character decides right out of the blue that the nun turns into flesh and blood whenever she is in the water so thats they way to go to try and kill her. and everyone just says ok! and they all elaborate this plan to kill the nun in a water tank. now, who gave that guy this info and why did the others just take it for granted? who the hell knows, but its scenes like that that make the movie look stupid.<br /><br />and yet another thing that got in the way of my enjoyment of this film was the fact that they used spanish actors who have a very thick accent. when they try to speak english its very hard to make out what the hell they are trying to say. id prefer to have them be dubbed then try and figure out what they are saying and become frustrated. the fact that this dvd has no english subtitles didn't help matters either.<br /><br />so in conclusion, this is a movie that has some slick visuals, nice sound effects but a terrible terrible script. i guess this just goes to show that you might have the biggest budget or the best special effects, but if your movie has a bad script with terrible characters and situations that your audience cant connect with, then you've still got a bad movie. such was the case with the nun.<br /><br />if you want to have some real fun with evil nuns, rent any of the films i mentioned at the beginning of this review. now, as for the makers of this film, they should go say ten hail maries and light fifty candles to their saint of choice to see if they'll be forgiven for making this sinfully terrible film.<br /><br />rating: 2 out of 5.
