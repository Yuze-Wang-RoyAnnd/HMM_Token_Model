..."flight of the living dead" sports production values that belie the substandard script from director scott "i'm a producer, can'tcha tell?" thomas and two hacks who shall remain nameless because i feel sorry for them having to attach those no-names to this turkey. apparently actually shot on film, this direct-to-dvd release has almost nothing going for it that you haven't seen or heard a hundred times already.<br /><br />despite the presence of a number of recognizable character actors like richard "three o'clock high" tyson, erick "stargate" avari, and raymond j. "little children" barry, and a slew of others not so recognizable, "fold" is predominantly populated with cardboard, most of which ends up soaked in unconvincing fake blood. there are a few (precious few) gags that work (the umbrella and the zombie trapped in his seat both come to mind), but most of the scripting is pedestrian and comic-book stupid, and i am here to assure you that we're talking pedestrian and stupid. you'll never for a second believe that "fold" is anything but a cheap cash-in movie with pretensions of cool. god forbid it ever spawn the sequel its idiotic ending promises.<br /><br />strictly freebie viewing, depending on how impecunious your local library is, and otherwise suitable for insomniacs and the indiscriminate only.
