this show is just another bad comedy which will probably be cancelled after two seasons. it's not just that the jokes are sexist/racist/homophobic, they're also not funny and clich'ed. in the first episode the father said something along the lines of ' i wish women didn't go out and get jobs and have the same rights as men blah blah blah' that really helps attitudes huh? then he was making fun of his son saying he was weird. what parent says their kid is weird? so overall this show is boring, unoriginal, offencive, clich'ed and most of all not funny. yeah american dad's offencive. but it does also make you laugh and is obviously taking the micky. thats the difference.
