i just have to comment on this movie because i gave it a 4 rating, and in my opinion that's pretty high for a softporn smut movie. the actual plot is kind of hokey (who would expect otherwise) but hafron is so incredibly funny, and he delivers everything in a cyborgish voice so it's easy for him. whoever wrote the script had some wit definitely! i must have laughed out loud ten times, and that's not a reason anyone would pick up this movie. the only softporn movie i've seen which had any merit other than beautiful women (and believe me, emmanuelle is drop dead gorgeous...just look at the cover!)<br /><br />any movie that can entertain me considering how poor the plot was and how bad the acting is, also considering the movie wasn't made to artistically entertain, so to speak, it gets at least a four in my book. i mean, who wouldn't watch this before stop! or my mom will shoot?
