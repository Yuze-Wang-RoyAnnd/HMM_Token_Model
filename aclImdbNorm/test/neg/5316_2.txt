get shorty was an excellent film. it was funny and had the perfect balance of highly comical acting and a serious plot. be cool is like some cheap knock-off trying to pass for a sequel. john travolta as chili palmer seems to have forgotten that he was ever in the mob. he plays it like he's a bored movie exec, rather than a bored movie exec who used to be a shylock. uma thurman, great in nearly every role she's ever played, comes off as strained and confusing. is she supposed to be ditzy or clever? the chemistry between her and travolta is strained and uncomfortable. other than that, just add every movie clich'e you can think of. a well-educated rap producer by cedric the entertainer, an inept gangster wannabe in andre 3000, the girl with heart, soul, and a good set of pipes in christina milian, a gimmicky black dude wannabe in vince vaughn, and a stupid celebrity cameo by stephen tyler. the only funny part was the rock, who invents his own new clich'e as a gay samoan bodyguard actor wannabe. probably the biggest crime is the plot: it makes no sense. get shorty was clever with chili playing one group against another and coming out on top. but this film tries that with about a million different characters. and even chili doesn't seem to know what's going on. fans of get shorty be warned: this is a very different, very worse movie.
