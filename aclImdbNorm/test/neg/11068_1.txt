i am an avid movie watcher and i enjoy a wide variety of films. however, i found no enjoyment in this movie. it is probably the worst movie i have ever seen. i do not feel that it had much of a storyline, the characters were not likable and the relationship between the characters was dysfunctional at best, and the ending only made me dislike the movie more. it is definitely not in the same category as "the cave" which was, in my opinion, the best cave movie ever made. even "the descent" was better than this movie.<br /><br />it was a waste of the $3.79 rental fee and of my time to watch this. do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one.
