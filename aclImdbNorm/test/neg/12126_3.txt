the plot of "open graves" is very simple:it's about a board game called mamba,where the players die in real life the same way they die in the game.laughable death scenes include killings via computer generated crabs and snakes.the characters are cardboard and deliberately annoying and there isn't even a tiny bit of suspense.i liked eliza dushku in "wrong turn",but she is completely wasted and unmemorable here.the climax with cgi-witch coming from the sea is utterly laughable and stupid.the only reason to see "open graves" are some interesting camera angles plus sexy eliza dushku.if such movies are the future of horror then i seriously give up.give me any 70's or 80's low-budget horror flick over this modern piece of crap.a generous 3 out of 10.
