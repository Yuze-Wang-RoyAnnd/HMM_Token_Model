most of the positive comments posted here are as verbose as the movie! it takes a long-winded bore to appreciate a wordy and boring film, one supposes. some have merely called the film "contemplative", meaning slow and devoid of plot, however, one dutch reviewer hit the nail on the head: this is an important event turned into a dull film whose tone is set in the very first scene. here a young couple is being shown an apartment by a realtor who, predictably, talks non-stop and regardless of what else is going on. so does just about every other character!<br /><br />the only silences in this picture are dream sequences--1930's soviet propaganda snippets--and they are also its most interesting parts. this tells you something about how watchable the rest of the movie is.<br /><br />the device of filming most of the scenes in extreme closeup--as if one were looking through a crack in the blinds--gets old fast.
