this is one of the most horrible 'scary' movies i've seen for awhile. i had to wonder if john ryhs-davies was just bored and wanted a distraction to do this movie. th chupacabra looked like a cross between the sleetaks from land of the lost and the creature from the black lagoon. additionally they should have used someone who was a bit smaller as the chupacabra of legend is much smaller. all in all however the movie was soo bad it was funny. why couldn't bullets and electrocution stop the chupacabra but the captain's kick-boxing daughter do ok?? watch if you are sick at home or feeling down and need a good laugh.
