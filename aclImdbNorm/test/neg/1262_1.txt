do you ever wonder what is the worst movie ever made? stop wondering. i'm telling you, michael is it!<br /><br />it is not "heartwarming," "entertaining," or "travolta at his best." it just sucks. if i had kids, i would let them watch deep throat before michael!<br /><br />a sold-out john travolta, a washed-up and balding william hurt, and an about to die any time now jean stapleton highlight this turd of a film.<br /><br />but wait...you'll get to hear andie mcdowell sing! yeah. hollywood really s**t all over us with this one!
