what a terrible movie this was! i made it about 50 minutes into it and started skipping chapters until the end. the plot is nothing special, and the dialog from the movie deviates from the main story so much that your head will explode out of rage. many useless minutes wasted just listening to characters jabber on about something irrelevant to the plot, and/or something that could said in a shorter amount of time. the camera work is shaky, and grainy. it seemed mr. milligan needed to take his finger off of the zoom button! i noticed also that at some points during this movie it seemed that andy was having seizures, and would uncontrollably shake the camera. the splices between scenes were jumpy and didn't flow. the murder scenes were nothing special - incredibly, and laughably fake. barely any gore, as the title suggests. this movie runs about 1 hour 20 minutes and the murder scenes take up about 1 minute total of the whole movie - if that. what a wretched piece of garbage this movie was. andy milligan is in fact probably one of the worst directors to plague mankind with his talentless directing, and camera-work. usually, i can make it through really bad horror movies, and laugh about it later. bloodthirsty butchers, however, i can't. i am just angry i wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this (what i wouldn't do to gain it back). take my suggestion, and do not see this movie unless you plan on falling asleep. terrible.
