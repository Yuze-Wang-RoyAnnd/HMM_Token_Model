this is beyond a shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie i have ever seen. it's been a long time since i've seen it, but the jokes are not funny, the plot is painfully forseeable, calling the main characters stupid is to vastly upgrade their intelligence...uggh! i just wanted to punch tom arnold and make him cry because he wasted two hours of my life when i was done watching this piece of cinematic filth. i don't even know why i ever wanted to watch it, but remember if you see this movie: don't say i didn't warn you.<br /><br />ps tom arnold's character sings a song in this movie called "i'm my own grandfather." nuff said.
