just in case the title didn't give it away - this movie is garbage.<br /><br />short review? yeah.<br /><br />i decided to spend as much time writing this review as hollywood probably decided to put into the script. i doubt it'll be published considering how poorly i worded everything but if this is and anyone reads it -- stick to cherishing the first sandlot movie. it completely surpasses its predecessors in every single way. the sequels aren't ever worth buying or seeing and everyone involved in making them should be ashamed for ruining what has to be one of the most classic, original films of our childhood.
