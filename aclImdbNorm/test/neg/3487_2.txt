the bad news: the canadian version of beast in the cellar released by maple pictures that i saw was of poor quality. dark and washed out, it appeared to be dubbed haphazardly from a vhs tape. it even skips at one point due to some missing frames.<br /><br />the good news: this movie is so bad that the poor quality of the dvd detracted little from my viewing enjoyment. this horror movie fails to build tension and lacks scares. it is a horrorless horror film. while most frightening films have limited dialog, beast in the cellar is a gabfest, so much so that a character will repeat something we have just heard said by two other characters. presumably, all the chit chat acts as filler for a very low budget, unimaginative movie. unfortunately, the dialog isn't campy enough to make it worth a watch.
