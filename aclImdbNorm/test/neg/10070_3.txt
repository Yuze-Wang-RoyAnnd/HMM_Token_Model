jp3 lacks the spielberg touch. it's an all-out assault on the senses featuring "in your face" dinosaurs. watching this film was a bit like a roller coaster ride from hell. <br /><br />the script is lame; it simultaneously asks and then leaves too many questions unanswered. also, we don't really get to appreciate the humans in the film for all they're worth. for example, william h. macy is too great a talent to have to compete with dino-thugs for our attention. and laura dern was especially sympathetic in jp1; in this film, she's barely a blip on the radar screen.<br /><br />the whole jp3 experience was t o o m u c h. too much noise, too many surprises, too many characters dying off, too much predictable, gratuitous violence. <br /><br />word to the wise: vote yourself off this island.<br /><br />(i rated it a 3 for special effects; i took off the other 7 points for having absolutely no originality.)
