not much to say other than plenty of wire-fu and supposed sholin monks ego-tripping about kung-fu and caricature japanese plotting to take over china. all of this would not be so bad if not for the utterly fake japanese sword fighting. if you watched a samurai movie or two you can tell that the "japanese" fighting in the movie is simply the same "kung-fu" (really circus acrobats) stunt men doing the same things except with a japanese sword. however, there are a couple of fun moments such as when a japanese woman ninja tears off her clothes in mid-flight to disarm a monk and captures him with a fishing net. storywise, there seems to be a bit of schizophrenia as far as whether the japanese should be shown as completely despicable or if there could be exceptions. the "japanese" protagonist is shown as largely honourable but not beyond unwarranted cruelty such as when he murders a sedated monk so that he may have his duel. quite disappointing with a very silly ending. does not for a moment evoke even the semblance of the idea of an epic battle.
