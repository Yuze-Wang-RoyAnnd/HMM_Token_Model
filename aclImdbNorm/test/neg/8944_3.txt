early talkie feature based on a popular stage play. a murder has been committed and a bunch of people hire a medium to conduct a s'eance to see who the murderer is. while the lights are out there's another murder...so it's someone in that room.<br /><br />what follows is an obvious, dull and creaky murder mystery. most of the cast overacts to a ridiculous degree. they act like they're on stage (where you have to overdo things) and it looks silly on screen. most embarrassing is bela lugosi (two years before "dracula") who really overdoes it as a police inspector. static direction by tod browning (who was always overrated) doesn't help.<br /><br />for browning and lugosi completists only. i give it a 3.
