what about scream baby scream is supposed to make me not feel like a fool for buying it? i bought it because, god help me, i'm a sucker for old b-cinema even as worthless as this. nonetheless, something about this movie irritates me, it's probably janet, janet comes off cold & snooty, seemingly, with the intention of coming off as deep and noble, with a look on her face that screams constipation, she can't seem to agree to anything her uptight boyfriend wants. i'm glad that this is her only role. what really irritates me is that this is a 1960's gore film gone terribly awry, and as we all know, awry is floridian for "zero gore". it's like the director started with a herschell lewis style but backed out of the gore scenes when his wife found out, so instead we end up with one dull conversation after the other, and basically, a whole lot of irritating nothing. in other words, we end up with florida bore. joseph adler should be embarrassed. janets boyfriend, jason is almost as ridiculous as she is, this guy has something negative to say about absolutely everything, come to think of it, he's probably the least likable good guy in horror history. the only thing this movie really has going for it is that it carries that 60's/early 70's b-gore vibe that you can find in stuff like undertaker & his pals, blood freak, or most anything from herschell lewis. even rodney from the gruesome twosome is in this, i ithought his caveman comedy routine was irritating, most everything from reel to reel is stupid, even the trip scene was stupid. the only positive thing at all is the small amount of beach scenery, but that mostly includes janet whining about life not being perfect. in the only real ironic twist, scream baby scream gets even less interesting once the story finally gets started, around the 45 minute mark. if you happen to be indifferent to whether or not your entertainment is watchable, but are offended by the color red, you might not hate this. why does troma distribute this? wouldn't this be something weird video's area? scream baby scream very well may be the worst in florida horror/gore of its era, but, i suppose, underneath the unlikeable characters, and the incoherent plot, lies potential. scream, baby, scream really just seems like it should follow the blood feast pattern, so, to steal a quote from janet, "if it doesn't fit, i throw it out". 2/10
