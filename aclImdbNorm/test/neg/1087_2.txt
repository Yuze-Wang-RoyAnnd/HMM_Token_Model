this hokey movie left me groaning after just about any exchange of dialogue or plot complication. patricia arquette, though pleasing to look at, gives a below par performance from her usual mediocrity. my friends and i have coined the phrase "beyond rangoon" to mean anything really bad. a lowpoint for boorman.
