i had been looking forward to this movie since lost world came out. it didn't bother me that lost world wasn't as intellectual as the original, and here, i was just hoping for a good monster movie. it was all about "dinosaurs eat people." however, it was disappointing even on that level.<br /><br />for starters, there were not enough people to eat, and while i'll keep it a secret how many people get eaten, it was not enough. also, while there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community, there were not nearly "enough" dinosaurs. and many dinosaurs, like the spikey-back-and-has-a-club-on-its-tail-osaurus, just made cameos and didn't do much considering how cool they are.<br /><br />(start spoilers) then there were the pterodactyls. the figures i've read put their body weight at about 15 pounds, while the movie made them look closer to 300. worse, they didn't get to eat anybody, or even splatter them on the rocks by dropping them from high up. there was no ending to the movie, either, it was just, all of the sudden, credits. (end spoilers) i'm left wondering if the edition i saw was missing 40 minutes of film.<br /><br />my only conclusion can be that they taught the pterodactyls to stick their long beaks stealthily into your pockets and get your $7. go rent the carnosaur series; at least you won't be disappointed.
