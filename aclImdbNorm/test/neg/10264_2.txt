this film sucks!! it looks like they just chose to place scenes together at random. good gore, but little plot. sally whines and complains about everything till she becomes a demon. i figured that she had pms. it sure seemed that way. the dubbing in this film is horrible. one scene the woman was talking and a few seconds before we hear any audio. i knew at that moment my suspicions were correct that it was not from the us. i tried to follow along but got lost about half way through it and found it very hard to believe, even for a horror film. some good characters, but not many. not worth wasting one's time.
