if you watch the documentary extra, you'll note that the director is totally inexperienced and was actually a co-worker bud of quentin tarantinos in a video store. put two and two together and you realise quentin is doing a favour for his old bud, despite the bud being rather talentless. was that harsh? well see this film and you'll realise it isn't. too slow in the beginning, too nonsensical in the middle, and too slow to end. that about sums it up. eric stolz & delpy were the only two showing some charisma. and kemp actually put in an ok performance. but the rest was real bad. one instance of plot stupidity was when "lead robber" accidentally leaves his mask off during the raid. so what happens? well the other robbers decide they may as well remove theirs too! what great thinking. the violence was relentless and insane. but not in a "cool" way. rather in a farcical way. i wondered if this was meant to be a comedy. more fool tarantino for having his good name connected to this garbage. more fool me for watching it.
