as i'm listening to my parents watch this (after i gave up 10 minutes into the film), they have absolutely no idea what is going on. when "charles dickens" stared into the camera, i half expected him to turn into a demon (yes, he looked like one). unfortunately, that didn't happen.<br /><br />this movie had various reasons i did not finish it: one, it was unbearably slow. i mean, seriously, it was sloww. you can only understand 10% of what is said, and the characters were poorly introduced.<br /><br />if you have an english accent and you like a lottt of talking, no action, terrible acting, cheesy laughs, and the same music/sound effects played over and over and over, then this is the movie for you...<br /><br />1/10 - completely horrible.<br /><br />avoid at all costs.
