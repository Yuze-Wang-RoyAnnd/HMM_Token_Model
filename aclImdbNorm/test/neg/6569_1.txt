leonard nimoy directed star trek iii, which wasn't half bad. maybe william shatner thought seeming as how nimoy did it he could. after seeing this film he should have reversed that decision.<br /><br />star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series. the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.<br /><br />the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god (seriously) i just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards. she looked like she was taking part in a granny competition. if they meant to make her look sexy. they were wrong. she looked grotesque.<br /><br />how this got to production or even written...well it dosen't bear thinking about. the only place good for this film is in the garbage. the worst one of the series.
