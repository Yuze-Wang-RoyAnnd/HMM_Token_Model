...than you easily spot the biggest fault of the movie. what was the motive? the details of the murders were used, but never explained. i guess the team got too much into the atmosphere, which is great, but the story is definitely lacking. there is no thread to follow. i guess if that was done properly, the movie would've lasted a bit longer, but it would've been worth it, at least for me.<br /><br />casting is very good, i loved wilson as the vulnerable vicky.<br /><br />not much more to say, really. but i really wish they've concentrated a bit more on the less obvious.<br /><br />
