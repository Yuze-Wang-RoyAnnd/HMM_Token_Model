apart from the da (james eckhouse), and a brief appearing woman who is convincingly sympathetic to ellen gulden's (renee zellweger)plight, ellen herself is the only convincing character--and likable character in the movie. she is the one, not her dying mother, who should be and is--the one true thing. it's not only in the role, in zellweger's acting, but also in the plot itself.... until, the plot turns against itself--and makes the mother the "one true thing" in the eyes of her weak willed, shallow husband who can do nothing right for his wife or daughter. the daughter perceives what the viewer perceives, but such intelligent perceptions must give way to the shallow sentiment of the husband who is blanked out on both the realities of his wife and daughter. <br /><br />to boot, the one powerful scene in this whole movie, when ellen confronts her father's cruelty, is given the lie at the end. ellen is just another young strong woman who must be tamed into conformity by a crybaby father. a very flawed movie--so flawed as to be called a bore and not worth the time.
