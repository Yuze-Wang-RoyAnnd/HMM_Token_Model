unfortunately producers don't know when to leave well enough alone, or are into recycling to the point that every scrap of trash that hollywood generates is up for rendering into alpo. it seems that every sci-fi action adventure flick must endure a sad list of follow-up films, and robocop is a tragic example. the first film, under paul verhoven's direction was a wild, stylish ride, even finding time for a little social commentary on what the dark side of bio-tech is capable of turning us into. this film has none of that, aside from maybe telling us that drugs are bad for you and could make you do things you'd regret when sober. robocop 2 lacks the vision, the profoundly scary vision of what we are becoming, and instead clumsily takes us on a boat ride into how nauseating drug dealers and their victims really are. social commentary be damned. this one really bit the big one for me. if you don't care for anything but the sfx, go to it, my friend. otherwise don't waste your time with this yeastless sour cake, and preserve the first film's accurately measured, heavy-weighted pumpernickle hot out of the oven. it's that simple.
