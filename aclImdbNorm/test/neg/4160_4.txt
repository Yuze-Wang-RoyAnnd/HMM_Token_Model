***spoilers*** ***spoilers***<br /><br />i saw this movie last night at a screening. i started out already liking tim robbins and loving sci-fi. the first third of the movie was very cool. the score was good, the cinematography was interesting, the film maker's vision of the future was realistic yet starkly interesting nonetheless. i remember thinking to myself: "this is the most intelligently done sci-fi movie i've seen in a while". then they just couldn't keep it together.<br /><br />although from the outset, there were a number of more "rough around the edges" issues with this film (namely the editing, and later some of the writing/plot development), these issues were forgivable. they became unforgivable once the movie sort of lost all momentum around the half way mark, and then the film just got tedious when you realized that it wasn't going to go anywhere at all. <br /><br />robbins could not breathe life into his character, but did the best he could. his female counterpart (her name escapes me now) was good in her role.<br /><br />the main reason for the meandering of the movie seemed to be that the film makers could not decide whether or not to do a sci-fi movie or a futuristic love story. they ended up with neither.<br /><br />good:<br /><br />some of the cinematography: grainy, it felt like "21 days later" some times.<br /><br />very fitting for a futuristic movie like this.<br /><br />i dug some of the location shots.<br /><br />the music was cool.<br /><br />the film makers vision of the future was realistic but still cool and interesting.<br /><br />i liked the interactions with the other minor characters in the movie.<br /><br />some of the writing was interesting (early on). <br /><br />the girl who played maria gonzales (name?? can't recall), she was good.<br /><br />***spoilers below***<br /><br />a few questions/comments:<br /><br />i felt that a lot of the futuristic things in this movie were convenient to fix a patchwork story. namely viruses. obviously the virus they gave her at the end of the film that made her physically 'afraid' of him was just there so that they could stick in another sex scene and then she could uncontrollably report him for code 46. then they take him away and erase his memory and the movie ends. classic 'dream sequence' cop-out ending if you ask me. ties up all the loose ends very neatly if you just make it all a dream right?<br /><br />was robbin's character naturally good as intuition or was it the virus?<br /><br />why didn't they explore the myriad of issues surrounding the girl being a clone of his mom? that could have made some interesting story.<br /><br />at first i like the salutations from across the globe in everyone's speech. but it became intrusive especially since their accents were not convincing. i get it, the future will undoubtedly be racially and culturally more androgynous, but it started feeling like an at&t global networking commercial by the end of it.<br /><br />if they were 'outside' how could they have gotten busted for code 46?<br /><br />'cover' was never well defined. sometimes it seemed as trivial as a visa, and other times it was as vital as life or death. again, loose definitions allow them to use it for gluing disparate parts of the plot together.<br /><br />okay, i'm starting to get to negative about it, so i'll stop. there were some cool scenes, and interesting things about this movie, but that only gives it a 4/10
