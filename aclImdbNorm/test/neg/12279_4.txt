this movie is very violent, yet exciting with original dialog and cool characters. it has one of the most moving stories and is very true to life. the movie start off with action star leo fong as a down and out cop who is approaching the end of his career, when he stumbles on to a big case that involves corruption, black mail and murder. this is where the killings start. from start finish fong delivers in this must see action caper. this movie also co-stars richard roundtree.<br /><br />i really enjoyed this film as a child but as i got older i realized that this film is pretty cheesy and not very good. i would not recommend this film and the action is very, very bad.
