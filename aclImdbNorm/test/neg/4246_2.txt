hope floats with sandra bullock is a real disappointment. the story starts off ok. her husband cheats on her and she finds out on national television. so she has to rebuild her life. here it could have gotten interesting or built up in a story line, but you become so bored with it. she moves back with her parents and harry connick jr. who plays justin begins hitting on her. the two have no real chemistry at all, yet your supposed to get the impression that justin is in love with her. the movie ends the way you figure it will but you wish it hadn't ended like every other kind like it. they had a good start with this movie and could have turned it into something watchable but instead its a movie that you definitely want to miss.
