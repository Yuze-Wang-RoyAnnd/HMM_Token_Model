jack frost returns with an army of styrofoam balls that can only be foiled by being shot with super-soakers loaded with margaritas. how's that for a plot? the film hinges on such a ridiculous premise that it barely raises an eyebrow when characters are killed with bbq tongs and are impaled by carrots. you might even say the whole movie is skating on thin ice (ba-boom-tish).<br /><br />admittedly, there are some fantastic one-liners including a remark about the murderous coconut shark.<br /><br />fair enough times are hard, but that does not excuse the willingness of the actors to take part in such utter tripe.<br /><br />for those fans hoping to see jack frost, be prepared to accept him as merely a phallic carrot creeping up the beach with corny voice-over commentary.
