i'm just filling this comment out, because i couldn't stand the fact that a positive comment was featured on the "complete information" page. i really think this to be the worst movie ever made in my country. this is not only because of the terrible plot, the crappy english and a tension-curve that is as flat as our country. no, it is because this was a serious attempt to make a good action movie, conform the hollywood standard. it had to be "the european action movie of the year".for this purpose they even hired fejda van huet, actor in the academy award- winning picture "karakter", to do the job. i don't mind bad films, i can even enjoy them if they are pretensiousless b- movies. but i can't stand movies that are terrible, but supposed to be a-type movies.
