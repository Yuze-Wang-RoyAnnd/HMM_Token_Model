on the opening night of the san francisco silent film festival i was quite excited to see films that are historical and well not common. the guest speaker who opened this film created a sense of hype towards the obscurity, and how this film is underrated. the sci-fi part of the film was very interesting and fantastic for its time, but i'm not sure if it was due to the fact it was shown directly after the brilliant 1928 "the wind" or if it seemed that russian filmmakers take after what russian novels are famous for (hundreds of characters, tangled plots) but i know for certain that the dramatic parts, as in the parts on earth, made absolutely no sense, were boring and i became lost within about twenty minutes. maybe it was the acting but i found myself convinced as to why this film is "unknown and underrated": it's boring, there is no plot or basic story and the acting is horrible. this certainly is no "battleship potemkin", however i will say that russian films do not make a real good effort in lightning up what life in russia is like.
