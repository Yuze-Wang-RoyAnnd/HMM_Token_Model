norris plays a chicago cop who stumbles upon a devil's apprentice? who wants to, well, create armegeddon. he eventually kills the creature by, get this, throwing a solid gold 24 inch spike, not very sharp, about twenty feet, hard enough to penetrate the chest. unlikely? so is the rest of the movie. much of it consists of cn and his sidekick driving cars and talking nonsense. the israeli (or arab) kid is there ostensibly to humanize cn. ok. doesn't work, makes no sense, and advances the plot, so-called, not one bit. also, no cops ever every get invited out of the country to be interviewed by other cops. it is ridiculous as a premise. the whole thing is bad. unfortunately, it's not so bad as to be entertainingly bad or campy. just plain bad. but--one can see how norris was trying to find his way to the successful walker: texas ranger series.
