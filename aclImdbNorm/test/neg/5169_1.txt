kokoda was inspired by events on the kokoda track during ww2 when australian militia slowed and ultimately stopped a push by 10,000 japanese soldiers to move overland and capture port moresby. what they really mean is that the movie is set in this time period but is fiction and everything that happens is just a jumble of standard scenes from other war films. the first hour is just one clich'e after another. some of the scenes are simply there to be able to draw us into a feeling that this conflict was horrific beyond compare, when there appears to be little evidence of this. both sides fought hard to control the track and no mercy was shown by either side. both sides suffered from logistic shortages and the terrain was a great leveler in this conflict. as the japanese got closer to port moresby their supply line grew and this ultimately led to their downfall. on the other hand as the australians retreated closer to port moresby their supply line decreased. some of the scenes appear to be straight out of the handbook on standard scenes to include in any war film. the film was misguided and highlighted the youth of the production team. at a time when australia could have done with a great film about one of australia's best moments the film kokoda is a shallow disappointment.
