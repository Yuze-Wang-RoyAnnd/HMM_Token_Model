downhill racer is essentially, a movie to see only for the terrific skiing sequences. although there is a story here, robert redford's character, a skier trying to make the u.s. olympic team, is so bland and unsympathetic that you wonder why to care about him at all. gene hackman, in an early performance, adds nicely, but this is a film that could be watched with the sound off, and it wouldn't make much of a difference.
