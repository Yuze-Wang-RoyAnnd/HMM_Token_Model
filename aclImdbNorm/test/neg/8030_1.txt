it's the one film i almost walked out of, and would have if my friends hadn't been in the movie theatre with me. normally, even if i don't like a film, i think it's still worth sitting through it to the end. that way, you can really claim to have given it every chance to redeem itself. but with the million dollar hotel, it was so dreadful i just badly wanted the experience to end as quickly as possible. i think i probably would not have been so sourly disappointed if this film had been made by a lesser director, one i didn't normally like so much. but coming from wenders, it was all the more shocking to behold. i know bono from u2, a good friend of wenders's, wrote the script to this abysmal film, and i wonder why wenders let him, as buddy-buddy as the two may have been. "stick to the day job, bono", is a sentence that easily springs to mind whilst viewing this mess. pretentious, disjointed, a mish-mash of every possible contemporary film stereotype, a naive and transparent attempt at coming across as kooky and daring, with the most irritating characters i have ever set eyes upon, especially the leads, jeremy davies, milla jovovich and mel gibson, none of whom i dislike normally. the happiest ending i could have wished for would have been for a nuclear bomb to be dropped on their collective heads so as to get it all over with as soon as possible. on a positive note, the first five minutes of the film are extremely good, with an extremely stirring soundtrack from u2. but the film's opening shots make the rest of the film (which takes a spectacular nose-dive from then on) all the more disappointing as they are a promise of cinematic quality that's just never delivered, not even close.
