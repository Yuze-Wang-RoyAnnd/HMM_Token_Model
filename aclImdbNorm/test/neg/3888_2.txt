i was shocked to read all these wonderful comments about this movie because i hated it. i stuck it out to the end, but it was painful-- especially having to listen to that voice of the child. as socact-1 remarked, even though the girl claimed to be from chicago, she didn't have a chicago accent-- it sounded more like she was trying to imitate a ny accent--but failed at that as well. i was so confused that i was waiting for the punchline. of all the wonderful actors who could have played that child, why did they select this one? and why force her to talk like that? it wasn't even just the accent, it was the script, the monologue created for her. the reason i even selected this movie was that the plot idea appealed to me-- this era in history, the type of characters that are poor and uneducated, the setting --and the love triangle. as far as i'm concerned it could have and should have been much better. i was just soooo relieved to read that at least one other person felt the same way that i did about this movie.
