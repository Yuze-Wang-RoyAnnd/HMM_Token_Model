final draft - a screenwriter (james van der beek) locks himself into his apartment and succumbs to psychosis in an attempt to write a horror script. not a terrible premise, but the execution is awful. this feels like a first year direction and writing job, and probably is. the director jump cuts the hell out of everything. it's meant to be disorienting. what it is is annoying. so much so that small chunks of film are incoherent. the writing is predictable, and doesn't use follow through on most of the ideas it offers (bag of oranges). it's like they ran out of time and slap-dashed it together for the toronto film festival.<br /><br />this film is not jaw-droppingly "oh my god it's so bad it's good" bad. it's boring bad, and irritates you for a long time afterward. james van der beek is not a terrible actor, and keeps the ship barely above water. but he's too normal for the kind of psychosis the film tries to offer. he is merely a withdrawn guy who one day sees people and hallucinates things, then decides to act mildly deranged. cause follows effect. maybe there's something in the water. now darryn lucio, who plays his "friend", is a terrible actor. he shares the likeness of chris o'donald and is even more annoying, a superhuman achievement.<br /><br />the atmosphere the film provides is good (dull gray and somber), but as it's the only thing the film achieves it means nothing. this film wants to be jacob's ladder or the machinist. it isn't even secret window. it's the preppy girl in class deciding to turn goth.<br /><br />not irksomely terrible, but the sheer stupidity of it will ebb at you. i've already put more thought into this critique than the filmmakers did for this.<br /><br />d
