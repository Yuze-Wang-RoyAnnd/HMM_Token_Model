this is indeed one of the weakest films based on agatha christie's work, a lifeless, muddled mystery that clearly lacks the grace (and the budget!) of its predecessors ("death on the nile", "evil under the sun") and donald sutherland is a pale shadow of peter ustinov as far as screen detectives go (of course, he is playing a character much less interesting than poirot). the film manages to coast as far as it does on the strength of christie's plot alone (all her plots have a certain amount of inherent interest), but the direction is hopelessly flat.
