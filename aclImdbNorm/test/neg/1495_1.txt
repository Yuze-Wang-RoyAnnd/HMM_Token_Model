a whole bunch of teenagers gather around to discuss their fears, but an uninvited guest has showed up and is killing everybody off.<br /><br />probably the worst horror film of the 90's, camp blood (1999) is the only film that could challenge it for that title, has some of the dumbest characters and situations to ever grace a television screen. the so called surprise ending is awful, as is the rest of this film. mildly entertaining on a sooo bad it is good level. my rating: 2 out of 10.
