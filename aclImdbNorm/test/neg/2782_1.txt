i knew full well when i rented this dvd that it could very well be one of the worst movies i've seen in my life. but to say that it was one of the worst movies i've ever viewed would be putting it lightly. i'm wondering if there isn't some legal action that can be taken against the individuals that allowed this film to produced. i mean, the financing had to come from somewhere, someone had to put up money for this to be produced!!??<br /><br />i'd pinpoint several production values that led to the failure of this film, but this film violated every production standard in the universe. i couldn't make it thru the entire movie, as i started getting dizzy the from horrendous filming techniques. i also can't tell you how many scenes i just ended zoning off during because of the inexplicably horrific dialog.<br /><br />i feel like i've been permanently scarred for life. if you viewed this movie before getting this warning, you should think about starting a support group with me for the poor people who did view this monstrosity.
