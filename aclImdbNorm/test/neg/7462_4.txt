slow, odd film that drags and plods (i mean really plods) along to its disappointing climax. you may expect some sort of punchline at the end, but there is none. both milland and snodgress give awkward performances; in fact, the film's weirdness may actually be the only thing it has going for it. the generally atmospheric score has some absurd parts (like the music that plays during the first appearance of a monkey), and there is a truly awful fantasy scene involving....a gorilla.
