the credits come from the sandy frank stitching job that was made to turn this movie into cave dwellers for re-release. now that that's cleared up...oh! excruciating, eye-gouging pain. blade master leaps shamelessly on the sword & sorcery bandwagon started by the conan flicks...except the bandwagon never left the garage anyway. as such, this italian flick is a dud trying to rip-off a box office dud, with predictable results. however, this would give too little credit to the director and writers, who make no effort whatsoever to maintain a coherent plot, continuity, any semblance of era-accurate continuity. miles o'keefe is no leading man, now or forever (tarzan the ape man proved that, if ator didn't). just an unlikeable picture and a chore to watch.
