all i ever heard while being raised was equality of the sexes, and here we have a film that not only exemplifies imbalance, but continues through with a whole concept that one sex is better. all the while watching i was hoping for that redeeming quality to make the viewer feel as though there is hope for the future, and there wasn't. i'll admit to not finishing the film, i had to turn it off at the part where the old man whore told the genetic man adam that it was ok to be a whore and get, and i quote, "more tail than any man in the past time." i know not finishing it is a bad review on myself, but it is the responsibility of the writer and crew to develope a story that will keep a viewer interested, and they failed. this film betrays all true female nature qualities of the mother figure and the need for balance. instead it exemplifies what america ran by lesbian natzis would be like,and i'm not against lesbians. thank you mr. director! someone please give me a redeeming quality... wait i have it! there's no sequel!
