if you are thinking of going to see this film then my advice is - dont.<br /><br />for me the film failed to make the grade at every level and was a reminder of how dire most british (& irish)films are. forgettable tripe is the best i can say. if it had been on telly l would have wandered off to do something more interesting five minutes after the start. i saw this film with a group of friends and having read the press previews went along prepared to not be critical and hopefully pass an amusing 90 minutes. but, oh dear.....<br /><br />as a comedy it wasn't funny, as a thriller the stupid story was sloppy and lazy. as a love story totally unbelievable. most of all as a piece of 'gloriously over the top whimsy' it lacked both style and charm. gambon and caine did what they needed to do to earn their money playing er..... gambon and caine. is it just me, but other than playing east end gangsters and jack the lads, does michael caine leave you cold?<br /><br />in fairness, some of my friends thought it was 'ok' but if you do go, my advice is have a few drinks (or puffs) beforehand and leave your critical faculties safely locked up at home.<br /><br />
