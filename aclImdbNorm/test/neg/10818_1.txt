its perhaps unfair of me to comment on this film , because , for the first time ever , i switched off a movie because it was so bad. i can watch anything , but this movie was so very boring. i was bored before i put on the dvd and thought this might be a laughable action horror/ action movie to lighten the mood. it is not even that , it is a device which increases the level of boredom by the power of 100. had to switch it off after 45 minutes because all that had happened in that time was some people had been scuba diving , and a big mole had been discovered. seriously , this movie is not worth the time, even if you can enjoy a bad movie like i can , avoid this film like the plague.worst thing i have seen in years.
