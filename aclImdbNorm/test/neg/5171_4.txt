first off i'll give this movie a low scoring 4 out of 10! it was nothing more than a wannabe film. i felt very let down watching this film. i was lead to people it would be more drama and more facts about the true story it's based on. instead i spent over an hour watching middle aged mean break the law and take drugs.<br /><br />it's abit like football factory but with no real storyline and not a good ending. after watching the film i was left wondering "what was that film all about?" if you like films with no real storyline and a lot of drug taking and swearing then this is the film for you.<br /><br />i'm a big fan of mob and gangster movies but this film did not live up to the hype. i can see where the writer was trying to go with the film but it never reached it's destination.one of the worst british films that i have ever watched. if only the movie had more of a storyline this would have bad an excellent movie.
