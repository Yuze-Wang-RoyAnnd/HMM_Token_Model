if i was british, i would be embarrassed by this portrayal of incompetence. a protection agent of the special branch unable to defend herself against a sick, unarmed and untrained assailant? the home office sends a single "science adviser" to investigate a possible level four biohazard, and that "advisor" doesn't have the sense to wear even a mask and gloves? totally unprotected london police officers working side by side with technicians in full biohazard suits? the "advisor" and his bodyguard bearding the lair of a sociopathic doctor experimenting on human subjects without any backup? puh-leeze! one wonders whether the producers could not afford to hire any technical advisers or if, for some arcane reason, they consciously decided to portray the principals as hopelessly incompetent. even my wife, who has no background in either medicine or law enforcement, was rolling her eyes in disbelief. after the first episode, i was discouraged; now that i have seen two episodes, i give up.
