everything this film tried to do is done better - and superbly in "run lola run". the red haired hip cutie, the critical deadline(s), the lover in jeopardy, and the "crime pays-sometimes" message. but, unlike "lola", it just isn't believable or well put together. it is a labored knock off that might have worked for me if i had seen it before "lola" - but it pales in comparison. yes! the falling beetle was nice! but that was about the only surprise in the film. do yourself a favor and see the real mccoy - (and the real hip red head!) - in run lola run!
