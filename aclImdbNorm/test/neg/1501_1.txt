oh my god, this movie is incredible, it's the baddest movie ever and i know what i am talking about! i am a scary movies fan!<br /><br />the story is totally silly, a group of adults decide to make a party and a silly guy with an awful mask comes and kills everybody... the dialogs are a kind of parody, worst, they're just talking about sex with a so bad accent. the end is (oh!!!!!!) discover by yourself! you will be really really surprised... (not possible! yes it is!) and surprise the movie is just 58minutes. (not possible (bis) yes it is!) worst than house iv and howling v.<br /><br />to put it in a nutshell, forget it forever!!!
