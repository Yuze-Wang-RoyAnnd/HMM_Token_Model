bad plot, bad acting, bad direction.<br /><br />it had possibilities but just didn't achieve anything.<br /><br />this film looks like someone started with an idea, googled a bit of info and then tried to flesh an hour and a half with lots of night shots and bad suspense music.<br /><br />others had to stop watching because they were scared 2/3 of the way through - i had to take a break purely because i just didn't care anymore.<br /><br />reminded me of an episode of days of our lives with marginally more suspense.<br /><br />just bad.
