this is not great cinema. the film is cliche ridden and in many places it is a copy of the original carrie. the parallels with the original film are striking but with an added improbability about the telekenetic powers being congenital.<br /><br />i can't say that i disliked the film because it at least passed a couple of hours ... but these were passed as one would read an undemanding book on a long train journey. that book would not be great literature but would absorb one for a while and be forgotten soon afterwards in that it would blend in with the numerous other cliche ridden books. likewise the film was okay whilst it lasted but is perhaps forgettable. at least i think it is. i cant remember much about it now!!
