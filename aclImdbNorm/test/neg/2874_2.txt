to put in simple words or rather a word, would be best suited by pathetic !!!!!! the movie starts with attracting a little interest by the plot, but, but as few minutes by audience is getting restless for restrooms and getting snacks, or to get a breathe of fresh air outside the closed dark hall....<br /><br />it seems like watching a movie from 1960's where colors were dull, directed by a debutant, and acted by high school students ! movie revolves about a american high headed actress trying make a comeback into films by acting in one of the not-so-great indian movie. her acting is real sad complimented by the worse dialogue delivery.<br /><br />overall: i would not recommend anyone to watch this movie still want to watch: then try watching it at home, when some tv channel airs it, believe me it would be fun as this movie would not get a single advertisement and no sponsors.<br /><br />and better carry a aspirin, u might need it if you cant find a remote control to change channel ! p.s. i have no clue, if the other reviewers even watched the movie ? i did and wasted my $10 on the ticket !
