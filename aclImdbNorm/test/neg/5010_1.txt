i attempted to watch this, and was highly disappointed. don't expect intelligent and insightful humor ala amy's brother david amidst this dreck... it is the polar opposite. but if you're into poop, fart and boner jokes, you'll be in seventh heaven. this is bathroom humor aimed, i assume, at those who've had several bongs, which can only explain why many ecstatic reviewers have heralded this crap as "the best television writing ever." i assume that those who hate such simpleton humor were unable to watch long enough to care to submit a review, but i am just sending out a warning shot to those unaware viewers who are looking for high-end comedy. the characters overact. the shock factor is set to 10. and the laughs are set to zero (unless, of course, you seek juvenile, low-brow humor.) <br /><br />i made it through 40 minutes, praying the whole time it would turn the corner toward worthwhile entertainment, but alas, it just got worse and worse. and beware of amy's ever-present and hammy overbite expression - it will set your eyes rolling. it was nice to see cameos by recognizable comedic actors i enjoy, but i can only assume they agreed to participate as a favor to the sedaris family.<br /><br />to those who loved it, i'm sorry... this is my opinion. it was so bad it inspired me to write my first review.
