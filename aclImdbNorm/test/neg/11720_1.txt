this movie was not only disappointing to the horror/suspense film lover, it was disappointing to anyone who sees it. wow. i thought that this film might be funny because the guy with the huge head. however, it was filled with long and drawn out conversation that wasn't needed. there was so much sex that i hate women and men now. this film was not only boring, but there was no substance. wow. wow. on to of all this, each scene looks like it was light from a single light bulb, and i think they used the same set for two different lawyers, a restaurant, and an airport. this movie is not for the movie lover who loves bad movies because in the end, it feels likes wasted time. see the movie!<br /><br />-party
