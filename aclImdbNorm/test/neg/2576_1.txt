[possible spoiler alert]<br /><br />it's unlikely that seagal will ever again scale the heights of lousitude he did with *on deadly ground* (mainly because no one's ever going to let him direct again), but he sure tries, don't he?<br /><br />this one's a typically brainless and badly-written little fantasy about how indian folk remedies are much more effective than western medicine. seagal seems to actually believe this nonsense, although he never explains why life expectancy in the americas and europe is so much higher than it was in 1492.<br /><br />kinda like he never explains how his supposed "water-fueled engines" work in *on deadly ground*.<br /><br />even the "action" in this one sucks.
