the protector. you hear the name. you think, "ah, it's a crappy hong kong movie." guess what - it's not hong kong. and yes, it is crappy. this amazingly stupid jackie chan film, ruined by us, yes us, the americans (i'm boiling with anger, ooh, i think i'll jump out that window!), has chan as a new york cop hunting down a gang, avenging the death of his buddy. sounds cool...but it's not. don't waste your money renting it. to prove he could make a better cop film, chan made the amazing police story (1985).
