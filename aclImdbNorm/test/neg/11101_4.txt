after putting a mummy in a local museum goes through the cat-scan, a metal object in it's brain reacts adversely to the procedure, thus freeing the spirit,or phantom if you will, of the mummy, belphegor. due to convenient circumstances, lisa, who lives close to the museum finds herself possessed by the evil spirit. soon enough she's stealing the museum's egyptian treasures out from under their nose. detective verlac comes out of retirement to catch the supernatural thief.<br /><br />this is a serviceable enough, if you haven't seen any other incarnations of "belph'egor" before. if you have, i recommend skipping this particular version as it can't help but pale in comparison to the others despite the nice locals and scenery.it plays out like a (slightly) higher budgeted sci-fi original film, and i don't really mean that as a compliment.<br /><br />eye candy: sophie marceau shows ass & side boob <br /><br />my grade: c- <br /><br />dvd extras: none
