i read about this film on-line and after seeing the generally positive reviews it has received, and viewing the trailer, i decided to check it out for myself. what a disappointment! it starts out well enough. the opening scene was actually pretty tense, but from there it's all downhill. i can see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this movie, but by doing so, they took all the enjoyment out of watching it. those choices combined with the "c.s.i" editing, use of music and montage, lack of suspense, scares, or humor really drag this film down. there's too much foreshadowing and to many "subtle" clues, so when the first twist arrives early on, you already know how the movie is going to end. i gave the movie three stars because i think the cast did a good job, other than that i can't recommend this movie.
