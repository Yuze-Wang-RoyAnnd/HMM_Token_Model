i have to admit, i picked this movie just for the cast, and while sutherland, scacchi, and prochnow were - as usual - great performers, the rest of the movie was such a let down. it feels like it was put together by a team of adolescents with low level scripts, that is, scripts lacking any depth, awful photography and editing, and hilariously lousy score! i can't believe i was able to watch this seemingly long movie until the end... the sad thing is, this could have actually been a great political thriller given the interesting plot. all the potential was there to make it a hit; that is, two main ingredients are there: a great story of national conspiracies, and a great core cast (even though many other actors are pretty much soap opera quality). but maybe i'm missing something; until then it's still not worth more than a 3 in my opinion.
