for a horror film, this is criminally dull. a few memorable, gruesome bits can't compensate for a really poor script. very little coherence is achieved, and the movie relentlessly overplays its one basic idea (a killer cat), until it becomes repetitive - and things are made even worse by the constant use of shots from the cat's point-of-view.
