*some possible spoilers*<br /><br />of course this film could not be expected to be as good as the original, remakes rarely are. but, this remake of one of hitchcock's greatest films, psycho, could have been a lot better. <br /><br />first of all, whoever cast the movie must have been psycho. i mean, vince vaughn as norman bates! what where they thinking?! unlike the "harmless", almost childlike bates that anthony perkins was able to portray, vaughn looks like he would could be a murderer. in efforts to make his bates seem innocent, vaughn ends up acting gay. many of the other actors didn't seem to fit their parts either, including julianne moore who just didn't seem to fit in the film. <br /><br />on top of the atrocious casting, the cinematography is notably shabby, despite the fact that they remade the film scene for scene. the one thing they added were random shots of object such as clouds or a nude woman, in between the shots of characters being murdered. these shots seemed to be irrelevant to the plot in anyway, and in turn made no sense.<br /><br />overall, this psycho remake, which could been a decent picture, instead turned out to be a complete waste of time.
