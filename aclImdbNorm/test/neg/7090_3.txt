"on a clear day you can see forever" is nothing more than a new age update of the "pygmalion" / "my fair lady" story: a professor attempts to turn a common girl into an upper society woman. this time, however, instead of using language skills, the professor tries to do so by hypnotism and past life regression.<br /><br />you know a musical has problems when reviewers constantly mention the sets and the costumes before they mention the plot and the music. the songs are instantly forgettable. (no "get me to the church on time" here, i'm afraid.) and the plot goes nowhere. to paraphrase gertrude stein, there is no "there" here. the characters wander through the story without ever getting from point a to point b. professor chabot claims several times that he will get to the root of daisy's troubles, but he never seems to do so.<br /><br />all meaningful conflict is avoided. for instance, there comes a time when chabot's university demands he either stop his research into reincarnation or resign his position. now there is conflict! will he give up his career for daisy? alas! nothing comes of this development. a scene or two later the university changes its mind and tells chabot to continue on with his work. so much for conflict.<br /><br />the talent was certainly assembled for this movie: directed by vincente minnelli. written, in part, by alan jay lerner. a cast of yves montand, bob newhart and jack nicholson. and, oh yes, starring barabara striesand who was nearly at the top of her game at this point in her career.<br /><br />but it all falls flat. lerner's attempt to reincarnate his greatest success, the previously mentioned "my fair lady," is as doomed to failure as daisy's attempt to revive the greatness of her own past.<br /><br />if you enjoy movie musicals, there are far better choices than this.
