i'll say this first...the film would've been a 70s sci-fi classic if it had been executed a lot better.<br /><br />that said, let's examine the plot...it starts with peter graves (or is that clarence oveur?) running for president, then cuts to a goofy college campus-like environ full of authoritarians in goofy trucker caps and headsets and retarded athletes who all act like they're perpetually age 8. it then shows one guy apparently going to america, having a party, then taken to a medical lab where he is drugged, wrapped in a plastic bag and then prepared as if the doctors were bagging vegetables for steamers packs...okay, actually he's being put on ice so the doctors can extract the organs they need.<br /><br />it then cuts to another dopey man thinking the place he's living in is a bit strange after a beer can (of all plot devices possible) he finds in a river makes him look suspicious (damn those beer cans!). he and some equally stupid love interest of his feel they need to get to the bottom of it all, so he makes her stay behind as he escapes through what is basically a large college administration building with some evidence he discovers on the way about cloning...and how he's a part of it.<br /><br />he escapes his controllers after being shot some and an old reporter guy helps him find his 'father'--the man he was cloned from. it just so happens he's a clone of the brother of peter graves. after debate about what to do with him and his evidence, he goes back to the facility to find his girlfriend (who has been lobotomized in the meantime to be even more stupid, harmless, and ready to host a talk show according to the sol crew). he is captured and put into cold storage just like his nazi-build retard friend from the beginning of the film.<br /><br />meanwhile, a confrontation at graves' brothers house results in several deaths, including graves'. the reporter guy and his wife are killed in the middle of an exciting conversation by a bomb. it seems the conspirators have won to some extent...<br /><br />then, peter graves turns out to be able to survive being run through with a metal poker by the miracle of cloned parts, and giving another 'vote for me' speech just as reporters confront him about the cloning thing.<br /><br />definitely mst3k fodder, but on the low end of the spectrum as far as overall badness goes.
