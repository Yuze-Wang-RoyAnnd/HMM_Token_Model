yesterday i watched this tv production, and i was very disappointed.<br /><br />i didn't have big expectations when it was a tv production, but the complete movie was pain with no ending. i felt it lasted for 3 hours, but it was just me who was bored to death. every minute was a long struggle and i really fought hard to stay away from the "turn off"-switch.<br /><br />the movie is about a doctor (dr. verghese) who gets a lot of aids-patients, and most of them die during the movie. it is hard for verghese to live with, so his family gets punished with his frustrations. however this movie has problems showing both sides, it mostly focuses on his conversations with the patients, and sometimes we see flicks from his home, but we don't get much. the difficulties to show more than one part of verghese's life doesn't get any better with the poor acting from naveen andrews, a man i (hopefully) can't see in any good future movies.<br /><br />i believe it got 7,6 because of the subject (taboo?), but i'm sure that there are better movies about this subject on the market. stay away from this movie, it does not deserve more than 3/10.<br /><br />
