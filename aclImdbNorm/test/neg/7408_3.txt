i'm not sure what it is but there seems to be some curse when it comes to films about the elusive bigfoot. there has yet to be a film that intelligently approaches the subject, nor one that creates any real suspense. both "legend of boggy creek" (1972) and the first film entitled "sasquatch" (1978) have become minor cult classics, but neither were very memorable. both films were targeted at family friendly audiences, thus inhibiting themselves from actually trying to scare anyone. "harry & the hendersons" (1987) was the first big budgeted film to use bigfoot, with a terrific creature design by rick baker. however, they too chose to aim for younger audiences, but this time as a comedy (as did "bigfoot" in 1995). i've long awaited for someone to tackle the subject as a thriller, perhaps in the vein of "jaws" or "predator". when i saw this at my local video store i thought my dream had come true. boy, was i wrong! lance henriksen plays a billionaire who leads an expedition into the pacific northwest in hopes of finding his daughter as she was on board a small plane when it crashed in the mountains. the premise is interesting and sounded promising. the truth is it never builds any real suspense. i never found myself at all interested in any of the characters as each of them were very two dimensional and rather bland. even the always dependable henriksen seems to be phoning in his performance. every time he appears on screen he looks plain bored. he should be as there is no action to speak of for the first hour of the film. as for the creature, where do i start? i figured at the very least we would get a cool looking monster running around in the woods, but instead we get this bald (yes, i said "bald!") man with pitch black skin and patches of fur here and there. picture a cross between "swamp thing" and chaka from "land of the lost" and you'll get the idea. nothing like the artwork on the cover box i assure you. sloppy editing and careless direction also adds to the confusion as half the time everything seemed out of sequence, while the other half of the film was constantly used up with these long, slow fade outs (which made no sense or served any purpose). they even stole the whole infra-red vision p.o.v from the creature in "predator", which just looked too silly and out of place to be effective. maybe all this proves is that hollywood should just forget about trying to make anymore bigfoot films, as they have yet to make one that works. so far each one has been as scary as an episode of "in search of" 3/10
