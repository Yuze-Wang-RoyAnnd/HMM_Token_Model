seymour cassel gives a great performance, a tour de force. his acting as supposed washed up beach stud duke slusarski will always have a place in my heart. the film is centered around a nerd who just came to the beach in hopes of honoring his dead brother's dreams. what he gets is lame surf hijinks. guys cheating, guys fighting, and guys getting drunk going to watch surf documentaries with the whole town of la on a friday night. duke takes the nerd in and tries to teach him how playing volleyball is like touching a woman. next time my woman talks back i will pretend i'm spiking the ball. <br /><br />back to seymour cassel. the end of the movie turns into a good drama, since the first half of the film really had no point. duke plays a wonderful game of volleyball, the best he's played in over ten years. the way the scene is shot is beautiful. you can feel the heart this man has for the game and the love of being on the beach. those five minutes will go down as one of my favorites of all time. 3/10 bad to fair, the rest of the movie was lame.
