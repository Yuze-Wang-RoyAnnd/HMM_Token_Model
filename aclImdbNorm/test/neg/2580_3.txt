the patriot (nothing to do with the mel gibson film of the same name) came out steven seagal was still doing that 'saving the environment' thing in his movies. which is fine. but it doesn't make for good action.<br /><br />when the plot(?) of this film finally kicked in i saw the twist(?) coming a mile off. seagal's anti-warfare, care-for-mother-nature stance is not very subtle. for a film that was originally going to debut in the cinemas it is shot very much like a tv movie despite some wonderful shots of the country by dean semler, the photographer of dances with wolves.<br /><br />steven seagal does like 1 fight scene in the entire film and it's totally boring. as an action film it fails, as a drama it stinks, as an environmental message it's obvious. avoid like ebola crossed with plague.
