mario racocevic from europe is the only user who has posted a comment so far and covers the major points to the film.yet again another difficult film to purchase in the uk.i had to go through "midnight video" who have a swedish branch.i went to the post office and bought by mail order this and a similar title at only skr30 a title.<br /><br />this film goes under many "a.k.a's" depending on when and where it is marketed.i had previously purchased "the bloodsucker leads the dance" (which you will find if you search on imdb under "people" and input "krista nell").the actor who plays the count on his private island in the latter film had his words dubbed from italian into english by an actor with an unmistakably mournful and rather tired sounding voice.i smiled when i heard this same voice dubbing on the english soundtrack as the police inspector who is investigating the murder of the prostitute killed in the copse in the subject film.my choice of course was to see another outing by the delicious krista nell.<br /><br />there are quite a few rather inconsequential sub plots in the movie involving blackmail/extortion, sleazy affairs with girlfriends' mothers, a motor cycle chase resulting in a gangland hit, a gangrape by a "client's" motorcycle friends, sleazy photography, cross dressing by transvestites etc. which give a flavour to this film summarised in a word - sleaze, (but artistic sleaze).the aforementioned contributor liked this film but the lowly rating suggests other imdb fans did not albeit without explaining their "wheres and whyfores".personally i thought there were too many subplots and not enough put into the main story and the relationship of these subordinate characters to the central plot and the development of their screen characters.also a professional film editor was sorely needed as some of the scenes appeared to last far too long, having made their point, so that the film appeared to drag in places; e.g. the scene of the dancing transvestite.krista nell appears in one fruity scene with a client but this too is but a vignette and i was left wanting more from her, the director and the screenplay.<br /><br />i love the political incorrectness shown in older films (this is 30 years from its making) e.g. smoking in offices and the way some characters react to each other in the office!i would suggest 4/10 as a more realistic rating and i have awarded it as such.
