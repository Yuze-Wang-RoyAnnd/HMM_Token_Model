this is one of those films you can have on for a couple of hours on a sunday morning -- able to do other things with no real complications in losing any understanding of the proceedings, and gaining some fascination in wondering why such mediocrities acquired the manpower and financial resources to be produced in the first place.<br /><br />of course, with all the cable channels, as well as lifetime's need to fill its time slots with 100 or so hours worth of movies per week (along with incessant "golden girls" reruns), this type of fare is now a t.v. staple. also, it seems these flicks provide livelihood to the canadian locales where most are made, as well as the host of canadian actors appearing in them.<br /><br />tori spelling, like the ferret-face paris hilton, is somebody who - if not for family connections and resources - would likely be working at the gap. but at least tori has become, say, a c+-level thespian, appearing in occasional presentations appropriate to this level.<br /><br />this story is one which has been seen on lifetime and similar venues god-knows-how-many times. devious woman, a total sociopath, trying to screw-up everyone else's lives, operating during the initial parts of the story with more cleverness than a cia operative could muster, committing murder when necessary, and out to wreck the life of the flick's "heroine."<br /><br />as usual, the male lead is a completely clueless dolt. and in these types of films, one finds, say, characters about whom one can really "care," about 10% of the time. this one is in the other 90%.
