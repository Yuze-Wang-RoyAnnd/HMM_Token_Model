very stark, very drab, no real drama. why not just make a documentary? this isn't exactly the passion of joan of arc. the only reason for seeing chronicles is to hear the performances. i love bach's music and even i found it hard to sit through this misery of a film. the great gustav leonhardt plays (in two senses of the word) bach. we don't get much of a sense of him as an actor, since he's given so little to do dramatically. mostly, he gets to walk purposefully or angrily out of various rooms. bach's life, of course, was not an errol flynn movie. it was indeed fairly drab and more than a little hard. this probably means that the life isn't a terrific candidate for a film. the music, of course, is another story. i recommend the stations of bach. far more information, for one thing, and some insight into the music, which is, after all, why bach interests us in the first place.
