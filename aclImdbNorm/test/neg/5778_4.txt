(there are spoilers) usual slasher film with the story taking place in and around this god-forsaken mine outside the almost deserted town of sutterille. after receiving a letter map and gold nugget from her brother jared, shadrach smith, clair and her husband nick breman, carrie bradac & sean hines, drive to the village together with four other friends and armature gold-prospectors alx & tori, steve wastell & sangie, and hayden & rox ann, rick majeske & elina to stake their claim. <br /><br />it later turns out that the fact that jared disturbed the long-forgotten gold mine caused the ghost of the notorious jeremiah stone, vernon wells, to come back to life and with that restart his reign of terror. stone, or 49er, is about the most ridicules slasher/killer in motion picture history. stone looks like he was buried for years under a few tons of coal runs around with this hook slicing people in two. after doing in almost the entire cast local hermit aunt nelly, (karen black), who's daughter eve (alexandra ford) was also one of stone's victims, tells those still alive that unless they return the gold back to the stone mine the crazed miner will never rest until he kills all those who still have it.<br /><br />aunt nelly is given just enough time to tell her story before she's turned into a human torch by stone and ends up jumping into a nearby stream.the movie goes on endlessly with the killer miner on the rampage looking like he's about as scary as burnt toast and just as dark. even those in the film seemed to show no real fear of him. in one scene when he broke into aunt nelly's house everyone inside all charged, instead of running away, him causing the ghost miner to lose his right arm; stone spent the rest of the movie with a miner's pick attached to his "stump". <br /><br />besides actress karen black the film "miners massacre" also has veteran actors john phillip law and richard lynch as the town sheriff murphy and old man prichard. passable stuff but nothing special the movie has a predictable ending with the entire gold mine going up in flames. the audience given a hint by the makers of "miners massacre" that the end to this mindless lunacy is nowhere in sight and may very well resurface in the very near future in a possible sequel, god help us all!
