the girl in lovers lane is one strange little low-budget film. on its surface, the movie tells the story of a tough drifter named bix (brett halsey) who spends his time looking out for a young kid named danny (lowell brown) and the girl, carrie (joyce meadows), that bix meets who would like to look out for him. nothing overly interesting happens (bix goes out with carrie, bix gets danny out of trouble, carrie's father drinks a lot, etc.) until about 10 minutes to go in the movie when carrie is murdered. her father blames bix, pulls him out of a jail cell, and just about beats him to death. now their roles are reversed and danny has to save bix.<br /><br />until i read the reviews on imdb, i thought that maybe it was just me reading more into bix and danny's relationship than was really there, but i see now that i'm not alone. it was quite obvious to me early on that bix and danny had more of a relationship than you usually see in a movie from 1959. the homosexual nature of their relationship, while never openly expressed, is still quite obvious. their living and sleeping arrangements, bix's reaction to finding danny in bed with a prostitute, bix's inability to commit to carrie, and that phone call at the end when danny tells his parents he's "brining home a friend are a few examples of moments that lead to the inevitable conclusion that there's more to their relationship than initially meets the eye. i'm sure they exist, but i can't think of any movies i've seen from the 50s that scream homosexual quite as loudly as this one.<br /><br />as for the movie, i don't know any other way to put this
