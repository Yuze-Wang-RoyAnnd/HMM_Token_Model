1st watched 7/19/2003 - 1 out of 10(dir-brad sykes): ridiculously lame 3d movie which pretty much follows the plots of many 80's teen slasher flicks. stupid kids go to a known murderous camp site, become hunted by an unknown masked man, and then we try to figure out who, if anyone, is going to live. we really don't care who's behind the mask but even that's not hard to figure out if you've seen any of these kinds of movies. what a waste of a 3d viewer despite somewhat decent 3d effects.
