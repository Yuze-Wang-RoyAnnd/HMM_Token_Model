this film should be called adventures in cinemascope. it is like the screenwriter and director tooks the cliff's notes page 3 outline and decided that this would be a great vehicle for a film about the italian alps. rock hudson is pretty good here, but the dialogue bears no resemblance to hemingway at all. this is a made up version of hemingway. hecht, the screenwriter, is a hack. watch the 1932 version with gary cooper and helen hayes. that is great cinema and was made by someone who understood hemingway and the war in northern italy. gary cooper is very, very good compared to his performance in for whom the bell tolls where he is stiff as a board and thinks he is in a western.<br /><br />anyway, if you are a hemingway fan, do yourself a favor and do not watch this film. your best bet is to get the unabridged audio cd and just listen to one of the greatest novels ever written.
