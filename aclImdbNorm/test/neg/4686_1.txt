when i bought this film, i expected to get a fun, 1970's exploitation film. instead, i got this bore fest by amateur auteur andy milligan. ah, andy milligan. with his tight editing, breakneck pacing , and wonderfully well known actors, you'd almost think you're watching...one of his home movies! seriously, i couldn't even stay awake the first time i tried to watch it. the scenes of boring people dragged on an on, and whenever someone got killed, the film would slow down. sometimes it would speed up too, making the characters voices sound like chipmunks, which was probably the best thing about this film. the script actually seemed a bit better than the film, and seems more well suited to be in a soap opera than in a grainy 70's sleeping pill where the actors constantly stumble over it's lines. the cover said "their prime cuts were curiously erotic...but thoroughly brutal!" trust me, there is nothing "erotic" about this film. oh, we do get to see characters that resemble extra lumpy cottage cheese making out, but that's about it. and as far as "brutal", well, the viewer is brutalized the most with this here film. and another thing...
