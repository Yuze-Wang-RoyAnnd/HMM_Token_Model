this movie is too stupid for words. even if you consider it to be a parody on movie-making, if you consider it to be completely camp, even than you're wasting your time watching it - for you've seen it a hundred times before. but maybe you are a big fan of high shrieking girl voices, you're still loving barbie and ken and you can stand this typical '80s electric guitar background noise... well, than you'll have a chance.
