i went into this film really wanting to like it - it headlined a film festival earlier in the year, and boasted an all-star cast. but (and you could tell there was a "but" coming) it's a failure of a film. outstanding character acting by sarandon and walken is destroyed by editing and the antics of the supporting cast. turturro's performance is lackluster, and most of the comedy is overplayed. the recurring puppet shows are pointless, and a few scenes are completely out of place.<br /><br />that said, there are some wonderful moments sprinkled in the film. a genuinely touching stage moment, several of the seductions, and a few of the comedic color actually work out. unfortunately, they're overshadowed by the diffuse, incoherent script and some bad acting.
