personally, i didn't really gain a whole lot from the act of seeing with one's own eyes. i've noticed a lot of really highly rated reviews on here for the film, and i'm kinda surprised. maybe i missed something that other reviewers felt "moved" by but i found the film pretty tedious and basically pointless.<br /><br />the "action" of the film is a bunch of autopsy footage that is filmed in an "art-house" style - lots of extreme close-ups, weird editing, etc...and with no sound or dialogue.<br /><br />i guess the act of seeing with one's own eyes could be considered a study of human anatomy, or maybe (if you really wanna dig a little) some sort of comment on the fragility of humanity or whatever - but i personally found it to be a bunch of semi-interesting but ultimately dull autopsy footage. if that's your thing, then this will be a winner for you. as for me - i've seen more interesting er footage. not a "bad" film, as it isn't really a "film" in any traditional sense - i just found nothing really notable about it - 4/10.
