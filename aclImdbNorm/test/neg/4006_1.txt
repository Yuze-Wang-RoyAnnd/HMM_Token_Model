me being one was probably having a brain fart at the time for renting it. anyone who actually buys it, will enjoy using this as a coaster. perhaps a frisbee? this is a dvd i actually found up front where the kids could get to it. since dvd's don't seem to be in the position to be put in that tell tale back room with all the big box vhs tapes are, i find it rather annoying they stuck this up next to a disney film. yep, going from dinosaur to erotic ghost has shown what we all think of disney right? i havent' stooped that low just yet. there's no acting in here. the only thing interesting is the old 1973 movie trailers for ollllld ancient erotic films that i'm amazed have escape from being burned to hell.<br /><br />1/10 (if imdb allowed zero's it'd be 0/10)
