six students at a convent do the unthinkable - kill a nun who was overbearing. now, eighteen years later, the nun's spirit is back and getting revenge for her murder.<br /><br />yea, basically that's the short of it. there's more to it than that, but i still have no clue what it is. the only really cool thing is the effects on the spiritual nun, as i was pretty impressed for being a more low-budget flick. i'm also confused as to whether or not it's in english. most of the actors are italian, and even the title here is in italian, yet they spoke english in the film (i think, or it might've been dubbed, i still can't tell).<br /><br />anyway, the real premise of the film is pretty idiotic, and the ending not only doesn't make sense, it...well...doesn't make sense.
