totally forgettable movie but an unbelievable soundtrack: i'd give it (soundtrack)a 9 out of 10. i have the cd and the guitar work (nils lofgren) is superb! i saw the movie years ago and had to check imdb to remember what it was about. i obsessed about getting the soundtrack and have since had to replace it. it ranges from blues/soul/ballad to a dose of gospel. all songs written, arranged, produced and performed by nils lofgren who is the "other" lead guitarist opposite steve van zandt in the e street band. this dude can play! the vocals are handled by nils (he can't sing very good-too raspy), bonnie sheridan (who is a great singer) and tom lepson.
