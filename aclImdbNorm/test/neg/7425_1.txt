there's something about a movie that features female bodybuilders that gets me in front of the screen every time. <br /><br />i've seen "pumping iron ii", "aces: iron eagle iii", "raven hawk", and even the tv movie "getting physical", which featured some big names in the sport. they were tolerable in their own ways (mostly, because they featured rachel mclish. rowwr!!).<br /><br />then i went and watched "nemesis iii: prey harder", on the sole basis that it featured such luminaries as sue price, debbie muggli, sharon bruneau and ursula sarcev. love the ladies, always will, but after this i'm kinda glad i missed the first two "nemesis" flicks.<br /><br />well, the first one, anyway. most of the footage here is lifted bodily (and kicking and screaming, i would guess) from "nemesis ii". actually, that one looked marginally entertaining from the evidence supplied here.<br /><br />but even though price and company flex and pose, they don't get much of a chance to do anything else (like, say, act!). in fact, this whole film is an exercise (get it? ha-ha...) in oblique story-telling, ambiguous characters and open-ended movie-making (in terms of filming as well as the story-line). <br /><br />nothing makes much sense but even if it did, there would still be issues - such as making such small parts for such larger-than-life women as these. what a crime.<br /><br />of course, it was written and directed by albert pyun, so what did you expect: cohesion?<br /><br />one star only, in consideration for all the hard work that price, muggli, bruneau and sarcev obviously put into their bodies, not the "craft" work done within the movie itself.<br /><br />thanks, ladies.
