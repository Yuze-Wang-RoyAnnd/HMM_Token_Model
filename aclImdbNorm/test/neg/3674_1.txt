val kilmer is almost nowhere in this film -lucky for him! he plays maybe 30 seconds of screen time and his role is completely irrelevant. after seeing the film i couldn't tell you what "role" he plays in the film!!?? ok... they suck you in the first hour by immersing you in dark underground tunnels. spooky movies filmed in dark underground tunnels easily suck most people in to last the first 30 minutes to an hour. then you will begin wondering, "why am i watching this?" i remember thinking how easy it must be for a director/writer to use dark underground labyrinths to make a film. simply film people wandering around in dark tunnels and you have instant "suspense". but that is where this movie goes no further! we all wonder what goes bump in the night, but there is nothing out there in the dark in this film but more darkness. the story is even worse. apparently there is an underlying story to the film that i learned of "after" watching the film. but the film uses such poor dialouge that it never came across clearly during the screening. i still don't understand what the writer/director meant to say. some children trapped underground by a misled sister in russia? why? are they in our time -the same time as the characters? are they ghosts? <br /><br />this was an absolutely horrible film that drew me to write my first imdb review to warn others to avoid it.
