this is easily one of the worst movies i've seen in a long long time (and i've recently seen starship troopers 2!!!). i could find nothing to redeem this film. the acting, which is probably the best aspect of the film, is fair at best. michael madsen hams it up in his standard character persona. denis hopper doesn't seem to know what he's supposed to be. vinnie jones accent is bizarre. one positive thing is that leonor valera looks fantastic. her acting is pretty poor but i doubt that's why shes there.<br /><br />the dialogue is truly appalling. it is quite simply rubbish. i don't know who signed off on this but they really need to get professional help next time round.<br /><br />this film is the reason imdbs rating system should be able to include zero stars out of ten. avoid at all costs.
