you know, i'm getting really tired of all the generic music being used in these type of movies (see jawbreaker, disturbing behavior, etc). every scene of genuine tension here (and there is some) is immediately undercut with some cheesy pop tune, completely diluting the suspense. why do they do that? to sell some soundtracks, of course, but in this case, mission unaccomplished - did anyone buy the cd?<br /><br />and yeah, ms. mirren attacks her role with zest and relish (with some cheez-wiz to add kick). but what are molly, leslie and vivica doing here? their roles (they're so underused that i cannot use "characters" here) have no purpose in the storyline, so i can't figure out why three well-known actresses had been cast.<br /><br />oh, and the ending is so unbelievably hackneyed and irresponsible. the kids get off scot-free and act as if nothing happened - all smiles at graduation. they're criminals, people! no consequences for their actions (kidnapping, assault, grade tampering) - nothing.<br /><br />little things too - was tingle's tale about her husband true? what's with the crossbow? would the virginal katie character loose her cherry on a whim like that? (great message, guys.) why did mckean go to her home? how did kate's academic nemesis walk through the door at that exact moment? how do students even obtain teachers' home addresses? what's with jeffrey tambor?? on what basis did mckean fire tingle? she's bloodied, battered and held hostage by students, fer cripe's sake!<br /><br />oh well, i'm spending way more thought on the script than mr. williamson apparently did, so i'll stop here.<br /><br />3/10
