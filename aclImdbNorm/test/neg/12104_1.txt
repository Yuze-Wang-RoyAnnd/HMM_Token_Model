...out of this movie.<br /><br />sorry to say, this showed at the cleveland international film festival. our copy did not have subtitles, so i asked the festival crew if there was a problem with the print received. "not so..." i was told. "the director wants it this way". <br /><br />again, sorry to say, my french is barely high school elective level (more than 3 decades ago). much of the initial dialog is in french, so i'm sure i missed the nuance and many details in between my understanding of a few key words. <br /><br />i've rated this a "1", primarily because of the irony of a director who once worked doing subtitles refusing to put subtitles into a movie to be seen by an american audience. excuse me, even if most americans wouldn't know where europe was on a map, not even a film festival audience should be assumed to know "the native language" of a given movie. even if a few of us don't know finnish, i would still expect subtitles for the few "dolts" who aren't sophisticated enough to have expertise in the 37 different languages presented. i'll put up with this ego from david lynch, not from litvack.
