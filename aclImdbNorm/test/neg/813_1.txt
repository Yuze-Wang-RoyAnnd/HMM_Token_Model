i had this movie given to me, and have to admit, i am glad that i did not pay money for it.<br /><br />the back of the box makes it seem like some kind of sex triangle, with 2 women trying to seduce her. but the reality in this movie is far from that.<br /><br />in reality, the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape by the two other characters. there was absolutely nothing in this that i found interesting at all.<br /><br />even movies like silence of the lambs and wild things (which the box tries to compare this movie to) were riveting, because of the unexpected turns and suspense.<br /><br />but jaded has none of this. it concentrates on the rapeists and the sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them. and the persuit of a videotape that may prove the victims story is true.<br /><br />while it does show that same sex rape is possible, it is not a movie worth watching.<br /><br />if at all possible, pass this movie up at all costs.
