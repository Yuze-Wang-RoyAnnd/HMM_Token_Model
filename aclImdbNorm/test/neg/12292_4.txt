i'm very interested in the overwhelmingly positive reviews here. while it had some good features, for the most part i found this movie to be heavy handed, predictable, and, worst of all, not in the least bit scary. the first 30 minutes of the movie were promising, the actress did a nice job in her portrayal, and the world around her was well thought out and meaningful. unfortunately, from there, the movie entered into a downward spiral. i went into this movie with no clue as to what it would be about-- didn't know anything about the actors, directors, genre, etc. at a certain point, my wife made the comment "is this supposed to be a scary movie?". well i suppose so, as the boiler-plate "horror movie" score full of squeaking violins and extended vibrato could mean nothing else. there didn't seem to be a whole lot of originality in the movie, the romantic interest was painfully obvious from the first moment, and the second half of the movie descended deep into the realm of the ridiculous. a movie like this walks a dangerously narrow path, and unfortunately there comes a point where the viewer must decide whether to continue walking along that path, or to jump off and simply laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. for the final 30 minutes, i chose the latter.
