i gave this 2 stars out of a possible 10.<br /><br />i went into this not realizing what it was - and discovered it is apparently some kind of african musical - since people break into song every few minutes.<br /><br />none of the songs rhyme, most of them aren't really saying anything sensible, and they all have the same non-existent tune - if you could call it a "tune."<br /><br />karmen is a tall, spectacularly built young woman, with the longest braids i've ever seen. [the actress looks as if she has probably done some modeling.]<br /><br />the film opens in a women's prison, although not like any prison i've ever seen or heard of -- the inmates wear whatever they wish - and seem to be having a party.<br /><br />karmen does some frantic dancing, and the woman warden of the prison, angelique,[a magnificently handsome woman]is definitely erotically interested. she and karmen dance together. later karmen visits the warden's room and they make love - unfortunately the scene is not detailed, and is very short, although there is some nudity.<br /><br />karmen then escapes from the prison and next we see her dancing in front of another group where a man, named lamine, maybe a colonel - it was never really clear who he was, watches her. he is with a young woman who dislikes karmen's seductive dancing and there is a dance-off between the two women.<br /><br />after that the story [such as it is] becomes even more muddled.<br /><br />with lamine in jail, out of jail, and who knows where.<br /><br />karmen may be involved with a group of smugglers or thieves.<br /><br />there is more singing. more dancing, and a scene of angelique obviously suffering from heartbreak.<br /><br />the film muddles its way to a finish, and i heaved a sigh of relief that it had ended.<br /><br /> <br /><br />
