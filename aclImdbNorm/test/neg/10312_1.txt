found this film in a dvd discount rack for $10. it wasn't worth it. some of the camera work and dialog look and sound as if it were done by a film student. sandra's performance was somewhat credible, but the film was predictable and the action was spotty and dragged.<br /><br />one thing that i will give them, however. unlike most action films, people in this film actually ran out of ammo and scavanged dead bodies for new weapons and ammunition.
