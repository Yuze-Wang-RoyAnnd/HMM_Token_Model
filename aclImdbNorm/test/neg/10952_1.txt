wow, i was told this would be a b movie worth watching. i feel that i was misled after seeing this preview event. the plot is a twisted make of several films at best. even the title is a take on another film if you can give the movie that much credit. i am sorry to say that i was taken to the cleaners. i wouldn't waste your time on this one. this movie appears to be a bunch of wannabes who got together and made a poor idea of a movie on a weekend with a borrowed camera. being in the entertainment business, i can judge a decent film and this one deserves to be shelved or discarded. my advice, stick to a classic like the 1979 dawn of the dead. on a scale of 1 to 10 even a 1 is being nice to producers because this movie blows. (below limit of what sucks) the producers need to stay with their daytime jobs. if you do view the movie please be honest in your posting, this one seems to have been hyped up and inflated by a few. there are a few who have seen this for what it is and posted correctly. sorry, but, i have to say this is one to be skipped.
