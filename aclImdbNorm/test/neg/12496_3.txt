eric phillips (don wilson) is a secret service agent who prevents the assassination of a senator however along the way he finds a conspiracy and has a tracker on his tail. the tracker by the way is bent on terminating phillips. the most obvious inspiration for this low budget cheeseball action flick, is of course robocop and while that film had some imagination and real energy, this just has a real life kickboxing champ running away from a robot. the movie isn't so awful as it is just empty and repetitive. the story is written in clich'es and the characters are set up to be cut down by the various gunfire. don wilson, as usual, is terrible in the lead role.<br /><br />*1/2 out of 4-(poor)
