not just because of that theme in the movie. which was one of the lame excuses for something reminiscent of plot. no.<br /><br />i watched this, knowing i would not like it. i hate numerology. whenever someone starts going off about patterns with numbers i feel the urge to slap them. my own brain starts hurting out of empathy. and fully aware this is a movie just about that topic, i couldn't resist the urge to watch it and maybe get a good laugh. but it wasn't funny. just exactly the dumb sort of "isn't this totally scary and yet amazingly cool?! i can turn any crap into 23!" dialog i was afraid of. as soon as the son started to chime in, i knew this movie is a turd, no matter what happens. but i hardly ever stop watching a movie i started. i sat through it. i enjoy the pain.<br /><br />the movie pretends to mock numerology under the disguise of showing how obsession can end badly. but it rides that wave as much as it's supposed to crush it. i don't see that message. i only see characters raving about a stupid number with little plot to justify. <br /><br />top that off with the usual "surprises" - trying to put another twist to throw you off, that makes no sense, and you almost believe it due to the quality of the narration up to there - and you get one hollow piece of movie-making. that just happens to be centered around the topic i despise. if only it did not try to be serious and rather had been some hilarious movie with actors i don't give a damn about. but i was starting to like carrey...while it's not his fault, he is trying. it's not even good for watching with a bunch of friends and mst3k the hell out of it.<br /><br />my expectations were low enough for someone to trip on them, but this movie managed to live up to be one of the worst i've ever seen.
