awful is really all one needs to know. first think of all the things that could be bad about a movie. and then try to make a movie that is bad in all of these ways. you will have made "vacationland." the state of maine should feel insulted: it's much too nice a place to serve as the backdrop for such trite, mindless, boring schlock. i'm a romantic, and i always want movies about two people finding each other to succeed, and i tried hard to find the good in this one. it was tough; very tough. i couldn't find a glimmer of emotional connection among any of the characters in this exercise in humdrum dreariness. except maybe in one or two of the bad guys.<br /><br />maine is a good vacationland; this movie is not.
