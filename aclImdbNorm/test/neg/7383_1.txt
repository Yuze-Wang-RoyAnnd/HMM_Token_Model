oh my gosh!!!! this was the first movie broken lizard made as a group (although it just recently came to video), and i have never been more disappointed in my entire life!!! i tell you what, if i had seen this movie before i saw super troopers (which by the way, is a kick a$$ movie!!!), i never ever would have watched it!! i had read several reviews online, as well as on the cover of the dvd, that raved it as being,"broken lizard's funniest movie ever!" now if they were referring to super troopers as being their funniest movie ever, i would agree nonstop, but not this one. talk about dry. it took the movie a good 45 minutes to even get going, and by then, i was so out of the mood to watch it, that it wasn't even worth it. maybe you gotta be high for it to really be funny? i dunno. i love these guys, i really do, but that movie is by far the worst one they've made. club dread was a pretty good movie, but this one, just wow. i'd highly recommend super troopers if you want a good laugh, but if you want more of a romance, drama, with a few funny spots, i'd say go with puddle cruiser. just my opinion though, everyone is entitled to their own! :)
