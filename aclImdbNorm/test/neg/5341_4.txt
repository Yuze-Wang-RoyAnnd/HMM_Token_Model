"black friday" did this plot so much better, which is why it is remembered and "the man with two lives" is just a forgotten potboiler. "shed no tears" was it's working title and it would have been a better one as he was a thoroughly evil character for most of the film.<br /><br />philip bennett is newly engaged when he is involved in a traffic accident. dr. clark (edward keene) has been involved in some experimental operations on animals - bringing them back from the dead. his colleagues urge him to try his operation on phillip, who has died. as he is operating , a dangerous criminal, wolf panino, is going to the electric chair and trans migration of the soul occurs. when phillip awakes from the operation, he has the soul of panino. he is a changed person, he is rude to his family and starts to hang around panino's old haunts. he takes over wolf's old gang - going by the name of philip bennett, he also romance's wolf's former girlfriend - who smells a rat. bennett, as wolf, is determined to even up scores and starts to eliminate his enemies.bodies pile up, including the girlfriend and a policeman, then his own family begins to fall victim.<br /><br />but - i hate those "bad dream" movies - you always feel let down. this film would have been better if he had stayed in character as panino and had a final shoot out. eleanor, his fianc'ee, would have ended up sadder but wiser with his brother. <br /><br />edward norris, the star, had a big career mostly in b movies.<br /><br />not really recommended.
