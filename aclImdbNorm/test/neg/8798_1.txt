ok, before i get into this, let's go ahead and get the warning out of the way: this movie is the quintessential "cinematic" definition of sleaze! there are movies out there that can definitely out-shock or out-disgust this movie that have way more artistic validity than can be said for this turd of a film. so what makes it so sleazy?? let's take a closer look at "wet wilderness" for a moment......<br /><br />made in 1974 for practically nothing, this "roughie" has no real genuine "plot" to speak of other than portraying what would happen if a family went into the wilderness to relax and spend a day while being accosted by a fat dude in a ski mask wielding a machete looking for kicks.....the kind that end up with everyone being forced to have sex with each other while being systematically murdered by the masked creep. so those sensitive to themes dealing with incest are encouraged to look elsewhere. then to really either add a level of surrealism or just demonstrate a complete ineptness for the art of film-making, the "daughter" of the group runs away after being forced to have sex with her brother and finds a random black dude (!) tied to a tree branch ("...that fat sum-bitch left me here for 3 days...") with virtually no explanation whatsoever!! he is saved.....or is he? of course not!! they are caught before they can escape, where our killer forces them to have sex as well while forcing the mother to join in, ending up with a dead black dude (courtesy of a hatchet through the chest) when all is said and done. then our killer forces the daughter and mother to give him oral sex when one of the women grabs the machete........and the movie abruptly ends!!! just like that! no warning, no tied-up loose ends.....it's simply over. now there might be a proper ending to this film (i honestly do not know), but i have only seen the extremely crude alpha blue archives version. their version appears to have the ending either cut out completely or this is how it ends. if this was intentional, then in film-making 101, i'm sure there is some sort of rule of thumb on how to end a film, but it shouldn't be done like this! fans of the film "psycho" should rejoice upon hearing the soundtrack music, as it's all through the film! i'd be willing to bet no rights were licensed or anything. also, even though this is a "violent" film, there's not a hell of a lot of it, so gorehounds will find nothing of real use here. none of the violence is graphically shown.....only the results (one of the victims gets stabbed with a machete right above the vagina area). also, the sex is some of the ugliest sex i've ever seen! the interesting thing about this film is it's too ugly a film to work as an effectively erotic porno or turn on anyone but those with a tendency to like things sleazy, nasty, and ugly, but not violent enough to garner any real notoriety with those looking for something really brutal like "cannibal holocaust" or other flicks like that. the only "notorious" thing about this steaming pile is that violence was added to an adult film, a fairly new concept at that time, especially when you consider than porn chic was all the rage and the grindhouses that filled 42nd street played stuff like this to a most jaded group of porn mavens. this wasn't and isn't "mainstream" porn at all.<br /><br />if you were in film-making school and there was a list of movie-making "don'ts", this film would be a shining example of that lesson! this cinematic swill demonstrates what happens when cerebrally challenged filmmakers are given a "budget" (in this case, probably about $142.....cuz it looks it!) and ignore all the "don'ts" and turn them into "do's".....yes, this film is that bad!! one more thing: those who get offended by racial epithets are also encouraged to watch something else. the black man in the film is constantly being verbally abused about his color and the killer is obviously racist, but there was no political correctness in the early 70's. i'm not sure a film like this could be made today.<br /><br />to be honest, this won't "shock" anyone or titillate anyone but those who get off on ugliness. actually, i got bored. the sex is so ugly and mundane, it's hard to watch with any sense of eroticism, so if you chance this, you will thank god for the fast forward button! the "acting", if you want to call it that, is amateurish at best (i mean, it's even bad for porno!) with not one reason to care about anyone or anything in this!! if you just gotta see this anyway, then download it, as you'll really feel like a heel if you buy this. some things are simply that worthless.....and "wet wildernes" is. the only thing more unpleasant than watching this film would be watching this film sitting in a theater and looking around at the others in attendance watching it too and suddenly feeling unsafe. probably not society's greatest collection of thinkers and intellectuals. but if you're up for some stupid, yet sleazy porn garbage, give it a crack. it's 54 minutes and yet, it feels much longer!! crackheads would love this! then again, maybe there's something wrong with me for seeking this out in the first place......lol! caveat emptor, sleaze-lovers!!
