okay people, i have to agree with almost everyone else's reviews here. the characters. are. stupid. they're all stereotypical, and yet have nice clothes and are always skinny.<br /><br />don't even get me started on jamie lynn's role as zoey. zoey is a pretty, popular, tan, blonde young teen who everyone just loves! she has a "rebellious", great, personality that everyone agrees with no matter how dumb or extreme it is. most annoying of all: her voice is so darn bubbly and obnoxious. "omg!"<br /><br />take for example the first episode. the moment she steps onto the huge pca campus, everyone seems to love her. the boys want to ask her out, the girls want to be her friend, etc. thinking she's all that, the episode plays out with zoey always being the center of attention; she is the so-called best player of the unofficial girls basketball team, confident, and has everyone pity her when she weakly gets hit in the face. oh boo-hoo.<br /><br />my favorite character by far is this whole series is a girl that appears much later into the show, lauren or something, who is the only person ever introduced in the show to hate zoey.<br /><br />and zoey doesn't even seem to be very loyal to her friends sometimes. in one episodes she even calls her friend a freak without ever apologizing and doesn't show the least bit regret in doing so.<br /><br />zoey is always the best:<br /><br />-desiging professional t-shirts and backpacks (which become a big hit)<br /><br />-coming up with very elaborate schemes by herself to teach a single person a lesson. <br /><br />-flawless grades <br /><br />-taking the blame for stuff that wasn't even related to her just so everyone else could be happy.<br /><br />-coming up with a commercial that was so good it was put on tv. the list goes on and on...<br /><br />ugh. she has no acting talent. she's always the perfect person. she acts snotty and rebellious and preppy and...ugh! can't stand her.<br /><br />not only that, but everyone in the show always has great clothes. even the nerd! her wardrobe is better than mine, and mine is pretty freaking decent.<br /><br />no one cares if everyone at pca loves you, zoey, and would do anything for you, even if it meant giving their right arm.<br /><br />but regardless of these cardboard characters, the plots are creative. not everyday things. they're interesting and amusing. the humor is usually good-natured and fun, but the characters are so paper flat that it's hard to enjoy it.<br /><br />this show would be really good if dan schnieder put a bit more time thinking of the type of characters he wanted, because they are so typical, so boring that's it's lame and stupid.<br /><br />point: no one's the least bit overweight, everyone has stylish clothes, zoey is the definition of mary-sue, the story lines are well-thought out, and the humor is laughable. but again, i want to emphasize that the characters taint the show. watch the show if you must, but don't say i didn't warn you if your eyes start to bleed.
