this is absolute drivel, designed to shock and titillate the 60's mindset. the acting is completely wooden, consisting mainly of ad-libbing, which results in the sub standard actors dribbling the first thing they can think of, repetitively. <br /><br />the end result is of a badly written play being read by people who have no idea and couldn't care. the one exception to this is the lead character "joe" (played by joe dallesandro) who spends a lot of the film in a naked stupor (either stoned, or the only one in the piece who can act!) please don't think i don't "get" warhol - this is plainly and simply a stinker that should never have made it out of a film class.
