i really wish hollywood would come up with some new ideas and quick. instead they go around and recreate and mess up a perfectly good movie with a re-make. this movie is awful from the demille version. all the way through this movie i was saying to myself, huh??? - what???? - i don't remember that part. the only exciting thing in this movie so far was the parting of the red sea. and in heston's version - it was a heck of a lot better than this version. did anyone else see an atomic or nuclear bomb cloud fade in and out when the red sea was being parted? i think i did. anyway, i might - might - watch the last part tonight.<br /><br />i wish hollywood would tackle different ideas and subject matters when they are making new movies. instead of re-hashing old films.<br /><br />they should of left well enough alone.<br /><br />update:<br /><br />well i watched the last part. did moses make up the second copy of the ten commandments with his own hand - or was i seeing things - please someone - email me and let me know. horrible
