i had to rent a couple of movies for my little cousin for new year's and she picked out the swan princess: the mystery of the enchanted kingdom and the little mermaid 2 and we just watched both films, while she's sleeping, i figured i could get a couple comments in. :) while this is a very cheesy cartoon, it really wasn't that bad. you have to admit that for children, these plots are new to them and it could be a great introduction of these stories to them.<br /><br />odette finds out that derek has been secretly keeping the magic secrets of rosthoe and she tells derek to destroy them immediately, but him being a guy, typically he does not do so and tells her that no on could achieve the magics without his help. when a witch named zelda gets her hands on them, she finds out that derek tore off the last words of a spell she wants to use to destroy everything, and she kidnaps odette in order to retrieve this information.<br /><br />the swan princess: the mystery of the enchanted kingdom is silly and predictable, but for the kids i would honestly say it's a go. it's so rare we have these clean cut cartoons now a days, so i'm going to cut the film some slack. it was just weird seeing all the voices change all of a sudden, i grew up with the first one, so i guess it was just stuck in my head.<br /><br />4/10
