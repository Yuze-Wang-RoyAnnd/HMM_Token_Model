doesn't anyone bother to check where this kind of sludge comes from before blathering on about its supposed revelations? ask yourself a question: is my skull an open bucket that i allow anyone to dump their propaganda into? do yourself a favor and take a look at the bomb-shelter mentality of pathtofreedom.com before you waste your time with this screed.<br /><br />these sorts of mother earth/people's republic of berkeley urbanite fruitcakes that openly despise a way of life only because it doesn't match theirs must believe their case fails miserably on facts and objectivity. else why resort to willful distortion and blatant one-sidedness? pathetic.<br /><br />don't be a sap. take two seconds and cast a skeptical eye before falling for yet more 'end of the world' hysteria from it-takes-a-village types with a political agenda that's probably even to the left of your own. mi. moore (rather his unthinking followers) have really opened the floodgates with this kind of one-sided political trash passed off as a *cough* documentary. but apparently they understand the sentiment of an ever-gullible public: "if it's on a movie screen, it must be true." <br /><br />god gave you a brain - act like you know what you're supposed to do with it...
