while traveling by train, a woman (st'ephane excoffier) mistakenly gets out in a remote station when the train stops in the middle of the night. sooner she finds that a weird lonely pointsman (jim van der woude) that does not speak her language is the only person in that area and that that was the last train in that track. the man lodges her in his house and they develop an unusual wordless relationship between them.<br /><br />"de wisselwachter" is an overrated boredom, with a different but uninteresting story that goes nowhere. i like movies off-hollywood, but this story is too absurd and has no message in the end. the sexual tension between the two lead characters is funny in a moment but too repetitive. i saw this movie in an old vhs and the image is too dark; i do not know whether on dvd the image would be of better quality. in the end, i was absolutely disappointed with this feature. my vote is three.<br /><br />title (brazil): "o homem da linha" ("the man of the line")
