the imdb plot summary erroneously makes it sound like it is noah taylor's movie, when fairuza balk is the central character. it is unbelievable how such a cast of established actors could have been in such an amateurish, pointless, non-movie. balk breaks up with boyfriend taylor, sleeps with the devil (i guess - played by dempsey), and accidentally kills taylor -- who follows her about for the rest of the movie as a ghost. may be the worst movie i have ever seen.
