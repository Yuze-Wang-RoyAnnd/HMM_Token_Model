i saw this film right in the middle while going through a breakup. it was about 3 in the morning and i was battling insomnia with a quick snack. it wasn't too bad at the time, but every time i have tried to watch it since, i can't get into it like i did that night.<br /><br />at the time i thought it was cute and i loved the variety of characters, though they totally could have done better than goran v, in my opinion. but the one thing that kept me watching was heather's character and her sad "commitment" to her husband who didn't want her anymore, which made me feel sorry for her and root for her at the same time. (considering i was in a similar situation at the time, perhaps that's why i liked her so much.) not a bad film, but you pretty much have to be somewhere near the character romantically in order to appreciate it, and let's hope you never are.
