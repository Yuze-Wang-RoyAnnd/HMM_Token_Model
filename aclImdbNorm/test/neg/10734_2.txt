" while sporadically engrossing (including a few effectively tender moments) and humorous, the sledgehammer-obvious satire 'homecoming' hinges on comes off as forced and ultimately unfulfilling. with material like this, timing is everything (michael moore knew to release "fahrenheit 9/11" before the 2004 elections), and the real tragedy of dante's film is that it didn't come out 2 years ago, when its message would have carried an energy that would have energized the dissidents further. in 2006, mockery of the well-settled bush administration hardly seems as controversially compelling (or imperiled) as it did then."<br /><br />frankly anyone that could be convinced of anything by a ham fisted zombie flick has questionable intelligence. <br /><br />and if you didn't notice, michael moore didn't exactly help to defeat bush.<br /><br />there was nothing engrossing about this film. i just felt disgust at how blatant and frankly stupid the film was, it was painful to watch. if you are going to do something like this you need a bit of wit. sadly this has none. a poorly done satire actually has the opposite of its intended effect. as they say, with friends like these who needs enemies.
