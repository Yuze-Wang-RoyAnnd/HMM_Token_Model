earnest effort which achieves some success to adapt the classic odyssey story to a '30's nostalgia period piece. the adventurers this time are escaped convicts, wandering about the depression afflicted south bungling their way into trouble.<br /><br />the greatest strength of the film is the wonderful music soundtrack, effectively evoking not only the era that this is set in, but the spiritual references that run rampant in the film. besides its value to the tone of the movie, the music is just plain fun to listen to.<br /><br />what cripples the film is that the characters really aren't that likable. in a comedy, you need that element in order to have fun along with them in their misadventures. instead, we have a bunch of selfish, arrogant, soulless, mean spirited nobodies who really have no positive points at all. they're not imposing enough to make you hate them either, so it's hard to relate to them at all. they're offered up as clowns, but like people who put clown makeup on and march in parades, they just aren't funny.<br /><br />like the story that inspired it, the movie takes these guys on an "odyssey," encountering a variety of symbolic (some even mystical) characters. everybody is stamped with offensive stereotypes, the operative word being "stupid." people are mocked right and left, and consequently, no one is left being particularly interesting or appealing. the movie doesn't like its own characters, and it doesn't let you like them, either.<br /><br />riverside baptisms, beautiful sirens, stolen cars, fistfights, radio preachers, people being whipped with sticks; all are thrown at you in disjointed fashion. some evoke a few laughs, others confuse or bore you. i did laugh when a nerdy guy beat the snot out of an especially obnoxious lead character. but there were a lot more pointlessly gratuitous scenes; an example: some '30's dillinger-type guy strafes cows with a tommy-gun. comedy? symbolism? no; just mindless violence, which detracts from the intellectual nature of the original source material this story draws upon.<br /><br />other adaptations of the odyssey are much better. unless you're a george clooney fan, rent something else. but buy the soundtrack cd; the music is great.
