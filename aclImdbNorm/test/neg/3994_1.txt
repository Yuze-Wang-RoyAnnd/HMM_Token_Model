let me get this straight... "the church" has a safety "lock-down" mechanism to keep the spirits from leaving but the ultimate solution is bringing it to the ground?! lofl! maybe i'm missing the plot. maybe this guy is from the ed wood school of film-making or something. this movie is about as useless as the church itself. hey... maybe that's the point. that whole rosemary's baby-esq segment was hilarity. i can go to my corner halloween costume shop and get better drag than that. the entire film needs to be remade. properly. there were so many things that were played down... so many things that could have made me jump out of my seat and through the ceiling. i'm not sure if the fault lies with the writing or editing but what i saw should not have this high of a rating.
