this is a great example of what happened at comedy central after dave chapelle left. here's the problem with carlos mencia. firstly, his birth name is ned holness, and was known that until he was 18, when he switched his name to ned arnel mencia. he was born in honduras, though he acts like he's from mexico. he grew up in the united states, as well.<br /><br />i might be able to forgive all that crap, but...<br /><br />he's been caught stealing other peoples material. joe rogan has been his most vocal critic in this way. the stereotype olympics was an idea he ripped off a couple of dj's from miami. he has stolen jokes from bill cosby. he stole george lopez's material in his own hbo special (13 minutes of it).<br /><br />he thinks what he's doing is so original, but dave chapelle and lisa lampanelli have been cracking on race for years before this idiot (amoung others).<br /><br />this show will crash and burn. the word beaner can't last that long before it gets old. he hasn't done anything new since the first episode.<br /><br />"wanna hear a joke? a beaner jumping a fence!! that's funny for 3 seasons!" not.<br /><br />awful.
