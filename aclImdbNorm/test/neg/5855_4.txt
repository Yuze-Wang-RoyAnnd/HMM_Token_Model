this film coincides with mike allred's comic book mini-series, "red rocket seven" and tells the story of an alien who escaped to earth to wait for "astroesque" which ties into the book of revelations and the apocylpse. this is only part of a bigger story (if the movie confuses you, read "rr7" too). you can easily tell that allred is used to telling stories with pictures. the direction is very good and the effects aren't bad for a $500 budget. unfortunately, mike used many friends to play the roles and probably didn't have the heart to say that they couldn't act. also, mike is not showing his writing skills in this movie. his dialouge spoon-feeds the plot to you and doesn't let you enjoy the characters. this was actually disappointing considering his tremendous writing ability shown in his comic books. 4 out of 10.
