spheeris used this documentary to push a stereotype of punks. this documentary is biased and guided, not objective. the cutting techniques that jump from interview to interview may be used to take the spoken word of interviewees out of context. when you watch the film, the sticking idea that comes from the interviews of the punks is that they are pretty dumb. band members and other punks seem to be of low intelligence and unable to explain their motives or give detailed or coherent answers or even answers at all. i highly doubt that if some of those who were interviewed knew what spheeris was creating or saw the final product would allow themselves to be included in the project. this film puts punks in a bad light by making them seem unintelligent and simple-minded. spheeris' film should not be taken as a representation of the l.a. punk scene. if you want to see a good punk documentary watch "another state of mind" featuring youth brigade and social distortion.
