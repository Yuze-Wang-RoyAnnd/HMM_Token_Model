i was so excited to finally watch "pulse" after receiving it from amazon, and i have to say i was utterly disappointed. i perhaps think i was too hyped up. i had expectations set by its fans that simply couldn't be met. after loving other asian horrors, i thought i knew this would find a place in my heart.<br /><br />the story was slow, painfully so. i am a diverse fan of horror. i love the brutal, bloody craziness of "the devil's rejects" and i love equally the steady, growing macabre of "a tale of two sisters". "pulse" offered little from either spectrum, sadly.<br /><br />along with the sluggishness of the plot, it was also very muddled. i hadn't a clue why characters were doing what they were doing and how what they were doing would help their problem. it seemed as if the director spouted off the plot in a sentence or two and the rest was improf from our actors. unlike "a tale of two sisters", which also has a rather hard-to-follow plot line, "pulse" clears up very little at the end and left me feeling frustrated, confused and uninterested in the characters' endeavors. my closing statement about the plot was its inconsistency. at first it seemed as if the story was about the ghost world overflowing and their medium of escaping is the internet. that's a damn original idea. i like that. but as the plot drones on, plot-holes and unexplained happenings rearing their heads in, it seems the director switched to some apocalyptic tale (as evident by the ending) that just hasn't been clear enough throughout to execute.<br /><br />i realize the dreariness of the shots and the setting was intentional to make the viewer feel bleak and isolated, but the dullness of the movie was only intensified by the grainy, shadowy surroundings. i will admit there was a certain feel of surrealism with the movie, but that may have just been my attention waning in and out.<br /><br />the actions of some of the characters are a little bit ridiculous as well, and perhaps if i was more enthralled by the story i would've been able to suspend more disbelief but as well myself being unmotivated so too were some of the characters. like i mentioned previously, the logic behind what certain characters did were absent and contributed to the incoherence of the plot. perhaps it was a result of the plot's incoherence that the characters do questionable things. to be honest i don't really care.<br /><br />the acting was decent. certainly nothing outstanding but nothing terrible either. no outliers to mention on either side of brilliant or plain awful.<br /><br />now i'll stop sounding so sour and mention that there were a handful of creepy moments. one towards the end especially that if there were more like it throughout, i would've enjoyed this movie (almost) wholly. i thought whenever the website was shown it was pretty unsettling, as well as some of the ghostly encounters our two main characters face. the things that went on between these ghastly run-ins were just too lackluster, baffling and "wtf" for me to truly appreciate.<br /><br />now for something pertaining to the dvd itself... magnolia's release of "pulse" comes with subtitles, yes, but the subtitles are off. they aren't said at the correct time of the character's speech. it may sound nit-picking but it bothered me a little and it may bother some others. i think this is the only north american release of the film though so you either have to deal or watch dubbing (never watch dubbing!!!) i tried to like the film, i really did. i wanted this film to live up to the hype... but sadly, it fell flat for me. if you're looking for other creepy asian cinema i can recommend you "audition", "shutter", "a tale of two sisters", "strange circus" and "marebito" -- all of which are more my palette.
