i'm always interested to see neglected movies that appear to have good credentials, but in this case the film's neglect appears justified. evidently based on some actual incidents during wwii, the film just doesn't connect with the viewer for some reason that it is not quite clear to me. one very likely reason is that - in the print i saw on tcm, anyway - none of the scenes where the germans talked among themselves were given titles. this interesting directorial concept - to let the non-german speaking viewer just guess from "context" what the germans are saying to each other - is, in my book, an utter flop and helps to lock the viewer out. also, the way the movie begins - just dropping us into a very confused situation without much setup - is disorienting. brian keith is pretty good here, but the reputations of "the great escape" and "stalag 17" will not be challenged by this flick.
