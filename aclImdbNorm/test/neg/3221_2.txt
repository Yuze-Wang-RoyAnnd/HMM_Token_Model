a friend of mine decided to rent this thing, lucky it wasn't my money.. pretty much wasted my time though. a story that could have been interesting is completely wasted by incredibly bad acting and horrible editing/directing. maybe it could become a classic because of all the weird over-acting :)(gary busey's character for example) all the over-acted characters were actually the only thing that made this movie a little interesting as they grabbed your attention (for all the wrong reasons obviously) where the movie in itself failed miserably. in short: a waste of time and money<br /><br />2/10
