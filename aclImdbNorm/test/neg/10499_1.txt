a friend of mine showed me this film yesterday, and i was really amazed that someone could make a movie this terrible! <br /><br />mix the most awful, clich'ed dialog, with the most wooden acting you've ever seen, with the cheesiest special effects know to man, and you get this magnificent beast!<br /><br />'vampire assassins' is funnier than most comedies i've seen, it really is awful! <br /><br />i was in stitches during the scene where the ex cop/vampire assassin character is having coffee with the internet journalist. just watch it and you'll see what i mean!<br /><br />i honestly can't believe that someone made this with serious intentions.<br /><br />tragic, but a really good laugh. it has to be seen to be believed.
