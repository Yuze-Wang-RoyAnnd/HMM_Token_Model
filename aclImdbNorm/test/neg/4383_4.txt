when i was young, i was a big fan of chuck norris. i just begun getting out all his old movies on video so i can see them through adult eyes. i remember that i really liked this one in particular, and thought it was one of his best. now that i'm a little older, i can say that although it's thoroughly average, i still consider it one of his better films. in an acting stretch for him, norris plays a cop haunted by his participation in the arrest and capture of a dangerous serial killer movie. serial killers are all the rage nowadays, and people would like to think of them as a wholly 90s invention. in contrast, it's good to see where the current infatuation has sprung from, most obviously, action movies (as well as stalk n' slashers) of 70s and 80s. while norris attempts at both humour and any form of human compassion are ham-fisted and laughable, nobody could kick someone in the head quite like chuck. being a big fan of steve james also, i can recommend this film, ditto for genre legend billy drago, as well as seeing mitch from the blue brothers in a supporting role. not great, but it's better than anything norris did in the 90s.
