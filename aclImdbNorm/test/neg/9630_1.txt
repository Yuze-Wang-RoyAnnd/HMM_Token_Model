there are no saving graces in this dreadful, stagey, boring snooze-fest, which brings to mind "the ransom of red chief"! <br /><br />even though there are some big stars in this film, the acting is almost uniformly terrible. <br /><br />glenn ford, normally a laid-back kind of guy, hams it up with forced emotion. <br /><br />donna reed is so over-the-top as to prove laughable. <br /><br />leslie nielson is woefully miscast and is terrible. <br /><br />the son is such a repulsive little brat, i found myself rooting for the kidnappers. <br /><br />the only decent performance in this mish-mash is the relatively minor role of the butler. <br /><br />perhaps i'm being too harsh on the actors, after all, all they did were to read the lines given them in the script. ah, the script, that turgid piece of contrived dreck that would like to tug on your heart strings but merely turns your stomach.
