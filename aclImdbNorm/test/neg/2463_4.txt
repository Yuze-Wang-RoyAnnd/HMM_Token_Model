"once again, we have a movie that packs about 20 minutes of entertainment -- much of it involving the band's occasionally funny lyrics -- into a 90-minute package." for anyone old enough to remember, this is along lines of the first "bill and ted" without the story line. if that doesn't say enough as to how brainless this movie is, think about jack black singing for about 20 minutes of the movie and that being its selling point. if you actually like listening to tenacious d because of their musical prowess, then knock yourself out and buy the soundtrack. don't waste your time with this though. if your a stoner looking for a good bad movie filled with laughs, you're still barking up the wrong tree. no matter the potency of your buds, you'll still be left wishing you'd popped in grandma's boy again instead.
