this is one of those movies where i was rooting for whoever could end the movie the quickest. i wanted to see the cops kill keaton and garcia just to get it over with. basically, this is the deal--two cops have to die and a third has to get horrible burns on his face for garcia's son to get a bone marrow transplant from convicted killer keaton. is it worth it? no!
