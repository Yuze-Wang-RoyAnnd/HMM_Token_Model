i like ali g's show, i believe the guy has comedic instinct, but hasn't (yet) developed it to a talent.<br /><br />the movie is a little worse than i was expecting. i don't find ali-g offensive, just stupid. jokes for 5-year olds, some good, some terrible.<br /><br />if you want to watch a movie that seems "offensive", but is actually funny, see tom green's 'freddy got fingered'.<br /><br />2/10
