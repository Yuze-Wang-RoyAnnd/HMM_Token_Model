this is one of the worst films i've seen for years. the storyline has potential that is never realized. the actors are a poor choice, but considering the screen writing, their talent isn't wasted. i really wanted everyone dead as quickly as possible so i could get out and watch something else. unfortunately, i did stay to the end and had a laugh at the murmurs of people moaning about how crappy this is. there wasn't booing, after all, this is england, just gentle moans about how crap that was. then, i look on imdb and see 288 people have given it 10 out of 10. i really just cannot see how those people are able to give that score. they must be a pr company working with the distributor. there's a hilarious set problem towards the end of the film, when in the graveyard and the hick attacks, look out for the dodgy scenery that rocks when touched (supposed to be a brick wall) - the blood effects are waaaay ott - the film feels like everyone is making a spoof horror except the director.
