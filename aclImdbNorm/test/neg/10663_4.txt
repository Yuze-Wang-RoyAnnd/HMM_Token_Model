as a nice anecdote to one of the above comments: in was in mumbai about two weeks before the release of this movie, i was approached -being white- to dub some of the lines of this movie in a recording studio.<br /><br />while i speak german as well, i was kindly asked to do all dubbing scenes in english, otherwise it would be too confusing for the indian audience... so therefore, all germans in this movie actually speak english! funny enough i did multiple characters, so if you would want to actually spoil some time by watching the movie again, listen carefully; <br /><br />all non-indian characters are only done by 4 voices! . . . .
