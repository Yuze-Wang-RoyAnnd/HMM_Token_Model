steve martin has always had my respect for being a very funny comedian and a pretty good actor, and i loved "planes, trains and automobiles" and "bowfinger" --- but "bringing down the house" definately isn't one of martin's funniest works, and it doesn't even seem as if it's trying to be, which is just plain sad...<br /><br />i don't know; maybe i didn't like this movie because of the fact that i rented it along with "harry potter and the chamber of secrets" and "phone booth", both of which are excellent films, or maybe it's because i'm used to so much better from martin, or maybe it's just because i'm in a frickin' bad mood today...regardless, this film just wasn't very funny or entertaining, and i never managed more than a smile or a weak chuckle at the film's gags, which is really a shame, since the previews of this comedy were so promising! i was expecting "bringing down the house" to be an all-out comedy bash, and i certainly expected more slapstick comedy and inter-racial laughs from martin. instead, we're 'treated' to seeing queen latifah jiggle all over the screen, trying to do her best with her totally uninspired character. the funniest thing in this clunker is eugene levy, but even he doesn't get the screen-time he deserves.<br /><br />i would've really liked to enjoy "bringing down the house", but i didn't and i'd find it very difficult to recommend it to anyone but the most die-hard steve martin fans. skip this one and rent "planes, trains and automobiles" instead...<br /><br />you'll have a much better time.
