this film doesn't have a very clear picture of what it is or wants to be. there are some good bits when stewart is on screen and they give him some lines to work with. it works best early on as romantic comedy, but the story keeps heading for more dramatic territory and gets itself lost in the process. by the last fifteen minutes or so, the plot twists are just a series dramatic clich'es. <br /><br />the part with the airplane feels like some leftover footage from another film spliced in.<br /><br />the main reason i can think of to watch it is if you want be able to say you've seen all of jimmy stewart's films.
