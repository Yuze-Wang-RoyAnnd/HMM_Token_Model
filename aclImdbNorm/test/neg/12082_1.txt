jane eyre with full frontal nudity! i was not surprised to see that a woman had had a hand in this awful "woman's picture" and i mean that in the worst possible way. the trouble is, it could have been so good if they had only left out the jane eyre stuff and stuck with the vastly more interesting scenes involving the spanish/portuguese jews in early 19th century london. when the sound track music is better than the film, you know you are in trouble. when you fast forward the video because you can't stand the film, just to make sure you don't miss anything, you are in even worse trouble. this film will end up on the romance tv channel where it rightly belongs.
