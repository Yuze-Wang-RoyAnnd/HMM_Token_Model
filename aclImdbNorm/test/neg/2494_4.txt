it' s easier to watch this film if one views it as a scenario created by star fleet lieutenant reginald barclay during his holodeck addiction. (barclay is a recurring star trek character played by dwight schultz.)<br /><br />dwight schultz is miscast as oppenheimer. oppenheimer's character is poorly written, so we never see the depth and breadth of his knowledge. instead, we see a shallow, two dimensional figure from a soap opera. paul newman is also miscast as general leslie groves, but this movie's problems go beyond having the wrong actors in the wrong roles.<br /><br />the factual errors and great liberties taken (with the chronology of events) in order to advance screenwriter bruce robinson's political agenda make this movie embarrassing to watch. that's probably why this movie has found a home on the so-called history channel. <br /><br />"fat man and little boy" combine bad science, bad history, bad screenwriting and mediocre acting to produce a movie that should not be viewed by impressionable high school or college students who know nothing about the manhattan project.
