yes sure, this is a friday the 13th rip off but i have no problem with it. it's a good effort, the killings aren't that gory but the acting of one girl carries the movie, what a scream queen, jennifer ritchkoff. for a low budget movie the effects are nicely done, okay, sometimes you can guess how it is done. some people have problems with the use of the camera, i can't see what's wrong with that. it's so strange that so many people dislike this movie, i really enjoyed it. of course the script isn't original but give me one that is, i mean, so many slashers are made in the woods. maybe it is all predictable but it's a worth see, i have seen a lot worser, i can tell you that
