i'm surprised that the comparison hasn't been made yet between mind of mencia and the television program the awful truth, which ran a few years ago. helmed by controversial director michael moore, the show would begin, in the exact same manor as this show, with moore interacting with the audience, and introducing segments, namely short documentaries and skits, which had been put together in an attempt to provoke thoughts about current issues. the difference? mencia rarely delves past the superficial and the reactionary. what he says and does is often pandering and rude, and insults the ability of his audience to make decisions for themselves. there's a difference between being "edgy", which i have no problem with, but mencia tries too hard to accomplish this, and ends up coming off as arrogant, and with little backing. he does however, make points occasionally, but often in order to get to them, one has to sit through some pretty mind numbing attempted shock humor.
