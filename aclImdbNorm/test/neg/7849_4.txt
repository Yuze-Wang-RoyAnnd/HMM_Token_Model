perhaps the director was trying for another pirate (good garland and kelly musical) -- but this lame musical epoch falls flat. sinatra and kathryn graysons voices do not blend well -- and their chemistry together lacks spark. the premise of sinatra as a sweet guy who tries to impersonate his late "bandito" father is okay, but he seems awkward in the role. what's amazing and wonderful here, is how sinatra can take a rather insipid song and make it seem special -- his phrasing and eloquence as a singer make you want to hear it again. when grayson sings the same songs it's hard to believe she's not singing something entirely different and not nearly as interesting. she has her big moment with "love is where you find it" which suits her perfectly and shows off her abilities. the photography is lucious and both stars look appealing as do the costumes and sets. co-stars mildred natwick and j. carroll nash put lots of energy into making the impossible work. aside from sinatra's singing there is a strange menage-a-tois dance with ricardo montalban, cyd charisse and ann miller. it's fascinating and weird. montalban and charisse were a wonderful dancing team and this number is a real oddity.
