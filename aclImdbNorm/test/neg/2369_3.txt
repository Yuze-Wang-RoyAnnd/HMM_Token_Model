the film version of 'rising damp' came out two years after the television series ended. like many fans i duly went along to the cinema when it opened. i came away bitterly disappointed. eric chappell could not have spent very much time writing the script; most of it is rehashed ideas from old episodes. at the time of the film's release, the 'rising damp' series was still being repeated regularly on i.t.v. so the public was being asked to pay to see something they'd seen already. at least the 'on the buses' movies boasted original screenplays.<br /><br />secondly, richard beckinsale had died the year before, so they eliminated the character of 'alan' as a mark of respect, substituting art student 'john', played by christopher strauli of 'only when i laugh' fame. it simply wasn't the same.<br /><br />as another poster has pointed out, rigsby's boarding house looked nothing like the one used in the series, being bigger and altogether cleaner.<br /><br />director joe mcgrath was one of the directors who worked on the original 'casino royale', a film steeped in surreal humour. 'rising damp' also has its share of 'walter mitty' style fantasy sequences, such as the 'saturday night fever' parody. personally, i found them horribly out of place. a case of 'over-egging the pudding'.<br /><br />on the plus side, leonard rossiter is as magnificent as ever as the seedy 'rigsby', as are frances de la tour as 'ruth' and don warrington as 'philip. its just a shame the film isn't worthy of their talents.<br /><br />when rossiter died in 1984, it was shown by i.t.v. as a tribute, with its final scene - showing rigsby laying prostrate at the foot of the stairs - removed in the interests of good taste.
