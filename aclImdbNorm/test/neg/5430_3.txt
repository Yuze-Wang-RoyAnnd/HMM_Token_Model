i just watched congo on dvd.in most cases i love these kind of movies but this one is different. it made me write my first comment for a movie on imdb. i was amazed how such a team of experienced filmmakers could come up with this movie as a result. you can see there was a lot of money for this production but you can't make a good movie if you don't have a good script. and as a producer frank marshall gave us plenty of great movies to watch; he never should have tried to become another spielberg. this one shows how hard it is to make a good movie, maybe you've got all the ingredients but if you can't cook stay out of the kitchen. if can make a suggestion don't spend your money on this one. if you want to see it watch it on television first and make up your own mind.
