this movie was poorly conceived, poorly written and poorly acted. all of the characters were two-dimensional. it was a real amateur attempt. the movie was fundamentalist christian propaganda. the christian characters are holier-than-thou and they are without a shred of compassion for the skeptic or the undecided characters. the movie was a real "gotcha" for both the skeptic character and myself as a viewer, putting us in a very uncomfortable situation. i complained to the theater management and was given a free pass to another movie. i remember another movie on a similar subject, "the rapture," starring mimi rogers, that was much better and professionally done. i think i'll watch "the rapture" again. if you attend "unidentified" and don't like it, don't say i haven't warned you.
