baby boom was bad enough, basically making a series of every straight mans nightmare is worse. yeah watched a few always made me feel better after a bad day, it reminded me it could be worse. guy was rich successful, single(smart man), and dating celebs from singers to actresses, then his screw up of a cousin dumps his biggest mistake on him. in reality it would have been straight to foster care i'm sure, this was definitely a chic series. oh and what's all the wining about the baby change, most the time it's probably a doll besides at that age it's nothing more than a prop anyways.<br /><br />any case i'm glad it didn't last more than a year.
