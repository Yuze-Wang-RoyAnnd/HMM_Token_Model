the series does not start as it means to go on. although it's first two seasons are crammed with incredibly average episodes, as well as numerous duds, afterwards the pace picks up and one of the finest space operas is born. the first ever episode of star trek: the next generation is remarkable for two things: it's hugely enjoyable introductions to all of the main cast, and marina sirtis' peculiar accent which would later disappear. seeing how it all began is very satisfying, and viewed in mind of the rest of the series, rather moving actually. otherwise it is a very mediocre episode featuring q, and some giant jellyfish. that's right.
