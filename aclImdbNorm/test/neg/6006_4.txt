this film truly was poor. i went to the theatre expecting something exciting, and instead was afforded the opportunity to hone my "guess the next plot twist before it happens" skills. seriously, the plot was written with an extra thick crayon so everyone could see. nothing was truly shocking. in fact, even the gore was met with such complete suspension of belief that it really didn't add up to much.<br /><br />the excessive wise cracking and cops talking shop at the crime scenes made it seem all the more phony. and the scene where lambert's character is struggling with the clues and reaches his "investigative epiphany" goes to great lengths to indicate the level of intellect expected from the audience - little.<br /><br />probably the most annoying aspect of the cinematography was the "x-files" treatment: every building in the film, whether it's the precinct building, or a house at noon, or a hospital, was suffering from a lack of any discernible lighting (not to mention a lack of 'patients' in the case of the hospital). i don't recall a single scene when someone flipped on a light switch. it sure would have been nice.<br /><br />mr. lambert really isn't an oscar-grade actor, so i suppose you have to take this film for what it's worth. in the end, i've reached the conclusion that the only thing that would make this film seem more entertaining is to watch it after watching "the warriors". otherwise, you're left with an effort that is dull and unoriginal, and nowhere near the equal of films of the genre such as "silence of the lambs".
