if i were to pitch this movie idea to some hollywood bigwigs, i'm sure it would sound like this: <br /><br />me: "four boys at a private high school are good friends, and they are witches."<br /><br />hollywood: "that sounds like "the craft." <br /><br />me: "no, no, i said four boys, not four girls." <br /><br />hollywood: "that still sounds like "the craft", just with boys instead of girls." <br /><br />me: "ok, but there is this fifth unknown boy that comes into the picture and he wants more power."<br /><br />hollywood: "still not much difference, because one of the girls in "the craft" also wanted more power.<br /><br />me: "ok, ok... i'll make these boys part of the "in crowd", they'll be rich, and the school is on the east coast.<br /><br />hollywood: "now that sounds original. that is nothing like "the craft", here's a billion dollars." <br /><br />this movie was so clich'e and uninspiring. even the manufactured drama between chase and the brothers of ipswich was very blas'e. a bunch of rich kids, with their biggest problem being what color bentley they want for their 18th birthday (and 18th car), don't interest me at all, even if they have powers. every single kid in this movie looked like they stepped out of a magazine, and of course there had to be the gratuitous male nudity and female 80% nudity just to drive home how out of shape you are. i wanted to rename this movie "the witches of o.c.". oooh, rich kids and their problems... let me pretend to care.<br /><br />this film was completely unimaginative and predictable. the final fight was lame and dragged out and the ending was very anti-climatic. this was a movie best left on the cutting room floor.
