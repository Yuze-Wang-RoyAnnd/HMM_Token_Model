this is a tedious movie. the real villains are the clunky adaptation (it's embarrassingly easy to tell that the source material was a novel) and witless screenplay.<br /><br />on the credit side, considering the budget was tight due to wartime austerity, the look of the film isn't at all bad. and the performances are, by and large, ok, except for phyllis calvert, who is terrific - a miracle considering the potential for winsomeness, a pit into which she most definitely does not fall. ms calvert, with a lot less to go on, is as accomplished as olivia de havilland in gone with the wind.<br /><br />the one absolutely unbearable aspect of the man in grey is the dreadfully conceived depiction of a black serving boy. no matter that he's meant to be a sympathetic character. played badly by a white boy in black-face make-up, it is impossible to by-pass this example of condescending racism.<br /><br />grim.
