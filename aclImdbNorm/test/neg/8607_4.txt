sex lives of the potato men is about the sex lives of several men involved in delivering potatoes. so there are no surprises there. it is, in fact, pretty much what you might expect from the title: that is, it's a quirky comedy involving sex and potato men. at times the film works. it's an edgy, sometimes uncomfortable comedy about the lives of some rather unimportant and rather average men who are having problems of various sorts with women. where the film clearly does not work, and why it failed at the box office, is that the quirky, uncomfortable parts are perhaps just a shade too quirky and uncomfortable. instead of laughing during the scene of a man suspended from a basement ceiling masturbating over another man while he makes love to his wife, i think most of us just kind of groan awkwardly and wonder what andy humphries was thinking. well, perhaps we are shown what he was thinking all too clearly.
