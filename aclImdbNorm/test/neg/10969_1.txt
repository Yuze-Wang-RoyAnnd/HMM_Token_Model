i have no idea how accurate the portrayal of flynn appears in this film but even as a work of fiction it is one of the worst films i have ever seen.<br /><br />the script is all over the place and leaves you wondering how he got from one scene to the next - you are just not given the minimum information needed to keep some continuity and understand his present situation, and it is difficult to understand flynn's and other characters' motives behind some of their behaviour.<br /><br />add to that a series of silly and implausible situations and you have film that comes across as one of your dreams that seems to make sense while you are asleep, but when you wake up and you try to remember it, it is just strange, disjointed and totally unrealistic.<br /><br />there are many long, boring musical sections of the film that to me are either bad direction or a bad director trying and failing to be artistic.<br /><br />none of the characters are even likable and the flynn character comes across as a self serving liar, thug, thief, robber, murderer, bear fist fighter, gigolo and impostor who will do anything and step on anyone to further his own dreams, and somehow, despite all that, great opportunities just seem to miraculously fall into his lap.<br /><br />this film is not entertaining nor satisfying in any way and by all accounts not even historically accurate, so why even watch it? to rub salt into the wound, the dvd had one of the worst transfers i have ever seen, it wasn't even in wide-screen or dolby 5.1, it had terrible telecine wobble and many, many artifacts from what looked like a film reel that had been gathering dust and scratches somewhere.
