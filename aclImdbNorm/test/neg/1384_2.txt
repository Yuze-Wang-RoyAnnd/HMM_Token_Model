there's been a whole lot made about carlos mencia's (mr. holness, excuse me) theft of other comics' material. heck, even before joe rogan had a blowup with him on stage i knew that carlos mensteala was swiping material from cosby and kinison and a host of others.<br /><br />to compound the crime of his theft, he retold these comic geniuses jokes badly.<br /><br />and that is a crime he continues to perpetuate on this show. i'm sure the series writers have to share some of the blame - it's got to be hard to write jokes day in and day out... but that's why people get paid so darned much to do it! these series writers need to go back to their day jobs of flipping burgers or whatever it was they were doing before they decided to embark upon a career of intellectual theft.<br /><br />not to say that he steals all of his material. you can tell when he has devised a joke on his own when what you are watching transcends the merely awful and goes straight into the territory of horrifyingly bad.<br /><br />because he likes to call people b***h on his show, ten year olds call him a genius. they're gonna grow up one of these days, carlos, and when they do, you're gonna dry up and blow away.
