terribly disappointed with city of men after being swept away by city of god. lost is the exciting and unpredictable storyline, and instead, in its place, is bland predictability with the obvious attempts at audience manipulation by a superficial pretentious production and distribution team. this story ended up feeling like a sappy soap opera rather than a gritty indie feature, which is what is should have been. this is what happens when distributors try to seek a wider audience (ridiculous sweeping shots of the rio coastline, etc) at the expense of a gripping story and characters. i really couldn't care what happened to any of the characters in this film - they were all so 2 dimensional. in short, sad waste of potential that should have been a slam-dunk following the exceptionally inspired city of god. boo!
