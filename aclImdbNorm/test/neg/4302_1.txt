as much as we might welcome a film that deals with people who have different challenges in the area of romance, i cannot shake off the feeling that this movie was intended as a direct-to-video grade-c porn movie in which either a) the actors backed out of doing the explicit scenes or b) the producers ran out of money to hire for the inserts (an amazing thing if it were true).<br /><br />i had to go back to blockbuster to figure out why on earth i had rented it, which was due to an admittedly amateurish gullibility regarding the cover blurbs, which seemed to imply a seditious john waters-style humor-fest with a sexual theme. okay, i laughed a couple of times and it definitely has a sexual theme (although most of it can't be described as stimulating in any way). but, on some movies you might rewind to make sure you heard the dialog correctly--on this one, you fast-forward because you already know what they're about to say. but there's nothing to fast-forward to, so just fast-forward past it on the shelf.
