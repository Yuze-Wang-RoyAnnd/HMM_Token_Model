i don't usually like to comment on the acting in a movie, because it is the one thing that people who have agenda against a film will go after. in this movie, i will make an exception. the acting in this film are below average all around. i mean halfway into the film, i wonder how the hell did the producer and/or the director gets around casting such an ensemble of people who can't act. even-though the production value was good, the ill written story just compounded on top of the bad performance of the actors, and there is even a half-hearted attempts to a twist to the ending of the movie, which ends up quite confusing. is all the spanish horror films this disappointing?
