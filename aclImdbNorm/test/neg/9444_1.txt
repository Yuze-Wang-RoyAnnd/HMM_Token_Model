ed wood, perhaps the worst film maker of all time left us gems that are so bad, they delight, being unintentionally funny and therefore charming and innocent.<br /><br />james lay, and his financial backers (mom and dad, it seems from the credits) have created in 'dreamland' a film just as poorly made as any ed wood film, but lacking any charm or innocence. dreamland simply stinks, and about the only good thing about this 90 minute waste of time is the certain knowledge that james lay and his fellow perps will never make another picture again.<br /><br />i must mention some of the dramatic lengths some of the crew took to avoid being associated with this horrible picture. i'm sure the production controller, once seeing the completed film, demanded to have his or her name changed in the credits to 'donna snartlebutt' and the accounting done by 'brutus'. one can imagine 'brutus' with his roll of 5 dollar bills paying the crew at the end of a shooting day.<br /><br />i wont mention the many technical problems with this pathetic little videotape, but i must mention a few commentaries that compare this slag to the work of david lynch. you know you have turned out a real stinker when you have your mom log into imdb and post such astonishing bs - no one , save violent mental patients, could -ever- mistake 'dreamland' with -anything- produced by lynch. what a horrific slight against mr. lynch and his work.<br /><br />go back to film school, mr lay.
