i saw this film at temple university. i cannot imaging that anyone will ever see this film in a theater (projected on film). the acting is similar to saved by the bell (the tv show). the plot is simple and unimaginative. the sound recordist likes the sound of wind and the dp needs a light meter. vampires, vampires, vampires.<br /><br />don't waste your money.
