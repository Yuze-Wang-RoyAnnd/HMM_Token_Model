i hope the people who made this movies read these comments. the choreography was horrid, the plot was nill, and the actors where so low budget power rangers appears 5 star to this junk.<br /><br />the fight scenes where so slow you could actually see the actors waiting for each other to perform the next move. camera cut-aways and poor lighting could not cover up the cheap effects. the lightning was just plain stupid. the weapons looked like something out of a final fantasy game, and the dual bow and arrow was just dull as anything i have ever seen.<br /><br />next movie you decide to make try investing in some wireless mics, better script and try actually spending some time on your stunts.<br /><br />honestly there are shows on t.v. that play ever night and are thrown together in a few hours that look better than this one.<br /><br />stick to martial arts (unless its as poor as your acting) then take up quilting.
