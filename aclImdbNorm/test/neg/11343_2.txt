ladies and gentlemen.. be sad (or be glad !).. we are in the disgusting forensic t.v series-era !! now count with me and anathematize our luck :<br /><br />"csi: crime scene investigation", "csi: miami", "csi: ny", "ncis", "crossing jordan", "da vinci's inquest", even "the cosby mysteries" !..didn't we already have enough ?!<br /><br />from the late 1990 till the late 2000s we've got almost the same sick series about the genius criminologist with a partner (or a team) who go to solve crimes by scrutiny the autopsy ..and what a nauseating mission to do. so you will have for sure lots and lots of repellent scenes where we see clearly, accurately and awfully the most horrific shots in the history of t.v.<br /><br />oh god.. once we had the great days; the good cop (or detective)era such as columbo, kojak, magnum, and simon & simon. or the good old sci-fi era, like the six million dollar man, the bionic woman, knight rider. and oh boy we've got also the hot & sexy such :cover up, the love boat, baywatch, even a flop as thunder in paradise.<br /><br />all of those were unforgettable, original, had good..real good thoughts, action, women ..till the x files came.. and then it was the beginning of the misfortune or to be exact : the catastrophe!<br /><br />x files undoubtedly was one of the greatest, but there was a few slight disadvantages, we had have agent dana scully (medical doctor and fbi agent) at every episode doing an autopsy ..,and of course her lap (as the series succeed) became part of our living room, so the thirsty-for-money producers loved it with all the physical terror + the exciting hunt for the truth.. therefore they tried to repeat it in another not too far classification : the forensic !<br /><br />but it became so ugly, full of deformation, and very cruddy just like bones. plus the unsexy present of emily deschanel, and bleeder as david boreanaz (he was much better in angel), and all of these corpses .. to the extent that every time i've watched it i found my self screaming aaaahhhhhh !! what a terrible gross !!..<br /><br />cancel it please.. you've canceled before real good shows such as (the lone gunmen) or (a man called hawk). here it's a bad one.. so please.. little mercy and enough with the bones-era !!!.. or we'll drop dead ourselves of nausea and monotony !!
