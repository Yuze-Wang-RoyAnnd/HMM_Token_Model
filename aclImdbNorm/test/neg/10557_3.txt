how did so many talented or at least charismatic actors wind up in this baloney? nothing is very good about this movie but the worst things probably are the screenplay and the directing.<br /><br />apparently this is director damian niemans heart-piece as he's both written and directed it (and acted in as well). he's a card magician himself and seems to have named characters in homage of other famous magicians. this was his first feature film as far as i know, and chances are it's his last.<br /><br />it's hard to point to exactly what makes it so poor
