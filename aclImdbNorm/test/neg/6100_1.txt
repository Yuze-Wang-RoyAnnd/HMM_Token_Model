this short subject is a remake of the three stooges' 1942 film "what's the matador?", about the boys' trip to mexico and their bullfighting adventures. although the original short was made during the stooges' peak period, it isn't that memorable and i believe it is one of the more mediocre films with curly howard.<br /><br />having established that, i believe that "sappy bullfighters" is just pathetically awful, like all the other shorts with joe besser. moe and larry never should have hired besser, because his whiny, almost feminine character was completely wrong for the violent comedy of the stooges. his 16 films with moe and larry marked the nadir for the team, and those shorts are embarrassing to watch. this short was released in 1959 and was the team's swan song with columbia. maybe besser was a nice guy, but he was all wrong as the third stooge.<br /><br />i won't review any more besser shorts, because i would just be giving the same scathingly negative review over and over. do yourself a big favor and don't watch this. instead, try to catch "in the sweet pie and pie" or "hoi polloi".
