i don't care what anyone else says, this movie is the worst piece of trash committed on film. what was john landis thinking?<br /><br />i know it's based on a series of children's books, but c'mon! even kids hate this movie. it's pointless and boring. tom arnold once again amply demonstrates that his only talent is wasting production money.<br /><br />i think the only reason the stupids hasn't appeared on the 100 worst films of all time is that only 20 or so people will admit to watching this garbage. at least hobgoblins made it on mst3k.
