why oh why did they have to try and make a sequel to one of the greatest christmas movies of all time. the movie is a train wreck on every level and should have never been made. randy quaid's portrayal of cousin eddie is an over the top caricature of his previous outings as cousin eddie. also, the eddie character is not interesting enough to carry an entire movie. even "eye candy" sung hi lee could not redeem this hunk of holiday crap. please do not waste your time on this move, just watch the original again.
