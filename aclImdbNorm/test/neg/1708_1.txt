as an indie filmmaker, i try to at least make a decent film . this piece of ____ was beyond low budget. it was shot on video and not 24p mini-dv at least. the look and feel of this was just baaaad. i met the director a few years ago at showbiz expo in la and he was talking about that book, film-making for dummies that he was putting together. i thought this little video was going to be something but i guess i was wrong. he could have brought the value up a little by shooting 16mm film instead of that awful video. the plot was stupid as well as the acting and all the fake green screen and sound and the whole nine yards. i had a choice tonight to rent any movie and made the wrong choice. damn!!!!! i did buy joyride which was a hell of a movie. maybe the director should read real motion picture books on film-making and not try to cut corners when trying to make a low budget flick. maybe he should learn from the masters who made, night of the living dead and the evil dead and chain saw massacre. just to name a few of the all time low budget great hits. this is one video that should have stayed dead. i cannot call it a film because he did not use film.
