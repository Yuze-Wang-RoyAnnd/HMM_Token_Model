this movie beats everything out there. well, depends on what you are looking for... it could be a 10 or a 1 on the scale. this movie is in a complete league of its own.. i don't think any movie could possibly come close to it. i am not sure what the director intended to make it as.. a thriller or a comedy. if he did think he was making a thriller, then he has by a stroke of luck, created one of the best bollywood comedies of all time. you have to see it to believe it.. a matrix + terminator + a host of other movies rolled into one, along with a storyline dating back to 1980's hindi movies, with a icchadhari naag (a mythical snake which can turn into a human).<br /><br />its an ideal movie if you are sitting with a bunch of friends with alcohol on the side, planning to laugh at the movie! i am not sure whether to give it a 1 or a 10.. on the basis of flipping a coin, i have decided to give it a 1!
