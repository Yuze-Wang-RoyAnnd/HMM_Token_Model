a stupid teen supposed comedy that revolves a serious of misunderstanding including (but not limited to) a hooker being confused with a foreign exchange student, girlfriend beating, a girl loving a gay guy, and the straight guy that loves her, and bitchy gossipers. none of the following is funny or even amusing. nation lampoon's use to be hilarious back in the day. now the name is sadly synonymous with crap. and this one is no exception. i use to think topenga was kinda cute when she was on "boy meets world", but it seems she let herself go (and yes i know she has a name, but into she does anything else worthwhile, she'll stay as topenga) <br /><br />my grade: d<br /><br />eye candy: kati lohmann gets topless; boti bliss relies on a body double (booooo!!!)
