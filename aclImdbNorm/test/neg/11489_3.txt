when i saw that icon was on tv, i was surprised. i know that the first clue of where it was headed was the fact that it was on the hallmark channel - has to be said - sorry!! i was hopeful when i saw that ff himself was the exec producer but very quickly saw that the only real way that the tv movie and the book were similar were in the name and the character names only. the tv plot was a ho-hum to say the least but i concur that in and of itself, the action was worth a 3 stars. in my personal opinion, mr. swayze could have portrayed a valid monk, however i think that in order to do the movie justice, it would have been a far longer movie, and i don't think hollywood itself would have gone for the plot of discreditation by subterfuge. a case in point is the terrible film version of the sum of all fears - need i say more?
