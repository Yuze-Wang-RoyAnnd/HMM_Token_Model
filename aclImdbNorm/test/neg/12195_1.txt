this was not a good movie!! why do you people keep saying that? there is a nice little story going on and then some sexy girls and then bam vampires!!! why? why are there vampires? where did they come from? also, what the hell?! there are all of these "super human" vampires but george clooney and three other random guys dominate all of them. quickly too. it's not like there was a long fight scene with lots of struggle. there was just three dudes from the bar killing these vampires like a fat man kills twinkies! the next thing you know, clooney and the stupid girl are rescued by cheech and leaves the family-less homeless in the middle of mexico. end of story. literally. oh and the strip club was an aztec temple which is funny because that would have to be southern mexico not the border. why are you people lying and telling people this is a good movie? do not rent, buy or even watch this movie at a friend's house. you will wish you had that time of your life back.
