this was one of the shows that i wanted to follow-up on. but, i'd just couldn't bring myself on devoting my time to this show. to have a show that centers on the topic of politics, you really need a strong plot with twists and turns to enhance the mood of the show, something like "the west wing" or "commander-in-chief." rob lowe was ok, but actors like kyle chandler just couldn't act (he was awful in "early edition"). it was a pain to sit through this show. with its lack of suspense, urgency, and characters who can actually act, i just had to give up on this show and am glad it was canceled so i would have nothing more to miss.<br /><br />grade d-
