the contemporary chapter of the u.s. navy's elite underwater demolition team is called to do.... whatever they want, apparently.<br /><br />charlie sheen was made an officer. already the storyline is unbelievable. michael biehn is his immediate c.o., but he keeps charlie on a rather long leash and one of the guys pays for it early on by getting killed thanks to charlie's patented stupidity. the rest of the team spends their spare time committing courts-martial offenses. mostly an exercise in random gunfire and paper-thin ethics, these particular seals might be better suited to serving as crash-test dummies.<br /><br />some good action scenes counter the goofy proceedings.
