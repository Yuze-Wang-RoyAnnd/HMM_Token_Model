it's not awful but what a waste... lousy gags, bad music, poor drawings and animation...<br /><br />regarding the impressive number of animators and intervallists on this picture (from, hum... a hundred different studios throughout the world? come on, how can you expect something coherent when doing an animated movie this way!) i wonder if one guy on the credits = one drawing! the lines are rough, the 3d work inadequate (i'm not against it, but not in this film) but the backgrounds are corrects. the storyline is rather dumb, far from the precise cleverness of the bd, and obviously aimed at an international audience. to distribute a movie all over the world doesn't mean to take everyone in the world for a simple-minded guy... a cultural object is far more interesting when challenging, even when it is a foreign movie (being french in this case it's even worse!).<br /><br />some new stuff is doing well (the olaf character, sometimes, like with the stone explanation, but it's not great) but the modern references are exasperating (music, sms -not even a verbal joke, just a stupid bird named short message service: does anyone know imagination?). but, hey, it's a m6 / tps production with some celine dion in it... pathetic.<br /><br />asterix is underemployed and obelix talks too much. goudurix could be great (like in the book) but he is too clearly a "cool guy" having a love affair (with an uninteresting made up female character). in fact, only the vikings (wizard excepted) are funny. too much action, not enough laughs. the best part of the movie are the end credits. not the music, but the few stills it contains. bd style. well, definitely, asterix is not made to move!
