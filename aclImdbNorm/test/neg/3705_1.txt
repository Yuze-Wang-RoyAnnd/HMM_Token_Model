this movie is, in all likelihood, the worst film ever made. it is certainly the worst that i've ever seen, and i have seen a lot of bad movies.<br /><br />in this, nothing at all interesting happens throughout the movie. one could, literally, start the movie, take a short nap, and then wake up secure in the knowledge that nothing interesting has happened while you are sleeping. and i have seen this movie three times, staying awake throughout. i feel i should be congratulated.<br /><br />the movie goes as one might expect, according to a formula, with no variation. hunters capture baby bigfoot, get killed by parent, and the nearby town goes into a bigfoot killing frenzy. this is surprisingly boring for a troma release.<br /><br />so please do yourself a favor, and skip this movie. if you have to see it you will understand why.
