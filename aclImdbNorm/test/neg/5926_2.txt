i have to say, its not very good. polly bergen is fine in this film.the rest are so so. i'm gay and honestly , there are so many clich'e's for this time in history that its just sad. we started watching it then turned it off, then decided it would be fun to make fun of the rest of the film. but all said, the basic idea of the film is good. if it was re-written with less contrived lines and better acting it could have actually been prety good. over all i would not recommend it. in additon the this is coo coo thinking line is so lame. on top of that the fight in the hair salon is funny because its so bad. the lesbian sister in the room with them while they are trying to get it on is so weird its sad.
