it's not often i feel strongly enough to post something about a film. this was, however, simply the worst movie i have ever seen. the performances were laughable at best, at worst they were, well, there's no other word for it, awful. especially the lead female who's random sexual come-ons have to be seen and heard to be believed. honestly, the plot is nonsensical,the dialogue appalling and the characterisation...there is none. i'm surprised it's not an alan smithee film. i can't stress this strongly enough... avoid at all costs.how do movies like this ever get made? this is no budget film-making at its very, very worst.
