i saw this movie because every review i read of it said that it was one of the scariest movies of the new millennium. i really don't understand what all of the hype was about. for one thing, the dialogue in this movie was laughably bad ("what if something strange is going on?"...what????). the acting didn't blow my socks off either. it could have been because the script barely gave the actors anything to work with....the characters are purely 2-dimensional to me and i didn't give a hoot about them at all. another thing is that the movie extremely boring. extremely. sure, there are a couple of "jolts" here and there, but for the movie's 112 minute length, it sure didn't use it's time up wisely. most of the movie contains characters talking about stuff that had barely anything to do with the plot. what was the point of that??<br /><br />to top it off, the movie makes no sense. yes, i believe i understood the intentions of the ghosts, but how that fits into the events that actually occur in the movie is beyond me. also, much of the movie is played out in little vignettes, which makes the story hard to follow at times. and don't even get me started with the ending. what exactly happened there?<br /><br />i can give kurosawa credit for placing some truly frightening images throughout the film. there are very creepy shots of ghosts and other unsettling images. if they reflected more on those images and elaborated on them, it would have made the movie much stronger. but they didn't, and instead elaborated more on social commentary, which was interesting, but again, portrayed in an extremely dull way. yes, it's a message movie. okay, fun. i'll just get the message of my review right out here in the open: find a better way to spend your spare time than watching this.
