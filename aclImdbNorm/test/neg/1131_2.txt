it'll be a blue christmas indeed if you subject you're family to this. i loved the original movie, and this one was not worthy of being its sequel. actually, for all intents and purposes, it is not its sequel. only one character from the original cast returns. granted, that character happened to be the hilarious cousin eddie, but he simply is not hilarious being the protagonist of a movie. his niche is that of the wacky relative who performs zany antics--alongside chevy chase. chevy chase was needed in this film for it to be a success, and he definitely was not there. as far as i am concerned, a movie is not a "vacation" movie unless good ole' clark griswold is at the helm.
