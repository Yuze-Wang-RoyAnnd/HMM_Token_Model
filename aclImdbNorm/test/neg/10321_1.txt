i checked this out for free at the library, and i still feel ripped off. yes, sandra bullock is actually in it, but only in five scenes totaling up to barely 5 minutes, and even those are fairly painful to watch. the rest of the movie is so bad that you'll spend most of the time hoping it will end soon, but only if you're one of those people who have to finish a movie once they start it. everyone else will just turn it off. don't worry, you aren't going to miss anything. bullock's lines (assuming that you were tricked into watching this because her name is plastered on the case) are essentially just parroting of other characters lines, like this dialog:<br /><br />lisa (bullock) - "danny, please tell me what is going on."<br /><br />danny - "i don't know." <br /><br />lisa - "whaddaya mean you don't know?" <br /><br />danny - "i don't know - it's something to do with my dad." <br /><br />lisa - "whaddaya mean your dad?" <br /><br />danny - "i don't know - he ****ed up or something." <br /><br />lisa - "why am i here?" <br /><br />danny - "i'm sorry lisa. i don't know." <br /><br />(moments later) danny - "some army buddies of my dad . . . " <br /><br />lisa - "whaddaya mean army buddies?"<br /><br />see what i mean? <br /><br />bottom line - just say no.
