i'll never understand why when a studio like universal buys a musical it then butchers it when bringing it to screen. my first thought when seeing ava gardner and robert walker were starring i would be seeing something from mgm which did musicals best at that time. boy was i wrong and disappointed.<br /><br />one touch of venus which starred mary martin, kenny baker, and john boles on broadway ran for 567 performances in the 1943-1945 season and gardner, walker, and tom conway play the roles that martin, baker, and boles did on stage. the kurt weill-ogden nash musical with book by nash and s.j. perelman was a comeback vehicle for mary martin who reestablished herself as the queen of broadway after a disappointing venture in hollywood. <br /><br />look at the names that went into this show. given who was responsible for the book i expected to see some sparkling wit in this production. instead i got a rather pedestrian screenplay, it was like all the wit was drained out of it. doing her best to make up for it is eve arden playing her usual girl friday role with tom conway, but it's even too much for eve.<br /><br />the story concerns department store window dresser robert walker who kisses a very valuable statue of venus who springs to life in the person of ava gardner. of course when the statue goes missing, conway yells for the law and is suspicious of walker, the last person to be with the statue. <br /><br />the rest of the film is walker dealing with gardner and what will happen to both of them. for reasons i don't understand, ava was of course dubbed by eileen wilson and walker sings only a couple of lines. the singing is carried by dick haymes and olga san juan playing walker's friends and coworkers. of course on broadway the songs were done by singers mary martin and kenny baker. you would kind of think that haymes would be playing walker's role at least. it was awkward to say the least.<br /><br />only three songs survived from the score, don't look now, but my heart is showing, that's him, and the incomparable speak low. haymes's silken baritone is shown to best advantage in speak low which was sung as a duet by martin and baker on broadway. for some reason the lyrics of one of the greatest men of verse of the last century, ogden nash, were done over by ann ronnell. i suspect the infamous code was at work here.<br /><br />in lee server's biography of ava gardner he makes mention of a brief fling ava had with robert walker when she had had a spat with her current man, howard duff. when duff and gardner reunited, walker took it badly and didn't speak at all to gardner off camera. i'm sure the fact that both of them were not in their best work didn't help matters either.<br /><br />hopefully some repertoire company will do one touch of venus and you'll get to see it the way, weill, nash, and perelman wrote it.
