i'm sorry but this guy is not funny. i swear i've heard heard 4 year olds come up with better jokes then some of his. "dee dee dee" for instance is possibly the worst catch phrase i've ever heard. it lacks any creativity at all, and to be making fun of mentally challenged people when you've reached level of having your own show is incredibly dim-witted on mencia's part.<br /><br />though every one compares this fool to chappelle, their is no contest. first off they had very very different shows. i think all in all menica's show on average had only about 2 short 5 minute skits in between his 10 minute rants about god knows what. chappelles show came off more as sketch comedy, with 2-4 skits that occupied all the show. all chappelle did was a short summarization of each skit before and after each one. this is where mencia fails even more. what would make mencia think having a show which consists of the same standup comedy that he talks about on his standup specials would be a beneficial idea? does anybody really want to listen to a bit george lopez pioneered years before mencia, but just dragged beyond belief to the point where its dead? snowflake's chance in hell.<br /><br />my point is even though most people hate this guy for his rascism, i just cant stand him for his imcompetence. comedy central was looking for a minority they could brand as "controversial" and then leave him to follow chappelles path. the problem, is this guy made it very clear he doesn't want to be chappelle. so instead he conducts his crappy show like a burning trainwreck right into the ground. does anybody want to watch a weekly standup about the same stuff every thursday, i know sure as hell i don't.<br /><br />i cant express my gratitude to comedy central though. this idiot's show is done. personally after watching his standup, i don't know how he got his own show in the first place. there are so many more deserving comics like jim gafigan, zach galifinakis, etc... in fact anyone is better than this fool.
