i generally like sion sono's work, but this movie was completely retarded. but sadly, not retarded enough to make it entertainingly retarded. i just sat, mouth agape, wondering when it would end. the plot makes only a whisper of sense. i think it was intended to be campy. i mean, haunted hair extensions - how could it not be? but the humor, such as it was, fell flat. not funny. not scary. not gory. i would say perhaps sono was a hired hand on this project, but he appears to have written this boring trash as well. i still need to fill a couple more lines, what else is there to say? i suppose i could finish by saying: better luck next time, sono-san.
