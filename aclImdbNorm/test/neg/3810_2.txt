i don't understand what the big hype was about this film. all the horror sites were saying that this movie had all the essentials of an 'old american slasher' flick that it would satisfy your needs. -- even though this was similar to an old american slasher flick, my needs were still not satisfied.<br /><br />my big problem with this movie is that we are now in the 2000's, not the 1980's. 1980's horror is the past and should stay in the past. horror movies have changed so much that older movies now look cheesy and unrealistic. even though they are fun to watch, they don't offer the same realistic blood thirsty gore that the recent films offer.<br /><br />hatchet is cheesy, unrealistic, and down-right awful. if we wanted to watch an old american slasher flick, i can just go back to the friday the 13th series, nightmare on elm street series, or the halloween series. i must admit, the movie is better than some of the horror movies being released but it is among the worst. the jokes are not funny and the actors are horrible.<br /><br />i would personally stay away from this movie and never look back.
