this movie features several well known actors which i usually like, so i had at least modest expectations when i rented this on dvd. i was highly disappointed. in fact i walked off for some snacks somewhere during the last half hour and somehow i ended up in the kitchen rather then going back to the tv. the actor performances where poor pretty much all across the board and none of the atmospheres in the movie felt very convincing. virtually all scenes had that "just a movie" feeling to them, i just sat there waiting to hear the director calling "cut!" followed by the crew having a little chat about the scene before moving on to the next.<br /><br />since the movie is about gangsters most characters are tough and mob-like, the problem here is just that this whole bad-boy attitude is played out so poorly that it just feels like a joke. the constant guitar-drilling soundtrack really tries to emphasize this atmosphere too, but when the same track is played the 18th time it just adds to the already strong feeling of the whole thing just being fake.<br /><br />maybe it was just a really really bad script, maybe it was just poorly executed. i'm no movie critic, in fact i consider it rare to see something that's really good, but this was just plain bad no matter how objective and forgiving i'm trying to be. not recommended, not even as a rental!
