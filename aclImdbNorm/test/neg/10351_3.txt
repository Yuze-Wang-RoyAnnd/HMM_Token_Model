it isn't too bad, but ultimately it lacks the quality that the australian series has.<br /><br />the jokes are few and far between, the actors are attractive (they shouldn't be), the film makers think far too much about the cinematography (it's supposed to look like a home video) and it's just like a serious version of kath and kim... it's stupid.<br /><br />it's too normal to be kath and kim. kath and kim are supposed to be two curvy, middle-aged women who think they are hot and wear ridiculous clothes. there are no "look at me kimmy!" jokes. the fat friend of kim is not fat at all and she's not even slightly stupid. she's a stereotypical black/latino chick.<br /><br />it's just not as stupid or funny as the australian series. it doesn't compare. nothing is the same. i admit, this show is pretty funny at times, but it is not anything like the aussie series. i was looking forward to an american take on a bogan family. they failed. it's supposed to be really stupid and hilarious, but the actors don't act stupid! to me, this is just a typical american tv show. it's a let down if you want it to be anything like the aussie show.<br /><br />2 stars because it is an okay show, just nothing like what it should be.
