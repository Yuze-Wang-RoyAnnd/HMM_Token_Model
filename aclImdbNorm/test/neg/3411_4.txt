first of three aztec mummies film is the only one that to the best of my knowledge was never completely dubbed into english. the film was chopped up and used in pieces by people like jerry warren in other films (he combined it with another mexican horror comedy with lon chaney to make face of the screaming werewolf. and it showed up in attack of the mayan mummy and elsewhere.) the longest of the three films, a good chunk of this film makes up the two later films which use this as a basis of flash backs. the plot of this film has a scientist conducting a past life regression experiment which causes his subject to travel back and discover hidden chambers in an aztec pyramid. the group, as well as a sinister figure known as the bat, hope to use the information to discover hidden treasure. instead they discover a living mummy who has other plans. long and long winded this film has way too little action to sustain its 80 minute running time (worse the mummy doesn't even show up until an hour has passed). probably the least of the three films, its easy to see why this film was cut apart, it's the only way to fashion a non-sleep inducing film. watching the film late last night i found myself fighting to stay awake. it was a tough haul and i found that i ended up scanning to the point where the mummy showed up. given the choice i'd take a pass and watch the second two films.
