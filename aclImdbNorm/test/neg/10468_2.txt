with the exception of the fine rack on clara evans...this show was pretty bad...so why did i watch it? too much coffee, and had to relax before hitting the sack. watching bb change into his lamest big chief outfit, was amusing at best, downright laughable at worst.<br /><br />i could have made a better skeltor and special effects on my dell.<br /><br />boxlietner has seen better days, this guy is a year younger than me, and he's looking more and more like the scarecrow from his tv series days back in the early 1980....the women eye candy need to go back to acting school, although evans size 40 and playing a 17 year old(she's in her early 20s was a stretch)....the sci-fi channel has done better that this...but for us folks that don't get out to the bars much anymore, i guess we have to take what we can get...after all anything that gets you away form cnn, msnbc, and fox coverage of election 2008 these day is a good thing.
