did you find the title funny? oh, you didn't? well that's because you're uptight. learn to laugh because if you're not laughing, you're not living. so please, lower your standards regarding to what you believe is funny to that of a mere infant. now do you find it funny? still no?! ok, that's because you're full of yourself and get offended too easily. if you're not laughing, you're not living. and if you don't like me then send me hate mail so that i could write another review and state how much hate mail i get and try to twist this into making it seem as if i am a bad ass. are you laughing at my hilarious title yet? still no?!?! ok that's it! you are a racist! you have to laugh or else you are a racist. why else would you not laugh? oh, it's not funny!?! no, this can't be why. i want it to be funny so therefor it is!! laugh damn it!!!! please!!! deedeedee!! durdurdur!! please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ok that's it. where's my notepad and pen? and where's my richard pryor dvd's? i need to write some jokes for my show.<br /><br />and...... scene. thank you, thank you.<br /><br />this is basically what you'll get from mencia for about 23 minutes. please, do yourself a favor and change the channel when this bum's show comes on. even basic cable channels have things 100x better than this. i'm not even saying this because i hate him. i'm for real. this show is like watching grass grow. not sure though, at least grass doesn't steal jokes. i'm honestly trying to save your time. i even tried watching his show. i told myself "maybe he isn't that bad.". but no, he is. i completely zone out when i watched his show. i tried to collect myself during the commercial break and focus on the show but i couldn't. i zoned out again, i think i was thinking of something more interesting like re-making my bed, vacuuming or folding my socks. before i knew it, the show was over. yeah, it's that bad.<br /><br />here's my final thought - there's so many things you can do with 30 minutes besides watch this guy shout about nothing for half an hour. don't watch a show that tries to shove racism in your face in vain. i can support shows that try to ease the tension of the race wars but this guy just provides more racism rather than stop it.
