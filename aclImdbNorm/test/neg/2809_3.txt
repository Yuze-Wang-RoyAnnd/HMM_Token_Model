what a shame. this could have been good. the main problems are the script and the star. the film cannot decide whether to be a slapstick comedy (of a very uninspired and routine kind) or whether to be a insightful satire on the old east germany and its mores. its attempts at the latter flop totally, however. the film does not hold together well and the ending is very artificial and unbelievable. any stereotypes one might have about german comedy are sadly reinforced.<br /><br />the characters are stereotypes one and all, and the leading character, played by kim frank, is colourless in the extreme. he just cannot carry the film and appears to have been chosen largely for his baby face. it may not be all the actor's fault (he is a pop singer), as the script does not give him much to work on.<br /><br />one plus -- the recreation of the east german 'style' and period is good.<br /><br />the worst thing is that the film feels somehow dishonest and demeaning. the film seems to have been churned out by people who were not necessarily giving it their best and just wanted to make a quick buck from a few cheap laughs. (if they were giving it their best, it is a sad case indeed!) i watched it at the cinema with an east german audience and i felt sorry for them. the gdr regime was awful in almost all respects, but those who lived through it deserve better than this.
