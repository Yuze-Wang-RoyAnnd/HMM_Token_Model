i was looking through tv guide last night and saw a movie starring heather grahm on, who i liked in movies like boogie nights, and austin powers, so i decided to watch it. it started out ok, but you could tell the story was lacking, and at about half way through, it started to deteriorate. i do not remember this movie being in the theaters, and i'm sure if it was, it wasn't there long. the acting was stale and unconvincing, the dialogue was silly and predictable, and the story was confusing and stupid. definately one of the worst movies i have ever seen, and i like movies like the ones this has been compared to like fight club, but this one doesn't come close!! heather grahm has done much better things since. i gave it a 2 out of 10 but thats because i clicked on the wrong number, i meant to give it a 1.
