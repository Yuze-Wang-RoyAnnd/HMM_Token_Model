picking this up along with the rest of the marx brothers box set, i found myself disappointed by most everything beyond a night at the opera. this stinker is prolly the worst i've seen of them so far, with the clever lines left out and the characterization is woeful. the playwright is so obscenely stupid in this play it's hard not to tackle the television and try and strangle him.<br /><br />as it is, the marxes seem to do better as outsiders brought in to wreak havoc, and are much much better when they have a good gag or two at least. the material here is all obviously written for anyone, and it really wastes the marx's talent. avoid. <br /><br />rating: 3/10
