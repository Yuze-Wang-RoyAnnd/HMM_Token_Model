they did it again: ripped off an old show's title, then destroyed the nostalgia with boring "re-imagined" stuff. the '60's cartoon was one of the funniest of its time, a good-natured satire of super hero comic books. the character was drawn as 1/2 way between animal and human, the way mickey mouse is. here they use a real beagle; that's about the same as making a mickey mouse watch with a real rat. <br /><br />most of the clever schtick that made the original show funny is missing from this film. instead, we get a clumsy ex-police dog who's even dumber than cad. and some pet owners who add nothing to the story. cheesy effects (the dog-talking animation is embarrassing). poor scripting. a stereotyped dwarf playing simon bar sinister. the gravelly noise box guy they hired to voice underdog is painful. you'd think they'd at least gotten a voice impressionist to approximate wally cox's humorously distinctive voice for underdog. but no. there are, at least, a few affectionate references to the source material (such as the rhyming lines), which lift it to a 4. <br /><br />only small children that love dogs may enjoy this. everybody else should get a dvd of the original cartoon series. watch this only in desperation.
