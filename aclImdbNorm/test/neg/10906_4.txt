the cookie-cutter gets to work overtime in this obvious and unoriginal love story. the plot, such as it is, has been done before a trillion times so there is no need to recount any of it. suffice to say that all 12 year old girls will love this movie while the rest of us will be forced to make a face. even the soundtrack is awful! its not that i dislike figure skating, although i don't, its that i dislike cliched, bad movies.
