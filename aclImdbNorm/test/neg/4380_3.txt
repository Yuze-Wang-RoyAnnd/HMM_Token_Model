this is simply another bad chuck norris movie. norris plays a cop on the trail of a twisted serial killer of women. he put the guy away three years before, but the guy somehow gets through the bars in the nut house he's in by using what looks like dental floss. then the killer escapes in a cleaning van and drives it over a 400 foot cliff and survives to spend time around a theater undergoing renovation. irish jack o'halloran is the best thing in this movie, but like in superman ii, he doesn't say a word. somehow that's supposed to make him more menacing. ron o'neal of super fly fame and steve james are wasted playing the city's mayor and norris' sidekick respectively. the film also contains the idiotic subplot of norris and his girlfriend having a child out of wedlock; it's so 1980's. when coupling norris' "serious" acting turn with over-the-top musical cues signaling every forthcoming scene in predictable fashion, the film becomes a chore to sit through. the build-up while searching for the killer in the theater is interesting enough with norris crawling through the shadows to discover the hideaway, but the end fight is disappointing after beginning in such a promising way. it's yet another disappointment from cannon films, and it plays like a movie made for television. * of 4 stars.
