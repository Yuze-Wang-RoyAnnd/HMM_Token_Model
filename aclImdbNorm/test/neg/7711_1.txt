i will keep it to bullet points so here goes: 1. very badly scripted. 2. tries to be like resident evil. 3. zombies slow and docile one minute the next minute raging lunatics. 4. never saw blood clean up so easily! 5. special effects not as good as the original "day of the living dead". 6. acting not as good as the "bold and the beautiful". 7. it looks like it was written in 1 week and made the next week.<br /><br />basicaly med team plus special forces go into a zombie infested university to find the first zombie and extract a serum to cure the plague. all die except the 2 main stars so predictable even though unarmed and swarmed with 100s of zombies they survived. however special forces (who were trained at kindergarten school scouts) only took 1 zombie to kill them even though they had weapons. also the obligatory jerk on hand to fill any gaps. overall load of rubbish.
