lucille ball was a mighty power in television throughout the 1950s and 1960s, but she still made an occasional film, most notably the long, long trailer and the facts of life. although her television career remained strong, as the 1970s began her movie career seemed to be winding down--but ball was determined to have one last big screen fling, and the project she selected was the 1966 musical mame.<br /><br />in many respects the role seemed tailor-made: based on the popular novel which gave rise to two different broadway plays, mame dennis is a wacky, wildly uninhibited woman who "inherits" her orphaned nephew patrick--and leads him on a wild tour of life's possibilities, bouncing from one comic spree to another. the music, which featured such songs as "open a new window" and "if he walked into my life today," was among jerry herman's best work. the supporting cast, which included robert preston and bea arthur, was the best of the best. expectations were high; opening night fanfare was tremendous; the film was a disaster. critics were aghast and audiences sat slack-jawed.<br /><br />no matter what hardcore lucy fans may say, mame is a fiasco, so much so that it is hard to know where to start. it is badly directed, badly filmed, badly performed, and there lucille ball is at the center of it all, unable to dance, unable to sing, and grinning like a waxworks dummy while incredibly bad choreography swirls around her. but the disaster is hardly of her making alone; the supporting cast fares no better. bea arthur and jane connell recreate their stage roles of vera charles and agnes gooch; the former is stagey, the latter is dismal. robert preston manages to sing with a smile, but he's pretty much on his own and clearly none too happy about it.<br /><br />the dvd brings the film from the vhs pan-and-scan release to widescreen, but that only means there's more awfulness to see. everybody loves lucy, but only the least critical fan could love lucy's mame; while i wouldn't say it's bad enough to make you want to gouge your eyes out, you may wish you had. not recommended.<br /><br />gft, amazon reviewer
