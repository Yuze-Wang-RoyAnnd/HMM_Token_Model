i think hollywood should seriously consider never doing another "biblical" film again, if noah's ark is going to be the norm. aside from the horrible, completely uninspired acting from the whole cast (voight and steenburgen undoubtedly rue the day the agreed to do this film), the time line has been completely rearranged. i also missed the part in genesis about the pirate fight on the deck of the ark or the traveling salesman coming by on his paddle boat. hello? everyone else was dead except for noah and his family according to scripture. god stacked lumber and added plans to build the ark when noah questioned how?? i also don't remember reading anything about noah's wife constantly nagging him during the 40 days, or noah wandering around glassy-eyed and dazed all the time. the script writer obviously had very little knowledge of the book of genesis, or just didn't care that his abomination of a story completely mocked it.
