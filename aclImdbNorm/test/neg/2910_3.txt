following the world war ii japanese attack on u.s. forces at pearl harbor, "the eastside kids": leo gorcey (as muggs), bobby jordan (as danny connors), huntz hall (as glimpy), david gorcey (as peewee), ernest morrison (as scruno), and bobby stone (as skinny) want to serve their country. but, both the u.s. army and navy reject them as too young. still wanting to "knock off about a million japs", the "boys" attack an asian clerk, who turns out to be chinese. the unfortunate incident does, however, lead the gang to help uncover some really nasty japanese and german people.<br /><br />if "too young" is defined as "under twenty-one", only mr. jordan and mr. stone would be rejected for military service. but, it's possible recruiters were turned off by the office manners displayed by mr. gorcey and mr. hall. "let's get tough!" was made during what the script accurately describes as "open season on japs" - for this and other reasons, it hasn't aged well. it's a wasted effort, but the regulars performs ably, with tom brown moving the storyline along, as jordan's spy brother.<br /><br />*** let's get tough!
