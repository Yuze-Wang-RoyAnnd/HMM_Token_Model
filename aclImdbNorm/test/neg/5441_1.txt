after a string of successful 'a man and his monkey films', which included the seminal "every which way but loose", "every which way you can" and "peter's friends", the genre fell on hard times. in an effort to rejuvenate this once celebrated area, director frank marshall brought michael crichton's acclaimed novel to the big screen.<br /><br />think 'gorillas in the mist' meets 'tron' minus the box-office clout of bruce boxleitner. this is one mans doomed love affair for his talking monkey. not helped by bad accents (tim curry struggles with a romanian), a baboon of a screenplay, hungry hippos, skydiving primates and bruce campbell. ape-sh*t.
