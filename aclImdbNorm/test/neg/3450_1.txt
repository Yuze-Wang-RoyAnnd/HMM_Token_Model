this was amongst the worst films i have ever encountered. the cinematography was dull, with long tedious shots (like a camera on a tripod filming a stage play) interspersed with "dramatic" angles that made little sense to the content on screen. the editing was terrible, scenes matched together with the delicacy of a butcher. the plot hinged on the viewer being familiar with the historical night in which mary shelley wrote frankenstien. the acting was forced, with the type of character development that left you with an intense interest in seeing each of them die horribly (the sooner the better).
