okay, i'm sorry to the cast and crew for this review, but this movie is by far the worst i've seen yet...first off, the acting was okay. it could of been better (especially in some parts), but it was "okay". then, there was the cheapest video camera (which they used). the violence was pretty good. if it were paced faster, it would be awesome, but they didn't (*sigh*)...scares. the scares were well written (in the script), but not well done. for instance...(spoiler here!) in the loft, a girl is half way in it and the other half is in the dark, bottom area of the barn house, then she gets it. the monster yanks her down and then you hear someones guts getting ripped out. the scares could have been better if the music wasn't ripped from a cheap horror sounds cd. the blood effects were pretty good, but the blood was like that of "kill bill". k.b. pulled it off, because it was meant to resemble old kung-fu movies, but when the crew can't tell the difference between red and pink....it's sad. the ripped up bodies in the movie were good, but the scarecrow costumes were something you would see for 25 bucks at a halloween store. don't let the cover fool you, the costumes suck! my overall grade is a 3/10. if you are interested in independent movies, are easily satisfied, or just have 3 bucks burning a hole in your pocket, go to blockbuster and see the horror of failure.
