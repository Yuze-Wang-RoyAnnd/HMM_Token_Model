this movie was terrible not only was the plot weak, but the acting was unbelievable bad, and at times pathetic. very unrealistic dialogs people in real life don't talk like this and there is no emotion or feeling in anything said very monotone except for the almost indistinguishable whispering that constantly occurs. even the editing is bad the cuts are terrible. the camera work was sloppy and shaky on close ups even sways back and forth during conversations. there is nothing positive about this movie and george katts needs to be working on heavy machinery or anything where he doesn't have to converse with other humans because he clearly doesn't know how to. how did this movie win/ get nominated for awards oh my god!!
