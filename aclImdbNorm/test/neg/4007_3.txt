at last. here's a movie that does as much for the reputations of the men of greece and russia as "gigli" did for the those of mr. affleck and ms. lo. from the edge of the city details the sad and sordid lives of some young russian 'emigr'es who live in and around athens and spend their time burglarizing cars, getting laid, pimping woman 'emigr'es and prostituting themselves ("but we're not gay because we don't do, you know.... and if we do, it's only once or twice. with the same guy.") there is hardly anything here you have not seen before and better; only the athens locale adds a little novelty--even then there's but a scene or two that's scenic. writer/director constantine giannaris ("3 steps to heaven") offer a relatively generic 95 minutes, in which the standout moments involve how stupid, sexist and (from the looks of things) pretty much irredeemable most of these guys are. (interestingly, the gayer the guy, the more redeemable he appears.) what really rankles is the treatment of the women. greek and russian males would seem to give the italians a run for their money regarding that famous madonna/whore complex. has life in greece improved much for women since the time of plato and socrates? one has to wonder.<br /><br />if i seem to be equating russians and greeks in this review, i apologize, but even the non-'emigr'es pictured here (the cab driver, for instance) are creeps. according to another review on this site, the film (a hit on its home turf) was actually submitted by greece for an academy award for best foreign film. what this says about the state of greek movie-making, i hesitate to ponder.
