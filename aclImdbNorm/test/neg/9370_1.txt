the only thing it has to offer is the interesting opposites of tru and jack, their choices and viewpoints, and the philosophical questions that it raises. tru feels that she is helping people who aren't supposed to die, and jack feels that they are supposed to die, and she is messing with fate's plan, or the universe's plan, or such-whatnot.<br /><br />but she is obviously able to change things, so there is obviously no such thing as fate in the series' metaphysics. jack has no basis for believing that there is. and very conveniently, tru never asks him the right questions. nobody does. which obviously proves that the makers of the series don't have an answer.<br /><br />there simply is no plot!<br /><br />instead, they leave it murky in order for the series to be able to continue with it's boring girl stuff, only occasionally interrupted by tru and jack's racing against each other towards ends that are unknown...<br /><br />it turns out that there is nothing to any of it. a teenage pop series with that pretends to be something else.<br /><br />your time will be better spent sleeping.
