my age: 13<br /><br />james cole, played by steven seagal, is sent to help detective jim campbell, played by keenen ivory wayans, solve a series of killings in which the victims are crucified. since cole has arrived on the spot, he notices that the killings have changed a little, and thinks there is a different killer. it becomes personal when his ex-wife is murdered, and campbell finds his fingerprints on the body. campbell investigates the mysterious cole, and finds out about a very shady past.<br /><br />i am not a fan of steven seagal. i enjoy action movies, but he is the worst actor i have ever seen. this film is not much fun to watch at all, incredibly dumb, and, obviously, steven seagal's acting performance is absolutely horrid. keenen ivory wayans isn't too bad, though. the only redeeming thing in this film is the occasional good action scene, although most come round because of insanely stupid reasons. the plot in this film is absolute gibberish. i didn't care for it at all. the whole "glimmer man" past of seagal's character was stupid, all the mafia fights and fights in the restaurant were there for almost no reason. give this film a miss.<br /><br />australian classification: ma 15+: high level violence<br /><br />rating: 35 out of 100 (quite generous)
