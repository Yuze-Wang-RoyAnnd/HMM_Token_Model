on the positive, i'll say it's pretty enough to be watchable. on the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen. long, whiny and pointless. and i'm not saying this to be mean, i really wanted to like this film, it seemed to have everything going for it, had the so called "buzz", and was a hassle to track down besides. had a little more effort gone into it on the story side, i believe this would've been amazing. and i expect the team behind it will produce wonderful work in the future, they clearly have the ability. but i recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.
