cheaply pieced together of recycled film footage, music and ideas, this film cannot really be called "well". but for me, when i watched it as a teenager, it was quite amusing. (i didn't know battle beyond the stars before.) in retrospect it has got something nostalgic, regarding the sf wave of the early eighties and the special effects of this time. its trashy old-fashioned look and its naivety provide a certain attraction. to enjoy this movie i recommend to concentrate on the paternal relationship between the characters of vince edwards and david mendenhall. in addition, i liked the idea that a bunch of scoundrels discovers its heroic qualities after been unwillingly confronted with the challenge to take care of a child.
