it wasn't until i looked at the trivia section that i found out that the original producer/star of this movie tyrone power died during its making . this no doubt explains why everyone on screen seems to have their minds on other things , a symptom of which appears in a very early scene involving a battle that can only be described as pathetic . you know when you've been painting a wall until you're completely bored ? well that's the sort of expression the combatants have on their face when they're swinging their swords in a highly unconvincing manner <br /><br />the plot centres on soloman the king of israel having an affair with the queen of sheeba and his people not being happy about it . you can't really blame them since there's few things more beautiful in the world than those israeli moteks , though the israeli women here all seem to look like cherie blair ! modern day israel is also very cosmopolitan with the majority of israelis being born outside the country but would this have been true a couple of thousand years ago where everyone speaks in european and american accents <br /><br />after much talking and a dance sequence that has to be seen to be believed ( and no that's not praise ) we have a climax where the heavily outnumbered israelis have to defend themselves against a massed egyptian army who can't read a map otherwise they would have known there was a canyon in front of them . this is what i don't get - even though their blinded by the sun the egyptians spend ten minutes charging towards the israelis never ever realising they're charging towards a gaping ravine ! isn't this somewhat illogical ? it's also something of a revealing error since the horses , chariots and men falling into the canyon are obviously miniature figures <br /><br />anyway the film ends with soloman killing his treacherous brother and praising god for his victory . but who needs moshe dayan , arik sharon or god when you've got an idiotic enemy who can't see a ravine in front of him or waves a sword like he paints a wall ?
