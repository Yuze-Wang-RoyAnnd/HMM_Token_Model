the characterization in this movie is among the worst i've ever encountered. the dialogue is trite and clich'e to the point of extreme distraction. none of the issues the characters face are developed at all--they're merely surface details intended to get a point across without having to actually come up with believable dialogue to support said point. also, the depiction of the chinese characters leaves a bit to be desired--i find it hard to believe that the chinese father learns flawless english from a book(or so it is implied in one scene) so he can teach it to his daughter. etc.<br /><br />the smile train is a great organization and it's a nice idea, to make a heartstring-tugging film about the impact a program like this can have on kids' lives, but overall, i found this movie to be more frustrating than anything.
