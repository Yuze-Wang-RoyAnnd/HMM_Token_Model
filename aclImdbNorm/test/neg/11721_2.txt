ahh, nuthin' like cheesy, explopitative, semi-porn, masquerading as horror...this one stars jaqueline lovell(sometimes sara st. james), the nubile starlet also seen in "femalien", "the erotic house of wax", and that family favorite "nude bowling party". she is now a fixture in surrender cinema's line-up of talentless cuties starring in pointless, soft-porn exploitation flicks. "head of the family" actually tries to be a real moovie. a con-man and a tramp try to get said-tramp's husband off-ed. they turn to a large-brained evil genius in a wheelchair, and his family of moronic misfits, who uses mind control to send out zombies to do his nefarious bidding. said-genius has a giant head, hence the clever title of the film: that's about the extent of the film's humor. but basically, it's an excuse to show off the ample talents of lovell and dianne colazzo (ernestina). laced with some of the wierdest dialogue can be herd (what the heck is "plowing oats", anycow??), and just plain stupid, this titular thriller will moost likey appeal to the breast-cownters of drive-in theater, but no one else. the moocow says avoid the devoid, unless yer looking for a rent on cheesy t&a/horror night. :=8p
