oh,god! book ii is more of a bad remake of the original than a sequel to it.it is not all that funny,its plot plays too much<br /><br />like a rejected situation comedy pilot,and the use of the slogan "think god" is a different variation on the idea that worked so much better in the original.john denver had not returned for this movie and that made a big difference.george burns,as<br /><br />wonderful as he was playing god,does not have the same chemistry with the little girl that he did with john denver.<br /><br />i would give this movie a rating of 3 out of 10,but only for<br /><br />george burns;the rest of the cast is nothing special.<br /><br />if you loved the first one,don't bother to see this one.
