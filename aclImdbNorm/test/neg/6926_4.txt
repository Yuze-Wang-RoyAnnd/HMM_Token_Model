i was looking forward to this so much, being a big fan of the book. however, when it came out i remember thinking it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time i've ever spent at the cinema.<br /><br />in principle, the acting, the sets and the music were excellent, and are the main reason why i'm rating this a 4.<br /><br />in this version, sara is a little too self-sacrificing for my taste. there is no way she would have deliberately lied to miss minchin just to stop her punishing the other girls; in the book she makes a point of describing lies as "not just wicked, but vulgar." <br /><br />there's also far too much of a disneyfied ending for me; sara's father coming back from the dead and all of them trotting off into the indian sunset. while the book does have a happy (and critics might say equally improbable) ending, it doesn't leave you thinking, "oh puh-leeze."<br /><br />about the only things true to the book were:<br /><br />1. sara's father being a soldier 2. the lines between sara and her father ("are you learning me by heart?"/"no. i know you by heart. you are inside my heart.") 3. sara's friendship with becky, and her 'adopting' lottie (although this last one wasn't developed as much as it could have been) 4. the changing of her room by adding various luxury items. that part was brilliantly done. 5. the basic core - a rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly - is there, but that's about all that is.<br /><br />people might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience. possibly. all i can say to that is i have two cousins - aged 7 and 12 respectively - who were big fans of this film until they read the book.<br /><br />if all you want is a 'feel-good' family film, then this delivers. if you're looking for a film that actually tells the story of a little princess (in fact, if you've read the book) don't waste time with this one. it's such a shame; with a cast like this, if they'd stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantastic.<br /><br />am i harping on about 'read the book' this and 'read the book' that a little too much? very probably. but if someone attempts to adapt a book - especially such a classic - into a movie, then they should at least have done the same thing. preferably more than once.
