this has to be the most boring movie i ever sat through. it is dreary and drab, has no excitement, the acting by hulce is terrible as hulce cannot pull off the proper accent required for this film. the story is stupid and i sure wouldn't recommend this crap for anyone unless you want to die of boredom.
