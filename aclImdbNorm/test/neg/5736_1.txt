i know a lot of people would claim certain films as 'the worst of all time' but i think redneck stakes a claim for this prize. a combination of quite dreadful acting from both mark lester and telly savales and plot progression that defies belief.<br /><br />on telly saveles: was he drunk when he acted in this? he seems to play a slurring, laughing lunatic with no sense of conviction. maybe he mixed his medication with his whiskey, i don't know.<br /><br />on mark lester: a performance more wooden than a carpenter's workshop. his clipped british tones don't belong in this film; and his transformation from sheltered teenager to gangster's apprentice in 24 hours is mad. and the strip scene with mosquito does not have any relevance to the plot at all; perhaps the director likes this sort of thing.<br /><br />plot logic: when memphis and mosquito ambush the car at the beginning, why doesn't mark lester's mother do or say anything to get her son out of the car, before the loonies drive it off? she just lets them all go, without saying a word!! on the other hand, redneck has to be seen - you won't believe how bad it is otherwise!
