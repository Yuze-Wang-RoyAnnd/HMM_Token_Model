this is a by-the-numbers horror film starring richard crenna and joanna pettet as a psychologist duo who purchase and old mansion and invite a small crew of friends and patients to help clean the place up. unbeknownst to them, the mansion harbors a cellar door - the gateway to hell. if you are in the mood for a clich'ed horror film, then look no further, but if you want something inventive, then this little film won't appeal to you.<br /><br />violence: $$$ (rather subdued, albeit the scene where a guy cuts his hand with a saw - rather gruesome mind you. fans of inventive deaths scenes will not like this as every character seems to be electrocuted in some fashion).<br /><br />nudity: $ (nothing to speak of. mary louise weller adds the good looks but her character was underdeveloped).<br /><br />story: $$ (cliched, but view-worthy nonetheless. this offers nothing new to the genre but the casting of victor buono - who is about as menacing as a department store santa - seems to have attracted a few viewers).<br /><br />acting: $$ (the best performances are by crenna and pettet with the other actors simply "phoning-in" their roles. the screenwriter fails to develop any characters outside pettet's character and seemed to have forgotten about mary louise weller (animal house) who disappears for about twenty minutes and only resurfaces to be electrocuted like everyone else in boring fashion).
