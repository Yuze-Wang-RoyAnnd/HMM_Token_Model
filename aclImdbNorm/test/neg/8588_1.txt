another lame attempt to make a movie "gritty" and "thought provoking"- whatever the hell that means. they have al pacino say a lot of words like - "television killed football." yeah whatever. this is another movie that showcases oliver stone's delusions of grandeur. if stone is trying to show us that football will be our downfall or something, why does he insist on romanticizing the sport with his stilted camera movements and kid rock songs? he even throws cameron diaz into the fray for purely aesthetic reasons. it's a shame that diaz and pacino have to meet in a movie that is so bad.<br /><br />ever since "scent of woman," writers and directors have used pacino to romanticize their pathetic lines. his characters are nothing more than loudspeakers - their voices covering up what would normally be redundant and trite. he needs to reinvent himself, showing how he can act without yelling. he has to stop feeling sorry for hokey scripts with cheesy lessons like "organized football is messed up," and act out a good story.
