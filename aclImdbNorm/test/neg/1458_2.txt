a bad movie about a bad movie. is that original, or what? if it is, then that's the only good thing about it. the lovely ally sheedy couldn't stop this bomb from destroying movie theaters and vcr's everywhere. it should also be noted, that she, and the other actors hired by danny aiello's character were billed as themselves, as well as the characters they played in his d-rated film. calling it a b-rated film, is too much of a compliment, and would lead to delusions of grandeur.
