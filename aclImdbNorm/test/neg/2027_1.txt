i found this dvd in the store and figured, why not support some indy film and watch a cool horror flick. please save your time and money and pass this one by. the acting, the script, practically everything with this film is sub par. there really isn't much of a story, and there is no character development. i found myself not caring what happened to the people in the movie as long as something happened. everyone is supposed to be college age, but they all look like they are in their mid thirties, except for the woman who plays a mother who looks like she is pushing 40. in fact the worst part of the film is that every single scene is shown in a master shot. there is no editing, no cut ins or close ups. do yourself a favor and skip it.
