did you ever think, like after watching a horror movie with a group of friends: "wow, this is so cool! we have got to make a splatter horror movie ourselves some day soon. i bet it isn't as difficult as it seems"? well, this must have been what went through the minds of the young campbell brothers back in 2003, presumably right after watching sam raimi's "the evil dead" or a similar independent horror classic. this "demon summer", however, is so bad it's embarrassing! these young amateurish filmmakers obviously worship the horror genre and know their classics, but that nearly doesn't make them talented. i've seen quite a lot lousy b-movies in my years as a horror fanatic, but this honestly ranks as one of the biggest pieces of crap ever made. and it's quite sad to be this open-hearted, because the whole cast and crew clearly had good intentions. there's pretty much no script at all. a duo of thugs simply steals a mysterious book from a bum and, whilst reading some passages of it, one of them mutates into a hideous demon that starts killing off members of all the different teenager-groups: dorks, hot catholic girls, stoners and troublemakers. that's about it, except of course for all the obligatory clich'es, like the hot girl falling for the biggest dork etc etc... the performances are really painful to listen to and none of these annoying teenagers use mimicry! they just stand there motionless until the script says it's their turn to interact. i hate that! some of make-up effects are remotely decent but still not spectacular and the soundtrack contains some of the most awful punk-songs ever. this film should never have been released... i can very well imagine that it must have been fun to be a part of the production, but it's utterly imbecile and doesn't feature the slightest redeeming element. not even a bit of amateur-nudity, damned!
