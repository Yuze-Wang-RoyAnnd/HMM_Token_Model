just listen to the broadway cast album and to the voices of barbara harris and john cullum, who do wonders for the wonderful lerner and lane score. then, with that beautiful cast recording fresh in mind, watch the movie, with streisand as streisand, and yves montand reading his lines with such a heavy french accent that a chain saw couldn't cut through it. the best part (for those who need something to look forward to) is what montand does to the introductory part of the title song. listen as he sings/says: could anyone among us have an inkling or a clue, what magic feats of wizardry and voodoo you can do? (that one part sums up the problem that results from casting "name stars" in movie musicals instead of the appropriate talent for the various roles.) i can just see rex harrison entering that scene and suggesting montand, too, could learn to do justice to the beauty of the english language.<br /><br />
