ok, i could only find three reasons to consider this film worthwhile considering the extremely low budget.<br /><br />first there was linnea quigley and rachel carter. actually, the two of them gave me four good reasons to watch, and watch i did.<br /><br />the only other reason to watch is that a lot of was filmed right down the road. now, i didn't know this beforehand, but i saw an orange county car tag and said, wow! this was shot in florida.<br /><br />i was impressed by the flashback to the past and the ancestors of the young kid, but that was really it. the killings by the pumpkin man were pretty lame, with the exception of the biker.<br /><br />if you want to see quigley and carter, ok, but return of the living dead will give greater thrills.
