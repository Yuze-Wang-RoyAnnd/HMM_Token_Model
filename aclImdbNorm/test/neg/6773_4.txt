i watched this one mostly to see charlie ruggles and una merkel, two of my favorites.<br /><br />the plot has many a twist and turn -- it's not bad as a straight mystery aboard a train.<br /><br />but why throw in a circus train wreck and an escaped gorilla? i can mention this without it being a "spoiler" because the circus train wreck and the gorilla have nothing to do with the intricate mystery plot.<br /><br />the bad person trying to kill the good people has many tricks up his sleeve, but the circus train wreck was purely coincidental. it allows for a single scene with a menacing gorilla, but then it's back to the murder mystery!
