i'm a huge comedy show fan. racial humor is always a little risky but the greats like george lopez, dave chapelle, lisa lampanelli etc. pull it off perfectly.<br /><br />they don't go overboard, make the audience uncomfortable or *cough cough* steal jokes! but i won't harp upon that.<br /><br />carlos makes racial humor totally unenjoyable. his jokes continually scream racial humor to the point were it's not funny or clever, but it's insulting. i'm not one to turn cold towards racial humor. but his execution of these jokes is sloppy that cause people to recoil at his comedy.<br /><br />his humor is only surpassed by his stage presence in annoyance. i feel as though he's screaming at me constantly! and he runs around the stage like a maniac. it only comes off as annoying!
