i had just finished reading the book, and was really looking forward to seeing this tv adaptation which was broadcast on the hallmark channel on monday night (5/30/05). the key to the whole book was the manifesto which was stolen by the man with steel teeth, but i watched for an hour (out of 3 1/2) and i saw the man with the steel teeth but i never saw him steal a manifesto. i saw someone steal some virus but what did that have to do with the book? it's too bad because this film had great production values and a good cast, but isn't the idea of turning a book into a movie (tv or film) to get the people who read the book to be part of the audience. they only kept me for an hour. i thought the premise of the book was great and what did they do but throw out the whole premise. this book had a great mcguffin (to paraphrase hitchcock) but they ignored it. and it said in the titles that forsyth was involved in the production. they sure must have paid him a lot of money.
