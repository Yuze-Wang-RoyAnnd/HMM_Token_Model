i mean, nothing happens, 5 dumb kids go to oklahoma to find a magical forest of marijuana... this could've been fun, if it hadn't been for the 5 worst actors in the world. and the dialogs weren't even half an inch of fun. the only thing that i almost showed my teeth of, was when the dumb cops stopped the teenagers in either oklahoma or kansas... the plot could have been fun, had it not been for abysmal interpretation. if you even think about watching this piece-of-crap movie, don't. how dumb is it, that the guy gets away from the cops by telling them he's gay, like his friend did (just that he wasn't pretending...) and there's that dumb hick joke about the several meanings to the word "gay". i'm laughing my hair off.......not....... anyway... worst movie i've ever seen!!
