bank heist / cop thriller sounds ok right?<br /><br />chaos looks good: nicely framed, good production values, high concept action heist... <br /><br />but...<br /><br />the plot has the unique achievement of being both smart and incredidly, blatantly implausible in the "how we actually got the money" mode and overcomplicated in the "who done it and why" section at the same time...<br /><br />in addtion, ryan philippe shouting is not, seriously not either tough or scary...and he is especially not tough or scary when throwing a tizzy fit. honestly, his great outburst is the only really funny scene in the whole film. must make him thrilled that he turned down the role of anakin skywalker and is now doing this.... <br /><br />stratham is normally good as the tough but silent hard nut with the self-deprecating humor, but here, the extra relationship lines are so laughably bad that even he looks uncomfortable saying some of the clich'ed mush required. more silent seems best? <br /><br />snipes is actually ok in a typecast way, but another nail in a talented actor's coffin: he needs an actor's role not an action hero rehash. perhaps that business with his taxes will allow him to break that mold and the public and critics will let him on the sympathy vote. it would be good if he wasn't so typecast all the time.<br /><br />the lines these guys speak when they're not doing the plot development and detective work can be summed up in one word.... pheeeuuuh.<br /><br />the film feels all out of whack and it never gels: i found it irritating for the first 45 minutes, and the tighter last part was passable. it should /could have been good but it just can't redeem the awful lines, the overwhelming score, and the general level of irritation with the levels of plausibility. <br /><br />overall i nearly didn't make it through: incredibly irritating, and ryan.... please, please, please get rid of the goldilocks....
