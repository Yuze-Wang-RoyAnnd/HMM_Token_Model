<br /><br />the play has been heavily edited and the order of the scenes has been completely mixed up. the acting is appalling (especially by helena bonham carter) and the cinematography poor.<br /><br />the result is a slow, confused, boring film which will put those new to shakespeare off shakespeare instantly!<br /><br />if you can't see a stage play then at least see the olivier version (1948) instead of this drivel!
