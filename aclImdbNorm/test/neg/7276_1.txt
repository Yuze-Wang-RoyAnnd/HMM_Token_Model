i have never really been interested in cannibal movies before and up until a couple of months ago i had avoided this genre of movie.<br /><br />i recently had to undergo knee surgery and found i had a lot of time on my hands as i was unable to work, so i decided after seeing almost every horror movie our local video shop had to offer i would take a chance on this.<br /><br />christ was it a mistake! i have never seen a movie this bad in all my years of being a movie addict. this is just a pile of s**t pasted to a d.v.d disc and sold as a horror movie.<br /><br />i have a lot of respect to other horror fans who can switch their brains off long enough to enjoy this crap, they are more brain dead than i ever will be and that is some achievement! 0/10 and thats generous.
