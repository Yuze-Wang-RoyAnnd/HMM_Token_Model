marlene dietrich is magnificent as concha perez, the temptress who drives all men to despair in josef von sternberg's "the devil is a woman". her performance has nothing to do with 'acting' in any conventional sense but she's incandescent, a true star in full command of her material. but she's the only good thing about the film, (she's so good she keeps you watching this dross; i doubt if any other actress could have done the same).<br /><br />the story is an appallingly lame melodrama, (surely pierre louys' novel was better), in which dietrich's amoral concha ruins the lives of two friends played by lionel atwill and cesar romero with a stiffness bordering on petrification. and for von sternberg it's an ugly looking movie, (maybe in keeping with its fairly ugly subject matter). bunuel, on the other hand, thought enough of it to remake it as "that obscure object of desire" with a greater emphasis on the surrealist aspects of it all, down to casting two different actresses in the same role. neither film is either director's finest hour and while the bunuel version may be the better film, it is dietrich's 'performance' you remember.
