great ensemble cast but unfortunately a bunch of undeveloped ideas make the film drag. one feels not fulfilled at the end after waiting for some kind of conclusion, closure, or at least an ironic twist.<br /><br />it had that familiar "curb" feel without dare i say it, larry as the annoying polar opposite. the music was there, the 'show about nothing' scenes pop up, but without any common thread or suspense - it falters as a solo project that ran out of budget.<br /><br />spoilers: the movie title speaks about cheese but she prefers the rice pudding. is cheese a better selling title than rice pudding? he prefers just any junk food, regardless of the sell by date. maybe i want someone to eat 'cheese-dogs' or ice cream in a pirate suit would have at least tied some scenes together.<br /><br />marty: this is just not funny and overdone. people just don't care about a 'show' within a show. a coffee book table about coffee books was funnier.<br /><br />unless you are big fans of the cast, save your time and eat some cheese. it doesn't even have to be with anyone.
