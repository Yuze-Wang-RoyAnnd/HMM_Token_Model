first off, i'm in the u.s.<br /><br />when i first saw this, i thought it was an obvious - and loathsome - rip off of "the office" (uk). i would have thus awarded it zero stars, but lo and behold, it came out long before the ricky gervais series.<br /><br />still, it's hard to watch this or any other show with a similar dynamic (including the american "office") without comparison. it just isn't even close to being the same thing.<br /><br />i will give it some credit for being original, and ahead of its time. i'll also say that it - and the u.s. "office" and "larry sanders" - are actual satires. the uk "office" is something grander and more transcendent, as if populated with real people in events that felt like they actually happened. however, unlike this or the shrill christopher guest "mockumentaries", it isn't really a satire, while "the newsroom" definitely is.<br /><br />be that as it may, "the newsroom" still isn't very funny. it's aloof, and self-aware, but with a cast and crew not nearly smart or talented enough to heft the goods. it's weighty comedy being carried on weak shoulders. commendable, but ultimately not recommended.<br /><br />--- and what's with the lack of an anamorphic dvd?! i know it was shot in anamorphic widescreen, because i saw the pilot episode on one of our hd channels. cbc, get with the programme. ; )
