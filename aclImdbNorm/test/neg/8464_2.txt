boring movie. poor plot. poor actors. the movie happens in a room supposed to be in morocco but actually in some american city! the "arab terrorists" are the patriots the blonde patriot is the "arab terrorist"...damn!<br /><br />there is something good about this movie though (that's why the score is 2 out of 10). the director turns the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism the media feeds us every day into the real thing, the terrorists are americans (or western people if you like).<br /><br />the movie is divided into two parts. the first part of the movie concerns the dutchman travel (15 seconds) while the second part is about the staying in the amazing dark brown room (1 hour and something).<br /><br />the dutch guy is going to deliver money in morocco to some "charity organization", gets off the plain, takes the bus and ends up kidnapped in a dark brown room. he is kidnapped with another guy that is shot after telling "they will not shoot at us". the dutch survivor is forced to play chess with a morpheus-like arab guy for so long that you'll learn how to play chess too! at the end the dutch guy reveals his plot not because they cut four of his fingers off but because he is tricked by such a lame game you should watch the movie for!<br /><br />good when you are so tired you can't sleep.
