we saw this in a bargain basket at the local asda: lb1.50 for the dvd. reading all the hype plastered all over the cover saying how "hillarious" it is, and it also had a really good, established cast, we thought this must a great film.<br /><br />so we bought, took it home, shoved it in the dvd player, sat back and waited for the funnies to begin.......and waited.......and waited.....and waited a bit more.<br /><br />some 90 minutes later, although it felt more like 3 hours, the credits rolled, and that was the end of that.<br /><br />what a letdown - even paying lb1.50 seemed a con. god knows what caine, richardson and gambon were thinking when they said 'yes' to this tosh. and as for moran: well much as i enjoyed black books, shaun of the dead, and his comedy tours, i felt he was out of his depth in this film. he tried too hard playing for laughs, probably thinking that if retaining the characteristics from his black books character, would work here.<br /><br />sadly it back-fired. the gags fell flat after awhile, and then he became just an irritation. which is a shame because i believe given the right part he could be a very good film/character actor.<br /><br />anyway, to sum up: the actors in the actors, failed to act!!! <br /><br />**/*****
