being stuck in bed with the flu and feeling too rough to get up to find the remote, i actually watched this abomination from start to finish (how many people can say that? and for any who can - what's your excuse?). my god, has there ever, ever been such a total mess released by a major studio? there is not one second of genuine tension in a supposed "thriller"; the script is inept and ludicrous; the sets look like they were leftovers from a low-budget tv movie; and the cast ... what were they thinking?!!! sally field gives what is without doubt the worst and most embarrassing performance of any academy award winner in history. her irritating nasal whine and stupidly perky behaviour in what is meant to be a life-threatening situation are truly asinine. it's a wonder she didn't use all her future earnings to buy up and destroy every print of this turkey. michael caine, who now pontificates endlessly on the art of screen acting - even running master classes for would-be thespians - should be taken out and shot (preferably by one of telly savalas' henchmen). angela cartwright, an actress i usually like (and whose name isn't even in the opening credits, poor soul), is ten years too old for her role, and her horrible matronly yellow prom dress must haunt her nightmares to this day. slumming it are karl malden and shirley knight - hopefully they collected a big pay packet to assuage their involvement. the whole film is a series of bad scenes, but one that especially sticks in my mind is the explosion which results in the "ceiling" (if an upside-down ship's deck can be termed as such) collapsing and a load of empty cardboard boxes falling through! ooh, how scary! really, really, terrible.
