i saw this movie on videotape with my younger brother a long time ago, despite the fact i was a young boy who's hearing impaired. i didn't have the closed captioning decoder at the time (it was 1986, the year of the transformers: the movie), but i could follow the plot and understand what's going on. it wasn't my fault i saw the animated movie intended for girls. my father rented the video to show to my other younger sister.<br /><br />a decade later and i rented the video (for 50 cents) to watch again with the closed captioning turned on. my memories of this movie was utterly destroyed by none other than a wretched script. i have seen plenty of poorly written movies (like cool as ice and jason goes to hell: the final friday), but i have never seen (or heard) the dialogues this bad, only inundating with enough inanity to make your head spin from laughing in hysterics and screaming from the pain of enduring the torture of sitting through this movie. despite good plot and intriguing story concepts, the script has to be one of the worst ever written for the screen, bar none! the incompetent howard r. cohen should never be working as a screenwriter, professional or otherwise. i can not believe they would even allow the terrible script to produce a movie like this in the first place. did the japanese producers read the script, in broken english or translated before they know what they were into? even crap like g.i. joe the movie and my little pony the movie have redeeming values compared to this abomination.<br /><br />if you're a big fan of 80s animation, or just taking a nostalgia trip, beware of rainbow brite and the star stealer! it does not matter whether you were elated or traumatized by the sloppily animated movie with an atrociously written script, or you have not seen the movie, stay away from this movie. the movie should be viewed with the precaution to learn how not to write a bad script!
