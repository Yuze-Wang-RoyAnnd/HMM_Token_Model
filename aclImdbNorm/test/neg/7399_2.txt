although unusually in colour for a second string oater, the vivid clothes of the lead females fails to bring any life to the flatly directed screenplay. the "plot" revolves around the youngers newly released on parole attempting to go straight but being pursued by a vengeful ex-pinkerton man (a scenery chewing fred clark) and a femme fatale determined to involve them in her bank robbery schemes whether they want to or not. as cole younger, wayne morris is big and hunky enough but his " cool" demeanour and wooden acting skills undermine things. the standard of action is frankly, no better than a gene autry or roy rogers tv episode with colt .45's that never need reloading and uncanny shooting skills that allow a horse rider to shoot from the hip and wound a man from at least 50 feet...oh dear...
