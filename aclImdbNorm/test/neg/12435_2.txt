i've never been a big larry clark fan, but somehow, i've been dragged to almost every single one of his movies. now, i like independent films, and i grew up very much into punk rock, and i'd like to say that this film is disappointing to both audiences. not every punk song incorporates "oi!" into its choruses, as they do in this particular film.<br /><br />but the real problem with this film is that it switches moods every fifteen minutes or so and lacks any kind of cohesion. clark has made his living pretending that his fictionalized stories are "how kids really are," and as such, you'll allow him ten minute scenes of stupid dialog that go nowhere, because that's the cinema verite feel he's going for. however, when he shoots a ridiculous death scene (pick any of them, save for the opening drive-by), the over-stylized attempts at what i assume is intended to be black humor are completely out of context, ridiculously shot (in most cases, far worse than a student film) and absolutely ludicrous in terms of the story. john cassavettes and "date movie" make poor bedfellows, as the forays into the latter style take you out of any kind of reality to remind you that you're watching a movie - a really, really bad one at that.
