this movie's one redeemable quality (besides ator's barely-there loincloth) is the hilarious acting on the part of the bad guy, zor. this wonderfully overplayed villain has a certain...oh, shakespearean presence that made this movie bearable (hence the 2). i just giggled every time he pirouetted, lifting an incredulous eyebrow to henchman or hero. a true example of someone not getting paid enough. (and that beard!)<br /><br />now really, what was with the 12-minute hang-glider scene? really, really, really bad. i can't emphasize that point enough.<br /><br />so, seriously, if you even deign to see this movie, watch the mystery science theater 3000 version. with those dear silhouettes has many a horrendous movie been tolerated.
