i can see what this film was intending to do. unfortunately it just never quite completes the deal. the "reality crime" aspect works fine and the shots are all first rate. in fact quite a few of the scenes are incredibly evocative in a moody sort of way. notably the silhouette of the detective talking to the beat up woman, the scene of the detectives going through the garbage, and the father tying flies. on occasion s few scenes bog down in too much dialog. instead of showing the viewer the writer treats it too much like a book. but the real problem lies in the editing. the story does not flow. it fails to make a whole out of the sum of the parts. in the end you are confused as to what is actually happening. those who like this sort of detective movie like to follow along, piecing together the puzzle at the same time the lead characters do. with such poor editing it is difficult if not nearly impossible to do this.
