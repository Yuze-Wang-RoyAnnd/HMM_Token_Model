i really don't know much about the marquis de sade, not having read any of his book, but i never imagined him as a flaming queen. carson kressley of queer eye for the straight guy, or jack from will and grace would have fit easily into the role that nick mancuso gave us.<br /><br />the movie itself was rather thin and seemed more of a parody - or an excuse to show the paris whorehouse several times with men and women having a good time on the couches in the parlor. what? they can't afford a room? i did find it cute that the madame (irina malysheva) felt she was doing her patriotic duty taking care of the soldier's needs.<br /><br />the movie was just an excuse to show a lot of breasts - and i mean a lot! fans of gimli (john rhys-davies) might be interested in seeing him in a different role as inspector marais.
