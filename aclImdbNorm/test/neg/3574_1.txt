i recently rented this film on dvd and thought it would be an interesting choice seeing as i am both from the north of england (bradford), and also interested in film-making. however, it soon became apparent that this film seemed to lack a decent level of development script-wise. the characters were weak and often stereotyped and the story lacked substance. the subject matter could be an interesting basis for a film. however, the delivery of this appeared naive and unfocused. <br /><br />the ending felt as though it was casting judgement on the characters - punishing and rewarding where the filmmakers felt necessary. this felt a little awkward and silly, and seemed at odds with the 'realism' used in the style of shooting. for me, the film dealt with the characters and subject matter in a rather heavy handed and clumsy manner. it felt as though the writer had already decided how he wanted to end the story and set about crow-barring everything else in to fit it.<br /><br />another point that i feel strongly about is the watered-down ken loach feel the film had. i get quite upset that uk film financiers can't see that there is more to british films than 'gritty realism'. it has become almost a safe option. film is an infinitely wonderful playground for imaginative ideas and it is not being exploited by uk feature film producers. there is a lot of talent here in the uk. it's unfortunate that most of these individuals end up either making music videos and commercials 100% of the time or they go to america. <br /><br />love + hate would have worked better if it had been cut down to 30 or 60 minutes and appeared as a one-off tv drama.
