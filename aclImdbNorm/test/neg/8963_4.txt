**** mild spoilers _ but you probably know the plot ****<br /><br />woman gets raped and decides to take out her rage on all of mankind . oh did i mention the rape victim was mute ? that`s the problem with ms 45 , thana the rape victim decides she`s going to kill men but is there any logical explanation to any of this ? surely the whole film would have better if we had thana give a voice over as to why she`s bumping off any man she comes across ? there`s just not enough development to this plot<br /><br />as you`d expect from a film by ferrara it`s not a complete waste of time . it`s far better than i spit on your grave and pseudo intellectuals will have a field day pointing out the irony of the woman holding a knife like a penis as thana goes on a killing spree at the end . but the script is somewhat silly and underdeveloped and hinders any serious comment the film could have made
