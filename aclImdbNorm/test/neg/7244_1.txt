right on colmyster. i totally concur with all your sentiments and add these. i came to my pc especially to post a comment on this dreadful (minus)bgrade movie. i was going to say that in this day and age i am at a loss to comprehend how anyone could possibly make such a woeful movie - but you beat me to it. anyone reading this and colmyster's comment, trust me ---- don't waste you time and money. it's an absolute shocker. the acting is totally pathetic, the script is way worse, and the (so called) special effects are a joke. surely no-one actually invested money to make this movie? i really cannot think of anything else to say about this so called horror sci-fi product, but must pad this commentary to make 10 lines of comment in order to have it accepted for submission.
