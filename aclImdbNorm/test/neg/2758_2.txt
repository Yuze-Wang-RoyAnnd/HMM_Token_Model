drab morality tale about a high school kid who's pretty much the now-stereotypical nerd. he's smart, but has no friends, no social skills, and a lazy loser of a father who borrows money from him. a pretty girl hits on him(he should've known she wanted something-he's supposed to be smart, right?). she manipulates the poor desperate fool into writing her term paper on shakespeare, which the teacher immediately knows she couldn't have written. he loses the girl(not that he ever really had her) the confidence of his teacher, and his college scholarship, all in one fell blow.<br /><br />marv is so silly and desperate for love that he decides to rob some heroin dealers who are running the stuff through the warehouse he works at. then maybe the trashy little slut will be impressed and want to marry him. sad, really sad. marv is such a pathetic dope(and pretty brainless, for a supposedly smart guy. i mean, trying to rob drug dealers? has this kid got a screw loose?) that you stop feeling sorry for him and get the dreadful urge to kick him in the butt, instead.<br /><br />the girl, of course, tells her boyfriend about the robbery marv boasted of to her, and talks him and his cronies into stealing the money from marv and company. they try to do so, and in the process manage to shoot several people. the cops show up at the same time, and the idiot marv is dragged away, a total disgrace forever. i know this thing was geared towards making teens behave themselves by showing them the consequences of bad behavior, but all it really illustrated was the consequences of stupid behavior. which is the premature end of your film career, of course. goodbye, marv, we never really knew ya. and thank goodness for that.
