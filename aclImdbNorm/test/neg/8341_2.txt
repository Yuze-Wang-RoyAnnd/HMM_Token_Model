i saw the trailer for this film before watching titanic, and i must admit that it whetted my appetite. volcano seemed to be quite spectacular and full of promise. but what a damp squib. corny is not the word for the script, and the characterizations are often ludicrous. the stupid daughter is just beyond belief - she is supposed to be 13 not 4. but then the scientists,firemen and peripheral characters don't offer any more. this movie ranks just in front of cruise ii and twister, but only because those 2 films are completely appalling. this does have some reasonable effects, but overall its a 1 out of 10. don't waste your time
