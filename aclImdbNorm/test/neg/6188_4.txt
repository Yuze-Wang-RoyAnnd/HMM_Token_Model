eric idle, robbie coltraine, janet suzman - it should have been almost impossible to go wrong. of course it has some funny moments - the scene in the showers when robbie coltraine echoes lon chaney jr's ghastly werewolf line "i can't help myself" is hilarious. but ultimately the plot, script and direction are flat as a pancake and as tired as a 90 year old nun after 180 "hail mary"s. when i was a child, carry on films filled this niche slightly better, which is a really sad indictment of a film with such a promising cast.
