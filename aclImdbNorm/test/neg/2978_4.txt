well, i have to admit that this movie brought some occasional laughs to my face. ok, but that does not make it a good movie. most of the characters are terrible stereotypes and truly unconvincing. not all of them give great acting performances, but some really try, but fail because their characters are badly written. the perfect example is julia koschitz: she changes her eating habits from one talk to the other, on one talk she does not drink alcohol on the next she is allergic to champagne, she feels too beautiful for most people (in fact she is) but still ends up with the "perfect" fit concerning the looks, and refuses to give some more "realistic" guys a chance, and so on... the end is very cheesy, although i like one of the final scenes, when everybody finally stops talking and the director gives us a chance to catch our breath again. shoppen is basically a movie that offers some cheap laughters (mostly because it is about sex and relationships, i assume) and maybe some short entertainment. still, the whole picture is one big stereotype and nothing is really special about it.
