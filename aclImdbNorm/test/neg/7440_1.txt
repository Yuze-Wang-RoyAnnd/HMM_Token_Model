it's a shame that they didn't trust the original enough to build on it. <br /><br />but "robocop 2" takes the great ideas, imagination and characters of the original and replaces them with all the stereotypes that sequels have to offer.<br /><br />the beginning commercial was cute and so was the scene that follows (reminiscent of the beginning in "guys and dolls"!) but aside from a flash of thought here and there, this is one film that is a slow, dirty slog down into the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />ideas are introduced then dropped, interesting characters from the original hardly get any screen time here, most of the new characters (cain, juliette faxx) are so boring that they wouldn't hold up no matter what the movie, and then there's the tone.<br /><br />in the blessed original, paul verhoeven knew how to direct with the kind of attitude where if you cranked up the attitude and the sensibility of a good pulp comic, even the most repellent violence would be entertaining. kershner (although he did direct a "star wars" sequel) doesn't. and scene after scene either makes you cringe, look away or just tune it out altogether.<br /><br />and what's with robocop?? he should be the main thing here, right? but there's whole scenes where he doesn't even show up, and what scenes he is in are so half-thought and shakily written that you don't know or care if he's part-human or part-cyborg - since he's all-boring.<br /><br />never have i seen such a rapid fall from grace. why does hollywood make such bad sequels? on purpose? why; did the film-makers have a bet going?<br /><br />only one star for "robocop 2"; the fx are good but the story doesn't even try to match them.
