if you are a bit masochistic and like to waste some time you should try this one. i wasted enough time myself watching it, so i will waste no more explaining why it is so awful. be warned!!! oh, i see that i have to fill 10 lines or more. here we go: every year or so some people think it is fun to start shooting a low budget film about the scary monsters of the underground, that hopefully will prove to be some sort of a hit. the cavern is one of those. i didn't have high expectations about this one but the acting is so bad and the production so poor that i'm seriously thinking of asking for a refund. phewww ... one more line about a useless movie ... oh, i'm done.
