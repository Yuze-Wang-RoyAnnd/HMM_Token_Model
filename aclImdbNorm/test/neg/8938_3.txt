"music and lyrics written and performed by charlie daniels"... 'nuff said. just don't be expecting anything along the lines of "devil went down to georgia", ol' charles sorta talk-sings through one song early in about the whiskey mountain (duh) and that's it for lyrics. hey though, fans of arty rape scenes will get a kick out of the polaroid montage (my second-hand copy is classified as a family film) and who doesn't love interminable scenes of rednecks gawking at purty wimmen? the box art made the movie look a hell of a lot weirder than it was, with the promise that "you can lose your life-- or your mind!", but mostly it's two couples trekking through the sticks and "acting" natural. love that hermit.
