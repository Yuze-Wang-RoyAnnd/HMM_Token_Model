when moviegoers hear two popular villains/characters will be fighting, they flock to the theaters to see how the battle will end. there's freddy vs. jason, in which two very popular horror icons try to kill each other. and, more similarly to this, there's godzilla vs. (insert name here). but the very generic komodo vs. python is just a horrible title, and an even worse premise. obviously, the movie's a d-list picture, but, at least come up with a more compelling name, maybe something that can trick the unsuspecting viewer into watching it. with a name like this, you know what you're getting in to.<br /><br />a group of military men/women, including a 20-something year old sexy scientist woman are left for dead by the military on an island inhabited by a giant komodo dragon. as long as they can make it off the island and to the boat, they'll be fine, but...no...there's a giant python guarding the ocean and the way off. let's hope all these guys can make it off the island, and that the python and komodo don't verse each other in some sort of horrible special effect battle.<br /><br />really, this movie is bad in almost every way. the acting is pretty bad, or maybe it's that the special effects are so cheesy, that the acting is unbelievable because no one believes that these people are in any danger with creatures that look like they were made on an early 90s computer. nonetheless, this movie is actually pretty funny. the creatures are so clunky looking, and the actors really give it their all pretending like they're in danger.<br /><br />i'd like to say that this movie is a steaming pile of sh*squawk!*...but i can't. this pg-13 rated film actually bleeps itself out. every time a curse word comes, a parrot noise beeps out the word. even words that can be said on network television. how *squawk*ing cheap that they bleep out words, and with a parrot no less. eventually these parrot noises got to me and i couldn't help but laugh at the incompetence.<br /><br />this movie is bad, from the silly beginning to the ridiculous night of the living dead style ending, but it's also kind of funny. as a horror movie it fails miserably, as an action movie, it fails slightly less, but still pretty bad, and as a comedy it shines.<br /><br />my rating: * out of ****. 95 mins. pg-13 for some violence and squawked out cursing.
