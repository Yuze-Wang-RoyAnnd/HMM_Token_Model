i have to say that i had low expectations for the movie before viewing it. all the people around said it was great, but i perfectly knew what they like. they like aerosmith's song which is indeed great, they like the amazing special effects which had coasted a lot, they like the comedy side of the movie and of course many girls who love affleck who according to my opinion is a really bad actor who tried not to be one, failed and now he is nothing. and all these things plus the reviews and the ratings i read in internet, gave me a clue the movie would be a huge disappointment since i am a big disaster kind of movies fan. well, i've been right, but at least i was prepared.<br /><br />the movie is really commercial. it's been said, but i will say it as again. we have over #100 million budget, we have a romance between hollywood stars ben affleck and liv tyler and many other famous actors, who are popular with the fact that they rarely agree on becoming a part of the cast of a commercial movie if their names aren't written with big letters on the screen. such as billy bob thornton and steve buscemi which are highly respected actors that i also like a lot. they could play many characters in many different kind of movies. they could improvise, they could turn tasteless lines into hilarious jokes. on the whole, they could turn small movies into really interesting, funny or dramatic motion pictures, people love and will always love. such as fargo in buscemi's case or a simple plan - thornton. and to be honest, i am really disappointed they took part of armageddon. thornton plays a smart and refined man involved in politics if i remember correctly. buscemi is one of the members of the deep core drilling team which is sent to save the world by destroying the asteroid which is about to vanish the world.<br /><br />what i didn't like - well, i guess i've been already understood. i pointed out bad factors. the story is dull, artless and silly. it is so obvious that the movie depends on the effects and the dramatic ending that it's ridiculous. at least movies like deep impact and godzilla have something special that might be considered as art. at least it ain't that obvious that the movie is made of financial purposes. other than that, bad performances from all the huge stars. the jokes ain't funny, the lines are absurd and sometimes, they doesn't make sense at all. in fact, i recently read that on the stage, ben affleck has asked bay whether it would be easier if they teach astronauts to drill, than drillers to becomes astronauts and bay's reply has been simply "shut up!" which is a really funny story which perfectly shows the creators's desperation.<br /><br />and enclosing, i'll give an explanation why i give 4 to the movie. well, i like "don't want to miss a thing" and i was impressed by the special effects which are obviously the only good thing in the movie. the first scene is memorable. these are the the only 2 good things i liked about the movie. michael bay is an average director, but the rock and both bad boys were hundreds of times better than armageddon which was, is and will always be one big bad movie.
