to say i was disappointed is an understatement. an amateur film made by professionals. i was about to leave the theater in two or three occasions (something i've never done)i was stopped by cloris leachman really. she rings true, the only one i should say. this new women are less modern than the george cukor women of the 30's. this ones are "acting" for us trying to be with it but their "conflict" is exactly the same as it has always been, in movies anyway. the fun of the original was based on a crisp, vitriolic and very funny script. a masterful direction and an unrepeatable cast. all the elements that are missing here. tv actresses mingling with models and oscar nominees/winners. there wasn't anything organic about it. the whole thing felt like a put on, improvised in the moment without a clear objective. 2/10
