this was so bad i can't even review it. so i'll jot some sentences about what i witnessed, and it'll be up to you to decide. <br /><br />captain kirk, with toupee and tubby gut, is rock climbing yosemete's el capitan. spock meets him halfway riding on a floating skateboard-like hovercraft. kirk falls. spock flies down, catches him inches before kirk hits the ground head- first. <br /><br />later, that night, spock, kirk and mccoy are eating beans around a campfire. spock likes the beans. then, kirk and mccoy sing "row row row your boat", and want spock to join in on the three-way harmony. spock doesn't want to sing. and later that night, he disagrees. "but life isn't but a dream, captain". should i go on? <br /><br />okay... a renegade vulcan, who happens to be spock's half brother, leads a revolt on a sandy planet - taking hostages. the crew of the enterprise land on the planet, and uhura, pushing fifty-five and weighing two-hundred some-odd pounds, lures the natives with her bare legs. but they can't trick the brother, who claims he can find god. <br /><br />he kidnaps the crew and the enterprise. they go to a planet where a big bearded apparition, claiming to be god, spits fire at kirk, spock, and mccoy. spock's sibling, realizing it isn't god - but is really a form of himself - or something - joins with the apparition in order to destroy it and... sparks fly. <br /><br />then, after stuff happens too complicated to explain involving klingons who resemble lorenzo lamas... <br /><br />the three amigos - kirk, spock and mccoy - return to yosemite (did i mention, kirk was wearing a go climb a rock t-shirt?). with spock playing some kind of funky vulcan guitar, they sing "row row row your boat", this time all three harmonizing as the credits roll.
