a lot of actors have a multitude of good movie roles in their soul. some, a handful. others, maybe a couple.<br /><br />then there's linda blair. "the exorcist". that's it.<br /><br />when you see "chained heat" and watch linda blair in it, you have to wonder what, if anything, was running through her mind.<br /><br />certainly not, "oh boy: oscar for best actress, here i come!"<br /><br />just another women in prison film like they used to make for the cheap in the '70s, this one actually has names you may recognize. john vernon plays the dean... i mean, the warden (with a hot tub in his office; wonder what he told the contractor?), stella stevens pops up, even henry silva and louisa moritz show how bad they needed the work.<br /><br />and special mention, of course, for our heroine sybil danning as a bisexual prisoner who puts the moves on poor blair. to paraphrase, sybil is as sybil does and everything sybil does is done perfect. makes you forget what a terrible movie you're watching.<br /><br />almost.<br /><br />two stars. one for sybil and another for trying to pass off linda blair as a sex symbol. whatever could have possessed them (get it?)?
