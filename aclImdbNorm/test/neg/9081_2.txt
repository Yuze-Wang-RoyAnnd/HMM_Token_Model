does anyone remember the alternative comedy show the comic strip presents . one edition featured charles bronson ( robbie coltrane ) being interviewed about his new movie glc :<br /><br />" it's about a man , an ordinary man whose wife and family gets wiped out by creeps and i have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner " <br /><br />" and after glc what next for bronson ? " <br /><br />" we're using a new angle . my family don't get wiped out but i go after creeps just the same " <br /><br />this accurately describes the evil that men do . it's a bronson vigilante thriller where his motivation isn't down to a blood feud but this leads to credibility becoming strained <br /><br />bronson is a retired hit-man who isn't giving up his retirement for anything until someone shows him a video tape featuring interviews with the victims of " the doctor " , not the legendary time traveler but a infamous expert on torture . it's never really explained why the doctor is so infamous since any police state has a myriad of these sadists nor is it explained why the doctor and his sister have ridiculous english accents <br /><br />as you may guess it's a lazily written movie and incidents happening because the screenwriter needs things to happen to further the plot no matter how unlikely they are like one of the bad guys getting invited to a threesome so he can be killed or things being revealed like the doctor's sister being a lesbian so some t&a can be included <br /><br />in many ways it's like one of those nasty chuck norris vehicles that were being released at the same time , but the most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who made ice cold in alex and the guns of naverone two very well regarded war dramas that are often shown on sunday afternoons . believe me this movie won't be shown until well after the watershed
