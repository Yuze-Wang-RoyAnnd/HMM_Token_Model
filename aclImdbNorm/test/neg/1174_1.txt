i would hate to have anyone watch this "inspired by a true story" movie and draw any conclusions about the true event. few things they did get right were overshadowed by the things that were just not true. ed gein never dragged anyone behind a car, never met up with anyone at the graveyard and killed them, no proof he returned body parts to the graveyard. the things he did were awful enough, why try to make it worse? <br /><br />this movie ranks among my 10 worst wastes of eye strain. "in the light of the moon" is a much better film on the subject, it is more factual and the acting is superior in contrast to this one.
