when this show began it was fairly interesting: we got to see what crab boat fisherman had to go through during the crab-catching season. soon after, however, it lost focus on the fishing and focused almost entirely on the drama in the lives of the fisherman. episodes became nothing more than 'the captain doesn't like the new greenhorn' (this one happens way too often), 'someone is injured or sick', 'a fisherman gets word of some problem at home and is frustrated that he is stuck on a boat', repeat. i don't know how people can find the newest seasons watchable, as every episode seems to be essentially the same as those before and after it. this show should be moved to a different channel and renamed to "crab boat drama", or, even better, it would have made a perfect one-time segment on dirtiest jobs. <br /><br />shouldn't the discovery channel have learned their lesson after american choppers?
