it's hard to decide what to say about this one. it isn't totally, one hundred percent bad. although the movie-in-a-movie is unspeakably bad, meant to be campy, but missing by a mile. i'm pretty sure that this is intentional, however. danny aiello is perfectly adequate here, and more or less nails his pathetic character. dyan cannon was good in a small role. clotilde courau was impressive as the latest twenty-something girlfriend. and linda carlson had a brave topless scene that she pulled off very well.<br /><br />so, it's not totally bad, but i don't believe that this one accomplishes its goals. all in all, it's probably worth passing on.
