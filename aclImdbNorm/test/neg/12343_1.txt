11 years after this film was released only 5 people have reviewed it here on imdb. there is a reason for this utter lack of interest in across the moon. it is coherent, but lacks all cinematic virtue. see this film for examples of terrible production in all respects. the opening credits for instance are white letters rising mechanically from a red background. the ending features michael mckean staring out a prison window saying "there's lots of mysteries out there." followed by a clip montage/music video of all the uplifting moments in the tragically bad movie. julinana hatfield. everything in between is awful. i struggled to find any value in this movie and have come up empty. though it is hard to believe, even a cameo role from burgess meridith (always a crowd pleaser) only disappointed me further. this movie is like a mockery of what is special about movies. on paper the movie is below average. women living together in a trailer. but what actually was produced was nearly unwatchable. the movie attempts to branch off in many directions but never follows through on any. the unappealing conflict of having their boyfriends in jail is never resolved. no conflict is ever resolved. there really is no conflict. the women attempt to become hookers, but that never happens. instead they get jobs as a bartender and a shelf stocker. sound exciting? it wasn't. it was stupid. and the bulk of the movie is the two women talking and generating contrived conflict. the women are capable actresses, but the script was beyond poor. useless. this was a terrible movie, but it is even worst that they borough burgess meridith out of his retirement home to make it. bad from start to finish. like the lion without teeth, this film has no bite.
