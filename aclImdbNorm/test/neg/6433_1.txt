"war is in your blood" rambo says early in the film, "don't fight it". say, what? is the scriptwriter taking the mickey out of sly? it is impossible for any person with a primary school education to miss the joke here. yet, stallone utters it without a hint of irony.<br /><br />the same lack of humour applies to the movie. rambo iv is an over-the-top, idiotic actioner that would have been funny without intention if it weren't sickeningly violent. a redneck fantasy of the basest kind where villains are so villainous, it is not enough just to kill them
