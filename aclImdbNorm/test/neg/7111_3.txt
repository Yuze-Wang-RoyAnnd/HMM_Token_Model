i was sick one day and was skimming channels and i came upon this terribly rank movie. the plot and even the subplots (if you can find one) have been done to extinction. but, as bad as the story was, i reserve a special comment for liza minelli. her character was absolutely one of the most annoying characters i have ever has the misfortune of seeing on film. her only two competitors in this category are john leguziamo in "the pest" and julia stiles in anything she's done (or half-done). maybe she performed exactly as the script suggested or maybe (groan!) that is the limit she has to her acting range. either way, they should have had a rewrite and killed her off in the first 30 seconds of the film (eg. like the girl that fell off the balcony in lethal weapon (i) (but at least she had nice breasts))<br /><br />most humbly submitted...douglas neidermeyer
