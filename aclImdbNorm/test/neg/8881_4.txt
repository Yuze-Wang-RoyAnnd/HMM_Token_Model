then the second half of this movie is hard to follow. i got the first part with the spanish inquistion, but the film skipped many years forward with the french ruling spain. the movie does little to fill you in on what happened, and i don't remember much about it. so, the movie gets confusing then. the movie begins when ines, daughter of a rich merchant, is accused of judiasm by the church, specifically father lorenzo. she is put to the question and forced to confess. even her family's wealth can not buy her out of prison. her father forces lorenzo to sign a confession saying he is the offspring of a chimp, in hopes of getting ines released. all it does is give a reason for the church to condemn lorenzo, who runs off to france.<br /><br />then, the movie skips many years, and the french revolution is in full force. ines is released from prison. it was very good make up work to make natalie portman look that tore up. she finds her family dead and seeks goya for her help. she tells him she had a child in prison. goya sets up a meeting between her and lorenzo, whom is now with the french and in power. he is the father. goya sees the daughter and tells lorenzo, whom decides it's best to send her off to america, so no one will find out. but before his plans get carried out, the british join the spainish, and spain reclaims power and he is now the persecuted. that part is not well told in the film. it's like the film shows this to happen in a day.<br /><br />final verdict: the movie is good until it skips many years in time after the inquistion, then the movie expects you to understand what is going on. it just got too confusing to me then.
