i want to say that i went to this movie with my expectations way too high. i thought it was going to be funny because it's the sequel to bruce almighty which was really funny and it stars steve carell who is an excellent comedic actor but boy, did it sucked.<br /><br />the movie is advertised as a sequel but it really has nothing to do with the original since the only people reprising their roles are morgan freeman and steve carell but steve's character is completely different, he is no longer the jerk he was in the first one here he is a nice guy. the story is different and the actors are different and it's not funny.<br /><br />all the actors involved(steve carell, morgan freeman, wanda sykes, john goodman, ed helms and even jon stewart in a very crappy cameo) have talent but none of them seems to use it and it looks that there in the movie just for the money.<br /><br />now the plot is obviously shaped after noah's story but there are so many wrong things with it, i don't know where to start. i guess the big problem is that in the everyone around evan thinks that he is crazy despite all the things that are happening to him, he grows a huge white beard in two days, he gets help from animals from all around the world, he builds a giant arc in a few weeks, in real life people wouldn't be mocking these guy after that, they would be saying he is the new noah.<br /><br />also the special effects are good but what the hell is the greatest movie flood ever filmed doing in evan almighty? did they really had to waste such good special effects as filler for this crappy movie.<br /><br />jim carrey seems to be a smart guy since he has stayed away of three of the worst sequels ever made, son of the mask, dumb and dumbered and now evan almighty.<br /><br />this was a giant disappointment and tom shyadac should be ashamed of himself.
