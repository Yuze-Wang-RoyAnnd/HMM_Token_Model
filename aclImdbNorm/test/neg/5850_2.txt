if you are a fan of slap-stick that has terrible writing, awful acting and cliche after cliche this one is for you.<br /><br /> there is far too much to list for the reasons why this movie sucks. in a brief synopsis, people with a combined iq of 100 journey to new mexico on a race for 200 million dollars. and yes they are all apparently super heroes, as they can do many things such as jump onto trains that are traveling 80+ mph, survive numerous car crashes, and endless instances of outright cartoonish roadrunner and coyote antics.<br /><br /> if you are a teen, or dont want to think for a movie, this one is for you.. not one actor outside of lovitz is believeable at all.. lovitz saves the movie from a 1 with the hitler bit.<br /><br /> 2/10 (save yourself the 2 hours of pain and $4)
