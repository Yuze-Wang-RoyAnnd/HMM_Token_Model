i'm seeing a pattern here. if you see a movie on mystery science theater 3000, chances are if you go to imdb.com there will be hordes of lovers of the film, yet it was picked to be on that tv show because it was sooo bad. i'm sorry but i read a lot about rocketship x-m as being some landmark sci fi film that stressed realism. well if that is the case i could write for several paragraphs about how even with 1950's knowledge this movie is utterly flawed. gravity might be the first obvious observation, or as mst3k did as a skit "selective gravity", also what about when they are plunging to their death and they are just standing there looking out of the window, um would'nt the ship being upside down effect that scene? i would like to think that they started with good intentions and that it ran over budget or something but i think this movie was just plain cheese as in the from under type. just compare this to "when worlds collide" which was released in 1951 to see the true place where this movie ranks, there's no comparison. the movie gets a 2 or maybe 3 on its own, its not even funny to watch on its own. it gets about a 5 or 6 as a mst3k episode as there is no action or much to make fun of, just bad, bad, bad, oh did i mention, it's bad.
