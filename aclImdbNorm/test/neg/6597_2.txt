even though i sat and watched the whole thing,i must say it was not good.it was all over the place,with big chunks of information missing about how things developed and even inaccurate at some bits too.if you know nothing about michael , you wont understand a thing.you have to rely on your current knowledge of the man in order for some bits to make sense..acting was a bit dramatic, flex alexander looked nothing like michael which was a put off for me and towards the end he literally looked grey.saying that portraying michael as somewhat naive but highly positive, gentle and loving individual was okay even though they still made a fool out of him time to time.if you want to watch mj's life story check out "an american dream". it is much better but the only thing is it will cover up to "bad" era. i have no doubt that they will eventually make a big budget movie of mj's life story, cos michael you rock ;-) !!!!
