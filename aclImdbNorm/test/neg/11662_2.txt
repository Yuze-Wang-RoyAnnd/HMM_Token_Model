now i remember what the 'indie' filmmakers were ripping off before pulp fiction. it was david lynch, right?<br /><br />i hunted this thing down to see kyle secor. what a waste of a perfectly good bayliss. it was so painful to watch him, sort of like when someone you love is horribly sick and there's nothing you can do.<br /><br />nearly every cliche in the book: the desert, the psycho, the quirky mob boss, the biker, tracy walker (who fortunately was only in one scene, but i kept expecting him to reappear and say something strange and profound like "if a man wants to know where he's going, he's got to look at where he's been," or some contrived garbage like that). i have a theory as to why so many indies are short on location in the desert. i think it's because they can save money on lighting.<br /><br />if you like to be in pain, find this movie and give it a viewing. if you're a fan of kyle secor, watch reruns of homicide on court tv. if you want a good, quirky road thriller, check out wild at heart.<br /><br />there is a reason that no one has heard of delusion! my god, what a waste of a good title.
