this is a textbook example of how hollywood didn't (doesn't) trust moviegoers, and panders to its big name stars. the character of christian is completely re-written, the anti-semitism noah faces from his own army unit is virtually eliminated, michael's story is changed significantly, and the end result is to decimate the power and terrible beauty of the book. i almost wish i hadn't even seen it, because of the ability of movies (sounds and images) to resonate so powerfully in your brain; i would have much rather just been left with the impression of the book. the book could have been written today, it is that honest and brave. the movie, neither. my advice: skip the movie; read the book.
