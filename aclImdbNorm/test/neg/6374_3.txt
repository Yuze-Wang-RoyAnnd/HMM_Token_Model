i am obviously disappointed so i'll be brief and won't waste your time. first off, the plot was uninspired... at least. the animation was even worse, we're in 2008 for god's sake and it looked like a shinier version of g.i.joe. i won't even bother characterizing the actors' performance and the dialogs. or maybe i will 'cause i just saw that in order to post a comment over here you need 10 lines (?!??!?!). where were we? oh yeah the performance, well it was totally flat, lacking passion and talent if i am excused. now as for the dialogs, just like the acting, no memorable quotes, nothing that someone wouldn't expect. let's just hope the movie will be decent ...at least.
