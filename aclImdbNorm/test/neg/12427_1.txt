i think this is one of those few movies that i want to rate it as low as possible just to pay it a compliment.<br /><br />i haven't seen this movie in about 25 years, so i really can't say that much about it. it still seems to be very hard to find on video. but i remember my brother and i stumbled upon it somewhere in the toxic brew of late night uhf channel television of the mid 1980s when i was about 10 years old. so i've never actually seen the beginning of the movie, but i saw most of it. the first thing i remember is this couple is sneaking out of a campsite and they're rowing to an island to make out, and then they get attacked by an insane scotsman in a kilt with an axe! they manage to escape from him but get attacked by the loch ness monster, which in this movie is just a head and a neck with no body. the eyes and the mouth of the monster don't even move, it looks like a pi~nata.<br /><br />i mean i had just literally never seen anything on this magnitude before and it totally blew my mind. i had seen some bad movies on tv in the early 80s but i had never seen something so totally inept and so casually and thoughtlessly constructed that it seemed like the people who made it spent less time and effort on it than we did watching it. i had already seen some of the troma films and that type of thing that tries to deliberately be "campy", but this was the pure and real stuff and it was my first encounter with truly great bad film-making. this movie was like the last gasp of the drive-in era and i caught a whiff of it just in time. actually when we were watching it, we couldn't figure out if it was made in the 50s or the 70s. turns out it came out just a few years before i saw it.<br /><br />later i came into contact with mystery science theater and found out about a lot of the old b movies and serials, but i had already seen it in this movie. the movie is so funny that i had never even laughed that hard at the monty python crew or bill murray or any comedian. after seeing this movie i was always trying to search for the "good bad" movies and i got a lot of my friends into it. but this movie was and basically is an impossible one to find. i never really found out what it even was or who larry buchanan was until the 1990s when imdb took off and the internet took off and information started getting passed around. but this movie still needs to be discovered by a lot of others who might appreciate its transcendentally bad qualities. look for it.
