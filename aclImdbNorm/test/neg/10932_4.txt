the material is poor....the script's dreadful....the acting mediocre at best and the music telegraphs what the scene is supposed to be communicating like a kick in the head.<br /><br />give this one a miss....even yancy butlers not hot enough even in the semi nude scenes to save this tripe.<br /><br />i'm amazed people rave about yancy butler.....given what i've seen here and in the couple of other things i've seen her in she hasn't got the depth or presence to be a star...and her off screen behaviour would tend to indicate she knows that as well.<br /><br />last thing is where was this shot? i don't recognise the externals.
