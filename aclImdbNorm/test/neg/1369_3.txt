i was a teenager when this first appeared in theaters, and i saw it in japan. the film's plot wasn't my cup of tea as a high school sophomore, but i went to see it for the 3-d process. it had been ballyhooed in the press so that even service personnel overseas had heard of it, though it never screened at the post theater.<br /><br />the film started the trend of throwing objects at the audience, which was taken to absurd levels with later 3-d films.<br /><br />i don't know whether this qualifies as a spoiler, but you've been warned if it is. in many films of the time, actors would often work in front of a "rear projection screen," where backgrounds could be projected to make it appear that they were in a different environment, such as a jungle background when the actors were actually on a sound stage. this works well on regular films, but when seen in 3-d, they look like a flat scene behind the actors. there were several scenes in the film where rear projection was used, and it didn't work well in the theaters. if seen in 3-d, it will constitute another disappointment.<br /><br />the film's only importance is historical, since it was the first of its kind.
