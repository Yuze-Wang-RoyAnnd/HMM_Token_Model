watched this film with an audience of....5 in total! had a choice between lakshya and asambhav...(realized then i should have gone for lakshya). a typical plot...india v pakistan..but just isn't cricket as you have kashmir in the middle. an indian super hero goes on a mission to save the president of india from some pakistani rebels who are involved in a mass drug smuggling racket. i left the film half way as it was simply boring and the plot was confusing and all over the place. the songs were also awful, the film tries to hide the flaws with its special effects but unfortunately they are outdated too.<br /><br />overall...avoid it if you can, has to be the worst film i've seen this year.
