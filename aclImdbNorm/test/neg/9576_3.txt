deformed, aged female scientist kills fellow scientist in order to steal formulae for rejuvenating cells and reversing the aging process. she takes it and turns into the beautiful, evil satanik (magda konopka) who goes around, seducing and murdering wealthy businessmen.<br /><br />she dresses very stylishly in late-60s mod clothes and manipulates those around her, looking a lot like the late marisa mell from the diabolik film. coincidence??<br /><br />however, in spite of all this, it's amateurish and sloppy without the james bond pop-art gadgetry that diabolik had had. even the madrid and lake geneva filming locations don't make up for this.<br /><br />the soundtrack is by manuel parada & roberto pregadio and it isn't bad at all, consisting of lush orchestration with a little fuzz guitar used as an embellishment. perfect for one of those european loungecore cds that came out in the 90s.<br /><br />the retromedia dvd also uses a substandard grainy color print that's in poor shape, with an explanation at the beginning saying that this was due to the age of the film. bull ! they either didn't bother looking for a better source or they couldn't find one at all. there are only a few stills of magda and that's it.<br /><br />sloppy & poor all around, this one gets a 3 out of 10.
