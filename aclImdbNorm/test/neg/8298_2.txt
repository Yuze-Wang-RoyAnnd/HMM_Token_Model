this movie clearly has an agenda, which could be summed up like this: never, never cross the border (either physical or metaphorical). let's shun everything that's on the other side with a wall or a fence or something else, let's pretend all "gringos" are evil, satanic, or drug dealers. all that is outside one's country's border (and specially us borders) is dangerous, malevolent and people there will hate you, or envy you or try to steal you or something else. the "based on true events" is only a perverse tag that can be pinned on anything to give it some aura of credibility or, in this case, just to help pushing the film's ideology down some na"ive throats out there. the perversity of the film lies in the fact that it reduces countries, people and all else into very black and white stereotyped categories: mexicans into disgusting people, mexican police into a bunch of corrupt cops, republicans into the right-wing morons, democrats into almost hippie humanists and so forth. is there anything good about the film? i hardly think so, but may be you think differently.
