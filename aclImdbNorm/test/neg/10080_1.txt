you could have put the characters on the island for any reason at all and had the same movie. the first one had an original story, the second stole one from king kong, and in the end (i hope) of this trilogy the story seemed to have been bypassed altogether. drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives. that was about all there was to it. the special effects were decent but not worth 8 dollars. if you have a discount theatre in your local area, wait and see it for a buck. i wouldn't even bother renting it. that would be too much money for this unthrilling thriller.
