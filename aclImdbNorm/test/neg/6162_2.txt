they say david duchovny took six days to write the script for this movie. that sounds about right.<br /><br />this movie is one of the worst films i've ever seen and i've seen gigli. it's not as bad as gigli, but that's like saying saddam hussein wasn't as bad as adolf hitler.<br /><br />tom warshaw has been living in france with his french wife and 13-year old son. he has been pretending to be french all this time. he reveals to his wife that he is actually american. for some reason, this comes as an earth-shattering reveal for her, despite the fact that she always commented on her husband's american accent. also, their son - remember, he was born in france and never knew his father was american - speaks perfect american english without a hint of french accent. that's just one of several huge plot holes in this movie.<br /><br />the main bulk of the movie is a flashback to tommy's youth in new york city during the 1970's, as he explains to his wife why he has been hiding in france. his best friend as a boy was pappas, a retarded adult played terribly by robin williams. i assume duchovny thinks that "retarded" is someone who is just sort of dumb, because pappas comes off only mildly slow at times, while other times he comes off as just robin williams. yes, williams actually fits in his tired improv schtick although he is supposed to play a person who is mentally slow.<br /><br />tommy's mother, played by duchovny's wife tea leoni, is a pill-popping nurse who is distraught over the recent death of her husband. leoni does a good job, but she mainly just smokes a lot and yells at tommy for things that don't seem to be too important. the script didn't give her much to work with. tommy also befriends a lady (whom he calls "lady") who is in prison and offers him advice through her jail window (this house of detention is called "house of d" for short, thus the title). tommy has no qualms yelling his personal problems out loud on a city street so this incarcerated felon can offer him advice, and he does so many times without care.<br /><br />i don't want to bore you with the entire summary of the movie, but plot holes are abound in this film that tries way too hard to be touching but comes off as, well, bad. real bad. real real bad. near the end of this train wreck, the script gets cornier and cornier and ends with a laughably crappy ending.<br /><br />critics tore "house of d" apart and rightfully so. i can't believe some people actually like this movie. it is a painful film to sit through and i felt weak afterwards - not from emotion, but from how terrible it was.
