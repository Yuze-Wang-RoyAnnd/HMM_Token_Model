this movie is a waste of time. though it has actors who have the potential to do something decent, the acting in the movie is sub-par, and has a clich'e point. "you never know what's going to happen tomorrow, so live your life to the fullest and do what makes you happy." that sentence saves you from wasting hours of your life on this movie. people who like this movie are the same people who would enjoy sitting for two hours before finding that the entire movie was a dream sequence. if the most important part of the movie isn't even going to happen, at least make it enjoyable to watch and captivating. there's a reason this project didn't make a theatrical release, and though indy films can turn out very good, this one does not even come close.
