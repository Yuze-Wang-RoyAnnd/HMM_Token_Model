i watched "gristle" primarily for the presence of michael dorn, as i enjoyed his worf portrayal on star trek tng, but had never seen him out of his makeup. dorn appears to have a nice presence, and probably has the potential for a profitable acting career. this movie, however, gave him little dramatic challenge, except to prove that he can, indeed, use the "f" word.<br /><br />it appears that this movie was made by someone who fancied himself as a forward-thinking type, with a social conscience. yeah--- for 1965. today, the themes are so belabored and sophomoric and cornball that even spike lee's dreadful "bamboozled" looks good in comparison.<br /><br />this crime-caper flick has an intricate labrynth of double-, triple-, and quadruple-crosses, but the plot scheme is so convoluted that it collapses upon itself within the first 30 minutes. mostly, after that point, i simply watched out of momentum, and a mild curiosity about how each scene would play out. there is a great cast here-- you will recognize virtually everyone as a character actor from much better movies. why are they all in this? i suspect it was 1) the work, and some money, even if modest. 2) perhaps the director knows all these actors from acting classes and social connections around la--- you know, perhaps they participated to support him, as a fellow struggling movie guy on the third and fourth tiers of the hollywood scene. dunno... but the movie was half-baked--- not really "finished." i gave it a 3, although my affection for the actors involved was undiminished from my admiration of their previous work. let's hope everybody has moved on to more professional, more carefully done, and more thorough projects since.
