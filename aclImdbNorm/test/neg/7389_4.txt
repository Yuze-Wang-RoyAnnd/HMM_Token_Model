a bad movie, but with one reel that is worth savoring. for most of the film, the jokes are bad, the songs are bad, even w.c. fields is bad. then there is one sequence with bob hope and his movie-ex; the dialogue is witty and the song (a version of "thanks for the memories") light, cynical and delightful. who parachuted in for this one bit? yet it makes the whole thing worth the original 25 cents admission.
