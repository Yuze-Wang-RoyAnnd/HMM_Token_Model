there's not really that much wrong with crash of the moons. basically it's a few episodes of rocky jones, space ranger merged into a film. it is extremely dated, however. winky's treatment of vena is a good example of this. one has to remember that it was geared to be shown to children in the 1950's. in this respect, it succeeds. if you like children's sci-fi from the 1950's, go ahead and take a look at it. you'll see john banner in a pre-sgt. schultz role. he does a pretty good job in it. all in all, i'd give it a 6 out of 10. not great, but not bad.
