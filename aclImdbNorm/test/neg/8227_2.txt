shot in my former home town by a couple of college kids, this movie centers around some freak named "luther". luther, recently paroled (revealed to us by an arguing parole board in one of the most laughably scenes of all time), runs amuck at the local kroger grocery by eating an old woman's neck with his metal teeth.<br /><br />luther runs to farm where he eats a guy, steals a car, ties up an old woman, and gets chased, and gets killed. oh, and the chick from the superboy tv show gets naked.
