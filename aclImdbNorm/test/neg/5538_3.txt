the artist daniel king (chris john) and his mate laura peters (lara clancy) are invited to move to an old house in cornwall, in great britain, by his childhood wealthy friend natasha carlton (carol kentish). natasha has a crush on daniel, who is an ambiguous man regarding his sentimental life. while alone in the house, weird things happen and laura is startled and scared. when laura meets the old insane priest gabriel norton (brian blessed) on the road, she is advised to immediately leave the house, since evil lived there. but the couple stays and has to face tragic consequences.<br /><br />what a messy screenplay and awful and cheesy movie this "devil's harvest" is! the cinematography and the camera work is not totally bad, but the amateurish performances of chris john and carol kentish and direction of james shanks, together with the terrible story, ridiculous situations and dialogs make this movie one of the worse i have ever seen in the genre. i have occasionally seen in youtube a couple of shorts from cinema college that are better and better than the pointless and dreadful "devil's harvest". in the end, it is not a horror movie but a horror of movie. my vote is three.<br /><br />title (brazil): "a colheita do diabo" ("the devil's harvest")
