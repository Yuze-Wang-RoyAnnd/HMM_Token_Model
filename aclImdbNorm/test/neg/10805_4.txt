the film soultaker is essentially an older form final destination in which several car wrecked teens have their souls separated from their bodies and must cheat death who is chasing them... the film has its moments, and its concepts, the idea of disoriented souls being separated from their bodies is a pretty nifty idea... if this movie were remade with a few good actors/actresses and some awesome special effects it could turn out to be extremely awesome... as for the actual film, i recommend watching the mst3k version, the pure version might be too boring to sit through, unless you love bad movies staring martin sheen's brother...
