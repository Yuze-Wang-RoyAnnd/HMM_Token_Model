there's only 2 reasons i watch this show...i invested the time already in previous episodes and col tigh. for all you supposed sci-fi fans out there who love the new bsg, give me a break! go read some classic sci-fi novels by the true greats or watch some of the milestone films and tv shows from days gone by and you'll see what hacks these bsg writers are. their only gimmick is "who is the fifth cylon". poor writing and really, truly no sense of character development. if adama resigns or tries to take power or cries again or discovers the inner father he should have been one more time...ahhhhh! and roslin is as annoying a character that's ever been put aboard a starship. out the airlock with her. i could care less if it's six more months before they conclude. these wannabe writers were out of tricks in season one. if you don't know that, you just don't know writing.
