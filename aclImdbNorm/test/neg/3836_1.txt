the worst movie i've ever seen. i still don't understand what dennis hopper and michael madsen intend to do in. maybe they had bills to pay... the best and cult part happens during a flashback which brings us during wwii when a nazi officer hide his jewish wife. that's the beginning of a typical serial killer life! it seems to be directed during the beginning of the 80's but then appears a new beattle... amazing! this movie was directed in 2001... i'm quite sure that it took less than two weeks to do that movie. i heard that dennis hopper's wife asked for divorce after she saw that picture and michael madsen's mother had a heart attack when the actor admitted to be the man under the yellow baseball hat. pathetic!
