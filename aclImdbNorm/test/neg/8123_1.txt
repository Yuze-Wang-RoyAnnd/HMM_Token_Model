i don't care if this show is suppose to be communicating profound messages about human existence.<br /><br />the show is crap....how can anyone derive pleasure from watching it? yet it was received so well. this reflects a sad state of affairs for joe moron out there.<br /><br />i tried watching this program when it first came out as friends were talking about it. the inane laughing between the two main characters and the pitiful dialog made me want to cry.<br /><br />it is beyond belief that people can watch this show. yet i guess the creators had the last laugh....making themselves wealthy by taking the p.ss out of the very people that would watch a show such as this.<br /><br />i would wager they are laughing all the way to the bank.
