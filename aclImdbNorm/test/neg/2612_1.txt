this seventh (yes you read right - the seventh) puppet master movie shows how the demented group of dolls came to be; by a french puppeteer who uses them to get revenge on a group of ancient mummies who are after him once they learn that he holds the secret to life. it was taught to him by a sorcerer, also on the run, before he died. he used this power to bring normal puppets to life. this sequel is basically nonsense, sprinkled upon even more nonsense like most of the puppet master sequels. due to the pg13 rating, we don't even get any entertaining puppet murders. come to think of it, there are no damn puppet murders. if there was one franchise that needed to be cut off it would be this one. no more....god, please no more...
