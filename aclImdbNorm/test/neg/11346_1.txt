this is so bad i don't know where to begin.<br /><br />the lead role is a good starting point. it is a supreme mary sue character that has few things in common with the original one from the book, who was (a bit) more credible. no, this one is invincible, infallible, indomitable, and insipid even beyond the overinflated standards that this "chicks with swords" era that our medias are spinning out of late. she is a twenty-something top-model, thin as a match yet rich, already a leader in her academic field, a kung-fu master, a natural sniper and seems to have enough authority to naturally trump anyone official like puny fbi agents. she is god.<br /><br />to balance it out, she is supposed to be socially awkward (due to her typically harsh upbringing that transformed her into a "spock") which gives us some delighted moments where she wonders what is "star wars", or "american idol", but yet when it's really important she can conveniently reveal herself as a top negotiator and diplomat, because she is so superior, ya know. to top it out, she is played by a wooden actress.<br /><br />the more talented boreanaz serves as a faire-valoir token for this construct, acting as a bumbling comic-relief and house "watson". in fact, everything in there is a pop-parody of better works like sherlock holmes, csi and x-files, from which it tries to emulate the sexual tension between main protagonists. it is however cheaper, as this is delivered with all the subtlety of an elbow poke in the ribs, but a million million poor factory girls will doubtlessly buy into it, hence the crazy rating this turkey gets.<br /><br />in fact, the lowest common denominator goes a long way in this sad puppy, resulting in titillating sex details from the legion of sidekicks that aim to pass it out as daring and trendy, while the overall tone of the show carries an obvious neo-conservative view on things.<br /><br />story-wise, there's not much here to feast upon, as crimes (that always start out with some gruesome remains) are resolved using non-existent technology while the "squints", lovable but so wrong (the women less than the guys) goes on varied theories, all of them futile as the main character has it all from the start, and once it is established she goes out and then punch the guy, typically a real tough hombre, with a spin kick here and a slapper there. the end.
