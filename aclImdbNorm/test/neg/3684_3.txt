the gate to hell has opened up under moscow. a priest, played by vincent gallo, goes to the city to find a friend who has gone missing in the tunnels under the city in an attempt to find the gateway. wandering around underground he and his colleagues have to deal with the tunnels inhabitants both human and demonic. good idea with a good cast of second tier actors goes nowhere much like the tunnels that are its setting. i've watched this twice now and i still have no idea why this is suppose to be scary when not a heck of a lot happens other then people talk about the evil and we see shadow forms. nothing is clear and honestly i didn't see the point of it all other than provide a pay check for those involved (second billed val kilmer is in a couple of fleeting scenes that don't amount to much other than to allow him to be billed as in the film.) the idea is really good, the performances are fine, the script goes nowhere. take the advice of several of the characters in the film and don't cross the river to see this.
