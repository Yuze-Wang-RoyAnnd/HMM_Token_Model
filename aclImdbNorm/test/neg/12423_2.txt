oh dear! oh dear! oh dear!<br /><br />to think that films such as this were made, and probably enjoyed by thousands at drive-ins really boggles the mind. how innocent we were in those days.<br /><br />to put it bluntly, this film is crap. the hero is so wet you can hear his squishy damp footsteps in every scene. my lord, but he's just one of a whole slew of awful, awful actors that appear in this turkey. no wonder mst3k picked it. the story, such as it is, centres around a stock car driver (who is so incompetent, you really believe it is the actor driving the car) that he gives up and "gets in with the wrong crowd" oooooh! scary stuff. however, the wrong crowd turn out to be the biker equivalent of the three stooges and their "hand-me round" slut of a biker chick. as an example of how lame this whole thing is, the writers obviously wracked their brains to come up with a frightening name for the biker gang - if four people can be called a gang, that is. the result? the gang is called satan's angels! i kid you not.<br /><br />such dire acting and dialogue, along with ridiculous scenes, make for a wonderful beer and chips movie. but otherwise its just the worst kind of rubbish.<br /><br />as i said. once, this may have been considered good. but today it just makes you laugh (and cringe) with every minute that goes by. avoid it except for a good laugh. and make sure you're more than half-drunk too!
