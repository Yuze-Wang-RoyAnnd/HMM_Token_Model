as with many sequels, this one just doesn't have the quality or the impact of the original. the first one belongs up there with the rest of the greats. this one just doesn't cut it. the first film had a magical "good time" feeling about it that is totally missing from this film. we became enamored of all these characters (minus richard dreyfuss) in an age of innocence. now, a few years later, they have changed so much that they are largely different people. while this is what happens in real life, we don't expect this to happen to our favorite film characters! the film doesn't have the humor that the original had, and we were expecting to laugh. what little humor is there is dark. the first film also featured what is probably the greatest soundtrack ever, while this one is good but not even close to the original's. this film is so totally different from the original that it isn't even actually a sequel. i gave it a 4.
