wow, i'd hate to sound opinionated, but anyone that rated this movie any higher than i just have must have an i.q. that reaches unimaginably low depths which reach out beyond time and space and connect at planet "hopper-is-a-retard-for-making-this-movie". wow this movie stank. fred ward's haircut looks sssssssttttttttttuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuupppppiiiddd! i actually considered mailing fred ward some money in compensation for that miserable haircut he owned in this awful film. jodie foster, of course didn't have much to work with but still manages a terrible performance throughout. joe pesci, oh my...joe pesci (who mysteriously is not cast) plays the ultimate stereotypical joe pesci movie character, complete with mob killing and constant use of the f word. you won't believe your eyes. dean stockwell, watching him in this mess made me feel bad for him because i actually thought he was either intoxicated or temporarily retarded throughout the course of the film. jon turturro must have been intoxicated himself when he agreed to be in this, along with vincent price, bob dylan, and charlie sheen. i know what you're thinking, great cast! i know, and it was the worst great cast film i've ever seen. dennis hopper directs and stars, and does equally bad in both areas. how the man could have directed easy rider and then this is far beyond my excellent imagination. his outrageously bad hit-man character accent is beyond the realms of horrendous, and only is equaled by the hilariously bad ending. they (hopper and foster) are the most uninteresting couple i believe that i have ever come across in my exposure to the world of cinema, and you will be cheering for them to lose and then be grandly maddened by the ending. what exactly are the two of them wearing at that action filled conclusion? i don't know, but i do know that if i ever meet dennis hopper, i will make immensely make fun of him for being responsible for this waste of celluloid. join me! ian
