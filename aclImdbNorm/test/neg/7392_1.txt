i went to see "tkia" with high expectations, which might have influence on my opinion on it. i have seen all of the dogme films, and this tkia, is by far the worst. the story intertwines with themes from shakespeare's play: king lear, but never succeeds in capturing the audience and making them care. the directing of the actors is very loose, even for dogme style movies, and results in poor undefinable acting. the story lacks any dynamics whatsoever, and i lost interest very shortly. there are some scenes in the film which are there to shock the viewer, but i don't think they enhanced the story at all. mifunes sidste sang and festen are both dogmefilms that proved to be well directed, and had good storylines, so i shall look forward to better dogmefilms in the future. perhaps aake sandgren's "an invisible man-dogme 6" will prove to lift the quality again. for he is, like vinterberg and s.k. jacobsen a skilled and educated director.
