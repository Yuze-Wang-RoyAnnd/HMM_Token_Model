so unfortunately me and my mate watched this!!! it was showing on a sky channel over here called "zone horror" which basically shows crappy b-movie horror films 24/7. it was a boring friday night, so decided to have a laugh and give this one a look. apart from the atrocious acting, the awful plot, the dire effects, the shoddy camera work and the brain numbing ridiculousness of it all, it was ok, lol!!! in all seriousness it was quite a laugh picking holes in it and laughing at the goofy actors. there is a bit of semi-nudity which perked the movie up a bit, unfortunately it was the "uggo" who got topless as my mate calls her :od if you're bored one evening and this happens to be playing, take a chance, you just might like it :)
