what gives anthony minghella the right to ruin two extraordinary works of fiction?? first, he destroyed the english patient, which was bad enough, but now i discover he's butchered cold mountain - butchered!!!<br /><br />i had such a strange reaction to the english patient. my son and i went to see it the first weekend it was released, and i was so disappointed, but told my son i felt like i needed to read the book. i drove straight to barnes and noble, bought it, read it, and tried to figure out what in the world the critics were talking about when they said minghella had trusted enough in the intelligence of the movie-going public to give them a great film. that is what he most surely did not do. <br /><br />i do not ordinarily read a great deal of fiction, but cold mountain was so highly recommended by friends that i felt compelled to read it. i did not see cold mountain, the movie, when it played in theaters, and it was because of what minghella had done to the english patient. but like a fool, i rented it today, and i'm so upset, i had to vent my frustration and, most of all, my sadness, that someone could have taken this beautiful story and crafted it into something almost as beautiful on the screen, and now they never will. <br /><br />read the book and let the movie rot on the shelf. i will never be taken in by a minghella project again. i think he may be one of the worst directors working today, and i'm tired of the praise hollywood heaps upon his head. it must be that no one in hollywood reads anymore. this movie bears no resemblance to the book, except for the names of the characters. minghella's ego must know no bounds, and if he didn't like the book, then why didn't he write an original screenplay and leave the book alone. even if i hadn't read the book, i would still consider this movie one of the worst i've seen from 2003; and i've seen almost everything that's been released for viewing in the usa.<br /><br />elaine, you aren't going to like this one either.
