woa, talk about awful. do not waste your time. i wish i had seen the other use comments first. <br /><br />i have to admit, i didn't watch the whole thing. it was just too horrible. the worst, sappiest dialogue... i could go on and on. but what really made it unwatchable was the direction. the poor actors. you can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action. if you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance. <br /><br />this would not even be good as a made for tv flick. <br /><br />ouch!
