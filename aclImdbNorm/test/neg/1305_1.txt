this movie follows in the tracks of the riddle for an all star british cast in a downright awful movie! poor cgi effects, poor editing, poor direction, a cast that i hope were well paid as this will be a nail in many a careers coffin.<br /><br />nigel planer should've donned his neil wig once more & gone out with a laugh at least!<br /><br />it was like a particularly long & drawn out episode of "torchwood" but without the camp fake canadian doctor fella...it had the same overly dramatic music though, perpetually repeated, in a vain attempt to drum up some tension.<br /><br />oh the humanity!
