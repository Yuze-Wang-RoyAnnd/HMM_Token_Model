for an indy film this is probably a bit better than a 3 out of 10, but in general it only gets a 3. the effects aren't horrible and at least they have some adults playing adult roles rather than all kids as a lot of indy low budget horror films do. the acting is very wooden, but at least they had a better "display" than some films in the shoestring budget category. it's filmed a lot inside a building rather than a friend's basement. the plot as a whole isn't the worst. it's a resident evil rip off about an evil corporation invading a small town and an outbreak makes people into zombies. i would have liked to have seen some sort of creatures rather than the big baddie just be another "super" zombie. i try not to write spoilers but this review has one so be warned!! spoiler alert!!! not only do some of the cast just seem to shrug past the zombies (the same ones are recycled over and over but at least they have more then 5 people playing them). but one of the plot twists really doesn't fly with me. the deputy who goes inside turns out to be on the evil corporations payroll. he kills one of the other employees in cold blood and then meets with the head bad guy in an office talking about cleaning up the mess. the deputy has just shown us that he is a real bad person too and talks like he can clean it up (meaning kill all the surviving witnesses) no problem. but then 2 seconds later, he is helping them out. there was no real "change of heart" emotion or anything to make me feel that this bad guy went from killing an innocent guy just minutes ago and then talking about taking everyone out no problem to being their savior. there was no incident or anything to make me buy into this. worth watching if you are a fan of low budget flicks, otherwise you will not enjoy this.
