this is a great movie for first time ninjas who are dating. if you're trying to impress some cute little ninjette i would highly recommend playing this masterpiece. its one of those special movies that allows you to miss large sections of it without interfering with the plot.<br /><br />also i was wondering, where does a teal ninja hide? are ninjas color coded like this? is this normal? if i were attacked by one of these yellow or orange ninjas i would die of laughter before succumbing to his sword.<br /><br />and i finished my black star ninja test the other day, it was multiple choice, it went pretty good. i found there were a lot of questions on how to "sneak" around and look evil. its all about the eyebrows and the attitude. <br /><br />basically, the movie could have been better if: 1. there was no color coded ninjas (or the color coded ninjas could combine into a super ninja). 2. joe died in the first two minutes and patricia had to avenge him 3. miscellaneous monkeys were scattered throughout the file 4. patricia didn't talk and patricia was replaced with another character 6. the french guy was also a black star ninja 7. chris tucker, whoopi golderg, and chris rock were added as "comic" relief 8. ninja strengths came from miticlorians.
