this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. it's supposed to be a remake or update of "the one-armed swordsman", by chang cheh. the ham-fisted direction and crappy fight choreography mean that the fight scenes aren't even worth watching. the script tries desperately hard to seem serious, but is full of cliches like, "and i knew then that nothing would ever be the same again..." or "if only i'd known what a heavy price i would have to pay." ugh! and who is that girl who plays sing? someone find her and have her eliminated!! she's awful. if you like chinese martial arts movies, you'd be better off with lau gar leung. this stinks.
