a cryptozoologist captures a mythical chupacabra on a caribbean island.to get it back to civilization he bribes his way onto the cargo bay of a large luxury cruise ship with funny and i think the script intended disastrous results.<br /><br />lets start with the one thing i really did not like about this movie.... the monster really just looked like a guy in a rubber suit.the cgi scenes looked like a different movie. ok thats off my chest now onto all the enjoyable bits about this b movie.<br /><br />the best thing was john rhys-davies(his daughter the eye candy a close second.)john was intermittently funny and suave and no matter what the writers made him say, he said it well.good job given what he had to work with.the cyptozoologist was over the top and fun to watch too,he had some funny bits.the marines all were ok and make good cannon fodder for the monster as did some of the crew and guests.there are a few pretty funny lines in this movie,and a pretty amusing sub plot involving a thief.<br /><br />the special effects are generally med to low and i swear they reused the same blood spray on the wall scene in about four different parts of the movie. i did like the gore of the legless man.really since this movie was not scary at all i feel a bit more gore would have gone along way in improving the watch ability of this movie.<br /><br />all in all if you like b monsters this one is worth a visit.
