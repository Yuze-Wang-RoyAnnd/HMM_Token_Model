from hardly alien sounding lasers, to an elementary school style shuttle crash, "nightbeast" is better classified as a farcical mix of fake blood and bare chest. the almost pornographic style of the film seems to be a failed attempt to recover from a lack of cohesive or effective story. the acting however is not nearly as beastly, many of the young, aspiring, actors admirably showcase a hidden talent. particularly don leifert and jamie zemarel, who shed a well needed shard of light on this otherwise terrible film. nightbeast would have never shown up on set had he known the terrible movie making talent of this small maryland town.
