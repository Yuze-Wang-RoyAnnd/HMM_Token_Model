opie, tom gilson,was my brother,so i went to see the movie and i never looked at it again in all these years. sorry! it was bad. i'm told i have to write 10 lines so i'll put a little trivia in. tom and tuesday weld were to be " introduced " in this picture and tom was told to take tuesday to the premiere but tom said no he was going with joan collins, and he did and because he did only tuesday weld was introduced. i found this very funny back then and still do. the movie, while the concept was a funny one, and the actors in it were impressive but some how it just did'nt come out funny.the continuity was abstract, at best,it was like i was watching 2 different movies at the same time,each running into the other. sorry, bob gilson
