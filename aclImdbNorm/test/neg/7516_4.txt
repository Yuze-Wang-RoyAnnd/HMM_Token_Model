do you know that they want to escavate the moon for real?and in geneve there is the debated project that could lead to make possible time machine?all i can say about this movie that is based on facts about future(at the time of the movie)scientifical projects but real. hope the moon will exist not happen as in the movie. now about the movie itself, i saw the original movie too, and i also read the book. the book i didn't like though, but the movie yes.i totally agree with a previous comment that this movie was depressing,unlike the 60's one.that was very good with force, this one was only a paralled future of what is good movie.
