frank falenczyk: it isn't that i'm sorry i killed them; it's that i'm sorry i killed them badly.<br /><br />wow! talk about a swing and a miss. you have a great cast and a great plot with endless possibilties...how do you f_ck that up?! well, apparently john dahl has found a way. with an atrocious screenplay featuring jokes about as funny as a malaria epidemic and dialogue so painfully dry it makes none of the characters likable, 'you kill me' might be the biggest cinematic failure of 2007. on a positive note, ben kinglsey provides another great performance as the alcoholic polish hit man trying to get clean but the material he has to work with is crap. tea leoni is good as well as is luke wilson, dennis farina, bill pullman, philip baker hall and the rest of the cast. i guess the best way to describe 'you kill me' is a terrible movie with good performances. grade: d+
