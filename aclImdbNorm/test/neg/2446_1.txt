cartoon-like special effects, horrible acting and dialogue, and dry plot! this movie has it all! my friend and i went to blockbuster to find a horrible movie that we could make fun of, but this was just too much. the movie begins with a women and her son vacationing on a made-up island in the bahama region. the women, who just happens to be a doctor/virologist is in the area when a man collapses. he has a strange wound on his arm, and she immediately knows that it is a contagious virus. the story goes on to show startlingly fast romance between the two teenage leads (this is justified by the girl saying "i know it's fast, but it just feels nice." ????) anyway the entire island gets infected with this virus and the cdc is brought in. we are told that within three months, if the virus is not treated and contained that it will spread to the united states and kill millions of people. this information does not stop the cdc from leaving the island to save themselves. thankfully the cure to this horrible virus is found just in time, and the entire island is saved. to celebrate the death of there loved ones, the island people have a smashing party where everyone is dancing, having fun, and forgetting about the horrible epidemic that just occurred.
