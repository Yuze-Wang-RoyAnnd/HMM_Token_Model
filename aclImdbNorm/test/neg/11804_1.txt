the characters are annoying, immature, and flaky....madison being the most annoying of all. ooh...a cold spot! such a dire threat! any ghost in that house would have fled in self-defense! to make a long story short, this movie is boring. seeing a chair flying across a room may be creepy, but that's about as intriguing as it gets. i watched it once and when one of my kids wanted to watch it again, i was tempted to take a baseball bat to the tv set rather than watch this rubbish again. if you want a good horror movie or even a passable comedy, this isn't it! the only good part of the whole thing was "the roach scene" and, by the end of the movie, you ended up feeling sorry for the roach!
