this movie is astonishingly poor. it was on television when i tuned in during an action scene and was chuckling away at the cheesy macho dialogue, waiting for leslie nielsen to appear. it took me a couple of minutes to realise that it wasn't actually a comedy, it was meant to be taken seriously. what has to be remembered is that somebody actually sat down and wrote this movie, and worse still - other people funded it and gave it the green light.<br /><br />rutger hauer obviously doesn't read movie scripts before he signs up, either that or he has some seriously bad debts to pay.<br /><br />strangely, this film is so poor, that you find yourself staring at it, wondering how it actually got funded, and how a tv channel must have paid money for the rights to air it. the dialogue between hero and baddie whilst trying to shoot each other out of the sky is particularly painful, with dialogue sounding like it was generated by a texas intruments "speak & spell".<br /><br />the hollywood money machine at it's worst. funny though.
