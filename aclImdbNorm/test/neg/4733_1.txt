where to start?? i think only three other films have led me to post a review on imdb, and all of those were positive. as for this..?<br /><br />mind-blowingly, hideously, tragically, embarrassingly, catastrophically, stupidly, irritatingly, completely and utterly beyond awful.<br /><br />i am stunned this got made, never mind given a theatrical release. i think i am literally in shock.<br /><br />i'm no "snob". i didn't expect beautiful film-making or intense character-depth, but this is truly beyond a joke. we simply must demand more from the films we see.<br /><br />avoid. like the black death.
