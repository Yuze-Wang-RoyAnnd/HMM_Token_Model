this sequel to the above - and the final entry in the "kharis" series - is slightly more enjoyable on the whole but it's also more contrived (hell, we even get a singing barmaid/hostess!): peter coe is easily the least charismatic of the various egyptian high priests we've seen during the course of these films, and martin kosleck as his henchman seems uninterested in the proceedings; kurt katch, then, is saddled with a ridiculous accent as the man who discovers the newly reincarnated princess ananka: the latter, in the form of virginia christine (later a much-used character actress) gets her most substantial 'role' and, indeed, the sequence of her resurrection from the swamps is a highlight not only of this film but the entire series. unfortunately, here too, chaney has precious little to do as once again the emphasis is on ananka, as i've said; his mummy (to which he returned most often at universal - apart, naturally, from his signature role of the wolf man!) remains, without a doubt, his least memorable monster for the studio.
