if it's an art and essay film, there is not enough art, not to mention essay.<br /><br />if it is a thriller, there is not enough thriller.<br /><br />if it is a teenage drama, there is not enough drama, and as far as teenagers are concerned, there is not enough nofx and too much nino rota.<br /><br />i thought it could be a trailer for tony hawk's forthcoming movie, but there is no tony hawk, so i guess i'be been cheated: it's not tony hawk biopic.<br /><br />if it's an action movie, it lacks explosions, which would have added some interest to it, or at least would have make jump the sleeping ones into their chairs.<br /><br />most of the characters seem to be dead inside, but it's not a zombie movie. in fact, if it is a movie, there is not enough plot. if it is not a movie, it lasts too long to be a music video.<br /><br />if it's a music video, well... it's an album i will not purchase
