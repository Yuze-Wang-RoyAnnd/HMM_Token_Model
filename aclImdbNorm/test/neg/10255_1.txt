i don't really know why so many persons love this movie: maybe it's funny, ok, but it has totally ruined one of the best novels ever written. as the author himself said, this movie has betrayed the book: not only the story is violently cut to about 1/3, but all the symbols, all the complexity, everything is lost in a very 80's-fashioned fantasy/adventure film for kids. today we have effects, directors, a new attention to books: i hope that someone (tim burton, peter jackson, hayao miyazaki...) someday will direct the real neverending story. a great dead writer, a wonderful book and many literature lovers deserve it.
