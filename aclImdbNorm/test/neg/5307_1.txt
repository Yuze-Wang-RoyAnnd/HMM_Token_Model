sometimes when i hear an a-list cast will be bunched up together for 2 hours in a movie i hope, and pray that it is good, not for the sake of my 10 bucks or 2 hours, but for the sake of these actors' careers. in the case of "be cool", everything went to waste.<br /><br />in the beginning of the film john travolta (aka chili palmer) and a music executive played by james woods are driving in a car talking about movie sequels, and how most aren't good. if you look passed the fact that this scene was shot the same way quentin tarrantino filmed his car scene in "pulp fiction", and listen to the dialogue you can't help but ponder whether this is 1) a disclaimer to the audience that this movie is going to suck, or 2) an attempt to get the audience laughing at the sheer humor of 2 people talking about sequels in a sequel. oh the irony! (in case you were wondering, choice 1 is correct.) the cool and slick chili palmer from the first and good film "get shorty" is revived to play a mobster gone music business pro. he steals a young hot singer (christina milian) from her ghetto pimped out jewish manager (vince vaughn), and turns her into a singing sensation. of course a movie about an ex-mobster can never be complete without new mobsters causing havoc. this time around the mobsters of choice are russian, played by american actors who cannot act russian if my entire family hit them upside the head with their russian bare hands.<br /><br />as a russian i wasn't so much offended by the way this film portrayed russians, but instead as a writer i was more offended by the horrible dialogue. this film tried too hard to get the audience to laugh. it turned potentially good lines into a redundancy. the russian, black, and gay jokes were the same ones only reworded a couple of hundred times. after calling the rock's character a f***** (he plays a gay bodyguard to vince vaughn), and cedric the entertainerer's character a n***** (he played a black rapper with an entourage who threaten those who don't play his tracks with guns) i wanted to walk out of the movie theater, because it was painful to sit through. if this was "get shorty" none of this would've even needed to be in the film to build up drama, or a really bad laugh.<br /><br />what lacked in this film that didn't in "get shorty" was chili's hot spicey attitude. he's a completely different person in this sequel. for one thing the old chili would've had more dialogue. john travolta doesn't have more than 20 speaking lines in "be cool", because he is out staged by the repetitive lines, and the hundred and two cameo appearances by the most random celebrities. i won't ruin the shock by revealing all of the cameos for those who actually plan to see this movie (please don't!!!), but i will say that it will forever amaze me that these people agreed to be in a film of such inanity.<br /><br />what was even more stupid was the very lame dance sequence with travolta and uma thurman (she plays the widower of james woods who luckily gets killed in the first 10 minutes of the movie). tarrantino never made pulp fiction for an idiot like the director of "be cool" to mess around with. this dance number was boring, long, and just plain throbbing. the black eyed peas playing in the club with a total of 10 people didn't make the scene any memorable.<br /><br />there were so many plot holes that i left the theater asking myself why?! everything about this film was a big question mark. i just didn't understand the point to anything. i couldn't even explain to you why the russians were after everyone, or why this film was ever made, because i'm baffled. all i took out of this movie was that everyone in l.a. has a sidekick, and the only way this movie was probably funded was through all of the advertisements by diet coke, yahoo!, honda insight hybrid, t-mobile, trimspa (even the spokeswoman herself is in the movie) and the bad screenwriters guild. plot holes, stupid dialogue, too many random cameos, horrible acting (even by the pros), and a not-so-entertaining attempt to mimic "pulp fiction" makes this film the worst movie of 2005, and it's only the third month of the year.
