i saw bogard when it was released in the 70s. it was one of those pictures that received an x rating for violence. we snuck into our local grindhouse, and saw it anyway. pretty good picture. lots of blood from the street fights, although the cheap sound effects for the punches took something away from it. and lots of sex. i remember one of the early scenes when bogard meets this pretty brunette in an apartment she is showing him. without saying a word, he picks her up, puts her in the windowsill and nails her. from what i remember the picture sailed from that point on. so, when i found out bogart is also called black fist and was available on vhs, i ordered it online. i was very disappointed. black fist is bogard edited for television. so many of the scenes i remember were missing, i wondered if indeed, this was the same picture.
