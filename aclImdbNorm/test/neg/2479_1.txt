really, really... what pleases audience (american one!) in this so called show is totally beyond me. what can we learn from these series:<br /><br />1. each casino there is spending about 2-3 billion bucks every year to rent a satellite and enormous quantity of hi tech high resolution cameras for their security team. let fbi bites the dust of them.<br /><br />2. every security employee must have voluptuous breasts, of course natural ones. the tits must be shown all the time otherwise they will lose their job. <br /><br />3. if the employee happens to be a male, he needs to get breasts implanted, then go to step 2. <br /><br />4. only in hollywood one can blatantly rip off other show's ideas then implement them as their own and call all this crap "original" and "art". <br /><br />5. every security with tits bigger than 39d is considered immortal and cannot die.<br /><br />i really would like to have the opportunity to vote with minus values. -10/10 for this one!
