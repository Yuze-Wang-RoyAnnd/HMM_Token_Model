so i was energized during my snakes on a plane weekend, after the movie we craved some more. why not snakes on a train? how bad could it possibly be, its snakes probably killing people on trains. the snakes were supposed to be rattlers. first off me and my buddies thought the snakes were harmless garden snakes and pet snakes with the same cheesy rattling sound clip. we actually sat through the entire thing completely ready to turn it off (we're too lazy to walk over and hit eject). next thing we knew we don't know what the heck was going on but something amazingly funny happens at the end. it's one of those endings that you'll rewind a few times just to squeeze the laughs out, because you suffered for so long. <br /><br />last 10 min a "8", rest of the movie a 2.
