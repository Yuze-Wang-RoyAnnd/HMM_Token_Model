it's a shame that quality actors like baldwin and booth have to succumb to lousy stories and scripts just for the money. but, hey, it's a cruel world...<br /><br />this is just another one of a long line of assassin thrillers that use all the usual narrative twists to try to make it appear more appealing than it is. sure, it has some nice locations, it's a slick production, there is some good camera work and editing, and it's fairly well paced, overall.<br /><br />so, what's the real problem? quite simply, the whole premise is just totally unbelievable. however, instead of spoiling a rotten story for you, i'll let you find out what it's all about, that is, if you can get through it. i managed, but only because i like baldwin and i kept hoping that it would get better.<br /><br />it didn't. and, it had one of the most anti-climactic endings that i've seen for a long time. in fact, maybe never...<br /><br />but, it's harmless fun, i guess, if you've got nothing better to do.
