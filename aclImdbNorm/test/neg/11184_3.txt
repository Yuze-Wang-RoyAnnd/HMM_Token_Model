the price of a dream - and some dreams can be "too" expensive.<br /><br />only having viewed the english-translated version, it is perhaps the reason for a low rating from this viewer.<br /><br />it made the overall film poorer than the story material hinted at...<br /><br />...and other comments seem to suggest the subtitled version would be better.<br /><br />but some plot elements remained unexplained, leaving an unfinished feel.<br /><br />it also leaves the thought "is there a series to follow?".<br /><br />a pity there was no more (at this stage at least, anyway).
