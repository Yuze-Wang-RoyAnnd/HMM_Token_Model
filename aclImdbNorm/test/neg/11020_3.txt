after seeing the tv commercials for this film i marched to my local cinema expecting a lot of laughs. in the end it was one of the longest 90mins i have ever spent. the wog boy really did fail to provide a story line with enough substance to hold my interest and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes didn't fill this void.<br /><br />a scene where the two 'wog boys' dominate the dancefloor of their local nightclub was the only one that impressed me at all. the only character that was worth watching was 'nathan', played by the castle's stephen curry, his struggle with the opposite sex providing most of the few laughs.<br /><br />a word for this flic is boring. save yourself the time and just watch the tv commercial as the only laughs are shown on it.
