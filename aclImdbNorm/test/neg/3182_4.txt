i rented this film because i enjoy watching things with lauren graham in them. well, she was the highlight. everyone else seemed complete separated from the picture. you kept looking around you at those watching the film with you going, what? however she provided some clarity, as she was the only normal character in the picture, which actually isn't saying much for the film. personally it was too far fetched for me. however, i am glad i rented despite the fact i would never want to own it. i still feel that lauren graham proved to be a strong actress and even thought she was not the main character, she seemed to steal the movie. my husband and i were happier and cared more about her character ending up with josh's character than we were about the two main characters.
