i don't know how people can watch this - the only people who enjoy watching this are those who have no feelings and emotions and enjoy watching people die, houses burn down, car crashes, babies die, and cast members being killed off every week. its the most absurd thing on television and i still don't know how it pulls in the ratings. its so depressing. i can imagine the writers sitting down and saying - 'so who shall we kill of next week then' or 'whose house shall we torch in a months time?'<br /><br />its the most depressing, absurd and most stupid thing on tv at the moment, and i cant understand peoples motives for watching this depressing pile of crap anymore
