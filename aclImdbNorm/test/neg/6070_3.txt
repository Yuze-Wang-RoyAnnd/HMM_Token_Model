trite and unoriginal. it's like someone watched immortal beloved and amadeus and decided to mix them together and, in the process, steal other formulaic plot parts from other movies to make another one. as with most historical movies nowadays, there are some inaccuracies as history is manipulated to better suit the story, which is understandable for the most part. for example, during the remaining days of beethoven's life, it was necessary for other people to write down what they needed to say in order for him to understand them. that, of course, would have been a nuisance to have to show on screen. the script, although filled with some quotable lines, doesn't quite capture the feel of that time period and, coupled with some bad acting, seems rather contemporary. diane kruger is nice enough to look at but she still has lots to improve on her craft. ed harris doesn't work for me as beethoven and i mostly blame gary oldman for that. overall, not a very good interpretation of the musical maestro's life. better just find yourself a copy of immortal beloved.<br /><br />http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews
