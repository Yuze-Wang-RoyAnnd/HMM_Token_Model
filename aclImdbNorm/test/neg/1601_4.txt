i've been looking forward to watching "wirey spindell" since having happened across schaffer's "fall". unfortunately, i found "ws" to be a wandering, unengaging, boring bunch of claptrap pieced together with, what apparently is schaeffer's signature, a mix of story, narration, and poetry. the film recounts the sexual and other experiences of a manhattan man about to be married through self-narrated flashbacks. like beads on a string, schaffer apparently has strung together every little sexual life experience, while neglecting to tend to the beauty of the necklace. the result is a disjointed rambling story about a boy growing up which fails to engender empathy and leaves the viewer disconnected, unsatisfied, and with a bad after taste which taints the mechanical feel-good ending. a mediocre indie and a step backward for schaeffer.
