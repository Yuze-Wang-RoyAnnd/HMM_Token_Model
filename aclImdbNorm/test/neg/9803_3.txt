i kept waiting for the film to move me, inspire me, shock me, sadden me in some way but it stirred none of my emotions. it just meandered along to the end. none of the characters seemed very unique or complex, they just seemed like actors reciting their lines. i think it could have been a better movie if the characters expressed more emotion. the only one who did and was believable was the veteran and he probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could. it was a waste of talent, film, their time, and mine. if there is a message or meaning or genius in this story, it certainly is well-hidden or i am very dense, which i doubt.
