as i am a fan of hospital and medical shows, i have found this one gripping and sometimes humorous (especially the scenes with dr whitman) which brings a bit la light relief. however, i was looking forward to the last episode because i expected that the bad ones would be punished and the good ones reinstated. instead of that, the hospital management are making even more fools of themselves in an unbelievable manner and it's getting worse and worse for the good ones. you can't help wondering what the unions are doing or doesn't rob, donna and maria know what unions are there for ? besides, never seeing the outside, trees, grass, sunlight is a bit oppressive. anyone understood what the last words were ? i.e. the answer rob lake gave to mrs strawberry's children question "why are you telling us all that?" it was very frustrating not to be able to understand it.
