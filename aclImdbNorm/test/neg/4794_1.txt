this movie is just as bad as it gets. if you like logic (or the lack of it) 'a la national treasure and bad acting as well, then it could be a movie for you.<br /><br />otherwise spend your time in the sun and your money on a beer.<br /><br />actually it looks like a bad produced promo or demo picture to promote the people involved (ie. actors, special effects and so on). accidentially they produce really bad exposing of their lack of talent.<br /><br />in a case like this the film company should be ordered to pay back money to the costumers that are not satisfied with the product.<br /><br />it is really lousy.
