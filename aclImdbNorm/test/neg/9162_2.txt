you know the old saw about a train wreck? the one about how you can't look away? this movie isn't that good. the only reason you're still there is because you brought your kids and you can't leave them alone in the theater. you might catch a nap.<br /><br />tim hill should never work in film again after delivering this awful piece of junk. he manages to take a decent comic actor in jason lee and turn him into a robotic, unsure actor in this production.<br /><br />i didn't have much hope for this movie in the first place, i admit. if it weren't basically the only family film i could take my son to around christmas, my wife and i wouldn't have gone. god, i wish we could go back in time and stop ourselves. i leaned over to my wife about 10 minutes in to tell her what a stinker i thought it was, but she beat me to the punch.<br /><br />i'm not kidding. it's putrid. only david cross's terrific-as-usual work saves this review from being only 1 star.<br /><br />the story is cloying, insulting and stupid, as might be expected for a movie in this genre (although the recent "curious george" was blissfully intelligent and enjoyable). the acting is mostly poor. the decision to "update" the chipmunks songs for today's audience was inadvisable at best and boneheaded at worst. it does not work.<br /><br />the chipmunks of old were clever, mischievous and sly. these chipmunks are dumb, somewhat mean-spirited, obnoxious, and in a surprise, needy to the point of uselessness.<br /><br />either as a retrospect, a tribute, or as a completely new production, this film totally fails. the final straw? my son couldn't wait to leave. spend your money renting curious george instead.
