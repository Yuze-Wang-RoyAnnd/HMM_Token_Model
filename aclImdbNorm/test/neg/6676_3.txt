unlike what one reviewer said this is not a ripoff of magnum force. in that one lieutenant hal holbrook put together his own little squad from academy rookies to dispatch repeat offenders. in extreme justice this operation has the sanction from the higher ups of the lapd. just how far they sanction the exact methods used is open to question. <br /><br />this special investigations squad seems to be quite the haven for the misfits of the lapd, those that have forgotten their first duty is protection and service. which is why scott glenn thinks lou diamond phillips, a detective with more than his share of beefs with internal affairs for excessive use of force, is perfect for the squad.<br /><br />what should have sent him running from phillips is the fact he's got a nice live-in relationship with a reporter, chelsea field. that one certainly threw me in this film, you'd think that lou would be the last guy he'd try to recruit for his team.<br /><br />and what his team is, is a death squad. they target perpetrators follow them and wait to catch them in the act. then it's open season.<br /><br />extreme justice went very overboard in trying to make a point. there sure would have been no harm in waiting for a gang of bank robbers to finish the robbery and taking them down outside. no civilians got hurt when the citizens of coffeyville did that to the daltons. or waiting until three rapists finish the job before moving in. that's what were asked to believe here.<br /><br />and frankly i couldn't buy it. a lot of good players get really wasted in this one.
