for some unknown reason, 7 years ago, i watched this movie with my mother and sister. i don't think i've ever laughed as hard with them before. this movie was sooooo bad. how sequels were produced is beyond me. its been awhile since i last saw this "movie", but the one impression that it has stuck with me over the years has been, "they must have found the script in a dumpster in the backlot of a cheap movie studio, made into a "movie", and decided that it didn't suck enough, and made it worse. i'm pretty sure that they spent all the budget on camera work and the so called "special effects", and then had 13 cents left toward the script and to pay the "actors".
