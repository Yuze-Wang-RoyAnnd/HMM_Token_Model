as a christian, i found this movie to be completely embarrassing. the actors sucked, the writing sucked, the cinematography sucked, and the story was so typical. i couldn't say this is a great witnessing tool, because i'd be too embarrassed to show any of my unsaved friends. hollywood has much better stuff, and that's because they invest the best into it. christians put out sh*tty work and think it's ok because "it's for the lord". in the old testament, people spent huge amounts of money to bring offerings to god. david (or saul.. i don't remember) spent what would be equal to about $50 billion in todays money on building a temple for god. but these days, spending what would appear to be about $30,000 tops on making a movie to "witness" to people with is just pathetic. it's the person, not the product that affects someone. don't waste your time trying to convert your friends with this waste of an hour and a half. if you want to make a positive impact with people, show them movies like the matrix, american beauty, braveheart etc.. movies that have something to say and actually get it into you.
