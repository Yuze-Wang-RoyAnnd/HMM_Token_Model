i saw this movie while surfing through infomercials and late-night 80's sitcoms on tv one night at 2 in the morning. i must say, i didn't expect much, and i didn't get much. although rose mcgowan is hot, her performance and the performance of the rest of the cast was not oscar-worthy, to say the least. this movie has its ups and downs, and does have a nice couple of twists at the end, but in all honesty it was awful. not even a typical slasher movie. no gore, no sex, no nudity, no real violence. just bad acting. i'd give it a 3 out of 10.
