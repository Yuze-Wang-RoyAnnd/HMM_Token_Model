a roger corman rip-off assembled for what appears to be virtually zero budget. all of the special effects were originally used in "battle beyond the stars", and i suspect a fair amount of the props, costumes and sets were re-used from other sources as well. the story seems to have been written around these elements, so this isn't really a movie as much as it's a recycling project. third-rate "star wars" junk wasn't needed then or now.
