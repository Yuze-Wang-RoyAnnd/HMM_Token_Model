i love old "monster movies" for the pure camp value. this one does not disappoint if you find that sort of thing amusing.<br /><br />the acting is pure 1950s stilted crap. you do get used to it when you've seen enough of these... the dialogue is very silly and ultimately forgettable. you're just there for the giant bird.<br /><br />the "science" in this movie is hilarious. a monstrous otherworldly avian that can manipulate anti-matter... intent on wreaking havoc and eating people... an alien who has come to earth to nest. some of the best scenes in the movie (that don't have the bird in them) include the "scientists" explaining what is going on.<br /><br />a lot has been said about the ridiculous bird marionette. it looks like a new baby bird... bald and ugly with ruffled feathers. it even caws like a hungry, angry fledgling. however, the bird scared the crap out of my three year old, who had big scary bird nightmares for the evening. it's a bit creepy.<br /><br />i was very sad about the scene where they shoot the egg. (somehow the egg is not protected by an antimatter shield.) but i'm a bird lover, what can i say?
