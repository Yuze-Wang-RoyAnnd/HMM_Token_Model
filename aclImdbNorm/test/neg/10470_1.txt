bone eater is set in a small desert town in alabama where property developer dick krantz (jim storm) is financing the building of a huge resort. late one night three of his workers riley (timothy starks), hansen (adrian alvarado) & miller (paul rae) are digging foundations in the desert when they unearth what looks like a tomahawk axe, unfortunately for them an ancient native american demon called the bone eater comes along & kills them. local sheriff steve evans (bruce boxleitner) soon has krantz breathing down his neck as the construction of his resort grinds to a halt, sheriff evans also has to deal with the bone eater demon as it kills anyone it comes across...<br /><br />you know i consider myself a fairly big fan of the horror & sci-fi genre, i certainly don't think my opinion is worth more than anyone else's (unlike many here on the imdb...) but please believe me when i say that bone eater is the worst sci-fi channel 'creature feature' i have ever seen & it's up against some damned strong competition. as a horror & sci-fi fan there are two names that when involved with a film send shudders down my spine in anticipation of how bad it will turn out, those names are jesus 'i have no talent' franco who had nothing to do with bone eater & jim wynorski who directed the absolute disaster that is bone eater. in fact bone eater is so bad wynorski hid under the pseudonym bob robertson, when a director as bad as wynorski hides under a pseudonym you know the film must be bad. where do i even start? bone eater is quite simply the worst film i have seen this year & is so bad it's untrue, the story is awful, the script is sloppy (at one point sheriff evans tells kia to meet him at the hospital but when they meet there later he acts surprised & says 'what are you doing here?', at one point sheriff evans triumphantly claims that we are in the twentieth century & that ancient native american demons are nonsense although actually we are in the twenty first century now, there's a part when a woman tells in flashback the story where three men awaken the bone eater & it kills them but since it killed all three of them how did anyone else know about it for it to be passed down in legend?) & at times it gets more than a little bit embarrassing. the character's are horrible clich'es, the small town sheriff who saves the day, his daughter becomes involved which adds some personal motivation & as for the native americans there's an old wise man, a young hot head who hates 'white man' & a young woman who is the voice of reason between the two who have names like storm cloud & black hawk. the film is as boring as hell, nothing happens, the story is awful, it's full of plot holes & lapses in any sort of logic, the set-pieces are terrible, there's no horror or gore or suspense or mystery & bone eater is just the sort of film that makes you lose the will to live.<br /><br />bone eater has some of the worst cgi computer effects i've seen in a while, from the daft looking stiff moving bone eater creature itself which is just a selection of bones magically held together to a motorbike jumping a large gap to an awful cgi truck crashing over the edge of a cliff to a van being tossed to one side by the bone eater. whenever the bone eater needs to get some speed up he causes a large horse to form from the sand & dust & rides it! in principal this is actually quite a neat idea but it looks awful & the scenes even have cheesy cowboy music on the soundtrack! there is one pointless scene at the end when sheriff evans cuts his own arm (why?) & it bleeds but apart from that there isn't a single drop of blood in the thing, whenever the bone eater kills someone they usually just disappear in a cloud of dust, boring. the hilariously goofy climatic showdown between sheriff evans & the bone eater has to be seen to be believed, sheriff evans goes native on horseback complete with tribal war paint on his face while the bone eater also rides his dust horse & they have a sort of jousting contest which is just to bad to describe properly.<br /><br />with a supposed budget of about $700,000 bone eater is filmed in a very bland, forgettable & flat way, there's no sense of style here at all. the majority of the film takes place in bright sunlight & if you watch it on a decent telly then the desert scenery is quite nice on occasion. there are several veteran 'known' actors really slumming it here, boxleitner plays exactly the same role as in the similarly themed but much better 'creature feature' snakehead terror (2004), william katt will obviously put his name to any crap as long as he gets paid while ex star trek man walter koenig must be really desperate to agree to appear in this.<br /><br />bone eater is a truly atrocious 'creature feature', there's really not much more you can say about it other than to steer well clear of it. the worst film ever to appear on the sci-fi channel & that's saying something, isn't it?
