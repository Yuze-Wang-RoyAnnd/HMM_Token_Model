this movie was so awful, so boring, so badly miscast -- it took a lot of work to make what should have been a sure thing into such a travesty. i love lucille ball, but she absolutely stunk in this movie. too old, couldn't sing, sounded like a truck dumping gravel even when not singing -- and the biggest sin of all -- she wasn't funny. even a little. the studio shot themselves in the foot with this one, and for ruining what should have been a fabulous screen version of a fabulous stage musical, some other body parts deserve to have been wounded as well -- or perhaps they were already lacking those parts. that might explain it. but for lucy to think she was right for a part that required singing -- well, that's the saddest thing of all. it's a very good thing to know your limitations. even a legend can't come out of a stinker like this and still smell like a rose.
