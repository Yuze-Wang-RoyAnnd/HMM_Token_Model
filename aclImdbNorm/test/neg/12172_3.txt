dreadful. i hope i can save two hours of your life by warning you away from this. i just finished watching the film, btw.<br /><br />i love good cross genre films. this isn't one of them. show me a sci-fi musical, a dramatic farce, or a religious action flick, i'll watch them all. but you cannot just throw epigrammatic quips at a rambling, camp, schlock-horror fest and draw my applause.<br /><br />i love philosophical films. this isn't one of them. anyone who is amazed at the depths of intellect plumbed in this film hasn't read a good book lately. or ever. the "thought-provoking" dialogue is trite, at best. perhaps it lost something in the translation.<br /><br />i love a good horror-comedy. this isn't one of them. laugh! i thought i'd never start! squirm? only when trying to think of a polite way to phrase my feedback of the film to the friend who recommended it.<br /><br />rupert is incongruously good in the setting of this film, but even he cannot resurrect it. i only wish he had shot the director instead if the zombies.<br /><br />for shame, that the land that gave rise to the inferno should also give rise to this. dante would be spinning in his grave.
