mst3k fodder. it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason. there are some hilarious things in it, such as the mysterious device the bad guy is seen working on for the whole movie, that turns out to be this tiny helicopter that flutters around carrying and firing a machine gun without so much as a wobble, but is brought down by a bag of balloons (the kind they release at political conventions). many other wonderful touches of that sort. stars charlie sheen. there's one scene where he spends five minutes recording a conversation, only to drop the microcassette in the potomac river by accident. if they'd cast emilio estevez in the part that never would've happened.
