**maybe spoilers** **hard to spoil this thing more then it is, but just in case** gee's i don't see how anybody could have liked this re-make!! it was like a "made for t.v" show and still pretty lame for that. lots of fake snow, bad acting by top stars, bad action and that crazy pine forest in detroit. what the heck??!! i didn't really think this would be a great movie but i was hoping to be entertained. nope, we fell asleep half way and had to finish it up the next day. i could have skipped the rest easy(but then i would have missed those great piney woods!) i'm so glad i missed this at the theater! bad enough to have wasted $3.50 at the video store. and i am a lover of cop, action and drama films. this was a very stinky 1 out of 10 stars. give me the original any day!!
