in a sense, this movie did not even compare to the novel. however, it was good to have a visual of what the congo looked like and also the natives if you are not good at visualizing as you read. i would never recommend watching the movie rather than reading the book. i hardly suggest even watching this film, let alone any other films based on this literary work. this movie; and many others, did not fulfill this book. one important part that is missing from the movie is marlow's sense of how government of lack of there in africa was forming an early genocide. also in the movie, marlow and his companions didn't stop and get the note and wood. likewise, kurtz' african mistress knocks marlow out towards the end of the story which has a major influence in the story but was not in the book. in the novel, kurtz died on the ship, however he died in his hut in the movie. the fianc'e's reaction to marlow's interpretation of kurtz' last words also differed. this movie is only effective if you wish to visualize more clearly the novel.
