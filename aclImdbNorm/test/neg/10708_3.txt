this movie is awful beyond belief. it's a low-budget, badly written, piece of pointless garbage. but the saturday afternoon i stumbled across it on tv still sticks in my mind as one of the most entertaining i've ever spent in front of the television. the badness of this movie is epic -- maybe not ed wood epic, but close. the premise is hysterical (men are banned for being too dangerous and imprisoned in -- haw! -- football stadiums), the pseudo-dyke culture is laughably bizarre (there's an underground sex trade with women who dress up like men to service "deviants") and the "last man" of the title is a pitiful reincarnation of rocky from rocky horror picture show. i didn't get to see the end of it, which i have to assume was so dripping with syrupy "what have we all learned from this?" nonsense it would bring on an urge to brush the teeth, but everything in the first two-thirds was so memorably bad, even if the last third turned out to be a pale imitation of the rest, it's still worthwhile for anyone who gets a kick out of campy, stupid, brainless sci-fi b-flicks.
