very interesting to find another reviewer who had the exact same reaction to this movie as i did: it was a heck of a lot better when i was 10 or 11 years old.<br /><br />seeing it more than 30 years later, it's still okay, but it only mildly held my interest. what seemed hugely funny back then was only mildly amusing.<br /><br />also, things that were astonishing to me as a 10-year-old came across as just silly. for example, in one scene trinity is walking along and fires his revolver behind him and kills two men without even looking. in fact, he doesn't even bother to look and see if they're dead, because he knows he hit the mark. um, yeah, right.<br /><br />in addition, a lot of the dialogue sounds quite wooden. sorry, but 35 years later, it hasn't really aged that well.<br /><br />although it's been a long time since i've seen that one as well, probably a better terrence hill film than this one would be my name is nobody.
