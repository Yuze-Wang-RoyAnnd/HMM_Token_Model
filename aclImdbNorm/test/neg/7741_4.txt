i watched the mst3k version of the movie, and this review includes minor spoilers.<br /><br />when i started watching this movie, it looked like it might have promise as a cheesy sci-fi flick, but the more i watched it, the more disappointing it got. the first reason is pretty idiosyncratic - i liked the mousy shy girl with glasses a lot more than the model wanda became by the end of the movie. more deeply, it was the fact that the loss of glasses and change in clothing replaced any actual character growth. instead of growing into a character that could take care of herself, wanda was just as dependent on males to do everything for her as she was at the start of the movie. the acting could have been better (though i got tired of cracks about ireland's voice - they were even in the movie itself! it's not that bad.) the background was okay, but it was a little hokey (aliens = humans with facepaint), and could have used more explanation.<br /><br />maybe it was just that i was interested in the movie itself, but joel and the bots did little for me. the movie might have been better without them at all.<br /><br />overall (for the movie itself, not the mst3k), a 3 out of 10. it was an okay flick, for what it was.
