although the film does have a fairly stylish look for an indie made on a really low budget, that's not what i go to movies for. there wasn't one character i found sympathetic, they all seemed to be absolutely clueless losers. everything they attempt ends badly, it's all too hopeless for me. reviews refer to the puffy chair as a black comedy...comedy? the brother rhett behaves like an escapee from an institution. when josh talks to girl friend emily about his brother, he almost hints at rhett not playing with a full deck. nonetheless josh performs a "wedding" for rhett and a woman rhett met just a few hours before. there were a few interesting performances by some of the characters encountered on the road. however for me the most telling thing was that people were walking out of the film...and i saw it at a free screening.
