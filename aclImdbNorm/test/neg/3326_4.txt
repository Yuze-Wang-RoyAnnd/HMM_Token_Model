i thought this movie was too absurd for me to finish watching it. the premise was too silly and predictable. i didn't make it far into the movie.<br /><br />let me see. she is obviously older than the cabbie (unless she is a lot younger than she looks). he is black and she is white. she makes more money than him (he is only a cabbie). that's 3 of society's most statistically failed unions all rolled up in one and we are supposed to pretend they have a chance in hell. she would be better off marrying the guy she doesn't love.<br /><br />i only watched it partially because i love mjw as an actor. his acting was superb. hers, meh! it was ok but the premise is too silly. didn't see the end. couldn't make it there so i don't know if it ended differently from the way i predicted the ending would be. i can't imagine any black woman liking this movie. there is something sickening about watching a black man catering to a white woman like that. and an old one at that. please! not in the real world!
