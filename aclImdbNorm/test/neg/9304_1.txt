this is the worst movie of all-time, no doubt, and schindler's list, did in fact have more laughs. this, not only, tells you how unfunny this movie is and how great sl is, considering it's heartbreaking and contains 1 laugh. i wish i could meet "yahoo serious" so i could personally throttle him, for this and all the other very, very, very bad movies he's ever been in. there is also very few things to say about australia, seeing as they like this stupid fruit. don't get me wrong people (mel gibson) from australia are great, they brought us mad max. it makes me very nauseous that people like this garbage, (a review i just read said it was, "very funny," sickening, isn't it). i, personally will be boycotting this movie and will start a petition online to ban and burn all yahoo serious' movies for being so, and i emphasize this, so retarded.<br /><br />these are just my personal thoughts, no doubting they are shared by everybody who has seen this movie.<br /><br />note: if you are forced to watch this movie, clockwork orange style, call me to commit euthanasia on you for free.
