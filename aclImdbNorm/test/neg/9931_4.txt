i have read the 28 most recent comments by various people regarding this movie and was surprised that no one mentioned the fact that the first victim, shown on the bed with the "missing eyelids", as the camera pans up and away from her face, blinks! yes, blinks! i recorded it as it came on hbo this past weekend and when i saw this i literally had to replay it several times, focusing on one eye at a time to make sure that i was not seeing things! of course, after that, it was hard to take the movie seriously although there were a few interesting and intense scenes with julian sands. very disappointed and give it a 4 mostly due to the fact that the 1st victim blinks in one of the last frames as the camera pulls away from the body/face. too bad.
