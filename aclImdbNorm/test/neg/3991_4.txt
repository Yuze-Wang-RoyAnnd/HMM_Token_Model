i have a lot of respect for mr. argento's work, but this film lacks many of the qualities that make his films really unique. the opening to the film is great, and sets you up for the possibility of a really scary horror film. what occurs for the rest of the film lacks structure or purpose and does not build into much. there are some good performances, though, and a lot of great atmosphere. the end of the film is weak considering everything this builds up to. where there should be some grand climax of huge proportions you instead get a very typical conclusion that too many other bad horror movies use, making it feel like they just needed to wrap it up. a couple of scenes are very memorable for their imagery, but in the end the film does not gel to make a really good movie. unless you feel you must see everything this director made i suggest passing on this one...
