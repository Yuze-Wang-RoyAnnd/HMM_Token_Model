the worst thing i have ever watch.<br /><br />the movie is pure trash. all the things is bad on this movie. the direction, screenplay, arts, cinematography, cast or anything else.<br /><br />may i say more?<br /><br />the main character is an boy. it has to have 20 years of age approximately, but the actor who plays the role looks like 30 years old, in addition he is an very bad actor.<br /><br />the editing tries to save it, but with that very bad material in hands they can't do miracles.<br /><br />as i said, the cast is poor, the text is poor, that it doesn't help the actors.<br /><br />i learned how to "do not" make a movie.
