i have not seen such a stupid,dumb movie since quite a while. it absolutely has no logic, no horror- doesn't scare you, no suspense, not thrilling.. i mean i didn't find even one part of the movie appealing..<br /><br />i don't know what they were thinking when they made the movie.. you watch the whole movie to find out that, there is a plant that can walk around, drag human dead bodies and eat human flesh. not just that but it can also talk i.e. imitate sounds, like a cellphone ringing or human talking... so its like, the plant makes the noise of a cell phone ringing, so they go after the cellphone and find out its a plant... how intelligent of the plant to setup an ambush. <br /><br />this clearly is the creativity level of a primary school kid... bad!!!
