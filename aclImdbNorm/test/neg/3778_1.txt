in the past 5 years i have rented some bad movies...completely on purpose. see i aspire to be a movie reviewer, and as we all know there are horrible movies released every year. anyway, about 3 months ago i rented this one. i watched it all the way through...and cried profusely. this is one of those movies that is so freakin bad it makes you want to puke. it actually put a sick feeling in my stomach. i've seen lots of bad movies (mystery science theater 3000 anyone?) but this one takes the cake. the plot was hard to follow, the lighting horrible and the sounds almost inaudible. if there was a negative rating on the scale here this movie would be at -11 for me. this may seem odd, but i highly recommend it. it's something you have to see for yourself...but don't say i didn't warn you. i don't think this review could get any more precise so i'm done now.<br /><br />
