cops logan alexander and debbie rochon escort five black juvenile delinquents cross country and end up stranded out in the sticks when their van breaks down. after a deadly run-in with a racist, white trash bitch with a shotgun (played by the director), the survivors take refuge in the house of a blind voodoo priestess. one of the teens senselessly uses a spell to call up killjoy, who finally shows up about midway through this bore in a subpar make-up job and bigger, greasier 'fro that looks like it could slide off his head at any moment. he then proceeds to kill off the stupid characters while spouting some of the worst one-liners heard since hee haw was canceled.<br /><br />the acting from the "teens" is terrible, the dialogue even worse, the fx stink and it looks a lot cheaper than the first film. although i enjoyed him in his earlier troma films, trent haaga (trying to imitate jim carrey here) is awful and no match for the hyperactive overemoting of angel vargas in killjoy 1 (which at least had a few dumb laughs).<br /><br />yet another nail in the coffin for full moon studios, whose reputation as a fun direct-to-vid franchise has completely vanished since the trancers/puppet master days.
