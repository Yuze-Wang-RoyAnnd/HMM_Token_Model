this series is formulaic and boring. the episodes are the same thing every week, simply with slightly varied settings. some purely evil character does some dastardly deed, walker goes after him, and it ends in a karate match. the villains are super-clich'e super-stereotypical evil villains, the good guys are all pure, honest and saintly, and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic. after about 2 episodes, the show becomes totally unwatchable by all but the least discerning fans. certainly not norris's best work. his other work may be clich'e but it usually does not drag on for weeks. if you enjoy formulaic,boring, repetitive clich'ed snooze-fests, then this is for you.
