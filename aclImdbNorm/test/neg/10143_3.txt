does anyone else think that "reba" is basically a ripoff of "roseanne"? just look at the characters from the two families, connors (roseanne) and harts (reba) ; the blonde bombshell elder daughter (becky connor and cheyenne hart) who's married to a moron (mark healy and van montgomery), the sarcastic brunette younger daughter (darlene connor and kyra hart), the little brother (dj connor and jake hart), and the quirky relative (jackie connor and barbara-jean booker hart). <br /><br />and then, of course, there is the biggest similarity, reba hart and roseanne connor. "reba" tried to copy the sarcastic and tough-love style mom without giving her the same lovable qualities as roseanne had. or, perhaps, they made her *too* lovable, for reba hart seems to waver between being mean and scary (hence van's line to his wife cheyenne "i'm not afraid of you, i'm afraid of your mother!") and being sweet and caring with little transition in between. roseanne at least managed to get it across that she was being cruel to be kind, since she was always mean and sarcastic and, whenever she tried to open up, it was hard for her. as inconsistent as reba's character is, it's hard for her to be believable. <br /><br />but even if the characters weren't completely ripped off of "roseanne", nothing could've saved the show from being sub-par in the plot area. the writers try to give the show substance but they really can't lay off the corny jokes long enough to give any impact. and you'd better believe the jokes are corny; it's as if they were written by a twelve-year-old who thinks that any joke is hilarious. while occasionally they come out with something that's funny (i don't pretend that i didn't laugh at a few episodes) these gems are too few and far between to make "reba" witty. <br /><br />overall, "reba" is a very mediocre show with obvious ripoffs of "roseanne", sub-par plots and sub-sub-par humor, and (let's face it) terrible acting. the show might be a bit better, actually, if they replaced all the actors, especially reba herself, who is more community- theater quality than prime-time sitcom quality. <br /><br />i give it a 3 out of 10 just to be fair to the good jokes that make it in.
