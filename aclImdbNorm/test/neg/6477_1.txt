i guess there are two ways to make a movie with kids as the intended audience. you can either say to yourself a) "let's make a movie that kids today will love!" or b) "let's make a movie that i would have loved when i was a kid!" the second approach explains why steven spielberg often make movies that appeal to a younger audience. prime examples are e.t., the goonies or indiana jones. that darn cat is an example of the first approach. you see these flat, unbelievable characters saying things that is supposed to be funny but isn't. the plot itself is enough for a ten minute short, but instead it goes on and on. and although i'm not a kid, i don't quite understand what in this movie is supposed to be fun for kids? the clumsy cops chased by a dog, the old lady with a tweety bird or christina ricci's sarcastic oneliners? one actor showed a spark of talent with his very acrobatic humour: doug e. doug playing the fbi agent.
