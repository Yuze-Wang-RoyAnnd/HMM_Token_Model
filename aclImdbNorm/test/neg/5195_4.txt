had i known to what i was submitting myself, i would have fled from the theater. the film is dreadful, in the literal sense of the word. despite striking images, intriguing locales, and a subject matter that might have been fascinating, the film is dead.<br /><br />i was unfamiliar with this period of greek history, and prepared to experience a great film. the filmmakers's hand is heavy. it is not enough to see a train going by; we must watch it from afar, we must watch it car by car, we must see the smoke, we must see it slow down, and we must see it stop. the director's approach is didactic. likewise, the characters that he creates never develop, they never change. they are so stereotypic that we wonder, are they meant to be everyman? everygirl? everyoldmusician? is there some point to this allegory? it is the most pretentious film that i have seen in a long while.
