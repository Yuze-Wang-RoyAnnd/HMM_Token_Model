watching showtime i got the impression that the producers got the idea to put robert deniro and eddie murphy just for the sake of having a film that co-starred the two of them. other than that i can't think of a reason to justify the film's existence. not that it isn't amusing in spots, it certainly is, but the concept is so completely ludicrous that the laughs are somewhat muted.<br /><br />the thing that really got me was eddie murphy's character. i can't seem to wrap my mind around the concept of someone being a police officer as strictly a day job. when i was working person at new york state crime victims board i had to deal with all kinds of cops and they ran the gamut between the really dedicated and some real slugs, but i can't think of one who thought that this was just something i do until i get my career going in an area far afield. i mean, can you really see eddie murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real police academy, not the screen version, just to get a day job?<br /><br />anyway deniro is your basic hard working detective who's on the trail of a major gun dealer. he's undercover and murphy is part of his backup. so what does the showboating murphy do, he calls a reality based tv series like cops to film the action. <br /><br />so deniro's bust gets blown sky high, but the producer of the show gets some good footage of murphy and deniro and decides on a new reality based television series. so these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working deniro's case with all the tv cameras around.<br /><br />eddie murphy's a funny guy, i loved him in beverly hills cop and in the doctor doolittle movies, but he's done better things than showtime and robert deniro certainly has. <br /><br />i guess murphy wanted a chance to work with deniro and deniro must have gotten one hefty paycheck to do this film.
