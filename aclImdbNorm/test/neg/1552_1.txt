i only rented this stinker because of its relatively high ratings. it totally sucked! i cannot imagine how anyone would think this a good movie - even an ok movie. none of the characters had any redeeming qualities of any kind. to varying degrees they were each selfish and mean-spirited - or abused and damaged personalities who hadn't a clue about the spirit of christmas (when this takes place!) i know canadians and like them - but i cannot think that even they would think this a good movie. i'd rather a sharp stick in the eye than watch this offensive movie again. a colossal waste of time and money. do not believe the person who wrote the opinion that it was "worth watching." this person probably would enjoy having a dentist drill their teeth without anesthesia, too. don't mean to be unkind but for the life of me i cannot imagine what this person was thinking. unless they had ulterior motives. maybe s/he was the director or the producer. if so, i'd like to ask them to give me back my money. if your money is important to you - save it instead of renting this piece of drek - or rent something (anything!) else. i'm running out of good reasons not to rent this film. if i were canadian i'd be ashamed that it's supposed to be a favorite canadian flick. if so, i would say that those who think so are definitely in need of great quantities of powerful drugs. yeck!
