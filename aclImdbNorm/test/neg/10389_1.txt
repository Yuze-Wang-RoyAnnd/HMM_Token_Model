even worse then the incredibly boring "the exorcism of emily rose". it started off decently, and right up until the mom said to the dad, "see i knew she was possessed", in an i told you so voice. it was a terrible line, spoken badly and it foreshadowed the rapid demise of this amazingly bad movie. every family member has an issue from the past with the priest. the dad starts to accuse everyone of either liking his wife, or actually having an affair with her, culminating with him killing his buddy, then himself in the obvious instant lucidity after he realizes his friend hadn't slept with his wife after all. people are dying, others are coming under possession, and by this point most viewers don't even care anymore. except for their employee miguel, none of the characters in this movie was actually likable, making it hard to care, about any of them. the acting was terrible and the writing even worse. glad i saw it for free; although i feel that for a movie this bad someone owes me money for the time i lost.
