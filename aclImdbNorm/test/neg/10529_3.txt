i really tried to like this film about a doctor who has the possibility of a new life with a young woman if he can comes to terms with the death of his wife. i suppose this was to play like a quirky light romantic comedy but the theme is a little uncomfortable for me.<br /><br />but putting that aside, i found the dialog was too much like a stage play despite being based on a novel and also,the mediocre acting was embarrassing to watch especially by the young lead vincent spano.<br /><br />i have been sort of trying to catch up on all the eighties movies i missed during that decade. it has been my pet peeve that eighties nostalgia buffs seem to focus on the same core canon of films usually featuring the brat pack actors and actresses and neglecting the other films like creator that have fallen through the cracks. but in the case of this feature i have to say i can understand it. not all of these eighties films were magical and creator is proof of this.
