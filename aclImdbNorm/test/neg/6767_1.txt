the rap, the book this movie was 'based' on was one of the most difficult books i've ever read. yet i could not put it down. raunchy, crude, foul, lewd...you name it, it had it. it also had some of the best characterizations of any novel i've ever read.<br /><br />well, as for the flick...it was deplorable. i mean, tim mcintire as wasco? wasco was the baddest mutha...talking 'bout wasco...mcintire as wasco is like casting tim conway as charles manson.<br /><br />what happened to the main character in the book? little arv. he doesn't even exist in the movie...fast walking was not the main dude in the book. why even name credit this thing with the rap? none of the spirit, atmosphere, nastiness, or drama of the book was captured in this movie.<br /><br />for me it was not only a disappointment, but a total waste of time and celluloid.
