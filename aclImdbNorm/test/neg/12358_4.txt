i caught this film -- under the title of "what lies above" -- on lifetime movie network last night, and just had to comment on it. designed as a resourceful-woman-in-peril, action adventure yarn, it is so unintentionally funny (thanks in large part to marc singer's scenery-chewing hammy performance)that i thought i was watching a cross between "cliffhanger" and "home alone 5." heroine nicole eggert makes her devious but dumb as dirt male pursuers look like the three stooges succumbing to her ridiculous makeshift booby traps (somehow she manages to devise a swinging battering ram with rope and a log in a matter of minutes, which temporarily takes out one of the knuckleheads who want to kill her). worth watching for a hearty laugh.
