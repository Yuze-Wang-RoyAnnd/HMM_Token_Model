the messengers is a bad,generic and boring ''horror'' movie.the film has got a big problem:it does not scare.the performances and the screenplay are totally stupid.it uses old tricks for scaring and all the supernatural events make laugh.i would not call the messengers as a bad movie...i would call it an accidental comedy because it's so bad that makes laugh.the only good thing about this movie is that it's short,so this crap will not stay with us for so long.there are a lot of masterpieces of horror genre which count with a low budget(like subject two,lucky or may)which are sadly ignored,while this crap is all a success in the box office.so,i do not recommend this weak and pathetic horror film which is called the messengers.
