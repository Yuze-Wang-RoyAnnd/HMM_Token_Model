look, i've practically lost all hope in nickelodeon after watching their newest "hit," the naked brothers band show, and "icarly" is no exception! if you haven't noticed, icarly is now the #1 hit tween sitcom on television right now! after hearing this, i decided to watch a few episodes myself to see what the hype was about! i have one word to describe this show in general..."effortless!!!" i cannot believe that dan schneider would go this low and make something this crappy!!! it's horrible!!! let me give you the details...<br /><br />the icarly cast starts out with a girl by the name of carly shay, played by miranda cosgrove! carly, unfortunately throughout the episodes, doesn't really have a personality so to speak of! i guess she's supposed to be the average girl in the show!(because a lot of people have an army veteran for a dad, an artist for a brother, and a popular teen web show taped and produced with thousands of dollars of equipment!) and to say the most about miranda, her acting is pathetic!!! she sounds like a 3 year old girl with tourette's syndrome on a sugar-high half the time! <br /><br />next, we have sam puckett(good god where do they get these names!?) played by jennette mccurdy! sam is the "co-host" of carly's web show!(wait a minute, if sam hosts the show with carly, shouldn't the show be called "icarly and sam?" i bet sam feels like she's been ripped off!)sam is supposed to be the bully in the cast!(yeah, because every girl bully wears girly skin-tight shirts and pants with blonde hair extentions!) she also, i think, is supposed to be a tomboy, too. i would find this a little funny, but it's her clich'e puns that ruin it!!! the "give me a bucket of fried chicken" pun is overused way too much!!! give this girl a script!!!! and give her a coffee because, don't get me wrong jennette's acting is okay, but, throughout half the episodes, she looks like she's about ready to fall asleep!!! <br /><br />next we have freddie benson, played by nathan kress. freddie is the technical producer for carly and sam's show! there's not much to say about freddie other than the fact that he's a techno geek and has a crush on carly, which never works out! here we go again with the clich'es!!! does it not stop!!!? nathan's acting is also okay, but seems to get excessive sometimes! he's too boring!!! <br /><br />lastly, and my most favorite, we have spencer shay, played by jerry trainor! let me make this perfectly clear; if it weren't for him, this dirt cluster of a show would be mud!!! spencer is the one who keeps the show alive! spencer is the older brother of carly! if you had a little 5 year old who was both on a caffeine high and constipated, you would have this character summed up! spencer also earns money from being an artist!(hmmm... i wonder...) you would think that a professional artist would make promising sculptures... yeah, i just love sarcasm! his art is pretty much utter crap!!!! i mean, what kind of sculpture name is "merry sniffmus!!?" what!!? that's about as much creativity as a hillary clinton speech on drugs!!!! it's stupid!!!! <br /><br />the plot settings and morals are effortless bags of poop!!!! these shows are now telling kids that stealing, lying, and being an asshole to your parents is a good thing!!! if these are the kinds of awful crappy shows that they're throwing at kids these days, then i don't want to take part in watching any of them!!!! this is biggest piece of crap i've ever watched on tv! bar none!!! nickelodeon, "i'm through with you!!!!" end of story!!!! 1/10
