what a waste of a great cast. figured i'd check it out because it looked like a good stoner comedy with a lot of fairly well-known actors. what it turned out to be was a pointless collection of boring intertwining stories about several characters with minimal connections with each other. characters who start off looking like decent people but end up with not a single likable or interesting characteristic among them. calling it a comedy was a stretch as well...the only thing that made me chuckle was jack black's song, which was basically tenacious d. i waited for something big to happen but ended up with nothing more than 97 minutes of my life wasted.
