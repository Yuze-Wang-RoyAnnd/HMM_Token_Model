stay alive has a very similar story to some asian horror films which include technology on the story.some of this asian horror films are one missed call,ringu and pulse.so,the idea of stay alive is very clich'ed and obvious but the filmmakers behind it did not know how to put something new or interesting to the clich'es in stay alive.this film is totally crap.but a very big crap.all the elements of stay alive belong to the worst class of ''horror'' films:shallow characters,nothing of suspense,stupid ''horror'' which makes laugh and light violence.it's easy to note that the ''director'' is incapable to create something original or disturbing.i do not wanna loose more time writing about this pathetic film.i just give you an advice:do not see this film.i really hated it.
