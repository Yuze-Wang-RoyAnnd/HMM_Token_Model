this is not exactly what i would call a mad max film, after seeing road warrior and experiencing the excellence of that film, i felt somewhat disappointed after seeing this. it supposedly started out as some kind of kids in the wilderness film, and was merged with the mad max franchise(bad idea). the casting was not exactly the best, i mean come on tina turner? one of the main problems with this film is that there are no good villains. no wez, no humungus, not even a decent toecutter! nothing really even happens, if you are going to plan on seeing this sub par action flick (can it even be called that?) make sure you see mad max 2 or mad max, or better yet both. another problem with this film is that there are too many people, even the thunderdome battle sequence is dull, max doesn't even kill anyone! the music is bad, the characters are bad (not in the good way) and after seeing this film, it left a very bad taste in my mouth.
