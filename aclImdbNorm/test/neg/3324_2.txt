i should have known when i heard anne rice left the project that the movie would disappoint me. i couldn't have predicted that years after it's release just thinking about the movie still makes me angry. the novels are amazing, and while i understand much gets lost in the translation to screen, this movie was a great big middle finger to her original work. i hope one day someone tries again, the right way, starting with the vampire lestat. they change the roles and looks of major and minor characters alike for no good reason. they destroy lestat's history. the acting of the queen is exaggerated to the point of comedy, but i just can't bring myself to laugh. the charm and allure of the novels just isn't there. the movie is a bad excuse to cram as many musicians and "dark" imagery as possible into one movie, hoping the teeny goths of america would lap it up. part of the appeal of the first movie, of louis' story, is that he is caught between his humanity and his curse. lestat is supposed to take over and display the magic and excitement of the vampire world. thank goodness i read the books first, or i'd have never touched them after this movie.
