i must say i was really excited about this film before renting it as it was an adam sandler "happy madison" production and i am usually attracted to that type of silly humour.<br /><br />there were a few funny moments at the beginning of the film, but this film lacked everything that makes a good movie. i realize that many filmsthat are not realistic can still be quite funny, but this film was unrealistic and not funny at all. the acting was horrible, the cinematography was very poor, the plot made no sense at all. i cannot get over the fact that 3 classy older ladies would even work for such poor writing. overall i was very unimpressed with this film and i do not recommend wasting 5 bucks on renting it.
