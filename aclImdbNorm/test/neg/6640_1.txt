so i turned on hbo which i just got thinking that it would have some quality movies and i saw this. carrot top is so unfunny it's nauseating to watch. i've seen unfunny movies before but i think i find this one so impossible to watch because carrot top seems to think he's hilarious. watching this movie is really like watching a movie designed for 5 year olds with crazy, over the top overreactions replete with ultra stupid jokes that only a 4 year old would appreciate.<br /><br />what is amazing is how some other talented actors actually signed on for this project, such as larry miller and m emmet walsh. if you've ever seen carrot top's absolutely horrible mci commercials (or whatever they were) then this is more of the same, just worse. it's a slapstick fest that is a waste of a high budget that could have done something, saved homeless people... anything but this. i'm not sure it's in the bottom 50 of all time but for the $10 million spent it's a disgrace.
