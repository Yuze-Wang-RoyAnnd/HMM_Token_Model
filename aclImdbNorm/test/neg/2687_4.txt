i'm new to argento's work, and if this and suspiria are any indication, then argento is much more a filmmaker of experience than story. in his films, characters are placed in grueling and mesmerizing horror contexts that literally saturate the logic of the world around them. the camera literally flows gracefully through sets as the characters run, stumble, and choke their way to an eventual horrifying conclusion. it worked, really well, in suspiria. for some reason it didn't work here.<br /><br />the problem i see with this movie is that even though the protagonist "gets help" by way of contacting the police and asking for help from her friends, it still feels as if she refuses to "get help" in terms of actually trying to find a solution to her problem. the entrapment in this film is that she's trapped in the killer's little game, one that she could easily get out of by... not setting herself up so easily? in a weird way it seems like the character wants the torture the killer gives her, which in a way is the point and could have worked except that the whole psychology of it is thrown about mostly due to whatever argento feels like doing.<br /><br />as a loving homage to "the phantom of the opera", it's certainly an interesting and unique take. for all his worth, argento delights in operatic movements as well, which well highlights the action. it just doesn't make much sense, especially as it delves further into a completely useless ending (yes, i know it's a reference to harris' novel "red dragon". no, it didn't work). why the character should go from one horrifying experience of entrapment to a willing one with the director is beyond me. it felt almost self-serving on argento's part.<br /><br />overall, a fun experience, and between this and suspiria i'm more than willing to follow up on more argento productions. but this is not a movie i'd want to return to or remember.<br /><br />--polarisdib
