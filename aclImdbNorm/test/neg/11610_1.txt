at my local video rental store, they have a special place for two girls and a guy. it's a long running joke really. the clerk lets people rent it for free. they value their customers too much to let them waste their hard earned money on it.<br /><br />i was extremely surprised to see that people gave this movie a good review. maybe someone can explain it to me. (or maybe the positive comments were jokes? did people involved with the movie write them? perhaps the mother of the director/writer?)<br /><br />maybe i've just seen so many good movies that this one fails in comparison.
