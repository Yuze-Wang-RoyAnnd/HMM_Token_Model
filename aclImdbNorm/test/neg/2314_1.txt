1 hour and 40 minutes of talking--boring talking, and more talking and then some. it is hard for me to grasp how an actress like anne parillaud, who shone superbly in femme fatale, would sign up for such a piece of crap! unbelievable. if you need a nightcap, this movie might help, although i would prefer some nice classical music. unfortunately, i just found out that i have to write 10 lines for my comment to appear--that's almost as unbelievable! so, short and succinct one or two sentence commentaries expressing one's core take on a movie is not enough. geez, people. i made my point and don't to waste your time with more, unnecessary words--as this movie does. wolfgang
