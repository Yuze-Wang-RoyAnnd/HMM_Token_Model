like almost everyone else, i became aware of this turkey on mystery science theater 3000. it easily ranks as one of my favorite mst3k episodes of all time. i really couldn't imagine attempting to watch this film on it's own though.........it's really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really bad.<br /><br />miles o'keeffe stars as ator, a muscle-bound fabio wannabe who lives during the time of cave men. we the viewer are asked to suspend our disbelief in that he knows alchemy and chemistry and can manage to build a complete hang-glider in about 5 minutes. yeah, right! there's also a fairly attractive actress (can't remember her name) who wears a hub-cap as a chest shield. oh, and i can't forget that wacky asian side-kick thong. he had the easiest role in the movie since he doesn't utter one word of dialogue throughout the entire movie. he had to figure out how to make his character interesting without talking.....and he failed miserably.<br /><br />the film isn't watchable in any way and should be only viewed in it's proper mst3k format. if you watch that version, you'll laugh yourself silly!<br /><br />"i'm huge!!!!"<br /><br />rating:1
