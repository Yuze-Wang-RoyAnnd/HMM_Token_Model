this movie is an abortive, stillborn attempt to stitch together several bad movies and make some sort of extra-bad movie. it fails at even this, since there's way too much "plot", and not nearly enough goofy puppets and ridiculous gore. seriously, the puppets are sweet, and the guys in suits crack me up pretty good. the performances are c-grade at best and lame throughout, with special props to the spec-ops guy who spoke some sort of bizarre east coast/venusian dialect that was almost impossible to decipher. not that you really care what he says, as only the curse words are distinct. cinematographically, it's non-offensive, pretty much what you'd expect from low-rent straight-to-video offal (just like the script). the fact that new concorde used footage from the "carnosaur" films is offensive, and quite confusing. for shame, new concorde. for shame. "carnosaur" is one of my favorite terrible movies, and they somehow screwed it up and made it nigh unwatchable. see the "carnosaur" films if you want to see shoestring dinosaur mayhem.<br /><br />i give it one star because i am so fond of the movies it steals from, and also because the scale doesn't have a zero.
