this all looked quite promising. an up-and-coming presidential adviser is framed for a series of murders, as he has been tipped off that a conspiracy is going on within the white house. it stars the excellent donald sutherland among several capable actors. yet very few people have a good word to say about it.<br /><br />the whole thing really needed some depth. you can pick up the idea that the president is being too left-wing with his ideas, and some within the government want him dead to stop those ideas being carried out. conrad appears to simply want the country to be governed his way, rather than the way of the elected leader.<br /><br />however, the action scenes had a few logic holes - the sewers and elevators already mentioned, and the rather haphazard assassination method - and linda hamilton's character is completely uninspired. her 'the president's my father' 'diversion' was ludicrous - that would make the president about 10 when that happened. worse still was her predictable final scene with bishop.<br /><br />they could have made a challenging, inventive political thriller, but either bottled it or failed. they could've gone to town on special effects, but the good ones were wasted. they could have achieved so much more in general. this was barely worth the lb1 it cost me.
