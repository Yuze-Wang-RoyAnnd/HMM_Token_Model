when my mum went down to the video store to rent a film for the night my sister and i learned a lesson, to always company my mum to the video store! in fact the only reason why she chose it was because colin firth was in it and she *cough* thinks he's a good actor!<br /><br />it starts off with some beautiful veiws of africa and then goes down and down and down, and down. after this film i was very surprised that colin firth got as far as he did since this pointless film could destroy any actors career.<br /><br />the story is about a divorced women who's son is trying to matchmake her to a man called matthew fields who he met whilst impressing his friends because of his large house.<br /><br />nimi the divorce does not like matthew at all and is going out with the local vicar who does not like her son john.... and the same with him!<br /><br />i am sorry if you disagree with me and i hope i haven't offended you but to all the people who haven't seen this film, i leave you with one word of warning, don't watch this film!!!!!
