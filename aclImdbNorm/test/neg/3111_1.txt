i bought this movie for about 2,5 dollars at a local flea market. i thought that with the cast present in this movie (ice-t, rob lowe & mario van peebles are all ok), it would be pretty good. boy, was i wrong. this movie annoyed the hell out of me. almost every scene drags on too long. the scene where rob lowe is watching this girl singing and dancing in a bar lasts forever! it was one of the worst scenes i have ever witnessed in a movie. the rest is no picknick either. my guess is when they finished the movie, they only had 30 minutes of film, so they made everything last 3x longer.<br /><br />conclusion: the current 1,9 rating here on imdb is right on the money. this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen. go watch some paint dry for 1,5 hour instead of watching this!<br /><br />if you want to see some better movies made by this director, watch 'mean guns'(with christopher lambert & ice-t) or 'postmortem' (with charlie sheen) instead.
