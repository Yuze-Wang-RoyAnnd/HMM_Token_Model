i just watched this yesterday and wanted to read other peoples scathing comments but found some high marks.<br /><br />what??? this was probably the worst asian horror movie i've seen.<br /><br />*spoilers* there were just so many fundamental problems with the story. a lot of asian horror has the twist of spirits trying to help but just looking scary (with notable exceptions: ringu and ju-on). this is the case here except they aren't scary. a pretty asian woman who looks a little pale isn't scary at all. the "monk" character straight up explains everything as being a perfectly natural cycle of life; nothing scary there either. but the woman just doesn't get it, she would rather kill herself and her baby then let this poor ghost be reincarnated. my friend and i were just laughing when she jumped off the building twice and the ghost waits until after the second time to tell her why she's been following her around. that information would have been nice to know before she started jumping but whatever.<br /><br />*that said i did like a couple of parts right in the middle. first she rides a taxi with a ghost (ghosts ride taxis?) that has a whole lot of extra hair which inexplicably is creepy. right after that at the bus stop, well you need to see it as it's pretty messed up.<br /><br />all in all this movie is a total bomb, i gave it an extra point just for those two scenes above. this is a poor quality asian horror that manages to make ghosts flying into women's wombs almost beautiful while trying to scare you with the same images.
