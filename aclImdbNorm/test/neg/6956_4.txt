on paper this looks a good film . michael caine plays a tough and ruthless boxing promoter who's son is up for a title eliminator . the pity is that when the story is transferred from paper to my television screen it loses a certain everything . i had hoped we'd be seen emulating his definitive role in get carter and as the film progresses it does seem to take on the qualities of a tough gritty revenge thriller but the whole tone of the film jumps around so much you'll be confused as to what genre it's trying to fit in to . for example caine ( who you can't believe in as billy " shiner " simpson , he's simply michael caine ) has a laugh out line as he refers to someone as " hattie jacques " then in a supposedly humorous moment has his henchmen break someone's arm . oh how i laughed . i mean it's supposed to elicit a laugh the way it plays out on screen isn't it ? but these seems at odds with the way the rest of the film plays out <br /><br />obviously director john irvin doesn't know what approach to take with scott cherry's screenplay . irvin isn't a bad director and is well regarded for his war films such as the dogs of war and hamburger hill but he's ill suited to this type of violent drama and one can't help but feel he might have been intimidated somewhat by a living legend like caine . caine does give the impression he's just doing it for the money and the well known faces in supporting roles like landua and cranham are basically just cameos who could be played by anyone
