20 people rated this a 10! that ballot box was stuffed better than a christmas turkey! speaking of turkey's, here's a traditional story hoping to piggy-back on the current poker craze - without success. told entirely in linear flashback, and when i say "told" i mean talked to death, this film never let's a picture suffice when words can be used to exposit.<br /><br />stu unger's childhood fascination with cards and his associations with hoodlums might sound like interesting movie material, but the director manages to suck the life out of them. at no point did i feel the least bit of sympathy for unger, a genius at cards who threw it all away on other forms of gambling at which he was not so proficient. of course, this leads, as we wade through three musical montages, to the inevitable downward spiral of drugs, loss of family, and finally his redemption (sort of). big yawn!
