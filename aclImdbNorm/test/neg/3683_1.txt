the gates of hell opened up and spit out this film, then closed again.<br /><br />watching this movie makes me appreciate other movies i have seen, like all other movies. nothing makes sense in this movie.<br /><br />it would really take too long to mention all the plot problems. in fact, except as a warning, it really isn't worth wasting some of the nearly infinite space available on the internet writing about this film.<br /><br />from now on, i will check imdb before watching any film.<br /><br />hot darn, imdb is forcing me to write more about this film. i guess i should warn you about edison force while i am at it. but if you had to chose between the two, pick edison force.
