many times the description "full of sound and fury signifying nothing" is used and is right on target. unfortunately "code 46" lacks both sound and fury. a bit of fury would have been greatly appreciated. tim robbins character (william) is so lacking in passion that the idea of his falling instantly in love with maria (samantha morton) seems almost absurd. these folks are so passionless that one begins to wonder if perhaps the water supply of this future world has been dosed with thorazine. there is a "brave new world" sort of atmosphere to the film that is helped along by every scene being shot about 2-3 stops overexposed. unfortunately this technique gets tedious and rather hard on the eyes. the cutesy mishmash of languages also grows tedious when there seems to be no apparent reason for its existence. many futuristic, scifi films are criticized for being all flash and no substance. this film has neither flash nor substance. its a code 6 all the way.
