the concept of this movie is unique, however its execution is less than special. when i arrived at the cinema and realised that there were only about 15 people or so in the crowd, i thought i had made a mistake. however the true mistake was realised in shocking detail when the film has ended and i knew that i had wasted two hours of my life.<br /><br />without the cruel recordings of the old man, and the stupidly funny friend, this film would have rated 1 out of ten.<br /><br />this film is special, special because it is probably the worst film ever to be generally released to the public.<br /><br />there is also the issue of whether you could call it a film or just an advertisement for the probably crummy "northwestern".<br /><br />if you are thinking of watching this film for the plot, the humor, the filming, the locations, then don't. on the other hand if you like to experience both ends of the film production spectra then go, just take a book, or a small game or just some novelty item.
