i'm very disappointed. first of all, the german synchronization is bad. maybe in the original version (with subtitles) it would have been better, but the whole movie looks like if the director saw luna papa and black cat white cat and tried to produce something in this style, too. but failed in every aspect. it's an incongruent mixture of a weird unbelievable story and very childish gags. no atmosphere, no life. extremely primitive sex-humor. i voted 2, because 1 is the worst, and the other point for 'sybilla', she's really cute. sorry - i like 'eastern' movies, but this one is really superfluous.
