when i saw on the voting panel that some people had given this film a score of 10 i assumed they were unaware that the score wasn't out of 100. this is a disaster movie in the real meaning of that term. poorly written and weakly directed with so-called actors unable to act, but able to grimace when ordered to. for the first 60 minutes the story appears to be going in one direction, then it changes tack and gets involved in a power fight, with extremely poor special effects. unable to work out an intelligent way for the hero with limited powers to beat the villain with super powers, the "writer" cheats. it is obvious that the father was added to the so-called story-line because it was easier than working out an acceptable denouement. not that the write would even know the word "denouement." some movies go directly to dvd. this one should have gone directly to the dustbin.
