warning! spoiler! this movie is absolute crap. it is not entertainment. i haven't the words to describe the disgust that i felt at the end.<br /><br />this is a badly made movie about the scum of society. during the whole movie i kept waiting for it to get better. it didn't. instead, it just kept getting worse and worse.<br /><br />when i see a movie that is as bad as this one i always try to find at least one good thing to say about it. in this case it proved impossible. i have not one good thing to say about it. how bad did it get? well, here's an example: towards the end dan akroyd smothers and kills vincent d'onofrio while reeves and diaz watch! this is not entertainment!
