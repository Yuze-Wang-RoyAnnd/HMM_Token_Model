from an artistic standpoint, the movie fails to entertain or provide any moral resolution. the plot is hard to follow, if there is one at all. the acting is tough to stomach. the dialogue is cliche and clearly written by somebody who doesn't know english. only the cinematography was worth watching in this movie, although you can still see flaws in the picture.<br /><br />as an asian-american female, the movie angered me because it proved how narrow minded people can be. politically speaking, putting asian women in such disgraceful roles should be outlawed. perpetuating stereotypes of asian prostitutes is not only bad for the self-esteem of asian women, but also to the country as a whole. i feel for the lead actress who played maya and the exploitation she must have faced in playing such a role.<br /><br />as americans, please avoid this movie. art should be used to develop our tolerance and respect for one another, not hold it back.
