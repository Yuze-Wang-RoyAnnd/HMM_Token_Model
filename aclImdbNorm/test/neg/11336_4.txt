this series, made for televisi'on espa~nola (tve) is basically a series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in 1968, primarily as seen through the eyes of the youngest son.<br /><br />based on a background of historical events, such as the may 1968 student uprising in france, the decaying franco regime, the war in viet-nam, the rise of imperialism, and others specifically related to spanish life at that particular moment, one might regard this series as a simple compilation of characteristic foibles which make themselves so apparent in this kind of entertainment.<br /><br />generally treated in a lightweight vein though not lacking in certain moments which might be called dramatic, the series would seem to be aimed at people of around fifty who can rember those times, as, it should be stated, anyone younger either chooses to ignore such happenings or is busily occupied in other things.<br /><br />the best thing that can be said of this series is ana duato's r^ole as mother of three children: she plays the part of the total housewife of the times really well, manifesting that peculiar spanish penchant, especially noticeable among women, of letting all her thinking and her doings be carried forward by the impetus of her heart, without any resorting to the use of the brain. as we say in spain, common sense is one of the least common senses. imanol arias offers very little, apart from not being his usual stereotyped hard policeman as in other television series. indeed, as an actor, he should not be trusted in anything which is not a tv series. his resources are too limited; however, his part as father of the working-class household is not at all bad.<br /><br />not really recommendable for other audiences, even spanish-speakers in latin america: the themes are all too parochially related to a specific spot in contemporary spanish history, such that if the viewer was not living here at that time he will miss most of the references. it is even probable that certain situations which cause a few spanish smiles would not mean anything to other viewers.
