this movie was an embarrassment. ulma thurman looked like she had some kind of disease and john travolta looked like he was walking in his sleep. i was expecting this to be a so-so sequel to get shorty not a half-baked remake of the exact same movie (except that some of the character's have different names and clothes)<br /><br />i would not recommend this to movie to my worst enemy. i feel like i was ripped off and hollywood has once again tricked me into seeing another horrible sequel ( i also suffered through alien vs. predator).<br /><br />the best thing that i can say about this movie is that it has my vote for the worst movie of 2005!
