this extremely bargain-basement blaxploitation/kung-fu hybrid was in my country released by a questionable dvd label that usually speaking just occupies with the transfer of pure crap onto disc, so that wasn't exactly a favorable herald. several other titles were released in the same series, like "the black six", "the black gestapo" and "the black godfather" and judging by all their low ratings and negative reviews none of these belong to the elite of the 70's blaxploitation hype, neither. "tnt jackson" is a pretty lousy film, completely lacking a significant plot but featuring far too many laughable fighting scenes and horrible acting to compensate. apparently roger corman
