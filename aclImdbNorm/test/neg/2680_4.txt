all ambiguity about michael myers has withered away thanks to this series' chronic habit of arseholing about with its continuity and pulling relatives out of nowhere. this entry introduces the potty angle that he's not just a psycho killer but is actually controlled by runes, which appear as a star constellation every halloween, and a cult is using him to... erm, well, this film is far from coherent and i lost track of the plot after a while. the movie hemorrhages credibility so profusely it doesn't have a drop left by the end. why does michael put one victim's clothes in a washing machine? why does an otherwise empty corridor have a deadly spike sticking out of the wall? does getting electrocuted really make your head explode? and so on. it's left to donald pleasence, in his penultimate film role, to produce some wonderful little moments from the pile of dreadful dialogue he's given.
