looking at these reviews and seeing all these high ratings leave me to believe that large amounts of red corn syrup will please just about any brain dead idiot. this movie is beyond useless. all the clich'e's of a slasher film without any substance. i am sure i could go in to details about the movie but why bother when you can sum it up? obviously everyone wants mandy lane and she apparently wants none of the guys. throughout the movie you will see this.<br /><br />when she stops being friends to the typical boy trapped in friend-zone loser, he goes ballistic and when she goes on a road trip to the middle of no where (of course) he begins to hunt them one by one. sounds decent so far right? but what made this movie suck beyond belief is when you find out that not only is her loser friend the killer but she is as well.. the plan was beyond ridiculous. lets together kill all our friends and then kill each other. they give no reason why they wanted to do this and given mandy lane's "goody too shoes" demeanor it makes you scratch your head even more as to what is actually motivating these characters to do anything they are doing. it's sad.. this movie had lots of potential but the director or writer apparently can't relate to the audience in anyway.
