let's get one thing straight: i like much of snipes' work. unlike his other high-kicking contemporaries (seagal and van damme) he can actually act. this film, however, does little to enhance his reputation; it's not exactly unwatchable - but i am not in any hurry to watch it again either. in fact, if i never saw it again it wouldn't bother me - there are just loads of better films out there to waste my on! it's a pity because with a bit of imagination and and some subtle changes this could have been a worthwhile film. instead the director has chosen to almost try and bludgeon his audience into submission with too much over-the-top violence and very little characterisation.<br /><br />the biggest problem i have is with snipes' co-star, silvia colloca. it baffles me that the producers of this film went to all the bother of hiring a stunning beautiful (for my money anyway) and talented actress like miss colloca and then give her such a pathetic one-dimensional character to play with. if she was hired to simply add a bit of "glamour" to the movie she doesn't even do that very well; there's no nudity in the film and also no sex scene worth mentioning. strange, really. given the amount of violence in this film it baffles me why the producers have taken such a conservative attitude to sex and nudity. are we living in 2007 or in 1957? what the producers of this rubbish (and probably the actors as well) have forgotten is that films are meant to be fantasies. like most of the inhabitants of this planet my real life is very boring. i would love to be chasing terrorists, be able to handle myself like mr snipes and hook up with a beautiful young thing like miss colloca. this film satisfies none of those fantasies very well. which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review!
