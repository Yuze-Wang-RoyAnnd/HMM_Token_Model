this documentary was very amateurish. it could have been made by college students. assuming that it was, my grading is as follows. content : c, sound quality : f ,cinematography : f ,acting : d, soundtrack : f, casting : c, boobshot : a ......overall grade :d<br /><br />i found myself getting seasick as we walked down the streets with the characters,bobbing up and down with each move of the cameraman'step.my mother-in-law even changed the batteries in her miracle ear and she could not hear the muffled dialog. extensive post production editing and cgi would not help this bomb. these students would "barely" pass my course.my advise...don't waste your time or money for the one "a".
