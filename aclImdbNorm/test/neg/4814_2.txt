with no dead heroes you get stupid lines like that as this woefully abysmal action flick needs to be seen to be believed. william sanders is saved by his buddy harry cotter during an extraction in vietnam but gets himself captured by the enemy. fast forward ten years and harry is now a brainwashed russian operative with a mind control microchip implanted in his brain. his new russian superior is ivan played to the obscene hilt by nick nicholson who might i add not only doesn't attempt once to speak with a russian accent but resembles more a gas station attendant in kentucky with his stained teeth. what is even more absurd is the fact that he was also the dialog coach for this film. soon william is re-recruited by the cia to hunt harry down. he teams up with barbara, a freedom fighter who has infiltrated ivan's el salvador camp and soon the both of them are blowing up half of south america. some scenes are so jaw droppingly awful that it's a wonder why this film doesn't have more of a cult following. one such scene is the sudden lovemaking in the jungle by william and barbara accompanied by the most inappropriate catterwalling background music i've ever heard. who would strip completely nude in the middle of a south american jungle? there is a rape scene that uses the end theme from blood on satan's claw as well. no dead heroes is the magic bullet movie champion of all time as one shot leads to multiple kills. in one scene harry strafes his rifle from behind a rock and kills seven guys. i had to rewind it and count. hard to find film that has recently gotten the full hd treatment by mgm. track this movie down and watch it for the sheer silliness that ensues.
