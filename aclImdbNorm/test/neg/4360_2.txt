thats not saying much. this killjoy film has better cinematography and is more professional looking than the last. that doesn't mean it's more professional sounding. that horrible last film was about gangsters killing a kid and then being haunted by a voodoo clown. i thought the guy that played killjoy in the last one was a bad actor, but wow!!! this killjoy is honestly the downright worst actor i've seen in any movie, and i've seen a lot of movies. thed last movie the clown came in about 15 minutes in, this one's shorter and the clown doesn't even come in until 40 minutes in, and it's only 65 minutes long!!! i give it a 2 because the acting from some characters is ok.
