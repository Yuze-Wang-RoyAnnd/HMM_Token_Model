in 1913, in carlton mine, addytown, pennsylvania, the cruel owner of a mine uses poor children in the exploration and after an explosion, a group of children is buried alive. on the present days, karen tunny (lori heuring) has just lost her husband after a long period of terminal disease when the family savings have been spent in the treatment. without any money, she moves with her daughters sarah (scout taylor-compton) and emma (chloe moretz) to an old house in the mountains that belonged to her husband. karen is advised by her neighbors to stay at home in the night, and sarah hears that there are zombies in the area. when emma becomes friend of mary, he mother believes she is an imaginary friend. however, when sarah's friends are attacked and eaten alive by zombie children and emma vanishes, karen and sarah chase her nearby the mine.<br /><br />"wicked little things" is not a totally bad movie: the acting is good; the make-up is creepy; and the cinematography and the music score are excellent. however, the story, and consequently the screenplay, are very weak, indeed a bad collection of clich'es. the beginning is reasonable, with a widow moving to a house in a remote location because the family spent all their resources with the illness of the patriarch. but when she arrives, coincidently the little zombies attack people without any consequences, for example, families do not search the missing persons. then the wicked mr. carlton comes to the place with the most disgusting attitudes, a typical clich'es that he will die in the end. there is no explanation why the children attacked innocent people and why they should stop after killing mr. carlton. when sarah is running away with her mother and says that she is tired and cannot run anymore, it is one the most stupid lines that i have ever seen in a horror movie. my vote is four.<br /><br />title (brazil): "zombies"
