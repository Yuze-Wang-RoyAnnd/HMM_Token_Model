for those viewers who thought the 1979 film "alien" the first to depict a male earthling being impregnated by a malevolent extraterrestrial, "night of the blood beast," made 21 years earlier, may come as something of a surprise. in this film, america's first man in space crashlands back on earth and, after examination, is thought to be dead. he later comes to again, only with a half dozen or so alien seahorse thingies growing in his abdomen. the mama (?) alien also pops up to terrify the small band of scientists who are observing our gravid hero, and she (?) seems to have the body of a bear and the head of yarnek, the rock creature from a 1969 "star trek" episode. anyway, with its short, 62-minute running time, small group of scientists, and cheap-looking monster, this film suggests nothing less than a grade z warm-up for "the outer limits" (which would premiere four years later), but without the fine writing that that show usually boasted. despite the lurid title, this film is decidedly sci-fi, not horror, and offers no scares, no laffs, little suspense and little food for thought afterwards. it looks as if it cost around $100 to make (but probably cost twice as much), and its musical score often seems to have no relation to the happenings (i won't use the word "action") on screen. by the film's end, many questions remain: just how was our hero to give birth to these critters? why does the alien need to decapitate people to learn our language? (to justify that title, no doubt!) why can't the space-traveling aliens land on our planet, rather than needing to hitch rides on our ships? how was our hero impregnated to begin with? these are all matters that this little cheapie can't be bothered with. it really is for 1950s sci-fi completists only.
