this very forced attempt to fuse robert altman and quentin tarantino (who is wildly overrated himself) is neither informative nor entertaining. the character development is arbitrary and unbelievable -- especially in the final scene of the thugs and the little boy, as other reviewers have noted. also, a couple of humorous moments aside, the film is not as funny (black humor or otherwise) as the director seems to think it is.
