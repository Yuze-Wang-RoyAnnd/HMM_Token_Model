bad editing, bad production values, bad continuity, implausible, bad dialogue... this movies is bad, bad, bad. however, if you want a movie to poke fun at (a la mst3000), this is your movie. i wouldn't suggest spending much money on it, but if you do see this movie, make sure it's with plenty of witty, like-minded buddies.
