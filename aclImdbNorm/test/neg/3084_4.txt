a ditzy girl (yes, ditzy is about as complex as her character gets) won't take no for an answer and does quirky things to get her husband back. it's too far-fetched to be believable with such flimsy characters going through the motions. but not far-fetched enough to be fascinating in the way that say, being john malkovich, was. so it ends up boring.<br /><br />sv
