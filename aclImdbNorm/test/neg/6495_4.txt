this movie suffers from the fact that for years hollywood had no clue as to how to package jackie chan for the masses. his low-budget hong kong movies were all fast-paced kinetic thrillers that highlight his amazing gymnastic skills and talent for light comedy. his early hollywood films stuck him in the same movies that were being packaged for stallone or chuck norris. there is nothing about chan's character in this movie that requires the character to be asian except for his being the star. in his hong kong films chan is never dull, with the movies being one rapid-fire martial arts sequence after another, but "the protector" is lifeless throughout. danny aiello isn't given much to work with either and the lacking chemistry between the two probably is more a result of the script and direction than how the two actors got on together. both have been better in worse movies. the best thing about the movie is the hong kong settings. the worst part is the appalling way that jackie chan comes off so colorless and drab. it wouldn't be until the made-in-canada "rumble in the bronx" that the west would finally figure out how to make a good jackie chan movie.
