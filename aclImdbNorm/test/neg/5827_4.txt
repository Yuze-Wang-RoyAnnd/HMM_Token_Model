i saw winnie's heffalump a couple of days ago. a nice story based on well known characters created by a.a.milne. although winnie, piglet, tigger and rabbit are all present in this animated feature, the main character is roo this time. he befriends with scary heffalump who proves to be not scary at all and shows everybody that friendship knows no boundaries and everybody wants and deserves to be happy. i love this film and i would love it even more were i 10 or 15 years younger. alas, i would like to become a kid again to enjoy this heffalump story much more but all i am left with is a sense of sadness at the loss of a sort of childishness and innocence of which this movie is full
