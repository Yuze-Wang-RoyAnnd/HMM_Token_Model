this movie is very modern and forward. it is about 75% in english. it is aimed at english-speaking multiplex-going young audience. basic plot is similar to ddlj. acting is below average.<br /><br />unfortunately they are portraying a wrong picture and setting a bad example for the youngsters. tanisha is shown drinking from a bottle, or taking shots of tequila about 5-6 times in the movie. the director does not even acknowledge she is an alcoholic and has a drinking problem. all through the movie she only wears bikini tops whether she is at work, at a beach or at a wedding. the heroine of the movie doing this makes the youngsters feel this behaviour is acceptable.<br /><br />the less that is said about failure of uday chopra doing shahrukh khan's ddlj role of arrogant girl-chaser, the better. the movie is about equality of sexes. but equality should not be about making the same mistakes, instead about doing the right to do the right thing. if men have been shown as chronic casanovas in movies, does not mean women should also portray same behaviour.<br /><br />even though the movie is made in light-hearted fun spirit, it promotes so many wrong social notions in the name of being forward, that "fun" part of the movie makes no impact. not even in canada women dress like this, or guys behave like they have shown in the movie. it is certainly not a reflection of indian society or even canadian society. perhaps they should have a disclaimer at the beginning stating, "all characters and events in the movie are imaginary and do not reflect the actual culture of the cities and countries mentioned in the film." the only good thing about this movie is the length, 1.5 hrs, thank god.
