i'm a huge zack allan fan and was disappointed that he only got one scene in the movie. this was also my favourite scene where he confiscates a character's weapons and directs her to down below. unfortunately unlike thirdspace & river of souls, most of the action took place off station. i didn't care much for garibaldi after the first three seasons and think sheridan is okay but no sinclair. i like lochley but she only had limited screen time. if you like crusade or space battles you should enjoy it. personally i can only give it 1/10.
