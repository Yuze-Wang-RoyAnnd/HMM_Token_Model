if you're a sane person and you have seen films before then you cannot tolerate this piece of idiocity for more than 20 minutes. and if you do stay there longer then it won't be because you'd expect akshay or paresh (not govinda please!) but because you value your money too much and you want at least a short nap on the plush seating in the multiplex in return of the money they robbed you off! its hard to believe that the director who gave us a cult film like herapheri can fall to such levels.. alright he's repetitive but now he's coming out of all third rate storied and expects us to laugh because he's brought in paresh rawal and akshay kumar...!no sir this ain't going to work now.. especially with this stupid script of yours!even comedy films can have meaningful scripts (lage raho munnabhai anyone?).<br /><br />govinda doesn't have much to do so can't comment..akshay kumar was boring, paresh rawal cracked some of the worst joke possible.lara dutta had real scope for acting in this one but she fails miserably...the only high point of the film (possibly) is tanushree's acting!but she's there only for the first 10 minutes.<br /><br />i don't think this film is worth any more space... (probably not even this much!). so final warning- don't watch it!
