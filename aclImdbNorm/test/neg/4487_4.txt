i was looking forward to seeing two bright young actors appearing in "dear john," but it was very slow moving; and i felt that both the screenplay and the direction hampered the flexibility of the principle performers. i usually do enjoy film adaptations of these novels. ironically, i did think the movie did an excellent job of depicting realistic military action.<br /><br />the cinematography was very good at segueing through love letters, focusing just enough on a key word or phrase in each letter. i felt that channing tatum became bogged down in what became a very "hang-dog" series of expressions in response to loss.
