i, like so many others on here, bought this movie at my local wm in the "two for $11.00" cheap-o bin. i love cheesy b horror and sci-fi movies, and this one definitely fits in that category. pretty much what everyone else on here said is dead on. yes it was bad, but that was to be expected. the "main" problem i had with this movie is that it was just basically boring. i mean serious yawn-o-rama. the acting was bad, the costumes (k mart skeletor outfit circa 1982) were worse, and the editing was awful. no continuity whatsoever. mr skeletor ultimately dies in an explosion of sorts...uh, although he encountered multiple explosion throughout this move. i guess the last one just took its toll on him. apparently earlier encounters with this "military" group (cough) took its toll on his horse....it would change from red to black throughout this crap fest. even for a b movie, do yourself a favor and skip it. the only good it serves me now it to add to my dvd collection. hopefully no one will recognize it when they look through my movie collection. thumbs down, big time.
