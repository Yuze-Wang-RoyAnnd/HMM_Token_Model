i agree with what so many others have said about the shallow and offensive nature of this film's examination of racism. it is baffling to me that so many people seem to have been fooled by its pretentiousness. i want to comment on the matt dillon character as an example of what's most infuriating about this movie. here we have a man who -- contrasted with the film's underlying message that "we're all a little racist" -- effectively rapes a woman in public, cruelly humiliating her husband and deliberately goading him to make a move that, as he well knows, will lead to his arrest or even death. he does all this after pulling the couple over without any legal cause but because, as we come to understand, they are black and wealthy and he is a hurt little boy who is now the police and can therefore do as he pleases. this behavior is not a little racist. this behavior is evil. it is disturbing to me that this extreme of racism is held up next to another character's behavior -- spouting her paranoid stereotypes about gang violence -- to illustrate that everybody's a little racist. later, we're spoon-fed some tripe about dillon's poor old dad and how black folks drove him into the poor house. is this supposed to explain, or worse, excuse this behavior? and is dillon's character meant to redeem himself by committing the utterly unmotivated and unbelievable, laughably coincidental act of saving the woman he sexually assaulted the very night before? please. the fact that so many people seem to feel some kind of self-congratulatory admiration for this film makes me feel sad about the shallowness of our understanding of racism, and our apparent lack of commitment to condemning and ending it.
