** out of **** stars<br /><br />let's see...14 divided by 20 times the square root of 13 equals 23, which was my departed grandmother's favorite number and the year she was born, 23 minutes past the 23rd hour. assign the number any way you choose and ooh be very scared. be extremely scared when you throw in a brain-dead looking mutt to go with 23, and you have schumacher's latest attempt at a dark suspense fest with the number 23. oh yeah, 23 is also my record in cuervo shots at my favorite dive on 23rd street in the 23rd state in the union.<br /><br />carrey carries the film to about it's halfway point, then we lose sight of him, not caring much. don't look for any crazy expressions to come from the comedian carrey, as you have seen in the mask and me, myself and irene. no. and don't expect an embodiment of a character as he did with andy kaufman. this role is a sad and peculiar devolvement for jimbo. where's the riddler when you need him! i know, we don't need him. virginia madsen, like usual, is underused as the supportive, speculative and peculiar wife. her talent, like carrey's, is suppressed, and it's almost painful to watch her try to rescue her underdeveloped character from near anonymity. <br /><br />to give credit where credit is due, there are a couple of interesting scenes in the number 23 that showcase some very crafty cinematography. they are arresting enough on their own without having to be convoluted within the incoherent narrative of this silly story.<br /><br />i don't know about you, (and i realize this is a work of absolute fiction) but i don't know of anyone who often reads his novel in a dank, dark basement, or spends his time at graveyards on a regular basis like carrey does in this movie. schumacher keeps his film dark and blood-red and gloomy and rainy and smoggy and gloomy and rainy and dank and on and on and on from beginning to end. even flatliners and the lost boys had a little more daylight in them, and we're talking about medical students obsessed with death and teenage vampires!<br /><br />if you feel like watching this film, even if it's out of mere curiosity...make sure you do it while enjoying about 23 catnaps, that way you can kill 23 birds with one stone.
