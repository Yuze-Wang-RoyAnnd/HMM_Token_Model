if anyone tells you this picture is just terrific they probably have something to do with either making it or profiting from it. this film is a real loser and it copies situations from big budget horror movies and not to mention soundtracks to. i wouldn't recommend this one to my worst enemy. it is a low budget movie with amateur actors. it looks like it was filmed for a film contest. the acting is terrible and it wouldn't surprise me if the script was written by a hee haw script writer. my family laughed at it. a grade zzzzzzzzzzzzz all the way. you won't be scared by this one. here is one little taste of the terrible elements of this film. when the guy gets his toe stomped by ric white's stupid portrayal of the reverend james johnston walking cane. the guys reactions are like if he had an amputation with no pain killer. watch the dvd extras after you watch the movie. when you see ric white and others talk so seriously about the movie you will laugh till your stomach hurts. how people will stretch the truth and what they will do to earn a dishonest buck. don't get fooled like we did and buy this failure.
