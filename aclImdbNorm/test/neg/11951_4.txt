well, i must admit, when i saw the trailer for this movie, i was looking forward to it. i am generally a fan of light hearted romantic comedies and from the trailer, thats the impression i got of this movie. however, i spent most of the movie waiting for the comedy to begin. although there were a couple of amusing scenes, in general the outlook of the movie was quite depressing.<br /><br />i also found it difficult to fall in love with any of the characters as they all seemed a little underdeveloped, the time which the director could have used exploring the characters taken up by a needless overuse of opera, making the movie feel dragged out and slow.<br /><br />all in all, although there are some touching scenes, the trailer is quite deceptive and i would only suggest you go watch this if there is really nothing else that tickles your fancy.<br /><br />not fantastic, and as i have said before; bland.
