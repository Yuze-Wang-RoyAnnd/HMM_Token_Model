i wanted to love this film so badly...i really did. but it was a horrible disappointment.<br /><br />i read jennifer egan's novel in 1996 and was enthralled by the story. in fact it remains one of my favorite books of all time. mind you, the book had much more depth than this movie, in plot and emotional resonance. it made you care about the characters. it painted a complete picture of phoebe, unlike the utterly poor characterization of the young girl in the film.<br /><br />though beautiful and showing *some* promise in her burgeoning career, jordana brewster was as flat and hollow in this performance as was the script. and christopher eccleston (wolf) was just an awful choice for the role of wolf, both physically and logistically. what an awkward looking couple. wolf should have been more of a dark brooding character, and more physically alluring, like he was in the book. what's more, the chemistry between the two actors was painfully forced.<br /><br />cameron diaz, however, deserves utmost praise for her performance. she took an impossibly mediocre script and gave her character life, a real spirit. she is simply gorgeous and her careful mannerisms make her very believable as a hippie. it's too bad her talent was squandered on this forgettable film.<br /><br />in the book-to-movie category, this is a dreadful translation, almost as bad as message in a bottle with kevin costner. but don't get me started on that one...<br /><br />i am not usually so harsh in my critiques but i was so disappointed here, because i really cared about the story and wanted to see it told right. it did not deliver...<br /><br />
