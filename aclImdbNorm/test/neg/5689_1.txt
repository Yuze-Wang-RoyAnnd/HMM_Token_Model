ok, please believe me when i say that this is a terrible, terrible, sci-fi movie. its done so poorly that much of the film plays out as unintentional surrealism and its absolutely a 100% waste of time. awful, but somehow also deeply unfunny. i watched this as a double feature with "recon 2020: the caprini massacre" and although "battlespace" was an incredibly superior film, that's not saying much. the plot of "battlespace" is so completely convoluted that its impossible to follow. the narration is cryptic, often nonsensical, seemingly endless, and thoroughly exhausting. literally half the film is duplicative scenes of the female lead, who looks like brian bosworth, walking through the desert. the movie actually starts out pretty cool, but then nosedives into pooptown and somehow continues to deteriorate, minute by minute. absolutely horrible and truly an absurdist endurance test. zero stars. ---|--- reviews by flak magnet
