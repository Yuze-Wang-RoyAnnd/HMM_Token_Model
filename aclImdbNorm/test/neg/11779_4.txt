this movie, which i just discovered at the video store, has apparently sit around for a couple of years without a distributor. it's easy to see why. the story of two friends living in new york searching for their pal from high school who is now living homeless under the boardwalk at coney island, has flashes of being a very good film, but ultimately is weighted down by the story focusing on stan and daniel, rather than on their homeless friend richie. cryer is as usual very good and the film has a nice stark look to it, with the ghostly images of coney island. however, writer cryer and director richard schenkman are too busy dealing with the fairly uninteresting lives of stan and daniel rather than focusing on richie. one flashback in a music store, where richie has a crush on an employee stands out and really shows the viewer where this film could have gone. but in the end, not much. two many drawn out scenes of annoyance, such as inside the skeeball building. rating 4 out of 10.
