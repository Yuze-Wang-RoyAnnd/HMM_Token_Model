at first sight, i must say already, watch the contractor, 2007. with wesley snipes too. a better action movie and with a more dramatic plot.<br /><br />the detonator has an horrendous plot focusing in some sort of atomic bomb, set in romania and with awful directing for an action movie-- there is no thrilling moments and an action movie is turned in to boredom.<br /><br />really, what you expect wesley snipes to do, when awful screenplays like this one are offered to him? don't blame him, he needs the money.<br /><br />this was the first impression when i saw the movie, 3 years ago. but i won't see it again, no way. screw it. it sucks. there. i said it.<br /><br />ps: i don't think i ever said "this movie sucks" on a imdb review. thank you, detonator!
