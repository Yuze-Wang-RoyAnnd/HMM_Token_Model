to be hones, i used to like this show and watch it regularly, but now (thank god!) i don't understand why did i watch it. sex and the city is one of the most pointless and insulting tv shows i've ever seen. i really don't get the point of this show, despite of trying. people are saying, that sex and the city is funny. in what way? by cursing all the time, talking about vibrators and the size of the penis? give me a break.<br /><br />i don't understand the plot: we have four girls who are trying to find a perfect man by sleeping with every dork, who comes around. and this show is all about four spoiled chicks, who are sleeping with every man in the city, but in the end they admit the best pleasure comes out of the penis vibrators. and yeah... the show is trying to tell us, that sex is the most important thing in every relationship. if you can have a good sex, you're a good husband (or wife). it doesn't matter if you want to be loyal and having a good heart.. the size does matter.<br /><br />the biggest problem is also bad acting. the four main actresses (sarah jessica parker, kim cattral, cynthia nixon and kristin davis) are so bad and unconvincing, that it makes me sick just watching this show. parker is just screaming and complaining all the time, cattral is showing her old boobs and saying "the f - word" all the time, davis delivers her smile (and nothing else) and nixon acts like she is bored all the time. and yes... men are sex - hungry pigs in this show. but, judging by this show, women are not much better. this show is insulting for men and women. the women are shown so primitive and emotionless, like they don't have any heart, just hunger for sex. it's insulting for everyone.<br /><br />sex and the city is one of the worst tv shows and i'm glad that the show ended, because it delivers bad acting and pointless stories. the whole world is not all about sex and vibrators.
