first off, if you want to make a good film, don't cram all your exposition into the last 10 minutes. the viewer is expected to be bewildered for nearly two hours, only to have margo's father explain everything to alex very late in the film. to make matters worse, the scriptwriter decided it wasn't enough to have the basic mystery solved, but adds in a completely unnecessary murder that we knew nothing about (involving alex's father!).<br /><br />there's some serious motivation issues with characters also. margo's father's choices don't seem to make sense once the film is over. why didn't he just kill philippe's father and be done with it? instead, a complicated plot to obscure the truth is concocted, but one which ensures that everyone will be in physical jeopardy for years (including the completely innocent photographer, who gets murdered by philippe's father's thugs). although alex is a doctor (whom one would think is relatively bright), he chooses to flee the police, during which he not only endangers his own life, but those whom he involves in a nasty pile-up on the freeway. why was margo's friend so keen on keeping her promise to margo, once all the crap hits the fan for alex? and are we to think that margo's father would rather kill himself rather than go to prison? what about his wife? did he consider her wishes? those are some of the main problems.<br /><br />then there are some nasty details, like: why was her father there the night of her faked death? how did he get a hold of the junkie's body on such short notice and get it back quickly in order to bury it with the other two? alex's friend bruno seems over-eager to be part of the mayhem, in which he and his friends have to kill for alex, notwithstanding the perceived debt he owes alex for saving his son's life. what good would the photos of margo do? they don't implicate philippe at all. and why would margo have the safety deposit box key handy that night for her would-be abductors to take? did i miss some other things? probably. minor irritations of mine include the fact that although alex is a doctor, he smokes like a fiend. which makes his marathon run away from the police even that more impressive. also, when he is riding in the convertible with his lawyer, neither of them is wearing a seat belt. how bright could they be?
