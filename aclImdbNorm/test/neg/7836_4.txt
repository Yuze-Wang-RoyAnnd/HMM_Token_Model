the story: alain, a french policeman, is shocked to discover that he had a twin brother when his body is found in nice. investigating the murder, he finds out that he was in possession of a list that details the deeds of the russian mafia. helped by his brother's girlfriend, alain dodges russian gangsters & corrupt fbi agents while trying to find the list.<br /><br />"maximum risk" is another one of the long list of action films that feature jean-claude van damme. as far as things go, it is strictly formulaic. the script sticks to the clich'es & the acting is mediocre. there are some nicely done action sequences, with an inventive car chase, a fight in a burning building, an escape through rooftops, a brutal fight in an elevator & jcvd fleeing his enemies over an elevated train line. director ringo lam keeps everything going at a reasonable pace.
