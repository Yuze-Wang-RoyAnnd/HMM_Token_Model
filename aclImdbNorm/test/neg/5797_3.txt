if a movie has an unimaginative, hackneyed story and bland characters it needs to make up for it by being really, really funny. you can get away with a lot if you're funny. but while there are a few amusing moments scattered here and there in grandma's boy, they are so far and few between that they cannot begin to make up for the hack work the film displays in such abundance.<br /><br />the movie certainly doesn't aim to surprise anyone. when alex hides marijuana in his grandma's house in a tea tin you know what's going to happen later on and it does. the movie appears to have been written by a committee who did a study of mediocre comedies and grabbed any gag that appeared in more than one of them.<br /><br />the most interesting thing about the movie is its somewhat unusual setting. the game takes place in a video game development company, which should be an interesting source for some clever comedy. but don't be fooled, this is not a movie about video game developers. this is basically a college frat house movie in which all the frat boys have been shoved into a big room to play video games.<br /><br />the way the movie completely fails to think through its setting and use it for original laughs can be seen in the character of j.p. j.p. is i think more-or-less conspired by the creator of doom, john carmack. at least inspired to the extent that he's an odd genius who makes games.<br /><br />in the movie, j.p. is a weird, obnoxious geek who is despised and jeered by the company game testers. that makes no sense at all. if you are one of the most significant people in the history of video games (as j.p. is supposed to be) then even if you're quirky and obnoxious, people will still admire and respect you on some level. if stephen hawking is obnoxious his associates still aren't going to make jun of him to his face.<br /><br />also, game testers are just as likely to be geeks as j.p., but in the movie they are basically frat boys. it's a fun normal guys against the obnoxious dweebs movie. and while that formula has worked, very occasionally, in the past, it is absurd in the setting of a game company. if you decide to use an unusual setting for a movie, you don't simply cram in all the conventions of movies from different settings into that one. unless you're a hack.<br /><br />about two thirds of the way through the movie i gave up. something happened that i knew would result in a series of painfully predictable events. and i realized i hadn't actually laughed at anything for the last half hour anyway. so i stopped (although i did fast forward just to make sure i was right that they would follow the most predictable clich'es, which they did).<br /><br />normally if a movie's bad i just say it's bad and then run out of things to say, but this movie is such a phenomenally shoddy production that it deserves a long diatribe.<br /><br />shame on the movie for luring a good actress like linda cardellini into it, then surrounding her with talentless nobodies. i'll give the movie 1 point for giving shirley jones the chance to be the anti-shirley partridge though.
