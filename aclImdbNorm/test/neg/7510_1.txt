i work at the video store that rents this video in lexington and i must say...it should have never been made. i even know some of the people who worked on it who regret doing so. bad effects, horrid acting, bad script especially. i swear the dialog wouldn't have passed for the original psx resident evil; it's that bad. if you want to know how not to make a movie, watch this film to learn a thing or two. if not, don't waste your time. and even the director know it sucks because he keeps coming in to try to get us to upsale the movie. no sir. i've watched two-thirds of the horror section and this rates even lower than plan 9 from outer space. even ed eood would have said, "nope. that's too stupid even for me."
