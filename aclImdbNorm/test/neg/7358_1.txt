if you saw the grudge, a another mediocre ghost movie then you should know what to expect, just worse, a lot worse. this time instead of being in japan with all english speaking people we are in spain with all english speaking people. it is interesting that not one shot of this movie actually looks like spain and could have been entirely filmed in a studio back lot. oh and a place with swings, cause there's a good 5 mins of footage of swings with no one on them, oooohhh how spooky.<br /><br />this one is terrible in every way imaginable. the acting by the lameinator mom and dad don't help matters at all. anna paquin is the only person that delivers a decent performance in the film but i hate anna paquin so you can imagine my own private hell viewing this film.<br /><br />there is one good moment in the movie, however, when a villain is trying to explain the convoluted plot to anna paquin's character and she doesn't understand any of it and asks a bunch of stupid questions and he blurts out "you idiot, you have not understood anything!" lol. well i happen to understand this film is a piece of garbage. 0 stars.
