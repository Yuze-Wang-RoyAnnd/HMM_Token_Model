what can i say about this? such a big prestige-production - but in the end? wasted time, wasted money.<br /><br />this work a disaster is historically seen. only some examples:<br /><br />* augustus often is named 'gaius' - his first name (pronomen). but the old romans don't used this name. correct would be the surname (nomen gentile and cognomen) or the 'octavian', 'caesar', 'augustus'.<br /><br />* livia was shown as tyrannic wife. but this historically wrong.<br /><br />* iulia was shown as nice young woman - but she wasn't one. adultery and (maybe?) prostitution and arrogant behavior was the cause of her banishing.<br /><br />* she wasn't at the dying bed of her father. she never was allowed to leave her banishing. and she was at this time around 50 years old! not as young as she was shown. in the same year augustus died she committed suicide, because tiberius stopped giving her a pension.<br /><br />* augustus was much more scruplesless then in this movie shown. but author and director seems to believe augustus' own 'res gestae'.<br /><br />what remains? historically extremely doubtful, bad acting, bad built and equipment - 2 points out of 10 - one for peter o'toole.
