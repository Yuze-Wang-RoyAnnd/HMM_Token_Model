as many have detailed here with a level of seriousness that i find amusing, this is *not*: <br /><br />a film. (cue dramatic music) <br /><br />it's just a so-bad-it's good, totally surreal, jackie chan stunt-for-all. the women fighters are totally kick-butt and jackie is definitely put in his place. <br /><br />this is the movie you want to see with some good friends on a sunday afternoon -- surrounded by munchies, ready to roar with laughter, cheer on the good guys, boo the bad guys, and continually yell, "what?" when something totally bizarre happens. great fun!!
