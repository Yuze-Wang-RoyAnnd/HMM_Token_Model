i guess that after leonard nimoy had been successful in directing "the search for spock" and "the voyage home," william shatner thought he could direct too. although he is a competent actor, he shows here that he's just not a good director.<br /><br />actually, this movie is hard evidence to support the arguments of trekkies who say that william shatner being an arrogant egomaniac. for although his character, captain james kirk, was always arguably the most important role in the original "star trek," it seems in this movie that he is the heart of the movie, the two other most important characters, captain spock and doctor leonard mccoy, are just there to support him, and the other characters are just there to add comic relief.<br /><br />the plot is that some emotional vulcan outcast named sybok is mindmelding with people and releasing the pain bottled up inside them from that traumatic event early in life that changed them forever. grateful, they join him in his quest to make the entire world free of pain and thus at peace. sybok and his followers commandeer the building in which a peace conference between a human, klingon, and romulan diplomat is taking place. this lures the still-being-constructed enterprise there, since none of starfleet's other ships have "experienced commanders" (honestly, with how starfleet is run, the klingons and romulans should have conquered them years ago). sybok adds the enterprise's crew, save spock (who is revealed to be secret brothers with sybok), mccoy, and kirk. sybok orders that the enterprise take off to "the center of the universe" to meet "god," who apparently every race has a word for. however, it turns out that this is only a minor entity when he demands the use of the enterprise and kirk asks, "what does god need with a starship." the entity is destroyed, but not before sybok, realizing he's been lied to for years, sacrifices his life and earns spock's respect in death after the enterprises photon torpedos destroy the entity and inexplicably sybok as well.<br /><br />ok, science fiction movies are not known for realism, but at some point, rationality must be enforced. why do people follow sybok just for releasing their pain? why are all humanoids defined by a single traumatic event? i've certainly led a trauma-free life. why doesn't kirk try his crew for mutiny and treason after they join sybok? what was the point of sybok sacrificing himself when the torpedos were going to kill the entity anyway?<br /><br />so the plot's weak. another problem is that sybok, though played well by lawrence luckinbill, is poorly portrayed. just because he's an emotional vulcan doesn't mean he should act exactly like a human religious fanatic. shatner (who was a co-writer as well as the director) could have at least developed dialog fitting for an emotional vulcan. i guess he feels that any emotional being talks like us. gee, i guess that means that klingons should say "isn't" and "don't" more often than "is not" and "do not." and the cardassians shouldn't prolong their sentences because they like to talk (yeah, i know it's sad that i know this). please... every st race uses unique dialog. why is sybok the exception.<br /><br />the only thing to not complain about is the acting. i've always known "star trek" to have great actors, and this movie is not exception. cudos also go to leonard nimoy, for it had to be difficult to play the dispassionate spock in his old age.<br /><br />some other things i didn't like:<br /><br />shatner and the late deforrest kelly twice show what bad singers they are by singing "row, row, row your boat" in this movie. i guess shatner wished to silence his detractors of his singing ability. what he did was prove their point.<br /><br />uhura does a fan dance while wearing nothing but tree bark to draw some men into a booby trap. after all, the dreams of all us men are filled with images of middle-aged plump women dancing naked.<br /><br />comedy's all well and good as long as it doesn't affect the nature of "star trek" too much, but when scotty bumps into an object on the enterprise and kos himself, it's kinda goin' overboard.<br /><br />kirk is the only crew member who can reject sybok's offer of releasing their inner pain and see through the god imposter's deception. not even spock can manage either of these? perhaps this scenes were valantines from shatner to his character, as many suspect.<br /><br />the concept of an entity posing as god had been used in "star trek" before this movie more than once. be creative, shatner.<br /><br />speaking of uncreativeness, i didn't purticularly care for the ripping off of the music of "star trek: the next generation."<br /><br />all in all, pretty bad "trek" movie. if you're a trekkie, watch it once because it's "star trek." otherwise, watch "star trek ii: the wrath of khan." it's way better.
