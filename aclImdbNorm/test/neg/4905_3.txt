this low-budget film about a writer who goes to work in a london casino has an awful script, wooden performances, and not much to recommend it. of course it will appeal to highbrows for whom "mainstream" is a curse word, and who automatically add 20 iq points when they hear a british accent (apologies to jeff foxworthy).<br /><br />the script is full of holes (has he written a book yet, or not?), cliches (relationship trouble: she works days, he works nights), and provides so little insight into such basics as character motivation that it requires a voice-over narration just to move the story along.<br /><br />in an attempt to keep the audience from dozing off, it includes a street fight scene that is about as realistic as a high school production of julius caesar.<br /><br />if your idea of scintillating dialogue is "i'll see your ten, and raise you twenty", then run to see this movie. otherwise, save your money.<br /><br />
