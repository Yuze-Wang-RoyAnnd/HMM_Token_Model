as bad as they get. this film commits the fatal error of making the viewer not care what happens to characters. the two women in this flick are so stupid that you begin to root for the bad guys so this thing would end.<br /><br />this film is one of the few that was so bad that i had to turn to another channel. <br /><br />put in highbrow language, this film lacks verisimilitude. people, not even people from ohio, simply do not act like this. well, maybe the writers do.<br /><br />there is not enough beer in the world to make this film bearable.<br /><br />f903
