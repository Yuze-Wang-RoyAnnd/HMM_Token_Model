i just found out before writing this review that "komodo vs. cobra" and another movie called "curse of the komodo" were both directed by the same guy, jim wynorski. that might explain why they are films of nearly identical premises. they both feature a military-governed island, a colonel whose concerned more about covering his tracks than the lives of his employees, people racing to get to a chopper that is conveniently lying in a field somewhere on the island, and giant komodo dragons created through genetic experiments running amok. what differences are there? well, the intruders on the island are now capitalists wanting to expose the government secret and there's a giant cobra on the island as well, hence the title "komodo vs. cobra" even though the conflict between the two monsters is hardly relevant to the 'story.' "komodo vs. cobra" is more or less what you'd expect given its title and its channel origin: the sci-fi channel. although every now and again you will find one that for one reason or another may appeal to you (i liked a movie called "komodo") i hardly doubt this one will.<br /><br />"komodo vs. cobra" is not only a boring film, but it's also one of the least enthusiastic sci-fi flicks i've seen in a long time. in some of these movies, there is an air to them that indicates the filmmakers were giving at least a certain level of effort, but i see very little here. that's indicated again by it just being a rehash of "curse of the komodo." the cgi for the monsters look as if they came straight out of a second-rate video game, the cinematography and misc en scene is poor, the acting ranges from passable to poor, the action scenes are dull, and then there are some parts that are, frankly put, unforgivably bad. i see a lot movies where a person will shoot a gun many times without reloading and i can deal with this. but in this movie, where michael par'e takes a single thirty-eight handgun and fires it approximately fifty times nonstop without reloading once
