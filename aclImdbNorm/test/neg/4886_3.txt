from the late teens to the 1920s, stan laurel was a solo act in films. during this time period, laurel was definitely not among the upper echelons of talent and his humor isn't nearly as good as contemporaries such as lloyd or keaton. however, for second-tier short comedies, he did create a decent niche. as far as the quality of the films go, they varied wildly. some, such as dr. pyckle and mr. pryde, were terrific, whereas most were of average to below average in quality.<br /><br />frozen hearts is an odd film. like many of the films he made for hal roach and distributed by path'e during this period, the costumes were absolutely first-rate and the film looked very nice. however, despite this and having support from the likes of james finlayson, one thing they forgot to include in this film was humor. none of the jokes seem to work and the film looks almost like a drama, not a comedy. only the really silly intertitle cards betray the type film it's supposed to be.<br /><br />my advice is try to see all his laurel and hardy films and then see the solo films. in addition to dr. pyckle, try seeing the soilers and mud and sand--two of his more tolerable solo shorts.
