man, are you serious? did you read the book or watch this movie? well, if you did, let me warn you, it is bogus. mark furhman has been seeking a job since losing his job with the lapd. you remember him, don't you? he was the guy that lied on the stand and gave the oj simpson defense a foothold they were looking for. well, he has written three books since then. i have read all three of them. no, i am not a fan, they were given to me. however, i will tell you one similarity in all three, they grossly distort the importance of mark furhman. he shamelessly exaggerates his stature in all three. in "murder in spokane", he pretends that he had something to do with catching the killer, when he had nothing to do with it. in all books he takes great delight in running down local law enforcement efforts. kind of like his efforts were run down in the oj trial. in this movie, there are plenty of slow motion shots of ladies looking at furhman and lusting after him. many other shots have him at the center of attention, when in reality, i am sure the only thing people were thinking at the time was "hey, isn't that the racist that caused oj to get off?" this was an interesting real life story, but not a good movie over it.
