i didn't really get this movie because i'm not some perv like you, who is into lesbian stuff.<br /><br />the girl in the red wig tries too hard to be funny (her lips are so silicone!), but she's really lame and insecure. she tries to come off like a surfer-guy (better than dressing slutty, but still weird and definitely unfashionable); the movie doesn't explain why she's trying to pass herself off as a man. oh, right, to "get" the poor, dumb girl. i forgot. she makes all these dumb inventions which are not funny, and she's a really lousy actress. plus, that waif look is so out!<br /><br />this dumb blond girl from melrose place plays(surprise) a dumb blond.<br /><br />she thinks the girl in the wig is a guy! they even make out! ewww! i guess that part was sort of funny.
