this was a dreadful, boring movie, even for a documentary. at times, it did provided insight to life and also had humorous moments, but overall it was not worth seeing. every time i began to feel sympathetic towards mark and began to hope he would be successful, i would become disappointed by his lack of responsibility and drug and alcohol abuse.
