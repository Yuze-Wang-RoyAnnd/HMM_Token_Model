my wife and i never got into the movie.we thought it was way to sloooowwww and to many subtitles.i understood they needed them for vietnam,but took to long to get out of asia.she wanted it off i said it's going to get better.it never did yes they had a tough time trying to get to america,but i wanted to see him looking and finding his dad.not at the end but forming a relationship.did i mention it was slllloooowwwwww.i love to watch a movie to feel good not sad at the end.i know they don't make many good movies now days.i think action movies are the only ones to watch.i have been renting a lot from netflix and now blockbuster,maybe 20% are worth seeing.i don't kneed realism or facts just a movie thats fun and makes you feel good.gary
