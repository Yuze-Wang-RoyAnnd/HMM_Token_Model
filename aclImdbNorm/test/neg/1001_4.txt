i'm a huge fan of both emily watson (breaking the waves) and tom wilkinson (normal) and was amused to see them upstaged by rupert everett (dellamorte dellamore) in this shockingly rather minor movie that had all the ingredients to be so much more. the too brief scenes in which he portrays a languid, infinitely entitled, worthless son of a rich lord are spot-on and entertaining. but for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry to speak of between anyone. the music was annoyingly movie-of-the-week quality, and the voice-over jarring and totally unnecessary. clearly the work of a first-time director with a small budget who either lacked or didn't sufficiently heed good advice. too bad.<br /><br />i can appreciate how the people you kind of hate at the beginning are the ones you kind of like at the end, and vice-versa, so there is some sort of character arc, at least in terms of perception. for example, watson's character, while refreshingly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man, began to grate on me near the end, particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions, and later when she simply declared that she would be moving back into their marital flat, with no asking of permission, no apologies offered. and i went from disliking wilkinson's control freak / moral relativist character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change (unlike his wife).<br /><br />this movie awkwardly morphed from a whodunit to a "love story" or "steel magnolias" illness drama without sufficiently informing me of the fact, so i was left distractedly guessing what the next plot twist might be long after they had all been revealed (was it the lord driving the car? the lord's dog?). the scene where the lord visits wilkinson and relates how brave watson is, the bestest nurse any dying boyfriend could ever ask for, florence nightingale incarnate, etc. was ok until he started over-the-top sobbing like a baby. good god! if you ask me she's just another flitty rich person with way too much time on her hands, and so she drives her hard working, well providing spouse crazy with unnecessary drama. her screwing around was just another way to occupy her empty life; the dying guy thing was an added bonus for her as it somehow made her previous actions completely above reproach.<br /><br />look, everyone would have been better off if wilkinson had just left her for his secretary, who seemed to appreciate him for who he was. instead he acted like an abused dog, his open craving for his wife's affection increasing with every kick she gives him. i'm not anti pc or anything, it just didn't ring true, even after taking into account all of the harsh realities of middle age we all tend to face. the ending for me was (and not the director's intention i am certain) depressing. the movie spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just don't belong together, so i found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing. i'm not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story, it just has to be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed. is that asking too much?<br /><br />my score: 4/10
