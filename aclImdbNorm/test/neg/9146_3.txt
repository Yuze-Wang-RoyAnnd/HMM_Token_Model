a tedious effort from not-yet great director budd boetticher and pretty but not-yet un-bland actress nina foch, this movie is, as one of the other reviewers notes, is the quintessence of a certain kind of b movie. it's just not the good kind. and a promising premise and an overactive fog machine is wasted.<br /><br />basic plot -- nina, a nurse on leave from wartime duties on account of her nerves, has a nightmare. she meets a dashing fellow at the resort where she's giving her nerves a breather, and realizes he's in the dream, even though she's never met him before. meanwhile, it turns out our dashing guy is working as a spy, and is about to go on an-extra secret, hush-hush mission that must not fail.<br /><br />of course, there are nazis. and plot holes. and smart people acting in a fashion most likely to get them into entirely unnecessary scrapes, so that the running time can be spun out past an hour. at the end, the movie becomes a contest between which group of spies can act more foolishly. if the fbi and oss had acted like this crew, we'd have lost the war in '42.<br /><br />the movie itself is rather flatly shot (despite the best efforts of the fog machine) and the acting -- as it seems to be in many of the columbia bs tcm has been showing lately -- is curiously unengaged. it's less stylized than what one might find from a similarly budgeted warner bros movie, but also less fun to watch.<br /><br />boetticher's strength, of course, is a rather matter of fact style which allows the strong stories and acting in his randolph scott westerns to come to the fore. maybe the problem here is that such a style is not going to work when the script is lousy and the actors tired from their five film a year schedule.
