i saw this film at the 2005 edinburgh international film festival. <br /><br />this film had been compared in the eiff program to sideways - which i liked - so i was quite looking forward to this movie. i also liked garden state, napoleon dynamite etc... so i have had good recent experiences with slightly weird american indy films.<br /><br />unfortunately, i found that puffy chair does not compare favourably with any of these movies.<br /><br />i was sitting for 35 minutes waiting for something amusing, witty, insightful or even mildly interesting to happen. it didn't - and the shaky video cam was making me sick - so i left.<br /><br />this is only the second film i have ever walked out from (the first was "showgirls") which is slightly disappointing. i probably could have lasted the duration had it not been for the nauseating effects of the wobbly picture - but nothing within the first 35 minutes gave me the impression that i would be missing anything.<br /><br />disappointing.
