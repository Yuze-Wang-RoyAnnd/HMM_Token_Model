the auteur of "prince" manages to take an excellent cast, a decent story, a mediocre script and carefully assemble them into one boring, monotonous, amateurish mess. in spite of a strong central performance by frank nasso, the prince, this disjointed film wanders aimlessly from scene to scene, painfully disintegrating into hash. the result brings a sigh of relief at the end where the tears of joy should be. a sad waste of time and talent and a good example of how not to direct a film.<br /><br />
