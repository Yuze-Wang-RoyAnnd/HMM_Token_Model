shrieker is a full moon production. i knew what to expect (very little quality) but i didn't expect this to be as painful as shrieker was to watch.<br /><br />it's just awful. bad acting, confusing script and direction. annoying characters i wanted to kill. the whole thing was probably made in one week. i've seen episodes of charmed that were more complex and convincing than this cheapie.<br /><br />it has the look and feel of an orphaned episode of a badly conceived tv series no one has ever seen. it was a chore to watch and i could feel my mind getting dimmer and dimmer by the minute. watching a movie shouldn't be this much hard work.
