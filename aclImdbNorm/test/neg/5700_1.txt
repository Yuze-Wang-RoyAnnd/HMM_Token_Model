it must be a long time ago that i have seen such a bad movie. i have to say it is really hard to make a good and/or realistic movie about air disaster but this movie was such a waste of time and money. also i think this is an unofficial way trying to get a bad reputation on airbus. first, the cockpit look a lot like an airbus cockpit, second you got a stick, third using computers to control rudders/elevators/aileron via "fly by wire". when i saw this movie i thought like the intention of the film was "don't fly with computerized airplanes like airbus, use boeing instead they have a direct connection of steering and rudders."<br /><br />all i can say: bad story, horrible acting (most of the actors), worst film trick ever...
