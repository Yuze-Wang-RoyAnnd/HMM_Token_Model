algiers is not a classic, it is a perversion of the wonderful original pepe le moko, directed by duvivier and starring a much more attractive and charming pepe, jean gabin. if you want to fully experience the casbah and the characters in algiers, i recommend you don't even watch this movie and see pepe le moko instead, for it is much more elaborate, more beautifully filmed, the lines are not clich'ed and the characters adhere much more to reality. furthermore, the ending is so dramatic and key to pepe's character that you'll find the algiers version intolerable. although algiers does an almost excellent job mimicking each scene, the acting falls short as does the credibility of the characters. plus, the wardrobe is truly breath-taking in all scenes, particularly pepe's in the last scene and gaby's (at all times) but also when she's on the boat. frankly, algiers is cheap as far as imitations go.
