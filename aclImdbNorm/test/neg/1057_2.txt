(warning: some spoilers ahead.)<br /><br />what an incredibly crappy movie. it makes iron eagle 2 seem good.<br /><br />the story is as follows: captain holiday (rutger hauer) gets shot down by his friend banning (robert patrick) to stop him from shooting down a iraqi airliner filled with innocent civilians. six years later holiday returns to take his revenge. among other things he, sitting in a tank, chases banning (now a colonel) and his pregnant wife over a field. he manages to fire shells and drive the tank at the same time. after getting the tank blown up by a bazooka, he miraculously survives and steals a fighter jet. with it he shoots down a number of allied fighters before attacking the nato headquarters in an attempt to kill banning's wife.<br /><br />an extra bonus is that major baxter (who holiday hangs in her office) has put the rank insignia on her right shoulder on backwards. elegant.
