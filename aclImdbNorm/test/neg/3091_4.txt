what a shame. what a terrible shame. the table was set, the candles were lit, the guests had arrived... and then...<br /><br />... well nothing really. just pretentious drivel. it could have been great, ok maybe not great, but it could have been very good. all the elements were there but at the end of the day the bottle was empty: no lightning! how that happened is a mystery with everything at the director's disposal...<br /><br />... the story was quite brave although it certainly needed considerable work with possibly several finishing rewrites to fix the story and tighten up the characters a lot (the only thing that was consistently and constantly and unnecessarily tight was the cinematography, but i'll get to that). but the direction was lousy, the acting was just that: _a-c-t-i-n-g_ with a heavy side of cheese and lots of ham, and then the cinematography...<br /><br />...well that was something to behold! but only if you are in film school's "cinematography 101 how to never ever use a professional movie camera under any circumstances". obviously the student had fallen asleep through part of the lecture's introduction and only heard "... use a professional movie camera..." then blissfully back to la la land as the sentence finished off.<br /><br />what can i say; amateurish and pretentious to the last! i can only see this film meant to appeal as a chick flick because it's supposed to be sad, but then falls flat and just ends up being 'sad' (as an excuse for a movie)... so that even those 'chicks' wouldn't be fooled by this schlockenspiel! <br /><br />ps. i felt bad for miss diaz. she's a lot better at her craft than what this film allowed her to be, even though she was totally totally miscast. actually i feel sorry for everyone in this movie except the director and (you guessed it) the cinematographer! i say '1st against the wall for them when the revolution comes!' ok, not really, after all "it was only a movie" but perhaps a good "tar and feather and running out of town" might be more satisfying or at the very least a lot more entertaining!!!<br /><br />ttfn :-(
