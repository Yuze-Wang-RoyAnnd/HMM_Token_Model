this movie was really bad, plain and simple. how a movie like this gets wide release is a wonder to me.<br /><br />it's a decent idea, but it just didn't flesh out. edward burns is a decent actor though. i liked his small role in saving private ryan.<br /><br />let's get down to the big issue here.<br /><br />the visuals were so incredibly bad, i thought i was watching an old "dinosaurs in 3d" cdrom point-and-click adventure demo on windows 3.1 i mean, i've seen cut-scenes in console games from pre-2000 that have better looking dinosaurs than this. i mean, heck... the original tomb raider t-rex looked better than this one.<br /><br />the lizard-monkeys were laughable. i thought they were some sort of ripoff creation from "killer instinct" i've seen better sock-puppet monsters now that i think about it.<br /><br />you know, there's a ton of made-for-tv movies that are better than this. how does a gem like scifi channels "the shining" get such a small audience, but this load of "cgi, easy to make 4 kidz" gets put out in the open? i don't care if it's a ray bradbury story. lameeeee
