nice attempt to bring shakespearian language alive in a post-apocalyptic setting, but the final result is dreadful. futuristic liverpool is not convincing at all; the budget was obviously not very big, but the production designer could have come up with a slightly more creative approach to the matter. alex cox has made some good films, e.g. repo man and highway patrol man, but i really don't know what he was thinking here. just an opinion.
