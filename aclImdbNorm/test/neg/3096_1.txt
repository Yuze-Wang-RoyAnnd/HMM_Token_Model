i am not afraid of bad movies. i like bad movies. i enjoy mocking them in the company of my friends. we're all quite good at it, in fact. that being said, let me tell you how much i hated this movie.<br /><br />to begin with, it was incomprehensible. rob lowe attacks some people, they capture him but he escapes in this big ol' shoot out. there's this singer whom we think died, only she didn't, unless maybe there are several of them who all act and look the same. cue burt reynolds to come in and question the singer. he looks like he's just wandered into this movie off of the walker, texas ranger set and is darn confused. then rob lowe dies, only he doesn't... and the worst thing is, there's not enough dialogue or action that doesn't involve killing people or attempting to to even make fun of this movie!! and don't even get me started on the random chihuahua. then there was the fact that it was supposed to be about the old power structure in eastern-europe falling apart. we didn't know where we were, all the accents were apparently "eastern-european" and what were burt reynolds and rob lowe doing there in the first place?<br /><br />i desperately wanted to tell the people at blockbuster what i thought of this movie, and to get my money back, but since i'd gotten it as a special (only $.99) i decided against it. what i want to know, however, is how the director got the greenlight to make this darn movie, and what the 'stars' were thinking when they signed on???
