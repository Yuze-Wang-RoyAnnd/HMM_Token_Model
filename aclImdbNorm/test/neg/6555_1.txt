i was telling a friend of mine about the time my grandfather actually picked this horrible piece of crap for us to see one night at the theater. he never picked another one again! it was that bad! anyway, my friend then told me that her father did some of the writing for this garbage. i thought she was kidding. it turns out, she was serious. she had never actually seen it, and she said that it put a quick halt to her father's writing career. i told her not to waste her time. but, if she did actually break down and watch it, she would see within the fist minute why this ended her father's days as a writer. i mean, even for the 1980's, this crap is bad beyond description. i mean, joe frazier as terrible tucker? and why in the world would two cops care one bit about a house full of ghosts? and the movie poster? a ghost with his tongue hanging out? what is that about? nothing about this makes any sense. well, i told my friend that this crap not only ended her father's writing career, it ended the careers of everybody involved. or, at least none of them ever fully recovered from being in this garbage of a movie. let's just say that i will forever ridicule my friend for revealing to me that her father was a writer for this movie! that alone should tell just how bad this is!
