by far the most racist and ghettoish cartoon for children 7+. kids who watch this cartoon will most likely try to dress, talk, and act like the characters portrayed. i am disappointed in nickelodeon and nick jr. for agreeing to air this terrible program. the wayan's brothers may be good in movies meant for the young adult viewers. they should stick to the movies and not make any more episodes for this cartoon. usually the young celebs start off working in movies and doing voice-overs for cartoons and then as they grow older, they move up to programs for young adults. a good example is nick cannon. he first started out with appearing in all-that, later on he starred in mib ii, then drumline, and now his tv show, nick cannon presents: wild 'n out, where comedians compete by telling inappropriate jokes. this comment was originally for thugaboo, but i wanted to show examples of how celebs kids watched on tv not long ago can become those who get involved with non-kid-friendly programs. it is very sad that this happens, but all celebs change and grow up. it is just the opposite with the wayan's brothers new cartoon. it is bad enough we have to deal with all the bad people from the ghettos, with allowing the young generation watch this program, it will just convert the kids with possibilities to the ones who don't have a chance at a good life. just my feelings on this cartoon and my beliefs on what will happen to our children if they were to watch it.
