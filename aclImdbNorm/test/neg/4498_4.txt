it must be remembered that the gammera movies, like many of the first-series gozilla films, were in fact aimed squarely at kids. little kenny and his cohorts are living out the daydreams of the kids in the audience: they get to run around and play with top-secret stuff while the adults stand by and allow it; they get to cavort with monsters, and even when the bad guys enter, they are never in any real danger.<br /><br />perhaps the first gammera film is an aberration because the child does get punished and is put into danger, but the rest of the series is pure wish fulfillment.<br /><br />as one critic said, these aren't failed adult movies but successful kid's movies.
