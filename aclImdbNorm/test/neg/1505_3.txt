ok end of the story is - all the kills were a joke on the main character and no one is actually dead. yes i know cry wolf did it and did it well, but this isn't "cry wolf", it's "scream crap"! even though the "characters" don't apparently die, we see them get stabbed to death (and other ways they are killed) even though these "kills" do not take place as anyone can see them. mr. director, if you're gonna show people getting killed, someone needs to see it, if they're off camera and the character getting faked killed is alone it doesn't work - and until the end i liked a couple of scenes but your end ruined the whole thing.<br /><br />the acting is horrid (especially the kid at the beginning who really thinks he tricked his friends into believing they were playing with his dead grandmothers brains) the script is less-than half baked (though if you're half baked you might like the movie) the only reason i gave this movie a 3 is because a) they actually made something b) they got it released and c) they shot on film yes you read right, they wasted (at least) $5,000 on film stock for this crap. sad, if they'd shot dv they'd had some cash for a better cast and another writer to go through the script and make it good.<br /><br />i admire the fact that the director made something (as most don't) but hatwe the fact that he comes on imdfb talking about how "original" the movie is.<br /><br />avoid the movie if it means buying it to see, if a friend has it, it might be a funny movie to borrow.
