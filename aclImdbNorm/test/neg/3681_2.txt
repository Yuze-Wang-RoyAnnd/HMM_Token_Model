i was hooked in by the premise that the show was about demons. from hell. and a doorway to hell. what i didn't realize was that i would be watching some guys run around tunnels chased by small children who may / may not have been demons for the entire movie. sure there was some dialogue in between, and great underground scenery but the lack of a plot, developed characters, any twists or development in the story at all was sorely lacking. oh, and out of interest, there were no special effects. the entire budget was spent on actors salaries, sets and lots of time running around with a camera underground.<br /><br />the ending was one of the typical lackluster boring endings that makes you say "i endured this film of boredom for that!?" if you want to see demons and a doorway to hell, i promise you that you would be better off served watching the trailers to the game hellgate : london which while shorter than this movie at 5 minutes, pack more dialogue, character development, action, plot and satisfying conclusions than this.<br /><br />the second star is for effort, but overall a low score for failing to make a movie that stands out, and for promising in the tagline much more than what was delivered.
