i saw this on cable. someone had to lose their job for greenlighting this one for air. just because a movie is made does not mean it has to be shown! savage instinct should be shown in all film classes. it is the perfect template for how to not make a movie. the editing alone is so jumbled you'll think it was assembled by a team of trained (poorly) monkeys, traveling across unpaved canyon road in the back of a jeep, blindfolded and drunk. the audio is often not legible. acting? i can't call anything i saw here acting. reciting? hmmm. can't call it that either. failing? that works. all that being said...it is hilarious! i cannot stress enough that there is not one redeemable factor in this "film" other than the hilarity derived from it's own incredible ineptness. fun, in a strictly masochistic sort of way. watch it...if you dare.
