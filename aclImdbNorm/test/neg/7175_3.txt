this is a bottom of the barrel type of b-film from one of the poverty row studios, monogram, in the mid-'40s, the kind that filled out a double bill.<br /><br />only reason i watched was to see what jackie moran was like in a leading role as a page boy at a radio station who attempts to solve a murder. he played phil meade in gone with the wind only two years earlier and this was one of his last teen-aged roles. he's no mickey rooney.<br /><br />the script is as hapless as the production values and is full of clich'e ridden situations with a cast of uniformly untalented individuals. wanda mckay is the switchboard girl who is "discovered" by a radio producer and sidney miller is the nerdy friend of the hero who's afraid of his own shadow.<br /><br />mercifully, it's over in an hour when the murder is solved after a round-up of all the suspects. terribly overacted, the only quiet performance of any interest is given by jon gilbreath as tex, the cowboy, but he bites the dust after too brief an appearance.<br /><br />there are several songs, but all of them are forgettable, as are the lame jokes and dialog.
