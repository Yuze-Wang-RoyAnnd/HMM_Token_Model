return to frogtown was a hard film to track down. well, i accomplished that mission and it had been sitting on the shelf for a good while. wish it was kept that way! first, sam hell is of course not roddy piper. he is replaced by a dude with a large face, less charisma, and this poor actor is very soft-spoken for the part! sam hell is supposed to be rebellious and awesome. here, he gets captured three times! what kind of a hero is that?! spangle is replaced as well here by another actress. why did we not get different characters here? this was stupid! lou ferrigno stars in this film and he is not even the hero. common sense says let lou be the hero of the film! bad effects, poor acting, and just a forgettable film. funny as they take shots at ninja turtles 2 with the whole concert scene in this movie. at least ninja turtles 2 was funny and not a bad movie! i really wanted to like return to frogtown, but i just cringed when the fight scenes would commence. this film makes turtles 3 look like gold! avoid this or you will be the one singing "meaner, greener, talking turtle tv dinner!"
