i saw this movie years about 8 years ago when it first came out, and the only memories that i have about it are : 1. that it was awful. 2. that in one scene linnea quigley applies suntan lotion to her arms and legs repeatedly for about 15 minutes straight (it seemed that long anyways). 3. one scene where a character gets a sledgehammer rammed into his head. in this scene, when the hammer connects, the head smashes like glass. it's quite bad.
