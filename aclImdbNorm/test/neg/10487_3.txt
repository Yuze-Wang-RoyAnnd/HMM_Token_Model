what? - that was it? the town sheriff (john agar) blows up the mutant gorilla with a stick of dynamite hidden in a mannequin? did i just write that? did i just see that? <br /><br />with instrumentals by the wildcats, "night fright" is one flick that never deserved to be made as late as 1967. the heyday of the gorilla was well over, and anyone other than ray corrigan in an ape suit is just asking for trouble. remake this in black and white and set the story about thirty years earlier and you'd have at least a 4.0 rating on the imdb. but sadly, this one never should have stood a chance of seeing the light of day. oops, there's another quirk - you can never tell if it's day or night in the story, since they seem interchangeable with one another.<br /><br />i'll give you this though, a couple of the early malt shop scenes looked like they could have gone on the air as coke commercials. thinking about it now, those were probably the best looking and best lit scenes of the picture; coca cola must have paid for them. had they seen the completed movie, they might have been better served to prevent it's release.
