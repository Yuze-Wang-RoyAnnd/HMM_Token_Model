i had noticed this movie had been on cinemax a lot lately, so this morning, i decided to watch it. i had just finished the infiltrator, which is a great movie, and i thought this looked good as well. from the description the cable had, atleast. this film was awful. it's slow, the pacing is horrible, it feels as tho it lasts 4 hours. there's no real plot to speak of...agh! how can anyone say anything good about this movie. rickman is good...but he always is...the other two characters work well, but there's no real story to support any of it. after 2 hours, and you sitting there wondering what on earth is going on, where on earth is the plot- it ends with a surprise that frankly just made me sick. don't bother with this one.
