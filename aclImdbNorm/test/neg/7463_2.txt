the attic starts off well. the somewhat dreary story is helped greatly by the two main actors and there's a semblance of a character study going on here but the film goes downhill fast when carrie snodgress' character buys a monkey. not one of those cute little monkeys. she buys a real big chimpanzee!!!<br /><br />this sudden plot device basically kills the movie. it's just not conceivable for a woman like the one snodgress plays, who has a hard time doing anything because of her domineering father, for her to, out of the blue, buy a chimpanzee. i mean, come on! forget about it!
