i went to see "quitting" with high hopes, because the director's "shower" had impressed me so. despite a few lapses into mawkishness, "shower" ranks high on my list of all-time favorite movies for its penetrating insight into family relationships and its generally superb acting and direction. and i've seen it at least three times now.<br /><br />but "quitting" fell flat, in my estimation. it seemed a pointless exercise and i was quickly so tired of the main character's insufferable personality that i was longing for the movie to end. i admit to falling asleep six or seven times, but it was only for a few seconds at a time, so i think it's still ok to write this comment.<br /><br />i did admire the parents and sister. the device of using all real characters in the film is a nice one i've never seen used before.<br /><br />disappointment aside, i will still make an effort to see any film bearing yang zhang's name, simply on the basis of the beautiful "shower."
