greetings, moviegoers! as i watch octopus ii, i contemplate the inherent lameness of the octopus/croc/dino horror genre. many moviegoers may blame the poor acting, nonsensical screenplay, or poorly constructed plot as the reasons that cause the ocd movie to flounder. these reasons may indeed be floundering factors, but it is the inherent difficulty of filming an ocd movie that is at the heart of the lameness.<br /><br />you see, the technology does not yet exist to make a realistic, life-size ocd and the cgi technology currently used by studios lacks the ability to blend in smoothly with real world environments and characters. even with clever cinematography, you can only film the semi-dark depths of the sea/semi-dark forest/semi-dark cave/semi-dark corridor so many times before the sci-fi aficionado becomes bored with the genre entirely (the ocd sub-genre, that is).<br /><br />what can be done, you ask? i wouldn't suggest that the genre surrender to cheesiness, but another avenue needs to be explored. we can't really go back to the days of the "fade-to-black" cue that someone has been killed. or can we? if we can't reach the goal of realism, we have to compensate in other ways, such as plot twists, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity.<br /><br />it will be through ingenious and alternate methods that the disease of lameness, so common to the ocd sub-genre, will be cured.
