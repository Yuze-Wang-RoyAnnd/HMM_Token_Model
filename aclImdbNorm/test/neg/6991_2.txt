i actually liked this movie. sure, the acting was flat, there was no plot, and the villain was the lamest that i've seen. michael bernardo as dante is worth laughs in his own right, with an incredibly funny catchphrase and evil laugh. but its worth seeing, just for the worst explosion you will ever see outside of the power rangers tv series. you'll know it when you see it. honestly, this movie must have the budget of a low grade porno. i almost stopped watching after an hour, but i recommend watching through the whole thing; at the very least, there's plenty of eye candy for all to enjoy. recommended for viewers with a high tolerance to poor movies.
