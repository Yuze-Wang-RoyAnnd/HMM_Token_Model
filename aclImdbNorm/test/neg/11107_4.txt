first off let me say that this movie is nothing spectacular. the cast is like the saved by the bell reunion, the monster is a guy in a bad outfit and like always; the military is useless. it would seem that the more training you have and the bigger your gun, the more likely it is that you will die if you're in a cheesy low budget horror movie. apparently the people in the movie business have little respect for the navy seals, the marines and ninjas, who get it the worst. the plot is thin, a nutcase cryptozoologist by the name of dr. pe~na traps the chupacabra. he then smuggles it aboard a cruise ship where two members of the crew let it loose. you can do your taxes and watch this movie and not miss a beat. the most noteworthy part that really makes it all worthwhile revolves around the captains daughter. toward the end she goes all martial arts on the monster and kicks his butt. let me get this straight, the monster wipes out the entire navy seals unit, while they are using armor piercing ammunition!! ok, its a movie it can happen right? but here comes the captains daughter who can't be older than 19 and kicks the crap out of the chupacabra with front and side kicks. it was hilarious. they should get a medal for coming up with that.
