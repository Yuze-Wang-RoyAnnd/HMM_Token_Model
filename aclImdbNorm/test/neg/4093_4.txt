this was a flick doomed from its conception. the very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre pg-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a pg-rated family movie. i wasn't the least bit interested. then came the trailer. not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the entire movie; and i'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer. it's like a 3-minute cliff's notes version of the flick. so obviously i wasn't gonna pay to see it, but once it hit dvd, i thought sure, i'll watch it for free. maybe steve carell can save it.<br /><br />nope.<br /><br />i'm still baffled as to why he signed on for this. he must have owed someone a favor. the jokes were all so flat and obvious, and the director obviously asked him to go for very broad comedy style like the original bruce almighty's jim carrey. but it's just not funny. the studio obviously tried to cash in on the success of 40-year-old virgin, complete with several of carell's past co-stars, a reference to the flick on a theater marquee, and another musical closing credits sequence. but even the talented carrell can't save this. his co-stars don't fare much better, with people like morgan freeman, jonah hill, and ed helms just wasted. wanda sykes isn't wasted, she's just a waste in anything she does, and her horrible one-liners and reactions just make you wish people would stop giving her work.<br /><br />the story itself is just predictable and lazy. it pounds you over the head with obvious foreshadowing, like evan's disregard for the environment (drives a gas-guzzling humvee, opts to use wood from endangered trees for his house, hates animals,...), and by the end it's just over-the-top preachy on both faith and the environment.<br /><br />why the movie was made at all is puzzling enough, but i really don't understand how it reportedly became the most expensive comedy ever. the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work i've ever seen. maybe the rental of the live animals on set cost a fortune. who knows. but whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure. but hey, it wasn't the worst film of the year by far. there's still plenty of worse duds like norbit and death proof.
