the title is a misnomer:the movie depicts barely one year of the so-called "divin marquis" .twas a hard time for him 'cause he was threatened by the guillotine :the quiet joys of the reign of terror .<br /><br />historically speaking,the background is rather sketchy: "the f^ete de l'et re supreme",robespierre's failed attempt to create a secular religion,his downfall ,a heaven sent opportunity for showing doctor guillotin's sinister machine at work (full speed).<br /><br />as far as sade is concerned ,it's a downright mediocre affair :he's waiting in a former nunnery with other nobles ,a golden cage if you compare it to ,say,marie-antoinette's or scientist lavoisier's fates,and he exchanges futile conversations with a young virgin about death,love and other trivia.there's the obligatory "daring" scene but you've got to be patient because it's a long time before it comes on the screen.and anyway ,by today's standards ,can we call that risqu'e? cy enfield's "de sade" ,which enjoys one of the lowest ratings of the imdb ,is at least entertaining ,and keir dullea was a more credible marquis than the aging auteuil.and it featured john huston.
