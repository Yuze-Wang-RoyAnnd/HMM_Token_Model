1) bad acting.<br /><br />2) for a bunch of castaways on an alien planet, it sure looked like home, especially with the houses and roads you can glimpse in the background.<br /><br />3) terrible plot with stupid caracters making idiotic decisions and blithely losing precious survival equipment and clothing left, right and center.<br /><br />4) cool 70's scifi jumpsuits (possibly the only good thing about this movie)<br /><br />5) interesting ship at the beginning (this crew must have been watching space 1999 a lot). too bad it blows up so early. the escape ship also got sunk too fast. *sigh*<br /><br />6) anthropologists might find some aspects of the movie interesting in terms of primate group behavior.
