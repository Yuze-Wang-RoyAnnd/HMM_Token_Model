a bit too much mediterrenean machismo for me. the cast was beautiful, lovely to watch in all of the romantic scenes. the locale was beautiful with azure skies and azure water. it just was not convincing to me that such an egomaniac crud bent on nothing but his building, could attract so many beautiful, vulnerable, women. only in the mediterranean i guess. certainly in no world i am familiar with. the macho men were really obnoxious, and i found it difficult to believe that the female characters could have anything to to with them for so long. the screenplay, cinematography, directing, etc. was set up to deliver a class b film, the central effort being on showing scenes of beautiful exposed female breasts. it was aesthetically nice for a while but it could not sustain a very mediocre film.
