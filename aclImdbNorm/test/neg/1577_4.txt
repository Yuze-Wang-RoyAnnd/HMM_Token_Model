after a snowstorm, the roads are blocked and the highway patrolman jason (adam beach) comes to the diner of his friend fritz (jurgen prochnow) and advises his clients that they will only be able to follow their trips on the next day. among the weird strangers, jason meets his former sweetheart nancy (rose mcgowan), who has just left her husband in los angeles. along the night, without any communication with his base, jason faces distressful and suspicious situations with the clients, and finds some corpses, indicating that among them there is a killer.<br /><br />"the last stop" could be an average thriller, but the screenplay is simply awful. most of the characters are despicable persons and the motives of the surprising serial killer are never disclosed, and the viewers have no further explanation why the killer decided to kill the guests. my vote is four.<br /><br />title (brazil): "encurralados" ("trapped")
