this self-important, confusing b+w "film" watches like an infant on a very bad acid trip. you're dealing with something that reminds you of a piece of rotting lettuce that accidentally fell out of the back of a garbage truck: no one cares to touch it because it will probably be washed away on its own down the storm drain. there's no room for plot when you've got "visceral imagery" and "subtle" allegory. to me, it seems like the director tries to make the next great art movie while begging for intellectual accolades. i didn't bring my beret either. watching this, i felt almost insulted since the "film" does such an effective job of distancing itself from you.
