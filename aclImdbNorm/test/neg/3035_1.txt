this film really misses the mark on most fronts. the accents are laughably weak, the acting amateurish and the comedy weak at best.<br /><br />they've got a great idea, it could have been particularly enjoyable but for the reasons mentioned above.<br /><br />the writer seems to think by putting the word f*ck into every sentence it'll make it funnier and the main character just seems to try a little too hard. he's no brick top thats for sure.<br /><br />next time at least get a cast that can keep the accent for the whole film.<br /><br />it's a crime to compare this to films like the business, lock stock and snatch.
