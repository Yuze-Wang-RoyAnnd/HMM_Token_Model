how many monster tree movies can you see in a lifetime?well i'll go out on a limb and say one.this movie is better watched late at night,with a 12 pack of beer, the sound off and you and your friends making up the dialogue.<br /><br />on a pacific island a young man is sentenced to death for consorting with the "evil americans".(seems his loving wife has been sleeping with the witch doctor and they set him up to die so the doc' can be king).well he vows to come back and wreak revenge.<br /><br />before you can shake a stick the goofy natives run to the american scientists' hut screaming"tobanga come!"<br /><br />it seems the young corpse has done just that as tobanga, the walking tree monster. yes his revenge is terrible (and so is this movie).it seems that these natives cannot run from a lumbering tree so he tosses them in quicksand,rolls them down hills etc.pretty soon the new king wants to trade his woman or kingdom for an axe or a chainsaw.<br /><br />general problems with this movie are numerous. the comedy relief is an obnoxious woman with a cockney accent (like this movie needs comedy).you want her to die upon her first appearance.the leading lady is whiny.the leading man is a boor.the acting is wooden (pun intended).the dialogue is stiff and lumbering.the natives have brooklyn accents.the monster suit is pure giggles.<br /><br />while this is a bad movie it still is fun to watch.it gets a 3 on unintentional laughs alone.your dog may rate it just a bit higher but only if the tree wasn't mobile.
