this movie was pretentious, foppish and just down right not funny. the filming technique reminded me of mtv. i am a fan of hartley. but what was he thinking of? so much more thought could have gone into this movie, considering the subject matter. this could have been a true theoretical battle over good and evil, but hartley, it appears used the stand technique of psyching out the viewer.
