this is just about one of the dumbest things i've ever seen. maybe not a worst movie ever contender, but if you haven't seen that many bad ones, this could easily make your top ten worst list. when you consider what was achieved in 1933 with the original "king kong", you've got to ask yourself why anyone would stoop so low as to produce this debacle. then, taking it one step further and realizing that the quantum leap to "star wars" the following year achieved a new level in sci-fi entertainment, this offering will make you laugh and cry at the same time.<br /><br />now let me ask you, what would possess the professor (peter cushing) to bring along an umbrella as a prime piece of subterranean research equipment for the ride to the earth's core? ok, so it was useful in fending off the parrot/tyrannosaur (parrotosaurus?) in the early going, but come on. somehow i don't think this is what edgar rice burrough's had in mind when he wrote his tales of pellucidar. he probably didn't have caroline munro in mind either as princess dia, probably the only redeeming factor to this whole escapade.<br /><br />at least there was one bit of pseudo-scientific explanation that i got a kick out of; i'm always looking for one in films like this. that would have to be how the sky at the earth's core was really the underside of the earth's crust, explaining that ethereal pinkish glow. but try as it might, the story just couldn't hook me in a way to find anything at all interesting about hoojah the sly one or jubal the ugly one, much less those goofy half man, half pterodactyl creatures. to paraphrase the good professor - "you cannot mesmerize me, i'm paying attention!"
