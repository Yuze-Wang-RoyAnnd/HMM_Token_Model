hello it is i derrick cannon and i welcome you to the first ever cannonite review show. my movie for this week was debatable, what route what movie, what excellent four star epic would i choose, guess what i decided to pull a one eighty and go the other route, i've decided to review a movie so atrocious that it totally killed what could have been a very unique concept. the movie i will review today is jack frost two revenge of the mutant killer snowman. the stars in this movie include christopher allport as sam tiller, eileen seeley as anne tiller, marsha clark as marla david allen brooks as agent manners, sean patrick murphy as captain fun, ray cooney as the colonel and scott macdonald as the killer snowman himself jack frost.<br /><br />it's hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that gave us the incredibly funny jack frost(loved the carrot scene),but it's even harder to believe that this is the exact same cast. the movie was ruined for me as soon as they arrived on the island and captain fun was introduced. what was the point of his character and how did he fit into a horror movie?the only possible reason i could see was that they wanted to give us a character that was total killer snowman fodder. sam tiler seemed more paranoid then he did in the original, his babbling about anti freeze was one of the most pathetic display i had seen in a movie. his wife however was one of the few bright spots. she played her role as the main woman to a hilt. she was a voice of reason in film of pure idiocy. the scene where she figures out how to kill the snowmen was one of the most anticipated parts of the movie. ray macdonald once again did a great job as jack frost despite what he was given. if it wasn't for such weak characters he could have been immortalized like chucky,freddy and jason. laugh if you must but when it comes down to it jack frost had spunk, he had humor, and most importantly he had an undoubtable vicious streak.<br /><br />this movie could have been so much more, it could have been a continuation of a great franchise, instead any plans to make a jack frost three have been canceled.<br /><br />this movie gets a two out of ten for me, and it's lucky that it even gets a one.
