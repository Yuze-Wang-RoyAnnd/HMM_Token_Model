one thing i have noticed about british horror movies from the 1970s is that they don`t hold up to repeated viewing theatre of blood is a case in point as are all those amicus anthology movies . add the beast in the cellar to the list <br /><br />much of the drama of this movie revolves around the build up of a plot revelation at the end . once you know what the revelation is this becomes a rather flat film . it does open with a fairly good hook but after that we`re treated to long boring sequences of two old ladies making small talk . correct me if i`m wrong but how many people watch a horror movie expecting a couple of old ladies making small talk ? the only sort of interest to be found in the beast in the cellar is the anti-smoking stance . some people have mentioned that this is an anti-war or anti-military film but watch carefully and you`ll see that everytime a squaddie lights up for a fly puff he gets killed . rather strange considering attitudes to smoking weren`t nearly so hysterical as they are nowadays
