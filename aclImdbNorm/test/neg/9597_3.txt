although many billie dove fans are delighted with her work here, i have to pass. as a socially prominent member of the british smart set, her british accent is basically non-existent and her line readings sound just like, well, line readings and her emoting seems trance-like and ponderous. basil rathbone, usually a fine actor, seems off-kilter throughout and also speaks with a weird sort-of-accent - in his case something like italian, though we cannot be sure. the script manages to keep his precise ethnicity a secret. he is further hampered by the script which gives him one of those old movie diseases, something to do with nerves, which requires surgery. the only real entertainment is provided by the illustrious kay francis sporting a lacquered bob with side curls in her role as a depraved countess who shamelessly devours men, including rathbone, and then spits them out. she pulls it off with her unique aplomb. she is the only living thing in this dead sea of a film.
