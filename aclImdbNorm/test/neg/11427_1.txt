this is really one of the worst movies i have seen in a while. it's not funny at all. it simply portrays a lower class northern british setting. i find it a very sad film at parts, at others cuts are where they shouldn't be. one thing that really annoyed me was the close ups of pointless objects it really slowed down the pace of the movie. i only made it through the movie because i fast forwarded certain sequences towards the end.<br /><br />this movie completely loses the attention of the audience. it's main problem is that it makes multiple reasons for one action, which in turn tends to weaken that action. however if there is one reason for one action it makes it more passionate. all in all this movie is all over the place. i didn't learn enough about the characters to care about them because of the shifting plot lines and stories where as i would have maybe enjoyed exploring the life of one character.<br /><br />for example at the beginning when the guy meets god in the bar, god seems like a cool guy. the movie could've elaborated on that moment and i think it would've been a lot funnier.<br /><br />anyway, enough if's. watch it if you want, but i'm warning you this film is crap. i respect the makers for trying to pull it off with such a low budget but they could've done a much better job. i guess it all lies in the camera movement and editing, the acting was decent. but then again, that's just my opinion.
