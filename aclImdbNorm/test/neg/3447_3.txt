coen brothers-wannabe from writer-director paul chart relies far too much on ideas lifted from other (better) movies, yet does manage to create a creepy atmosphere that keeps one watching. robert forster cuts loose as never before playing a psychopathic psychiatrist (ha ha) who goes on a killing spree in the desert. the film is unusual, but in its attempt to keep one step ahead of the audience, it becomes alienating and off-putting (with a role for amanda plummer that is downright humiliating). an admittedly bravura finale, many quirky bits of business--and forster looking great in the nude--make this a curiosity item, nothing more. veteran movie-director irvin kershner produced, and maybe should directed as well (could paul chart be a pseudonym?). *1/2 from ****
