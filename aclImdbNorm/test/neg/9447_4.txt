the lives of megan(jackie kresler)and dylan(shane elliott)change in the nevada desert between reno and las vegas. they stop to eat at a small greasy spoon where they reluctantly learn about the infamous area 51 by the caf'e proprietor(jonathan breck). after getting back on the road in their forty year old lincoln, the radio gets a little crazy broadcasting hitler's speech at the 1836 olympics and then later a 1958 news bulletin of elvis presley being drafted into the military. the car slowly breaks down and the two are in for the scare of their lives as mysterious unexplainable things happen in the lonely radiation-poisoned desert; remnants of nuclear testing. megan meets a lost little girl(channing nichols)and a wounded wwii soldier. the nightmarish journey doesn't end there. kresler is impressive to a degree and writer/director james lay makes good use of patsy cline tunes. all in all, moderately interesting sci-fi.
