what can be said about a movie that makes two hours seem like three weeks? the hero starts out in ninjaville, japan, goes through an identity crisis (saving a shinobi), makes a voyage to america (saving a slave named sam) engages in a little wild west action (saving a french/japanese native american named julie), goes hunting pirate's gold, and then heads back to japan to fight a war. the film obviously has no clue where it's going at any point in time; i think the director modeled each scene after the last movie he'd watched. if you're going to watch this film, i suggest renting the subtitled so you and your peers can openly discuss how dumb the movie is without speaking over the movie, potentially missing another dumb plot twist.<br /><br />movies the director was watching during the making of this movie - an american tail, fievel goes west, star wars, indiana jones, the goonies, teenage mutant ninja turtles, kung fu, vampire hunter d, the ten commandments.<br /><br />notes of interests - most fear inspiring line of all time. about 90 minutes (or 19 days) into the movie, the lead character has just bested an american villain, and just as one heads to the vcr to end the pain the hero proclaims "let's go back to japan", and the agony continues for another week.
