i expected this movie to be absolutely god awful. like "what dreams may come" or "the truman show" or something. well they were selling it off for lb3.99 in my local hmv and it had giovanni ribisi on the cover, you know you cant help but love him, and so my friends dared me to buy it. and i was sure it was going to be trash. maybe thats the only reason i could sit through this movie, because my standards were never that high.
