well, the first thing i saw after looking at the dvd box was "best screenplay" and thought this would be a good rental. wow, was i mistaken! i'm sure at one time there was a good movie in here, but after the incredibly poor acting and "video game" production values, this ends up looking like tron's retarded half-brother. the first scene sets up the overall atmosphere of the entire movie. five minutes into it, you'll be asking yourself, "what the hell am i watching?", and it will just snowball from there. an awful soundtrack that makes every song sound like rob zombie's "dragula" rounds out this miserable piece of crap into a laughably bad movie. on a side note, #3 most romantic quote in a movie - "i think you're the final destination."
