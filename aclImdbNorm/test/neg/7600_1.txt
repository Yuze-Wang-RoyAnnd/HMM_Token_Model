beethovan lives upstairs is a very bad movie. in my world history class, our teacher had us watch this movie and amadeus to be able to compare the two composers or something. we watched amadeus first and it was a very good movie, but when she had us watch this movie directly after that, i couldn't believe what i was seeing. the acting was horrific, the costumes were ugly (the little boy's was especially ugly and girlish), and the cinematography was z-grade. my friend compared it to a home movie without the date display in the bottom right corner. i understand this was a t.v. movie from canada and probably cost $10 to make, but please, they could have done better. i have seen a few good t.v. movies in my time, but this was not one of them. the biggest thing that i don't understand is why my world history class couldn't just watch immortal beloved or something. how is it possible to compare composers when given the movie amadeus, for mozart, and beethovan lives upstairs, for beethovan? it's not possible to do that when this is the choice of movie for beethovan. i give amadeus an a- (9 out of 10) if anyone cares to know, but beethovan lives upstairs gets an f (1 out of 10).
