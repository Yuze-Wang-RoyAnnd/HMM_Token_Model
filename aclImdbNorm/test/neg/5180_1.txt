the motion picture association of america has seen fit to advise potential viewers and this is particularly useful to parents and guardians that this film which is hereby titled "frostbite" is given a "r" rating.the "r" rating has specific information which allows any person who not knowing anything about a film to know something about what this film provides.the "r" was instituted for sexual content including nudity and perverse dialog,language, crude sense of humor and drug use.there is no reward in viewing such a film though it would be useful to know if this could be removed as a possibility at all i would as this reviewer remove such a possibility.this is a film whereby merely a 1 was not the equal to a number as it did not qualify as a film to be counted,in fact such as this purpose is with this film so should such a purpose be with this films place at all.this is a unwholesome and undesirable offerring that should of been given a much stricter interpretation because at no point is conduct or language suitable for viewing and this kind of film may wish for a blacklist rather than a stricter definition as to its content.it is suggested hereby that the stricter definition would allow,it is hereby put forth a criminal charge.it may any way irregardless of its rating.this is a unsavory world which would damage any persons viewing this film as its purpose is to commit an offense.it is an offense and it is offensive in its purpose.there is no sense of humor in the film but a depraved and indifferent purpose as to its undesirable underpinning.without reservation this is a do not see list and perhaps not entirely necessary to say to any adults considering but to any whose interests concern the environment to which there children grow up in,do not allow nor provide any young person the viewing of this film it is unfriendly.society often sends the wrong message when these kinds of problems are in the public domain let this not be one of those times.
