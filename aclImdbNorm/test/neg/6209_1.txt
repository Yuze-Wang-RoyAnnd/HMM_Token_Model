there wasn't a 0 in the voting option so i was compelled to use the next available figure.<br /><br />it is a sad day for bollywood when such type of movies which have star-cast actors is nothing more are than a bunch of juvenile acting, and an awful script.<br /><br />this movie is nowhere near to be called a clone of hitch. salman khan with his usual take-off-you-shirt theme and govinda with his in-humorous laughs. if somebody had told 2 decades ago that i would be writing a comment on salman (after his success with maine pyar kiya), i would have written him/her off.
