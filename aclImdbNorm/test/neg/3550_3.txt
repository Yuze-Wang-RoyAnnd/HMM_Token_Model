it starts really interesting - the story develops around the main character, who runs a "cleaning business", specialized in cleaning up crime scenes. as a former cop, he runs into some strange situation, when one job does suddenly "offically vanish". furthermore, he discovers some relation to an investigation into police corruption. his "columbo feeling" is justified, the deeper he gets into the background of the story. the good actors (jackson, ed harris, eva mendes) play in an suspenseful story with some twists --- but only up to the last 25 minutes. (up to here 7 of 10 stars). spoiler:::: suddenly the movie looses its touch and in the end there is a completely unnecessary shoot-out, involving the 14-year old daughter, a betrayal of friendship and a not justified righteousness out of the character development... why not having cutler giving up his investigation for the sake of the friendship? or having the daughter discovering some facts? or ... many possible much better story finishes are imaginable... a truly wasted ending!
