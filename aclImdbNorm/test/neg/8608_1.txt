....so why on earth would i see 'sex lives of the potato men'? answer: johnny vegas and mackenzie crook. vegas i have seen live and thoroughly enjoyed. i think he is an intelligent and unique intellectual comic who manages to retain extreme oafishness. crook i know only from probably the greatest comedy of the last 10 years along with 'alan partridge', 'the office'. as gareth he was simply hilarious, and i was interested in how he would convert to another character on the big screen.<br /><br />ok. so me and the boyfriend went down to the multiplex last night and the film was very funny, only because the mediocre nonsense dialogue and banter ferris and dave had was delivered with aplomb and enthusiasm by the talent of vegas and crook. they are destined for better things (have done better already infact) and i even believe vegas would make a decent straight actor. the trite scenes where he says he misses his wife came almost close to touching, although the **spoiler** tacked on scene at the end where he is taken back by his wife needed to be lengthened, it just wasnt believable. and throughout the film vegas only appears to miss his wife 2 or 3 times.<br /><br />the film became grotesquely unfunny and plain old, well, grotesque, when sex was mentioned. not, i add, when it was shown on screen. tolly's gratuitous explanation of what was in his sandwiches and why was not even slightly funny, and just made me feel a little bit ill. also totally unneccisary was the inclusion of the character of jeremy picking his nose, before showing a close up of the bogey on his finger. just him picking his nose would have raised a smile, he was a pathetic character and it would have just made him look as low as possible, but showing the snot close up was just not needed and was rank.<br /><br />one scene i did think was hilarious involving sex was vegas in the threesome. his blokish conversation with the second bloke just highlighted the fact that threesomes arent always endless ecstasy. not that i'd know.....<br /><br />that's about all i can say really. i will end with this, and this is actually my main critique of the film. this is supposed to revive the british film industry. it is no 'trainspotting' that is for sure....it isn't even a 'love actually' (you'd have to have a heart of stone not to throw up at that one), and 3 million pounds really could have been put into a better project. 'mike basset england manager' was a wonderful little known british comedy and was made for far less than 3 million. i only hope that the bfc will learn from 'sex lives of the potato men' and not get so gratuitous in future. although the terrible reviews this film is getting are only enhancing the box office takings. :-)
