"mame" is a disgrace to many things--to lucille ball, to a story which has been told better many times over, and to the musical genre altogether. ms. ball does not understand her character at all and she seems to be heavily sedated. bea arthur is good, but it is not enough. the production is very shoddy and cheap looking, the songs are sub-par, and nearly every joke misfires. also, lucy couldn't dance well, so the music had to be slowed down to a funerial pace. avoid at all costs, but do see the delightful "auntie mame."
