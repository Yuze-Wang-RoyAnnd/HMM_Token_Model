but then again, what ever is? i picked this up at my local 99cent store for, you guessed it, 99 cents (plus tax). i remember seeing this on video as a teen and thinking it was a cool flick. too bad the film and my memories don't match. regardless, its not a too horrible way to blow a couple hours, and it is neat to see some vintage bill paxton and mark hamill. blah.... blah.... blah.... man, oh man, i cannot think of anything else to say about this flick... (just filling space to meet the ten line rule...) good golly, this is pathetic, just how bad is this movie that the best i could come up with in regards to it were five frickin'lines of text? so anyway, ten lines of text, eh? hmmm, ten lines are hard to come by when you can't remember squat about a film you just watched.
