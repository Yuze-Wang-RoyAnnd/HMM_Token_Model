in pasadena, mrs. davis (joanna cassidy) sends her daughter aubrey davis (amber tamblyn) to tokyo to bring her sister karen davis (sarah michelle gellar), who is interned in a hospital after surviving a fire, back to the usa. after their meeting, karen dies and aubrey decides to investigate what happened to her and gets herself cursed in the same situation, being chased by the ghost of the house. meanwhile in tokyo, the three high school mates allison (arielle kebbel), vanessa (teresa palmer) and miyuki (misako uno) visit the famous haunted house and are also cursed and chased by the ghost. in chicago, trish (jennifer beals) moves to the apartment of her boyfriend bill (christopher cousins), who lives with his children, the teenager lacey (sarah roehmer) and boy jake (matthew knight). on the next door, weird things happen with their neighbor.<br /><br />"the grudge 2" has scary sound and visual effects, with the creepy woman and boy, and i have startled a couple of times while watching this movie. however, the complex screenplay with three subplots is totally confused, making the entwined story a complete mess. there are too much characters and situations, and in a certain moment i was completely lost with the disconnected and fragmented narrative. in the end, i was completely disappointed with this confused, but also spooky film. my vote is four.<br /><br />title (brazil): "o grito 2" ("the scream 2")
