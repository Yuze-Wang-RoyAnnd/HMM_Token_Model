this is a rip-off from cellular. <br /><br />bad casting... <br /><br />bad direction... <br /><br />bad music...<br /><br />and the list goes on...<br /><br />well there was no direction since story, scenes and setting were lifted straight off of other movie. <br /><br />even fight sequence is copied. one with the mace was from kill bill and another one with fire hose was from either a jet li's or jackie chan's movie (i am not able to recall the name of this movie)... <br /><br />stay away from this cheap imitation and try to see the real thing... <br /><br />cannot expected something original from any of the bhatts any more!!!
