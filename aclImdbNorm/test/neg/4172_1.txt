apparently this was an award winner. apparently someone had a gun against his/her head and was force to nominate maize: the movie.<br /><br />or this must have been a mistake.<br /><br />this is the most unwatchable movie ever made. the screening and the editing is the biggest horror of this movie. two little girls get lost in a cornfield and get stalked by someone who can be heard laughing under his rubber mask. the little girls run into their hero dad, and then runs away from him, w.t.f.? the hero dad in the movie keeps losing track of them in the few minutes of watching this.<br /><br />the girls obviously weren't trained actors, and had no common sense to them. they were so annoying and so infantile in the movie, it not even remotely comedic. hearing them scream over and over again like a broken record was the reason why i got up and left. you can't even listen to this movie without nearly going into convulsions.<br /><br />i can puke a better award winner than this garbage.
