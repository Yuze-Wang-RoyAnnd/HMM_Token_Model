carson daly has to be the only late night talk show host that isn't a comedian. what was nbc thinking! he's not funny! the writing is horrible to! all of the sketches are painful to watch. the current new karaoke isn't funny at all, especially since he tells you what they are going to sing before they sing it! the escalator interviews is just stupid and needless to say not funny at all. all he jokes, especially during the monologue, are the least clever, dumbest, not funny jokes ever put on television! i mean, anytime he makes a jessica simpson joke he ends it with "because she's stupid," which cancels out any funniness that was in the joke, which was already very low. any 3 year old could have come up with any of the jokes and sketches they put on this lame excuse for a show. seriously, don't watch this show, unless you're on the edge of suicide and want something to push you over the edge.
