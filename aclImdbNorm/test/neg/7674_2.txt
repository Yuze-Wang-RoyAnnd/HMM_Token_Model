this is what happens when a franchise gets lazy, and no one can think of a new twist to add. remember what happened to the "childs play" series? the first three were played as horror films, with genuine scares (albeit predictable) that held true to the theme of the movie. then they ran out of folks for the doll to stalk, and decided to play it for laughs, with the next two being black comedies.....<br /><br />well, that;s what happened here, but i think it was not meant to be like that. kind of like saying, "i wanted to make pancakes for dessert! i did this on purpose!" when your souffl'e accidentally fizzles flat. but the milk was spilled, and it had some value in the theaters as a goof.<br /><br />when the floor ripped out from under the passenger seats, i sort of expected the passengers to extend their legs through the hole, start running flintstones-style, to safely land the plane in the alps. i did. it would have fit into the silly campy theme of the rest of the show.<br /><br />instead of pointing out the obvious physical impossibilities of the film, what about the social implausibilities? like having george kennedy's character react calmly to the news that his date was a whore? even back in 1979, a man would not easily accept the notion that he has just poured his heart out to a paid companion. he supposedly felt he made a connection with a kindred spirit, who is subsequently shown to be a mercenary sex-worker with a come-on line. who wouldn't feel cheated by the experience? and yet he giggles, and wraps his arms around his buddy's waist as they merrily stroll off. what a cheap wrap up of a sleazy scene. ouch.<br /><br />i had an appetite for souffl'e, and got served insipid clich'e pancakes. and no, you did not do it on purpose!
