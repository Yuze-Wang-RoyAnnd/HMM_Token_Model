it is a shame that a movie with such a good cinematography as this one had no plot to be supported by the work of sarah cawley (cinematography) and adam lichtenstein (film editing), and above all, no sense of what goes on in mexico city. the movie tries to be a very realistic depiction of life in city, but it is unable to do it. it is a shame, a lot of film wasted. an american woman tries to find her brother who has been kidnaped. the first account of the story is powerful and interesting, very realistic, but it seems that there was no effort to come with a better narrative of the ordeal, especially when it comes to the issue of the attitudes of the us embassy personnel in mexico city, when dealing with an issue like this one. compare, as an example, with frantic(1988), which deals with a similar issue. something similar can be said of the role of local authorities. compare, as an example, with todo el poder (1999). the movie is worth watching if you want to get a sense of the looks of the city itself, paying little or no attention to the rather weak "plot" and the many twists that require a rather extensive suspension of disbelief. who is going to believe that a mexican patrol from mexico city is going to go all the way to catch the main characters to the mexico-us border? and that this policeman is going to be able to use its radio from the border to mexico city! only the producers of this movie. it is worth mentioning that unlike frida and other movies about mexico at least in these one mexicans talk spanish.
