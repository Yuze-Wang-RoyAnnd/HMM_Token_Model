i give this movie 2 stars purely because of its slightly liberal plot line. without going into too much detail.<br /><br />the acting in this movie is terrible. really terrible - wooden, shallow.<br /><br />the graffiti on show is weak, so bloody weak that i can only wonder why they bothered to use graffiti artists at all. it was obvious in the spraying scenes that they'd gotten other people in to do the 'work'. they might as well have let the actors do the painting and saved themselves a few cents.<br /><br />i would avoid this film at all costs.<br /><br />the kid loco soundtrack used to be something i listened to on my ipod, its going to be a while before i can go back there for fear of this movie coming back into my mind.<br /><br />avoid at all costs. unless you are thinking to yourself "wow, its been a while since i've seen a really sh*t movie...."
