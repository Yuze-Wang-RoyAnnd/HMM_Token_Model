the untold... is one of the worst films i ever saw. the story really seems original, but it was badly bestow on screen. lance henriksen, a good actor, ended up in this crap. but, hey he made a lot of low budget films... you need to pay the bills, you know? kidding. lance is a great actor, but he ended up with this bunch of silly actors. seriously, andrea roth was there just to have a nudity scene, and other actors... well they were just there. there was constantly a fade out-fade in editing, and that makes me sick! that was the most horrible move that just keeps on coming and it really makes you angry. it was also very predictable, boring and slow. it has a bizarre tempo that goes just... wrong.<br /><br />can't say more... don't rent it, or buy it. you can watch it, if on tv.
