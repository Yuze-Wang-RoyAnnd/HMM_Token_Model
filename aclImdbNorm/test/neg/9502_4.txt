(only light spoilers in here)<br /><br />stealing sinatra is a half-slapstick comedy about dimwit kidnappers, dimwit victims, and a few other side-stories thrown in to eat up some time.<br /><br />you will see some poor performances all around in this movie. the drama is forced, and the humor makes no sense. whether you're watching the kidnappers threaten the victim who won't shut up, or a victim's father responding to the criminal's death threat with "care for some tea?", none of it is believable. this quite comfortably fits into the "wannabe movie" category.<br /><br />you will also be listening to a repetitive goofy music track throughout pretty much the entire movie. it's quite unprofessional, and adds nothing. it's really just a sad attempt at making an achingly unfunny movie seem somewhat witty.<br /><br />however, if you're able to look past all of this and suspend a lot of disbelief, you might be entertained by the adequate storyline.<br /><br />i voted 4/10.
