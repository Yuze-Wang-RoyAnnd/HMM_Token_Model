as with most viewers of this film, i'm an avid reader of the books. the first 2 films have buck, ray and chloe as the main characters but in this the second sequel they play second-fiddle to louis gossett jr's presidential effort. world at war is based on the meeting he has with buck in the book series.<br /><br />the problem is - this film is as awful as the first two. amanda appears just from nowhere and suddenly has a significant part to play (i won't reveal it in case anyone hasn't read the series). other illogical parts feature. i really really want cloud 10 to make a good left behind film but sadly this is similar in all the bad ways to the first 2.
