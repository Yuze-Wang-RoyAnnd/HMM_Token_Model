i have to say that there is one redeeming speck in regards to this "film". it firmly establishes the bottom of the barrel. now filmmakers know what to aim above when making a movie. other than that i regret watching this debacle. what shameless abandon the making of this "film" was. what a waste of $100,000 (that's right folks, one hundred thousand dollars). this "film" reminds me of that "adult video awards" show in which of group of "industrial prostitutes" stand up a praise themselves, believing that they are real actors, actresses and filmmakers. ironic then how i've watched blue movies with better acting, directing and writing. i also found it funny that the executive producer, justin ament, just had to be in the "movie". he plays deputy jake barker. i'm sure his "acting" career has taken off... ted pfiffer, the writer, has a part. he no doubt was wallowing in the clich'ed glory he created. it should be noted that carrie finklea has a lead role in the movie. you might remember her from gus van sant's 'elephant'. though i'm not too sure that she'll want to write this film on her resume. and i'm not sure which is a more depressing point; money was spent to make this film or people are going to watch it. along with 'torque', 'godsend' and 'sky captain and the world of tomorrow', one of the worst films, if not the worst film, of 2004.
