i give it a 2 - i reserve a 1 rating for guy ritchie and woody allen films. we don't even remember what this movie was about. the only thing we recall is one gunshot scene where the actors drop to the ground, roll to the other side of a hallway or something and then get back up shooting. it was like watching 80-year-olds with 2 broken legs trying to perform the 'stunts'. also, when the characters were driving in a truck, the engine noise (or radio? can't recall) would vanish entirely when the actors were talking.<br /><br />and, like others, we bought it because of the sandra bullock front cover. very sad, very bad.
