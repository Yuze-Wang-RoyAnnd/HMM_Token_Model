just saw this at the cinema. i haven't read the books. there is nothing new about this film at all. <br /><br />the bad guys seem to die with a couple of slashes no matter how many times our hero has been stabbed with a big sword he keeps on going looking the same (ish)! there are several action scenes but they are very fake. filmmakers seem to be under the impression that whenever they cant be bothered to choreograph a fight scene they just move the camera up close, move fast and turn the music up......... this leaves me feeling conned yet again.<br /><br />i admire them for attempting to tackle a dark storyline without the normal hollywood cheese but i'm sorry to say the filmmakers have failed miserably. the characters are 2 dimensional. we hardly get to know them or feel for them at all. the lead has a charming farmers accent oo arrr..... though it seems he hasn't got much to say...<br /><br />don't bother watching this unless you are bored and got it half price from blockbusters....
