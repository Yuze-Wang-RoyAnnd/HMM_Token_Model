i love the beach boys and their music. so, being that i am a filmmaker, i thought, wow, a beach boys movie sounds great. well, wrong! i just actually turned off hdnet, the channel the movie was playing on, because it was so bad. someone above mentioned about editing... well, they should have at least looked at the monitors while they were filming. i don't know if anyone else caught the mustache falling off the face of one of the guys after he kissed his wife and then he smoothed it back on with his hands. ever heard of re-taking a scene! acting was terrible. direction was terrible. make-up was terrible!!! possibly the worst make-up job i have ever seen. brian wilson's "fat" cheek's looked like pl-ado. <br /><br />this is honestly the first time i have ever commented on imdb, and i know it really doesn't make a difference... but come on, what the hell were the producers thinking?!?!!?
