despite the excellent cast and the potential of the story, this movie fails on many levels. i was convinced that the director was a beginner. the movie is very poorly edited, shows a lot of non-important and annoying flashes, has very visible goofs and has no suspenseful atmosphere whatsoever. the question which repeatedly popped up in my mind while watching this was: "so what?". i couldn't care less about the protagonist and what happens to him. it's not that the story isn't compelling, it's simply the way it's told. the movie tells the story. period. it's like an actor who mumbles his lines, without knowing what he's saying. the movie simply tells the events that happen, without any soul. and the director's to blame. he doesn't know how to make something interesting or suspenseful or enjoyable. (and believe me, i'm not somebody who wants to see die hard 8 or 2 fast 2 crappy. on the contrary, i especially like slow-paced movies.) so i was convinced the director was a beginner. but to my amazement this man has years of experience and has worked as a cinematographer or camera assistant on a lot of marvelous productions. guess he had a bad year back then.
