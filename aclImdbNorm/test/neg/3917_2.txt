dennis hopper must've been really hungry to do this movie. atrocious special effects, very poor writing, cheesy dialogue, stupid-looking killer bio-robots. never mind the blatent disregard for science. the awkward scene with the 2 young leads taking their clothes off. the best part of this movie was the pull-start cyber-penis on the wacked-out cyborg pirate captain. 2 out of 10 stars because i'm in a generous mood.
