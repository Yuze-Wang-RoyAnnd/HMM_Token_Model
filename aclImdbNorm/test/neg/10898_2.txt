i've never made one of these before, but this movie was literally so bad i had to say something about it.<br /><br />i'm all for independent film-making as the past year has seen of the worst (in my opinion) of hollywood's showings, the mainstream just seems to have lost touch with what making good films is all about. that being said movies like this really give independent film a bad reputation.<br /><br />the characters are boring and too stupid to empathize with. the direction is horrible, the plotting is horrible, the plot itself is horrible, stay away, far away. only one brief scene featuring a female's nude breasts, and even that wasn't worth a second look.<br /><br />the scariest thing about this movie is the idea of ever having to watch it again. i gave it a 2 and not a 1 simply because the actors were visible and the sound was audible - it earns one point for each of those traits.
