from the acting, direction, scriptwriting and art direction this film is just entirely ill conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for land mine victims. when did we get so sad that they have to fill a a children's movie with sexual innuendo to keep the parents attention.<br /><br />dr suess is rolling in his grave right now, what with the "dirty ho" "s.h.i.t" and fake erection scenes etc etc etc. its shameful how they trade on the name of suess to get the parents to bring their kids, throw in the profanities to try for the teens and a few sad parents who won't watch a a film with their child if there is no t & a. greed greed and more greed.<br /><br />compare this to the classic children's films and we can get a disturbing view of world is turning into. these guys should stick to making mtv videos. how on earth this movie got >400 votes as a perfect 10 is beyond me. (unless its the directors family)
