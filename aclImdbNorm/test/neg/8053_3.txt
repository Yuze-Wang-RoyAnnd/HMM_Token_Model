director todd verow's unexpected turn into sentimental coming-out drama yields a predictable result: nothing new to see here. attractive but unconvincing leads - these 20-somethings are supposed to be in high school? - dribbling out banalities about confused, adolescent sexuality doesn't strike me as the best way to explore the promise of anonymous, which was equally self-involved, but also honest, raw and, by comparison, not all that maudlin. i have no idea what to make of this drab and uninspiring movie other than to hope that verow finds another career. sure, it's unpretentious, but so's mike huckabee.<br /><br />no single attribute, however, is as awful as jim dwyer's chintzy, electronic score, which grates non-stop, wall-to-wall for the full length of this movie. if i'd seen this, and heard this, in a theatre, i would have walked out. thankfully, on my laptop, i could scrub and hit mute.
