[possible spoilers] <br /><br />the sixth "halloween" film is an utterly depressing affair, but unfortunately not in the manner envisioned by the filmmakers. by now, everyone knows the story of how it was butchered and released in such a sloppy, incoherent form. the second half, in particular, makes little to no sense, as plot elements are introduced and dropped, seemingly at random. the very ending left me scratching my head. what the hell happened? is dr. loomis dead or what? this is what you get when you put a shameless hack in charge of a motion picture. it's not a pretty sight. <br /><br />on a related note, this is the most graphically violent entry in the series. i have no problem with gore if it's in the right place, but this movie takes it to absurd levels. the infamous exploding head must be a new low for the series. michael himself even seems to be enjoying the act of murdering another human being, inconsistent with his efficient, methodical approach in the john carpenter original. <br /><br />i'm not quite sure who was responsible; director joe chappelle or the producers, probably a combination of both. i'd be perfectly happy to grant a pardon to all concerned if only they'd release the legendary "producers' cut," a more complete version of the film that is a vast improvement from every account. from what i understand, it's like a different movie altogether. i offer to pay full price to purchase the dvd if miramax comes to its senses and releases it. <br /><br />there are a handful of good elements, however. the idea of michael being controlled by the druids is intriguing. paul rudd is solid as tommy doyle, whose appearance is a neat tie-in with the original. the slick visuals help make the proceedings a bit more watchable. but these meager offerings are overshadowed by the overload of drivel we have to put up with.<br /><br />finally, "the curse of michael myers" is noted for being donald pleasance's last film. many of his scenes were excluded from the final cut, and when he does appear, he seems frail and unhappy. the movie is dedicated to his memory, a blatant (if unintentional insult) if there was ever one. the fact that a talented performer should end his career like this is too depressing to even think about. <br /><br />*1/2 (out of ****)<br /><br />released by dimension films
