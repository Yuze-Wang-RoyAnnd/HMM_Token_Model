i had nothing to do before going out one night so i didn't want to watch anything too heavy, i picked the perfect film. this must have been a gift to barrymore from someone she slept with, the director raja gosnell has made nothing but silly crap and the writing on this one is just atrocious. in what high school can you register without a parent present and no proof of age or former schooling? they let kids all come to the prom with no shirts, in skin tight leotards, ass shorts and one girl was dressed as eve wearing only fig leaves? she announces that she's 25 and her brother is 23 but there is no reprisal from the school, parents or lawsuits of any kind against the newspaper for fraud or spying? the newspaper boss wants to catch the teacher in an underage sex scandal but doesn't realize the teacher is coming on to a 25 year old so any case would be entrapment? they allow a camera in and record peoples private conversations with under age kids? i wonder if i hired my younger sister to go back to hs with a camera on her and filmed under age girls for my personnel use i would not get in some kind of trouble??? nahhhh no problem. didn't she have to take gym or go to the bathroom at some point? the secondary characters in this were like cardboard cutouts of what high school students are thought to be and everybody was a stereotype. jessica alba is just embarrassingly bad in this mugging for the camera at every chance. in what world do the parents not get suspicious when their uber-geeky daughter is miraculously asked out by the school stud to the prom? and they don't ask the guy inside to meet him like every other parent in history. if some guy in my school or any other school for that matter had conned my sister and thrown eggs at her in her prom dress he would have been in a body cast for the rest of his life. this movie is so contrived and predictable it's nauseating, and why at the end is everybody (the alpo girls included) cheering for this chick when two days before they hated her????<br /><br />dumb, dumb and dumb.
