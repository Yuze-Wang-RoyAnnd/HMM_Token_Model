this movie is so god-awful that it was literally a chore to watch. i wanted to eject it from my vcr and throw it across the room, but kept thinking (foolishly) that it would eventually get funny and then everything would be all right. "you lose, we win, yay!" this movie should be required viewing for anyone who even once entertained the thought that jackie mason was funny. after that, beat them ove the head with this movie until the tape cracks. and if you're even considering renting this turd (or worse yet, have!) i have one thing to ask of you: didn't you even look at the cover? i mean, with crap like this you can tell with just a glance how bad it is! "oy vey!" this movie sucked.
