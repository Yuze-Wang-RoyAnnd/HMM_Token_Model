this show is absolutely ridiculous. yes, of course its fake. but it is agonizing to watch. i personally know more creative film influenced minds that could "make" this seem real. the young lead male couldn't be more unconvincing. he line-reads everything he says. are we really suppose to believe he knows what he is talking about? there is a plethora of ways to blair-witch this show up. fear does not breed from what seems "cool" and computer generated. nor does it generate from such proverbial lines as "what was that? did you hear that?" also, there are real convincing psychics out there that don't just "want to be on screen". another duh-factor is... how do these producers think we are actually going to buy that paranormal activity will just magically happen within the 2 possibly 3 days (if we are lucky) they film. i don't think so. a 2 + week at one site would be more convincing. it is also disarming that they think including "nasa radar checks" and computer's that show fancy bs really make us scared. and ie: exorcisms should not be staged like the film "the exorcist". when are they going to get it right? possession of the devil or other evil spirits influence people differently. they don't just snarl and lower their voice like linda blair or fallel around like courtney love on a drug binge. as stated better concentrations on "psychic ability" would aid this show greatly. we want to see and hear everything that supposingly flashes before them. not cut-away to other story bs. on a final note- shooting stars do not generate interest when you showed fake pictures of ufo's ahead of time. might i stress again the young dark haired man that hosts this show is absolutely down-right awful. avoid this show. for fright: watch old unsolved mystery episodes... not the new ones (the recreation got it oh-so wrong). but that is for a different blog.
