geoffrey wright, the director of "romper stomper", transplants shakespeare's "macbeth" in the contemporary, criminal underworld of melbourne, australia. the result is a semi-awful piece of cinema. sam worthington is macbeth, and walks around looking very self-conscious and bored. victoria hill, who wrote the script with wright, is lady macbeth, and she's neither awful nor good. lachy hulme, who plays mcduff, is the only actor in the cast who exudes any kind of authority. the rest, including gary sweet, are wasted and misdirected. shot on hd by the late will gibson, the movie's visuals lack character. everything is too clean and too deliberately lit. wright's direction is uninspired in the extreme and the action sequences are confusing and inept. marketed erroneously as "the most violent australia movie ever", the film is violent at times and reasonably bloody, but it fails to deliver a single impactful moment. slow moving and terribly pretentious, this umpteenth silver screen version of the classic play is the personification of wrong-headed.
