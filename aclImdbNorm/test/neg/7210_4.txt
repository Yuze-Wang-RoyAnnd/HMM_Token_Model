this in-name-only sequel to the classic roadhouse has a dea agent (john schaech) coming to the rescue of his uncle (will patton) when the uncle is badly beaten up by a local drug gang, headed by that wooden indian of an actor jake busey. the gang wants to take over the poor guy's bar for nefarious reasons. patrick swayze is sorely missed here. schaech is an indifferent actor and not convincing as an ass-kicking lawman. the fights here are intermittent and not nearly as powerful or vicious as the fights in roadhouse. the finale is equally weak. some good-looking women keep things afloat for a bit. there is a terrific fight between a daisy duke-type who turns out to be handy with both fists and weapons, and a nasty-looking babe of busey's who is handy with sharp implements. there's also a scantily dressed gal at the beginning who is a fellow agent of schaech's, but unfortunately she never reappears in the film. too bad. she does a brief lap dance for schaech that had my full attention. if nothing else, roadhouse 2 kicks off with a strip club scene that comes darned close to what a real strip club looks like, a rare circumstance in any movie. the rest is snooze time.
