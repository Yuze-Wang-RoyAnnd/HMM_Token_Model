ten years ago i really wanted to see this movie on the cinema. but i missed it, and then forgot about it. oh boy, am i glad this movie didn't get to ruin my teenage eyes back then.<br /><br />i saw it yesterday, and seriously, this must be among the 10 worst movies ever made. and i'm talking about movies which has had too much attention, such as those wonderful trailers on tv, and too much money spent on actors and the making of the movie.<br /><br />the script sucks and the acting sucks even worse, do i need to say more?<br /><br />please, hollywood, no more arnold!!
