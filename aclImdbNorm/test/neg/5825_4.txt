i don't understand the many good reviews, here. i found the photography and scenery beautiful, and the two lead actors appealing, but there's little else here to recommend this movie. most annoying are the fake southern accents and badly written dialog. these do not sound like real people to me. although it's refreshing to show men exploring various forms of sexuality without the usual labeling and stereotypical character traits, most of the story is without motivation or logic. the only thing that makes very much sense is the responsibility griffith feels toward his mentally ill aunt, grossly over-acted by karen black. lee is an interesting character who would have been more compelling had the dialog he was made to speak been more natural and his motivations more clear. yes, i understand that he's a drifter, but his actions as the movie draws to a rushed conclusion make no sense at all. this movie is worth a look, chiefly because it has a nice atmosphere about it, but it's slow moving and deeply flawed. a serious rewrite and better editing might have saved it, as the premise and story outline are promising.
