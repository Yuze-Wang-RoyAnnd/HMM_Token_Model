i hate movies that end like this!!!!<br /><br />this 16mm disaster is full of clich'es, stereotypical characters, a generic, over done "plot" and terrible dialog.<br /><br />in this "movie" we have the aggressive black guy, the black guys girlfriend, the blonde bitch, the possible lesbian "hacker chick", the pedophilic teacher...blah, blah, blah....and then the pumpkin man.<br /><br />"do you think someone is taking the legend too far?" this question is asked towards the end of the film. taking the tagline of scream 2 too far.<br /><br />spoilers*****typically i don't go into spoilers but i have to rant....<br /><br />a dream? the whole thing was a dream!!!!! this is the most sissified way to end a movie. "i don't know how to explain all of this, and we don't have any more money...let's make the whole thing a dream." this is what the director/producer/actor/fx guy must have been thinking. yes, the director is the character of mr. e he did almost everything on this garbage movie. this is such a cope out ending....and what of the principal, okay, so he has been doing all the kidnapping! what did that have to do with the movie? of course the black people are killed, the bitchy girl is killed, the teacher that has a past of sexual harassment with students gets killed ( he is main suspect)....yuck yuck yuck!!! this movie gave me heart burn.<br /><br />pointless, senseless, and made with parents visa and mastercards (which tells me it is probably still being paid off), this movie is dumb, boring and just plain stupid....<br /><br />the only thing i liked was the credits. the way they presented the names, etc, in the beginning and at the end. it had a creepy feel to it. too bad the movie didn't!<br /><br />1 out of 10
