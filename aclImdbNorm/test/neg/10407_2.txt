louis gossett jr returns to the well one more time as chappy sinclair who goes to doug masters (played by jason cadieux who is in for jason gedrick who wisely declined) to teach a new band of recruits however this time they discover corrupt air force pilots who deal in toxic waste. this is a series that just keeps getting worse with each subsequent entry, this one however doesn't have any of the zip or even the action to make this even worth seeing on cable. iron eagle iv is directed with such indifference that the dogfights come off as if we were watching a playstation 2 game played by two lobotomized teenagers. it is horrendous to watch and gossett jr who has made his share of turkeys seems to have bottomed out here. and i saw cover-up, firewalker, aces:iron eagle iii, toy soldiers and jaws 3d. what is mysterious about louis gossett jr is that he seems to be like christopher walken in his quest to do anything as long as he's working. as i look at his post oscar win. some of his better movies include iron eagle, the punisher and the principal. considering that the latter two movies have him co-starring with dolph lundgren and james belushi it is indeed something to say that three guilty pleasure action flicks are in the running for his better work. of course enemy mine and diggstown remain his best post-oscar win work.<br /><br />* out of 4-(bad)
