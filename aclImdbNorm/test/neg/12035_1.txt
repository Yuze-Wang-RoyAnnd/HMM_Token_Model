this movie made me so angry!! here i am thinking that here's a new horror movie, one w/a sense of intelligence & then the movie starts. the scenery, the delivery of lines, the costumes, the fake gore, must i go on? there are porno movies out with better dialog than this. i understand the concept behind indie movies, but my goodness, this wasn't just indie this was a high school book report shot w/a camcorder & the cast are all friends & relatives. this is 1 movie that was doomed from its beginning. maybe if it was 1982 instead of the new millennium this movie could fly. but it seems to me that someone hung a rock around this albatross's neck & it was sinking at a constant rate of speed.
