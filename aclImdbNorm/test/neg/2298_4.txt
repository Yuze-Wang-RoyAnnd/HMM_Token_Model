you know, i really have a problem with movie lists. i was reading maxim magazine a while ago and they had a list of the 50 greatest b-movies of all time, and knowing me, i of course have to go through and watch them all and write reviews of all of them. this is why you see reviews of movies like gator bait and barb wire and coffy on my list. so i noticed h.o.t.s. at the video store the other day and recognized it from maxim's list of the 50 greatest b-movies, and i decided to rent it and check it out. my only consolation is that i rented it because i recognized it from a list of b-movies, so i already knew it was going to suck. <br /><br />given the type of movie that it is, i can't say that h.o.t.s. is a total failure, since it is nothing more than a late 70s t&a film, and it never pretends to by anything else. the only place where it strays widely from its objective is in a ragged subplot involving a couple of ex-cons who have stashed a lot of stolen money in the house that the self-named h.o.t.s. move in to, because this subplot has absolutely no place in the movie. despite the fact that the rest of the movie is as well, this subplot is completely superfluous and unnecessary. <br /><br />the story is based on a couple of rival sororities at the beloved f.u., which exists as one of those universities that contains a grand total of one sorority until the rejects form their own in order to get back at the snobs in the other one. this new sorority, help out the seals (h.o.t.s.), is a sorority supposedly based on helping seals (the seal subplot is another one that doesn't really belong in the movie, and little attention is paid to the meaning of that name beyond having a seal running around here and there throughout the movie). <br /><br />this is going to sound weird, but there was actually one scene that i was pretty impressed with in this movie. one shot that i was impressed with, i should say. about midway through the movie, one of the girls in pi, the rival sorority, is pouring alcohol into the punch, and she pours some for herself in a glass and drinks it. oddly enough, what she does as she drinks that alcohol reminds me of something that charlie chaplin would do, which really brightened up the movie. obviously, nothing in this movie comes close to anything that chaplin ever did, but that shot alone raised my score for the movie from a 2 to a 4.<br /><br />as a whole, however, the movie is exactly what you would expect it to be, a lot of people running around looking for excuses to take off their clothes (i liked how the remove-one-piece-of-clothing-for-every-score in the football game at the end was one of the girls' ideas. riiiiiiiiight
