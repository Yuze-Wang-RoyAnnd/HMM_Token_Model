i've seen about a half dozen of the low budget poverty row b westerns that ken maynard made in the 1930s, and i am consistently amazed at how poor an actor he was. how did he ever get to be a leading cowboy actor? they say that he could ride pretty well back in the silents, but he doesn't do anything particularly impressive in these later sound films. still, maybe he got the leads because he was big and could ride.<br /><br />phantom rancher isn't as bad as some of the other ken maynard films i've seen, but it still isn't much. some of the other characters refer to him a couple of times as a "young fella," where it appears to me that he's just as old as the other older actors.<br /><br />and if that's not silly enough, there's a rather significant script problem in this film. at one point, one of the characters makes a remark about how the phantom had prevented the poisoning of a well, something that hadn't happened yet. just a couple of minutes later, we then see that particular scene. no, it wasn't a flashback. at first i thought perhaps that when treeline films was doing the dvd transfer, they might have reversed two of the reels. but in those days film reels contained approximately 11 minutes of film, and the whole reversal only took about 3 or 4 minutes tops. everything else was in a logical order. so, it looks like that was a genuine continuity problem in the original film. maybe that's one reason why colony pictures didn't last very long.
