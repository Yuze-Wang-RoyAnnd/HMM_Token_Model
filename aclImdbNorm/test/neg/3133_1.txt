great. another foreign film that thinks it's fellini. on top of that, we have to have more propaganda about murdering disabled people.<br /><br />i see no reason why we have to be inundated with these thinly disguised euthanasia commercials.<br /><br />i found nothing redeeming about this film. what can be redeeming about a man without the courage to carry on, in spite of some adversity. it does not take courage to commit suicide. that is the action of a coward. sharing this "wish" with his woman simply inflicts her with the same illness he has. if this had been a film about a man's courage to go on, in spite of his problems, similar to the jill kinmont story, that would have made it a great film.<br /><br />if you're interested in seeing true courage, check out the movies about jill kinmont, the former skier who was disabled after a bad ski accident.
