coach preachy or straight sappy. it's bad writing combined w/even worse acting. you can choose to drink the gatorade of this after school special, but i didn't, not even on it's 20th toby robbins/islander philosophy, motivational moment. it's too much posturing to be entertaining and not substantive enough to be informative. i have respect for the coach and the program this movie is inspired by, but the move itself is awful. as someone who has played rugby for nearly 20 years in the states i had hoped for a better rugby movie (even one that has something loosely to do with rugby). and i can tell you that the haka performed by a bunch of haoles and islanders is not intimidating (much like when it's performed today by the all blacks, seriously boys, everyone has seen it,it's time to put it away). if you want real intimidation, line up across from a bunch of south africans (the real eye gouging convicts of rugby). this is a fake and badly done movie about being a genuine and good person.
