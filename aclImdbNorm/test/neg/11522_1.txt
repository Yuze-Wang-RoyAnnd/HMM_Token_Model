rented this tonite from my local video store. it was titled "black horizon." i guess someone felt this was good enough for a 2004 re-release...<br /><br />micheal dudikoff is unfortunetly not a ninja in this movie, one of the major flaws of this film right off the bat. another major flaw would be that ice-t's action scenes are stolen from other movies, particularly the first scene of his rescue, which is directly from the wesley snipes movie "the art of war," with ice-t edited in. i hope they paid for that footage.<br /><br />the plot is awful, the special effects had little effort put into them (love those wires holding them in space), the acting is wooden (also love those new york/russian accents). ice-t being in the movie is pointless. these guys also forgot the fact that there is no gravity in space, but i guess they weren't worried about it.<br /><br />micheal dudikoff should go back to doing what he's "good" at and make american ninja 6.
