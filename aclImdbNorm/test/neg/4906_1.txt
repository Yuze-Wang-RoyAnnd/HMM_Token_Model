i respect mike hodges, and liked get carter immensely for it's bleak outlook, but the croupier just seems like a particularly dull itv drama.<br /><br />the reserved, cold acting isn't just the preserve of the lead character, it's spread to the entire cast, meaning there is nothing to contrast owen's character with.<br /><br />none of the characters evoke any kind of feelings at all, except boredom. the ending of the film is also untidy at best.<br /><br /> the camera work etc is fairly good, but if you want to see hodges best watch get carter, don't bother with this uninteresting, unimaginative trawl through emotions he covered better 20+ years ago
