warning:i advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.<br /><br />when i first started to watch this movie my expectations were it was a vampire movie, that is going to be awesome considering how rodriguez and tarantino both helped make the film. i began about 15 minutes into it and already my hopes for this movie were down the drain, which shocked me. first, the story it was going with was not at all appealing in anyway possible, and just flat out boring and uncompelling to the point where i just wanted to turn it off. i was getting more frustrated with this movie as it dragged on, but i guess i had hopes that it would get better.... then when it finally showed vampires it blew my mind, in a very bad way. i thought,"okay this movie started with some backwash horrible story about these two criminals, then very slowly turned into some vampire movie which i thought it was going to be from the beginning, in like, the last 30 minutes?" to add on to that, they try to make the main characters all cool and awesome and mean around the end when they're just not; a bunny would've been more intimidating than these characters! this movie is a horrible piece of crap!!! from dusk till dawn disgraced me and left a terrible taste in my mouth, disheartening thoughts in my head, and left my body unable to move from the horrible shock that i just wasted 108 minutes of my life away on a horrendous film. i do not understand how george clooney, quentin tarintino, cheech marin and danny trejo, all being the good and honorable actors that they are, could take part in this useless filth. in my opinion, from dusk till dawn is one of the worst movies ever made that i have suffered my eyes on. do not see it, you'll be doing yourelf a great favor...
