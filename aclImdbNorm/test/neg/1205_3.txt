i liked this move when i was a kid, but now that i'm older i can see how absurd the plot really is. in case you didn't read the earlier reviews it's about a teenager and an air force colonel who steal two fully loaded f-16s to rescue said teenager's dad.<br /><br />it does have some nice aerial stunts, even if the dialog accompanying then is basically teckno babel.<br /><br />some unintentional humor in the edited for tv version. when the hero's dad is being held by iran, err i mean an unnamed country, and his captors ask him for a confession (relating to why he's being held, don't worry about exactly why, or what they want him to confuse to.) he says "tell him he can take my confession and shove it down his throat.". however his lips and, more importunely, his gesture make it clear what motion, and part of the anatomy, he was really thinking of.
