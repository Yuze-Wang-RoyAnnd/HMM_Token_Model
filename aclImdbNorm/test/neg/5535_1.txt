the gun is probably the worst film i've ever saw. the comedians direction is very poor, the dialogs sounds like they were written by a 13 year old teenager, the plot (what plot?) is another "suspense" in which it is very hard to get into. finally, nothing in this movie is any good. a big thumbs down to everyone involved and particularly to the montreal film festival who presented this movie in competition!
