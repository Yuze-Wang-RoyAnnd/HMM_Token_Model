after hoo-hooing american indians scalp number one son, frontiersman bruce bennett (as daniel boone) seems, at first, like he wants to get even; but, he really wants to make friends with the natives. when sad-eyed indian chief lon chaney jr. (as blackfish) also loses number one son, it gets more difficult to clear up misunderstandings. apparently, this was republic pictures' attempt to do for their "daniel boone, trail blazer" what disney studio's had successfully done with "davy crockett, king of the wild frontier" (1955).<br /><br />the "dan'l boone" song, whistled and sung by a group of children in a wagon, did not follow fess parker's "davy crockett" up the hit parade. singer faron young (as faron callaway) doesn't perform the title song (perhaps wisely); he does sing "long green valley", and makes a good impression as a blond boyfriend for boone's daughter. but, spanish actor freddy fernandez is the film's most valuable player. in a cute scene, mr. fernandez reminds mr. young the name of the character ("susannah") he is supposed to be in love with.<br /><br />**** daniel boone, trail blazer (10/5/56) ismael rodr'iguez ~ bruce bennett, lon chaney jr., faron young, freddy fernandez
