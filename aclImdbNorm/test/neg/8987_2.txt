first, let me state that i have no idea who nora roberts is. so the book may have been great, but the movie isn't.<br /><br />i have spent my entire life living in the peidmont region of nc. i have never heard southern accents as ridiculous as the ones in this movie. i have lived in two small nc towns and charlotte and raleigh. on occasion, you will meet people with a strong southern accent, but i have never encountered a town where everyone talks like a bad imitation of gone with the wind.<br /><br />in response to gore_won from the atheist community. your comments reveal more about your warped psyche than it does about the movie. if we were to stretch our imaginations and pretend that there is anything realistic in this movie - which there isn't - then the truth is that bad people such as tory's father will always find some justification for their actions. the author chose religion as a counter to tory's supernatural abilities. your supposition that "the true character of the gospels" directs a man to beat his daughter is about the most perverse and misinformed interpretation i have ever heard. before you start spouting off about the gospels, maybe you should read them first.<br /><br />back to the movie. the dialog is flat, unnatural, and unbelievable most of the time. in particular, many of the things that kade said to tory are inappropriate and do not match the mood, context, or way they are said.<br /><br />the "exciting twist" at the end of the movie is lame, predictable, and lacks any credibility. some have also claimed that jacqueline bisset does a wonderful job in this movie, but the truth is that the bitter mother character is also a stale, predictable, one-dimensional character. is that bisset's fault? i don't know.<br /><br />if you have a choice between watching this movie and a twenty year old rerun of the muppet show, i recommend the muppet show.
