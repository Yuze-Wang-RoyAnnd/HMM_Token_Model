whoever filled this stupid idea of acting and producing a movie in himesh's head, which is always hidden under a cap, covering almost half of his face all the time ? only hope this is first and the last as well, for god's sake ! from assalam valekum to gayatri mantra, himesh has tried every thing, to create an aura of his so-called singing talent, which is nothing but atrocious pronunciations of words like tanhaiyya, which completely kill the beauty of the terms, so commonly used for love songs. why does himesh not smile ? simple, because he does not use close up toothpaste ! now there this friend of his, tailing him around every where, and this number one lawyer in the town, who has to herself sexily wiggle and try to seduce himesh, of all the handsome german people she might have met earlier, perhaps the male lawyers on this part of the world might be cursing their fate, for destined to deal with the stiff, unattractive lot, every day ! the action scenes are so funnily shot, like the event planner attacked by the thief, autos riding over the cars, so on and so forth. the father of the bride seems to be in a great hurry to get rid of his daughter by marrying her off, that he flies to and fro around. most hypocrite, he praises hr for distributing love among people of the world, as if they were sweets , and on his back, coolly gives a lecture to his daughter on these show business men. when himesh is proved innocent, he again unceremoniously dumps the other guy, as if it's a game of musical chair ! i didn't get to se the poor guy's face even, did you ? hansika in the role of ria, looks as if she is in need of an eye check up, for strain in her eyes ! the fellow in the role of a friend is good, who has acted quite naturally, and should be in better movies, like sharman joshi, for example. child artist in trishu's brief appearance is sweet, but wasted. it seems today's young generation has gone nuts , since they prefer this kind of mockery of lyrics and musical scores , and associate gossip with it, for example, if you sing ek bar aaja, the ghost would come. this is a weird taste in music, and rather funny. i am surprised, how such classic lyricists like gulzar , have opted for himesh of all the people, to give music. there is story in panchtantra , that a crow attach'es so many feathers of a peacock, to look beautiful, and appeal to the birds; but the feathers fall off ultimately, and the real dark crow is revealed ! hope himesh takes a hint, and refrains from manufacturing such meaningless stuff, and wasting precious money, which he has earned by taxing his short nose so much ! his friend does tell him, if your nose is cut, how will you sing ? thanks for showing us germany, himesh, at a reasonable cost of renting the dvd ! and correct those spelling mistakes, will you ? an extra e in movie, and no e in love ! there is also a famous number from the old film sholey, mehbooba, on which mallika sherawat wiggles, once again, but this time with himesh, winking at her, and conveniently, ria , his so-called real love, and his new bride is not around ! now that was very clever, himesh ! at least one thing in this movie which you have done smartly, to justify sherawat's presence . but doesn't she look a bit washed down ?
