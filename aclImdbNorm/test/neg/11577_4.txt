jim wynorski strikes again with the very literal minded komodo vs. cobra. no guesswork here. a giant cgi komodo dragon -- it sort of looks like a dog minus fur -- takes on a humongous cgi king cobra, with a bunch of tree huggers and others caught in between. the tree huggers get charter boat captain michael pare (who else?) to take them to an off-limits federal island. an experiment by a mad scientist in growing very large veggies has become an experiment in growing very large critters, thank so to our nutty military. now all that's left on the island are the very large critters and the mad scientist's tiny, shapely daughter. the group runs into her at the old plantation lab, the monsters arrive, and the chase is on. if you watch enough wynorski/sci-fi channel flicks, you'll recognize some of the sets and locations from many other movies. acting is nonexistent, as is the plot. at the very least, you can enjoy watching the badly animated compo/dog stomp down on its intended victims just before scarfing them up. the cobra just strikes and swallows. no imagination at all.
