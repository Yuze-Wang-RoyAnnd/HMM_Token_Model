hey all, i just wanted to give you all a few crazy facts about this movie. i was actually one of the make-up fx artists that help create the "beast" for this movie and i have to tell you the original creature looked absolutely amazing. i remember when we got the first photos back from the set we were all talking about how much of a shame it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty poor.<br /><br />what actually happened though was that jason palmer did the original make-up for the sasquatch, but for some reason they had to go back and re-shoot much of the creature. the sad part was that jason passed away a few weeks before that and so the re-done creature was no where near as awesome as the original one.<br /><br />for me it was quite sad because this was jasons final movie, and he sort of got cheated out of his final fame due to the bad re-shoots. anyway, i thought you guys may find that a tad interesing, and if you would like you can head over to mmmyeah.com and check out some "behind the scenes" photos.<br /><br />later, jeff
