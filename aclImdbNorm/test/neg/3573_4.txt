that's what i kept asking myself during the many fights, screaming matches, swearing and general mayhem that permeate the 84 minutes. the comparisons also stand up when you think of the one-dimensional characters, who have so little depth that it is virtually impossible to care what happens to them. they are just badly written cyphers for the director to hang his multicultural beliefs on, a topic that has been done much better in other dramas both on tv and the cinema.<br /><br />i must confess, i'm not really one for spotting bad performances during a film, but it must be said that nichola burley (as the heroine's slutty best friend) and wasim zakir (as the nasty, bullying brother) were absolutely terrible. i don't know what acting school they graduated from, but if i was them i'd apply for a full refund post haste. only samina awan in the lead role manages to impress in a cast of so-called british talent that we'll probably never hear from again. at least, that's the hope. next time, hire a different scout.<br /><br />another intriguing thought is the hideously fashionable soundtrack featuring the likes of snow patrol, ian brown and keane. now, i'm a bit of a music fan and i'm familiar with most of these artists output, but i didn't recognise any of the tracks during this movie (apart from the omnipresent "run"). b-sides, anyone? we get many, many musical montages which telegraph how we're suppose to feel. these are accompanied by such startlingly original images as couples kissing by a swollen lake and canoodling in doorways. this is a problem, as none of the songs convey the mood efficiently, and we realise the director lacks the ability to carry the emotional journey to the audience through storytelling and dialogue alone.<br /><br />the ending is presumably meant to be just desserts, as everybody gets their comeuppance and there is at least one big shock in store.. but i remained resolutely unmoved because the script had given me no-one to root for. it's not enough to tackle a hot-button issue, you have to actually give us a plot that hasn't already been done to death and individuals who are more than window dressing. as it stands, this film is a noble failure, with only the promising lead actress and a few mildly diverting punch-ups to save it from the bin. 4/10. must try harder..
