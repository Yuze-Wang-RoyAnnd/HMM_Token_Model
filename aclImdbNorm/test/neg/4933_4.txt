the beginning was decent; the ending was alright.<br /><br />sadly, this movie suffers from complete and utter shallowness of the characters, unrealistic confrontations/fight scenes, lack of anyone intelligent outside of the shuttle. this makes for an awful middle screenplay. <br /><br />stuff to look for: overly obvious foreshadowing, fast-healing cuts, overly smoky fires, fun seatbelts, delayed reactions.<br /><br />i did give it a 4, not a 0, because the start of the movie had some nice elements of happiness and basic character development. the relationship between the main, dark-haired girl and her fianc'ee is touched upon briefly, and the placement of the blond friend's impact on that relationship is present, though awkwardly so. the business discovered at the end is becoming more mainstream and decently done, though, as another commenter pointed out, not unexpected. <br /><br />~viper~
