poorly acted, poorly written and poorly directed. special effects are cheap. best performance is by yvette napir, but that's not saying much. story is a confusing mess about corporate greed leading to sabotage of a space station and an attempt to rescue those stranded aboard.<br /><br /> there is little suspense and even less action. there's one car chase that's not bad, but the rest of the movie is simply a waste of everyone's time.
