just once, i would like to see koontz's work given to a decent screenwriter, director, and producer! just once!<br /><br />this is a good attempt by jean leclerc and chris sarandon, and an even better attempt by victoria tennant, but everything else is pure unadulterated garbage. the screenwriter should be shot for bastardizing koontz's work this way and the director...please.<br /><br />the story is a well-written story, but the screenplay is quite dull, unbelievable and horribly executed. the only elements which work are the performances by leclerc, sarandon, and tennant.<br /><br />on a personal note, i really wanted this to work. i adore koontz's novels, but they have never given them the attention, backing, and talent they deserve. if they put the same money into koontz's work that they shovel by the barrels-full into king's, koontz would quickly rise above. but alas! without powerful people who believe in his work, i fear he will never get the chance.<br /><br />as an adaptation to the novel, this movie was a total suck-fest. as a stand alone movie, it wasn't that bad, though extremely weak in many places with huge plot holes and terrible, stiff, unprofessional dialog which never should have made it to the final cut. this movie failed miserably to live up to its potential. had they followed the original work by koontz, a bit more closely, and invested a decent amount of production money, this could have been a far better endeavor.<br /><br />however, all i can manage to see in this, is how good it could have been, and wasn't.<br /><br />it rates a 4.3/10 from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
