as i said, sometimes low budget is good. you get to see a good movie without a lot of the extra bs that can hide an otherwise piece of crap. well...this was that piece of crap. if anything, i thought it had humor, unfortunately the humor was unintentional. the only half-witted acting came from bill smith and his part was cut out (that's a joke). there was never a bill smith, nor was there anyone cast who could act. even gerald okamura sucked, and he's been cast in nearly 40 movies. the fight scenes were comical and made me feel like i could kick all their $%#@#$. the sound was horrible, as if all sound was recorded on the set. my 10 year old could have written a better script...btw, my 10 year old fell asleep...no kidding. i give a b+ to editing for cutting the movie to only 90 minutes...60 minutes would have been an a+.
