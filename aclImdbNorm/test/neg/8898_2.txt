although i rarely agree with filmkr"onikan, i have to say that this film while not awful, just didn't make me care at all... and it all just seemed to be out of place... it had its moments... three or four ones that made me snicker... but most of the time i was just sitting and wondering why? why did the characters do this? even hot shots characters felt more thought out and fleshed out...<br /><br />if you want to see a nice norrlands-film then watch pistvakt. there it was more than random ethnicities that just walked around shooting each other on the swedish tundra...<br /><br />i am so disappointed...
