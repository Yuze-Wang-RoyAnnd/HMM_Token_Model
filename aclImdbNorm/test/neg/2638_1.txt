this movie was so weak that it couldn't even come up with good cliches to rip off. i love horror movies and will see practically anything, but if i had it to do over again i would have skipped this one entirely. you may think that i'm exaggerating, but i challenge anyone to find anything even remotely satisfying or interesting about this piece of garbage. not scary, not funny, not curious, not worth it.
