this movie is scary at times, perhaps no more so than when a naked george kennedy tells his hooker girlfriend he wants a little more sugar. thankfully his nakedness is covered by a blanket, but the image is still more horrifying than anything you're likely to find in, for example, schindler's list.<br /><br />the dialog in this film was inspiring; it inspired me to watch another movie. in one scene, when a stewardess remarks about male pilots, kennedy asks, "why do you think it's called a 'cock' pit?" charming.<br /><br />and yes, contrary to what some have written, this film is very, very bad.
