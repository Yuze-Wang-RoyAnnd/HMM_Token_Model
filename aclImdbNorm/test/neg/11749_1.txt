let me begin by saying that this remade version of one of the greatest ever created movies "psycho" (1960) has been nothing but a fine example of poor direction, poor acting and poor cast. the best way to describe this movie is by comparing it step by step, acting by acting and process by process to the original.<br /><br />alfred hitchcock, one of the greatest movie directors ever lived, had an intention to shoot the original in black and white despite the availability of color at that time. okay, people in 1960 may not have been used to bloodshed or horrifying scenes as much as we are today but that didn't prevent people from liking it and getting nominated for 4 oscars. gus van sant had absolutely no reason to release this in color except that the year was 1998. what should have looked realistic in color did not. after the shower scene norman washes his hands it is easily comprehendible that whatever was used for blood looked like some kind of red wax. once he washes off the blood his hand is red in color. <br /><br />about acting, perhaps there couldn't have been a better cast of janet leigh and anthony perkins in the original. perkins suited well for norman and he was incredibly natural when he smiles and talks to the stranger. hitch wanted a handsome and good actor and it worked just fine. in this version, i personally think vince vaughn looked perfect and handsome and strong to play norman's role, unfortunately his acting was nothing less than terrible. in the motel office where norman and marion have the long conversation, he had zero expression on his face and his voice and face never changes throughout. in the original in the same scene when the madhouse is described, we can clearly see the sudden change of expression on perkins's face and he looks scaringly angry although not aggressively. vince vaughn here works out the entire conversation like he's just had his lines by heart. again, terrible acting. same is with anne heche. in the opening scene in the original, we can see how tensed and nervous marion (janet) is when she drives to phoenix. she was happy in getting the money but at the same time scared for life. that's what i call acting. in the remake, heche has no signs of fear and she smiles periodically for getting the money. i don't think anyone would be "happy and smiling" when they've just stolen $400000 and the entire state police is behind them. in the shower scene, janet in the original grips the curtain, turns around and dies after getting stabbed. in the remake, heche gets stabbed, turns around, then sways the other way, has a foolish expression on her face and manages to die with great effort. again, terrible acting.<br /><br />there are also some specially introduced changes in this movie from the original that seems to have nothing to do with the plot line and the ongoing situation. in the scene where arbogast gets murdered, two scenes blink in between the stabs. one with a naked woman and the other with a sheep. many people including myself aren't exactly sure whether the second scene showed a sheep or a cow or whatever it was. what on earth does a beast or a naked woman have to do with an investigator's murder! the changes were just inappropriate and unnecessary. there are a couple of changes in the ending scene as well. <br /><br />let me add some (and the only) positive points along with that. i felt julianne moore did her job well and played a good character of lila. and william macy acted well, that was almost exactly how arbogast's character should have been played.<br /><br />it is common man's knowledge that the purpose and intention of a movie remake is to make the present generation aware of a movie that has a good classic plot line, and to try and make it look better than the original. and if anything has happened here according to what i just said, it is directly the opposite. unfortunately many people like me weren't impressed after watching this movie unless we came to know of the existence of an unforgettable original version. <br /><br />please do not watch this movie, it is nowhere near the original and the original will always remain one of the best ever created movies if not the best.
