what on earth? like watching an episode of neighbours after drinking two bottles of cough medicine- nightmarish and making no sense at all. i was waiting for the clever part where everything fits into place and saves the film. maybe it was there and i just missed it, or was lost on me.<br /><br />my strongest suspicion is that it is a thinly veiled attempt to market a new drug thats about to hit the streets. i wouldn't say "don't watch it" but i will say its pretty poor on every level- like am dram in high def. whack. unless you drink two bottles of cough syrup. then it's just dandy.
