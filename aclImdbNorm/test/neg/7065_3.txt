this movie starts with interesting set design and a promising premise, but fails to provide the cult-movie goods. set in a gritty parallel universe where everything is owned by the "blump" corporation, it concerns a horrible stand-up comic who finds success when he grows a third arm out of his back.<br /><br />all the potential for great cheese is here -- washed-up 80's star judd nelson, wayne newton, offbeat visuals and strange plot digressions, obese women in skimpy lingerie, necrophilia -- but it never pays off.<br /><br />the pacing is the main problem. each scene is excrutiatingly slow. nelson's stand-up routines are supposed to be funny because they're pathetically not funny. but each performance drags on until it's not even tangentially funny, just boring.<br /><br />imagine someone telling you the longest, weirdest joke imaginable, full of smirky self-congratulation for how funny and weird he thinks it is. imagine after a stultifying two hours of this, you never got a punch line. you've just saved yourself the trouble of watching the dark backward.
