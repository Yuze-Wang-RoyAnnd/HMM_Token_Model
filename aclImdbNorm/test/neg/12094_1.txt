i haven't reviewed anything on here for quite awhile, but after having the misfortune to sit through this rubbish masquarading as entertainment i had to put forward my thoughts.<br /><br />normally, however bad something is, there is one redeeming part, whether it is an actor who was okay, a scene that was passable, an attractive cast member, or a general feelgood moment. unfortunately, that isn't true here, as the film starts of atrociously, with a ridiculous shootout, which was so poor, i thought it was a practice, & two halfwits, otherwise known as the boys in blue chatting beside a school.<br /><br />one of these idiots was daniel baldwin, who not only starred in this, but also actually directed this garbage, & unlike his brothers cannot act for toffee. not that he was on his own here, as everyone in it seemed to belong to the acting school of a trained chimp.<br /><br />luckily, certainly for me, i only watched an hour of this masterpiece, as the dvd wouldn't work, & was probably made by the same fools who produced this. so if you have nothing to do but watch paint dry do watch this as it is just as boring, & ideal for getting rid of unwanted guests.
