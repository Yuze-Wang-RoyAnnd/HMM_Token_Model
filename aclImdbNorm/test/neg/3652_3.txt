mgm tried pairing up and coming young men with the divine one to give them exposure and try them out as leading men. gable and garbo had chemistry in susan lenox but it was a lousy film. here in inspiration there is no chemistry whatsoever between garbo and robert montgomery and the script is poor as well. what were they thinking? the modern, fast-talking, wise-crack-snapping montgomery and the long-suffering garbo? it is a tale like camille. young student falls for woman of the world and is repelled by learning of her past, rejects her, takes her back, rejects her.... you get the picture. garbo is completely believable as a top parisian artist's model and completely at home, although bored, with her life at the top of society amidst her artistic friends and their loose morals. suddenly she is fascinated by this innocent. she finally gives up her life for him and sinks into poverty, only to be rescued by him and set up in a house of her own. ironically, he intends to marry and keep her on the side - so much for his pure moral ethic of earlier.<br /><br />the scenes are incredibly dull and boring and nothing much happens. only marjorie rambeau as lulu is able to inject life into the proceedings with such lines as "unfortunately weak women have strong appetites" and "odette, where is thy sting?"<br /><br />only for garbo fans.
