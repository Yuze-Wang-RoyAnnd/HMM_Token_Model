besides the fact that this guy is a liar, he is also a total idiot, and a thief in the comedy community. once when i attempted to watch this excuse for a television show, i believe i actually threw up in my mouth a little. i can't help but feel a little bit dumber every time is see one of his horrid commercials while i am enjoying great comedy central programs like reno 911 and american body shop. it shows like this that make me worry about the continual existence of mankind. it's hard to believe that even joe rogan can make someone look like an moron. please begin praying now that comedy central will realize their mistake and end this show as soon as possible. haven't we suffered enough?
