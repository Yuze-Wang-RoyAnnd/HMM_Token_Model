the use of "astral projection"(wandering soul), to exist outside of body, with the result inflicting horrible death(..crushing the insides of victims leading to broken spine and ruptured organs)on those close to the one with such ability, is the threat of eternal evil, providing karen black(..as janus) with another "unique" character to fool around with as a woman who influences a commercial director, paul sharpe(winston rekert) tired of his waning marriage and dull career. in actuality, she's dying and needs his body, her spirit potentially harmful to his wife and son(..his son has a "special friend" who talks him into things, even poisoning himself at one point). a detective, kauffman(john novak) investigating the unusual homicides concerning those killed by the benevolent spirit, links paul to the deaths and through him uncovers janus. soon both realize that janus must be stopped or she'll simply move to another human host. what paul doesn't know is that his new secretary is janus' lover, both were actually older intellectuals featured in his documentary of astral projection called wandering soul.<br /><br />director george mihalka(my bloody valentine)certainly creates a weird atmosphere with this movie which contains a rather bizarre premise. it seems that paul's boy can see the spirit moving in the shape of a "blue man", manipulating the kid into disorderly conduct. black, despite the star treatment, rarely is shot close up taking advantage of her face which can produce the type of malevolent evil her character warrants. instead, she's shot from afar, her voice dubbed, and she never quite establishes herself with the proper menace which is an opportunity lost, in my opinion. for some reason, despite the intriguing(..if oddball)idea of astral projection causing a spirit to kill folks from within, the film just never takes off. the soundtrack is very "yanni-ish" and the lighting(..and sound), while at times moody and effective, often is quite murky. the pacing is a problem, also, as the story mules along. the cast is rather limp, especially rekert in the lead, his performance erratic, at best. it doesn't help that there are few characters(..except paul's wife)we could care less about, and what really hurts is that paul himself isn't exactly the most lovable person in the world..he can be quite difficult and moody, his unfulfilled career a reason for such behavior. black should've been a more prominent figure in the film, yet remains mostly in the background, talked about in dialogue between paul and kauffman, but rarely does she get a chance to amuse us with her histrionics, which is a shame.
