truly awful. obviously an attempt to cash in on the star wars craze, but there's no excuse for this insipid piece of garbage. the storyline gets lost before the middle, the characters are forgettable and the kid is such a non-talent that all he does is pose for the camera. an alien planet they land on is actually the naval stockyards in long beach, california. <br /><br />this movie actually made me physically ill watching it.<br /><br />roger corman has made some good, some bad movies in his career, but there's no excuse for this one. <br /><br />0/10 - imdb won't let you score a zero.
