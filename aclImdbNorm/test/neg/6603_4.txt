i grabbed la bandara because it reunited jean gabin and julien duvivier, whose pepe le moko is a noir masterpiece. i'll give it a few points because gabin is in it, but the clumsy plot, cheap sets and the ludicrous annabella making like an arab princess put the film on my `to sell' shelf. if you watch it, you'll find yourself asking, why didn't the idiots build the fort *around* the well, instead of a deadly few yards away from it. and why use tin roofs in the middle of the desert? but by then the sheer perversity of contrivance that makes up the script should numb you to any further contemplation.
