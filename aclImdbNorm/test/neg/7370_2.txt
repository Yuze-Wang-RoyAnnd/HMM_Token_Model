it's really a shame to see so many talented people involved in what's happen to be a very waste of talents. the plot is clich'e. the directing is too self conscious and the characters are almost caricatures. one of the most disappointing aspect of this film is gerard depardieu's performance in the english version (this movie was shot in french and english at the same time). although he is one of the best actor in the film, he gives the worst performance of them all. i must say that bianca gervais come very close though...<br /><br />on a more positive note i must say that the newcomer juliette gosselin gives an amazing performance in both version. unfortunately that the only good thing i remember about this film...<br /><br />by the way i must apologize for my not very good english...
