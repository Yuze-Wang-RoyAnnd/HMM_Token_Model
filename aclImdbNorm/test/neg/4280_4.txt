as an avid disney fan, i was not totally impressed by this movie, certainly not motivated enough to catch it in the theaters. i am, however, so glad that i caught it on dvd and watched the special features.<br /><br />you must check out the "moose commentary": the entire movie can be viewed with commentary from rutt and tuke, the comic relief moose of the story, who are voiced by rick moranis and dave thomas. two veterans of the famous second city comedy troupe ad-lib - in character - for an hour and a half about a movie that they are clearly fond of. i laughed the whole time. the enjoyment i got from this commentary completely made up for the tepid reaction i had to the film itself. do yourself a favor and listen to it!
