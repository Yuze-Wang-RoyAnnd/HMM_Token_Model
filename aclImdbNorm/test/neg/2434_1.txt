i think this was a horrible mistake on disney's part. first off, kuzco does not need to pass "emperor school" to become emperor! that's never happened before. secondly, the new voices don't sound like the originals at all. very poor redo. and while i adored the movie the emperor's new groove, the new school is just stupid. like all the jokes are the same, and many are from the movie. the plot gets redundant, always yzma (is that how you spell it?) trying to become empress, kuzco stopping her, etc. or kuzco learning to become a better person. i think kuzco gets annoying with his constant complaints and questions. he is a spoiled brat and it bothers me. i do not think this is worth five minutes of your time, much less a half hour.
