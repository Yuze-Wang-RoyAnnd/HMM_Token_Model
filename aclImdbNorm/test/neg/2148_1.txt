you know you've got a bad film when you hear that the soundtrack is performed completely on a single cheap programmable synthesizer, without any melody or sense of rhythm.<br /><br />it's hard to see how anyone could take this film seriously, even while giving it a bad review. this film is way beneath 'bad'.<br /><br />the continuity of this film is outrageously butchered. in one fight scene, we the hero (wearing bluejeans and undershirt) turn a corner with two revolvers in his hand; he doubles back, only now he has two semi-automatics in his hands; he turns another corner and now he has an automatic rifle in his hands; he chases down a hallway and comes out (suddenly dressed in standard army fatigue jacket)with a shotgun; after which he exits the building with yet another automatic rifle. or here's one for the books - a bus slams into a car at high speed; the car goes flying, thrown by a gigantic explosion - cut to the bus which is completely unscathed from the same explosion? the narrative continuity suffers from an equally numbing sense of unreality; the bad guys really want to kill the hero - obviously - but every time they knock him out or otherwise get him in a vulnerable position, they suddenly decide they want him "to live to see this!" huh? one of the funnier moments of the film is when the hero is released from isolation because his lawyer has come to see him; then the bad guy decides he's not going to let the two meet after all; and this despite the fact that the the villain, the hero and his lawyer all know what's going on anyway, so the hero writes a note to the lawyer and next we see the note being passed to the lawyer by another prisoner, even though we never see the hero give it to him. (this lawyer, btw, has complete access to the offices of the atf in california, including its confidential computer files.) huh? well, but it's a mindless action movie - so how're the action scenes? not bad, surprisingly; unfortunately they happen to be stoled from about a dozen hong kong films made five or ten years previously. the opening scene, a shoot-out in a junker garage, actually has shots the composition of which are stolen directly from "hard boiled" - so clearly so that it's a wonder john woo didn't sue for plagiarism.<br /><br />other hong kong films stolen from include "prison on fire", "island on fire", "burning paradise", "police story" i, ii, and iii (aka "supercop"). i thought i recognized a couple sammo hung clips here as well. in other words, the actions scenes are exciting only to the extent that they are successful duplications of action scenes from other films.<br /><br />there's nothing one can do with this film unless one shoots smack and just needs a lot of visual stimuli that needn't be make any sense.<br /><br />very funny film, for all the wrong reasons.
