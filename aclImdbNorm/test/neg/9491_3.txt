i would like to know the real name of the lodge where scenes from the movie were filmed. it is truly beautiful and hearkens back to 20's and 30's architecture like the hotel del coronado. i know it was on either big bear lake or lake arrowhead and would like to hear if it is still in existence. as for the movie itself, it is truly amazing that jane wyman was even nominated for an academy award. this must have been a period when she was well liked by her academy peers. it really would have been interesting to get a true impression from wyman and the other actors in this movie regarding the script. the script of this movie, like the recent kevin costner movie with a message in a bottle, is so unbelievable that it it limits the credibility that the actors can bring to their parts. rock hudson can be forgiven. he was never a great actor, was able to get by mostly on his looks and didn't get credible roles until later in his career (pretty maids is the exception). but wyman must have been forced to take this movie through contractual requirements or the studio system.
