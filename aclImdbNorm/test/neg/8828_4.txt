it is very possible that i simply didn't give the movie a fair enough chance because it was so immediately unappealing to me (something similar happened with triplets of belleville), but i really should have caught on when i put the film on and my roommate, an exchange student from japan, immediately started laughing at the movie, saying that it sounded dumb. now, i don't agree that it is dumb, the animation is very simple but clearly very skilled. it's like classic animation with added layers that add another element of realism to them while remaining strictly in the realm of the surreal at the same time.<br /><br />but the subject matter is entirely unappealing to me. it has an interesting message about stinginess and greed, but it is wrapped in such an unpleasant package that it is almost not worth learning, especially because you already knew it anyway. the sound effects while the man is loudly gobbling cherries and cherry pits, for example, are indeed repulsive.<br /><br />there was a clever scene of animation as we kept diving endlessly into the hole that the man finds in his head when he pulls the sapling out of his scalp, but it goes on for so long that it seems to overshadow everything else. there is so much stock put into that one sequence that it is almost like the whole movie is about it.<br /><br />as i said about triplets of belleville, this would have been a great thing for a late night tv program like adult swim, or its japanese counterpart, but an academy award nominated film? it gives me the impression that there is not generally a long list of animated short films for the academy to choose from.
