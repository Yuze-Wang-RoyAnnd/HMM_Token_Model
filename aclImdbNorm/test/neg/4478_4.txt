i had high hopes when i went into the theatre-- having seen the trailer i was as hyped as the next person to see great talent participate in the making of a story with a beautiful premise.<br /><br />however, it's disappointing to see this talent laid waste by the poor composition of songs-the words are chunky and cheesy, probably because it was composed with a more western theme. i wouldn't find it difficult to imagine the same melodies with french or english lyrics. in mandarin, they just sound strange.<br /><br />the musical items were also cut together badly-- far too quickly to be enjoyable, and the shots of the actors looking anguished lasted far too long.<br /><br />the special effects are the next disappointment. suffice it to say, it is highly obvious where the special effects start and stop.<br /><br />it's not moulin rouge, and it's not in the mood either, inspite of the occasional (and very similar) slow waltz theme. altogether, and hour too long to tell a simple story.
