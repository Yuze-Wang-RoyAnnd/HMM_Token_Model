yes, thats that i felt after i completed watching this movie. the acting is below-average and the special effects are horrible. in fact, the worst i have ever seen. it is a very low budget movie. there is no way this movie will can scare you, it has no creepy or scary moments. mr. bone eater was more of a funny creature for me. it could have been much better but oh well they didn't had a big budget. the movie fails to convince you that you are watching a horror movie, lol. i would name this movie the time eater (waster). i am sure you would have a lot of better movies/etc to watch. still watch it if: 1. you have nothing else to watch. 2. you get to watch it for free. not worth renting at all.
