i understand the purpose of the director to tell stories that aren't stories, but the way he tried to show time passing by (the couple of joggers, who first appear jogging together, than jogging with a stroller (sic!), than the man alone...) and to link the "adventures" of the characters (the final scene, with the maid climbing a mountain seeing the big black guy on another cliff, and then seeing the boat with her former employer and saying "oh, a boat!") were awful. at the same time, i liked the way he portrayed the middle-high class, even in an excessive way. i think it is a lousy movie. if you want to watch it, do it as a film school student, trying to see technical aspects and issues. it will help a lot.
