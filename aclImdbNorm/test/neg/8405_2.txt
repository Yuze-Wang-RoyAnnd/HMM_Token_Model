i think "rosemary's baby" is the most overrated horror film out there. not scary, interesting or much of anything. it's reasonably well-directed and ruth gordon was wonderful but that's about it. but this sequel makes it look like "gone with the wind"!<br /><br />i caught this on tv back when i was 14. unfortunately, i still remember it. from what i remember rosemary's baby andrew is now grown up and the coven wants him to start taking over (the world that is). but there are forces trying to stop it...and andrew is having doubts himself...<br /><br />i'm giving this a 2 for a few reasons: gordon is in this (and still very good); stephen mchattie was actually pretty good as andrew and there is one spooky moment at the beginning with rosemary (patty duke) being "kidnapped" by a bus...with no driver.<br /><br />other than that it's dull, silly and needless. the original didn't need a sequel! ira levin's book followup in 1999 wasn't much better.<br /><br />tune in for the beginning with duke...then tune out. not worth the effort.
