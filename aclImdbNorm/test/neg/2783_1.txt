this is one of those films that you watch with a group of people. you will have the best time. it's really, really bad, like showgirls bad but without the quality of showgirls.<br /><br />you've got the best mix of bad actors, bad director and bad script here. everything that can possible be wrong that can make for an entertaining evening, you have here. the first being the tag line is "a bunch of teenagers..." these people are as much "teenagers" as my grandmother.<br /><br />the director has zero sense of suspense or tension. the 30 year old "teenagers" are standing around and the "monster" comes out and attacks and this pretty much happens throughout the movie when the monsters are revealed. there is no suspense building up to this or surprise or anything. it's more like when you were kids pretending to be chased by monsters and just kind of made up stuff as you went. and when i use the word "monsters" i exaggerate. more like a couple guys in halloween masks bought at the .99 cent store.<br /><br />there is no doubt this script was spun off in a couple days, no rewrites and i can only imagine how bad and poorly formatted it looked on the page because it was clearly written by an amateur with no clue. it's another example of one of the bad things about this day and age: anyone can make a movie.<br /><br />but of course the best bad thing about this film is the acting. it's as bad as you can get. there isn't one person in this who has the slightest skill at acting and the lead is the absolute worst. he delivers every line in this monotone manner without any expression and you have to wonder how someone this bad could possible get a part in any movie, no matter who he knows. when he had to "cry" when his girlfriend was killed, it was one of the funniest scenes i've ever seen in a movie. watching these people reciting some of the awful dialog is very very funny. but when the black guy said "tell her...tell her...i love her..." before his death scene, there was a huge laugh among our group. funny, funny stuff.<br /><br />my only hope is this movie gets bad enough ratings to take its place where it belongs: in the imdb lowest rating 100 movies. we can do it, folks!<br /><br />ps. is it any surprise that the one "great" comment this movie got in here was from someone in virginia (who has one comment, only on this movie and nothing else). and guess where the movie was made? virginia. i've said it before and i'll say it again: people who work on the movie should not be allowed to comment on it.
