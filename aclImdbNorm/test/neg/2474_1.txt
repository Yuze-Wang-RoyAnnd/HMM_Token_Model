no, *hitch* is decidedly not a romantic-comedy about bilious (and bibulous) former-leftist-pundit-turned-reactionary-pundit christopher hitchens, though it sure would've made for a funnier movie. a dumpy little englishman, teeth stained black from cigarettes and guinness, barking out advice -- and acerbic political commentary -- to lovelorn men: "look into her eyes when you speak to her, you nutter! and remember: calling someone a 'neo-conservative' makes you a de facto anti-semite! can't you get anything straight, you liberal pantywaist?"<br /><br />oh well. instead, we get will smith, whose continuing success remains a mystery to me, at least. i am apparently alone in this regard. smith is the most powerful man in hollywood as of this writing: americans just can't help throwing their money at him. i, on the other hand, find his smugness insufferable, unmitigated by a scene here (spoiled by the trailer) where he suffers a drastic allergic reaction to seafood. we know smith will bounce back to his bland, over-muscled good looks, because there's a fat sit-com actor (kevin james) on hand making a fool of himself. we're supposed to laugh hysterically whenever the slob starts dancing like a jackass (cue "everybody dance now!" by cc music factory), but why would a straight-arrow accountant behave in such a way? i've worked with several straight-arrow accountants for years, and i can tell you that if, in norman mailer's memorable phrase, "tough guys don't dance", neither do straight-arrow accountants. am i taking all this too seriously? or -- and here's a daring thought -- perhaps the writers couldn't conceive a logically-drawn character to save their lives?<br /><br />speaking of the writers, they come up with a lousy idea for smith's love interest: a writer for a tabloid (eva mendes). since when do tabloid creeps deserve love? what universe am i in, anyway? -- everyone here at imdb is actually gushing over this tripe. either you all need to raise the bar, in terms of entertainment value for your buck, or i'm just a skunk at the garden party. (me, and about 150 million other long-suffering boyfriends and husbands.) in any case, if i may imitate smith's hitch and offer my male readers some smooth advice: when you're dragged to see *hitch*, say to your better half, "hey, that was pretty good" after the movie is over. don't be overenthusiastic; don't rave about it -- she'll know you're lying to her. praise it in a lightly surprised way, as if the movie was better than you expected and wasn't the agonizing time-waster that it actually was. but what am i saying, eh, fellas? -- we dudes know all the moves. <br /><br />1 star out of 10.
