there must have been a lot of background info that was left out of the movie. in fact, in the film, the girl, lizzy, didn't even appear depressed. she just seemed like a girl that went out of control when she finally got to college, mainly from doing drugs and drinking alcohol. that seemed to be her problem, not mental illness. sure, she had emotional problems because her dad left and she barely saw him as a child, and her mom seemed a little out there. but, the way she treated noah and ruby was just mean and i don't think caused by depression. she was very needed, which ran rafe off, but she was like that because of her dad.<br /><br />but, i think the main reason this movie never achieved a theater release is that not enough happens with the plot and the story is not written well.<br /><br />final verdict: truthfully, i'd only recommend this if you are interested in seeing ricci's first nude scene. otherwise, it isn't very interesting.
