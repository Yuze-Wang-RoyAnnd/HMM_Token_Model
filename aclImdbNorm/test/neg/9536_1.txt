wow! after the first five minutes of watching this "film", i was quite tempted to put a bullet in my brain, and end my life. it's really hard to describe what exactly this film is about. i honestly don't know what kind of human being would even finance a piece of excrement. the film looks to have either been shot on video or 16mm. i normally don't have a problem with sov movies, are shoddily made 16mm films, but this was just so awful. and where did they find these "actresses"? i have seen some bad acting, but this takes the cake. watch the first 5 minutes and you'll see what i mean. bci entertainment should be boycotted for distributing this god awful sludge. this has to be the worst film i have ever had the displeasure of viewing. i want my 74 minutes back! if you are able to sit through the first 5 minutes, without either shooting your tv or committing mass homicide, then give a shot. after all, what have you got to lose?
