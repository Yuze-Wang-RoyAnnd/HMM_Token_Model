yeah..that's what the station disclaimer states after the commercials for this show "some scenes may be disturbing to some viewers" .<br /><br />it is beyond disturbing. the validation of this whole display of ego framing and chauvinism is in the fact it is on the comedy channel. yes..a comedy true and true. a joke. to see these 'playas' go through their rigid charade really spells out what is wrong with society. especially the meat market bar scene. both sides, the male and female, are equally as weak and desperate to be mingling among this superficial atmosphere. the club is obviously one of those cigarette corporation sponsored plastic coke scenes. these people do have a choice, and that is what makes it even more of a joke. <br /><br />these slick ricks try too hard. they glisten with their own groove grease. that's ok. it's a lesson on video tape for the new generation of how not to focus on a potential heart interest. hopefully that facade will crumble along with the bush/harper administrations. problem is, who's lined up after these characters fade? the bastard children of the one night stands?
