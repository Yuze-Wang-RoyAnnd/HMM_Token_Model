this movie seems as if someone had a cute idea for a movie, thought of two or three funny possibilities, hired a good cast, then turned the whole thing over to a really bad screenwriter and even worse director. the director filmed a screwball romantic comedy as if it were a dark, artsy film---weird camera angles, blue filtered shots, lingering, close up looks at raindrops. steve zahn was good, as always. ben affleck was charming, sweet, almost shy; he was perfect for a romantic comedy. sandra bullock struggled along valiantly with a character who was supposed to be zany, but whose wackiness consisted of things like madly kissing a husband she hated, abandoning her child, going on carnival rides, offering to strip for money, and bumming a ride with a fellow airline passenger. the script had very few funny lines; there was no physical comedy; it was boring. it introduced potentially funny situations, then cut them off before they could develop. to top it all off, the "twist" at the end was a slap in the face to anyone expecting a fun romantic comedy. if you saw the trailer for the movie and liked it, as i did, my advice is: don't go to the movie. it will only spoil a nice trailer.
