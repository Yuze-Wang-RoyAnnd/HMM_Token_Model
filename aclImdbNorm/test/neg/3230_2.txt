okay, my question; who's the idiot that wrote this movie, giving it the same name as dean koontz's awesome book? its terrible, nothing like the book...you got the dog, and the watcher, but there the similarities end...might be good, if you haven't read the book, though...but it disappointed me, really.<br /><br />they should make a new one, and let koontz write it... now that would be a good movie... i'll say it again, this movie disgusted me...absolutely disgusted me. it was terrible, it was absolutely nothing like the book. i would never again watch it.
