all i could think while watching this movie was: "will it ever end?!" it was unbearably boring to watch. i was wishing i could just turn it off, but i wanted to do this review justice so i fought the good fight and withstood the torture of watching this movie all the way through so that you, the good reader, need not bear that pain also.<br /><br />this movie sounds like it has a great premise if you read the premise on paper. however, the actual movie does not deliver on this premise at all.<br /><br />the opening scene features a mineshaft in the early 1900's, where they are forcing kids to carry dynamite into the tunnels that aren't big enough for the adults to fit into. this seems to be setting up the premise for an interesting movie. but after 4 minutes, it becomes clear that is not the case. the adults who committed these crimes are never punished; there is no consequences shown in the movie for their actions. the opening scene is way better than, and completely irrelevant to, the rest of the movie. the last time an opening scene misrepresented a movie so grievously was the opening scene of 28 days later which was the only good scene in *that* whole movie. wicked little things/zombies (a movie so crappy they changed the title to try to disguise it's crappiness and sell it again) is exactly the same in this regard. the opening scene is the only watchable scene in the whole movie.<br /><br />instead, the movie flashes forward to present-day. a single mother and her two bratty, foul-mouthed kids. right here is when it would have been wise to press the stop button and never go near the movie again.<br /><br />in the first hour, the zombie kids are barely even seen. they get maybe 3 minutes of screen-time, total. all they do is kill a pig, that's it. the rest of the hour is spent showing the dumb mother and her dumb kids buy things at the local store, wander around the forest, and have inane conversations with each other. the dumb teenage daughter goes and hangs out with some other idiot teenagers and smokes weed with them.<br /><br />there would be no reason to care at all if the zombie kids dispatched anyone in this movie. every single character is both dumb & annoying, with no redeeming qualities at all. not to mention one-dimensional and clich'ed.<br /><br />this movie would have been *vastly improved* if the mother and her dumb kids were dispatched in the first 10 minutes by the zombie kids, as they were driving up to their new house, then the end credits rolled. that right there would instantly change the score from 1/10, to 10/10. honestly! when the dumb mother takes her eyes off the road and almost crashes into a pedestrian on the road, her daughter scolds her: "you almost killed us, mom!" of course, anyone with common sense knows that if the mom had hit the pedestrian, it would be the pedestrian who would be dead --- not the people safely encased *inside* the car. i guess this line was put into the movie to show firsthand that the utter stupidity of the main characters knows no bounds, and runs in the family.<br /><br />wicked little things/zombies runs for 1 hour and 34 minutes, but it definitely felt like 5 hours or more to me. trying to not fall asleep was a tremendous challenge. it's not until over an hour has passed into the 1 hour and 34 minutes that the zombie children actually bother to kill any person. then the scene shows the dumb teenagers drinking beer and making out in a car and saying lines like, "if you ever wanna get in my pants again, you better start the car and get my ass out of here right now." seriously, that's verbatim from the movie. the teenagers are so clich'ed, one-dimensional, badly-acted, dumb & annoying that when the zombie kids finally get around to hacking 3 of them up 1 hour and 5 minutes into the movie, it feels like a cause for celebration. of course the "princess" dumb weed-smoking foul-mouthed beer-drinking loser daughter of the main mother character gets away scott-free. what a buzzkill that was! she was on the screen longer than the others and hence the most annoying of the 4 of them, and most deserving of a pickaxe to the head. all the more reason why she should have been dispatched within the first 10 minutes, as aforementioned. to still keep her around past 1 hour and 5 minutes though, is totally inexcusable.<br /><br />the reason for this of course is that feature length movies need to be padded to at least 1 hour and 30 minutes. so by keeping her alive long-past when she should be, they have an extra 27 minutes to pad the movie with her and her mother running through the woods. by 1 hour and 22 minutes in, it's the *second* time in the movie where the annoying daughter is trapped in a vehicle where the engine won't start whilst the zombie kids are coming to get her.<br /><br />the zombie kids are completely generic. never say anything. no character development at all for any of them.<br /><br />in the end, all 3 of the annoying, idiotic main characters live. which in my opinion, is the filmmakers' way of giving a final flipping the bird gesture to the viewing audience. in my opinion, the filmmakers surely know that they have bamboozled anyone who has had the great misfortune to watch the whole movie. why not rub their faces in it by not even giving them the satisfaction of seeing any of the 3 main characters who should have been dispatched within the first 10 minutes, die.<br /><br />avoid wicked little things/zombies like the bubonic plague.
