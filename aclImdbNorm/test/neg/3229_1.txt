i hated the book. a guy meets a smart dog, gets a virgin girlfriend, and all the while they're being chased by a hit-man and a ape beast thing (both of whom want the dog). dean koontz really can't write (i read the book at my sister's recommendation, i should have known better). when i saw this, (mostly out of a morbid curiosity) i actually found myself criticizing it because of the fact that it was untrue to the book, even though this is a book that its impossible to make a good movie of. i figured at least if they're going to make a film adaptation of the worst book i've ever read the filmmakers might as well be accurate. they turned the guy and his virgin love interest into a boy and his mother, for some reason that bothered me most of all (even though i seriously doubt keeping it a guy and his chick wouldn't have made it any better). quite simply; bad book, bad movie, don't see it.
