there is something about doug mclure's appearance in a movie that is a warranty of wretchedness. his dg initials are like a special cinema-certification, that comes somewhere before 'u'. <br /><br />cushing, on the other hand, seemed to suffer from both a dilatory agent and poor judgement of his own. he did excellent work in the hammer movies as dr van helsing. i'v seen him do a very passable sherlock holmes in 'hound of the baskervilles'. and his magnum opus was probably grand moff tarkin in the first 'star wars'. the only man but the emperor who could tell darth vadar to 'stop bickering' and get away with it. but - crikey! - he's done some turkeys. there was that lamentable 'daleks' movie for one. and here's another.<br /><br />there's a machine that's been hijacked from tracy island. it's a cylinder with a screw at the front and traction devices at the sides. i'm surprised jerry anderson didn't sue for plagiarism. maybe he was bought-off. yet if the movie is any guide, they can't have paid him much.<br /><br />it's 1976 and we're still playing about in latex romper-suits. <br /><br />that's about it really. some movies have an entertainment value in the 'so bad it's good' category. this one doesn't even manage that. it wouldn't even entertain kids. 'crash corrigan's' stuff from the 1930's has got more going for it.
