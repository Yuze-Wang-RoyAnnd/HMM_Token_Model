miranda cosgrove is known for her debut in "school of rock" with jack black and her role as megan in the show "drake and josh" and she has become a fan favorite amongst the nickelodeon public, so it isn't a surprise that dan schneider would create a show just for her. unfortunately, it ends up being as bad as, if not worse than, "the amanda show".<br /><br />"icarly" is about three friends, carly, sam, and freddie, who have become idols in the junior high community through a webcam show called "icarly". carly and sam are the hosts and freddie shoots and puts it up on the internet. carly also has an older brother named spencer, acted by the hilarious jerry trainor who is known for his work in "drake and josh" as crazy steve.<br /><br />well, let me tell you this. don't believe the 8.3 out of 10 this show received because it is pathetic in nearly every aspect. dan schneider probably went through about 5 minutes of studying teenage interests because all i see is him saying "ipod? iphone? ihome? aha! teenagers love anything beginning with 'i'!" and a majority of gigs that were used in "drake and josh", if not, then they are just really dry and forced jokes that don't even count on a generousity chuckle, such as "you want me to turn up the ac to 60 degrees?" "no. we want you to turn it up to 60 pickles!" not only that, but if you look closely, nearly all the sets in the shows were used in "drake and josh" and "ned's declassified" that were simply spit-and-polished with random stuff to try and make it look different.<br /><br />the scenes where the show is showing a broadcast of the icarly network is just as terrible as the entire series itself. the dialogue in them is atrociously bad, which may be accepted by some since it is just two friends playing around in front of a camera, but what's the deal with the really odd, humorless antics they do like "random dancing!"? and it just gets worse from there.<br /><br />in terms of acting, miranda and jennette aren't at their best, by far. nathan kress, who played freddie, isn't believable at times, but he does an okay job. the person who really steals the show is the humorous prowess of jerry trainor, who fits in his "protective older brother" role very well and his wide-eyed loud-mouthed acting can make for some pretty funny segments. too bad they aren't frequent, because that might have given the show an extra star in my opinion.<br /><br />dan schneider must have made this show for the sole purpose of giving miranda cosgrove her own cable-born playground to hop around and spew unfunny jokes and pathetic cue-card lines in every direction, because everyone else has exceptional talent buried underneath the poorly-done script and weightless acting. dan schneider did a great job with "drake and josh" so it's a real disappointment that "icarly" is such a failure. jerry trainor's acting saved this show from a 1 out of 10 rating, but he alone can't save "icarly" from being as horrible as it is.
