i would give this a zero if they had that rating. fun was no fun at all. i grew tired of the movie about ten minutes into but endured to the end thinking it had to get better - it did not. the others i watched this movie with also agreed. the acting was annoying. i am tired of jim carey's over the top ham acting. the supporting cast was no better. while this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the plight of the worker who gets stepped on when a large company goes under, the vehicle for this would have been better served another way. i actually disliked the leading characters (dick and jane) so much that their antics were never funny but pathetic. i am trying to recall one scene where i or anyone i was with laughed and cannot. a worthless movie and a total waste of time.
