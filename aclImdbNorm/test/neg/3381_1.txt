this "space snippet" was kind of dumb. i guess it was supposed to be a shocker unexpected ending, but imho it was just a huge letdown. joseph campanella and the rest of the earthbound actors do a great job in this one; their performances are not done justice with such a silly ending though. how this ending could ever have made it through any kind of review by the producers is beyond me. the other comment on here is not correct, the tongue in cheek vignettes only came in during the second season, this thing was supposed to be taken seriously! the producers and writers could have been a little more creative with the ending to do the rest of the episode justice.
