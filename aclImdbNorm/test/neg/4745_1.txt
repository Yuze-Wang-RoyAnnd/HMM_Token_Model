this film and the 1st avp film both all over the whole aliens and predator franchise.<br /><br />they are awful films, badly acted, badly scripted and terribly directed. they just seem like someones desperate attempt to make money off of the good name of the original aliens and predator films but instead of delivering a well thought out, quality production, they came up with the predaturd.<br /><br />the original alien/aliens/predator/predator 2 films were great, they redefined the horror/thriller genre by inventing these insane (and yet still believable) creatures who took the role of the 'serial killer', as opposed to a human. <br /><br />these films are just milking the franchise and do nothing but darken its name.<br /><br />the aliens vs predator comic books were brilliant and had a great story. they were true to the alien/predator mythology, didn't crap all over the original stories etc... why didn't they make the comic book into a great film? because hollywood are idiots, thats why.
