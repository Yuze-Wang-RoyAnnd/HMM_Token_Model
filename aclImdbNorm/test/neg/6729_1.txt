steven seagal's films of late have not exactly been good, but this is by far the worst since the patriot. the plot makes no sense what so ever; it is never clear in what the relationships between the characters are, who works for who or who is double crossing who. the film is completely disjointed, each scene seems to confuse the story further rather than carry it forward. even the action sequences are uninspired and hard to follow. most of the blame must lie at the director's feet for not even understanding the basics of film making, but seagal does not get off lightly, as one of the producers of this film, he must also share the blame. oh, and i haven't even mentioned how awful the acting is, even by seagal standards. even as straight to video fodder, this is not worth a view even for seagal fans. give it a wide berth!
