yawn, that is my reaction to this film. i was really hoping this would have been a good modern day slasher but it doesn't even fall into the category of slashers. instead, it tries to be something it isn't, which is a psychological thriller, and it fails so miserably at this. even the title "freak" suggests that this might be interesting. match this with the cover art on the dvd and you think "ok, maybe i will give this one a try". not worth the time.<br /><br />the story actually starts up a bit interesting with a poor deformed child with bandages wrapped around his head being chained up by his fat mother. she yells at him and probably beats him since in one scene we see her actually slap him for no reason. after all this, he decides he has had enough and smashes her face in with (i believe) a rock. present day, he is now in insane asylum and is being transfered. on his way he breaks out of the van he is in and escapes. introduce also the 2 leads characters, a little girl and her older sister. they are moving and hit the road. so most of the movie is them riding around in the car talking amongst themselves. but, the bandaged "freak" is now on the loose and is about go on a rampage of grueling murder! (this is me being totally sarcastic)<br /><br />i can't believe how boring this movie turned out to be. the budget was on the smallest ever with absolutely no special effects and the dialog i could just care less about. this is one of those movie where the packaging is better then the flick itself. and to compare this to halloween?! rubbish! i am not even a fan of the the halloween series (except the 3rd one) but halloween is far superior than this. at least with halloween we have a great score and some genuinely creepy moments. with this, there is virtually no music except some piano here and there and there is nothing creepy about this movie. maybe this movie would have fared better if it had a solid score because even the worst of movies are tolerable if the music is good.<br /><br />well, that is just my opinion on the movie. i thought it was just a complete waist of time and money. but, since the movie has over a 4/10 rating on imdb, there must be people that like this movie. i am not one of those people. 2/10
