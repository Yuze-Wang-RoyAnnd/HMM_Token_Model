i cannot believe i let myself rent that piece of garbage! the acting was so poor, my grandmother could have done better. the punches thrown in the movies were nowhere near the character the scarecrow was knocking to the floor. the movie became a chore to watch! <br /><br />so this group of baseball jocks decide to go hazing, even after they weren't supposed to in orders form there coach under consequences. so, naturally, they go anyway. they decide to tie a loser to a post with the so called "scarecrow." when the loser's best friend finds out about this, him and his girlfriend go to rescue him.<br /><br />the kid is found out to have diabetes, and is hospitalized, while the jocks head out to the beach the next day. the scarecrow finds them there and kills them all pretty much.<br /><br />i'm sure you really don't care. anyway, the scarecrow ends up having a connection with "diabetes boy" and the boy starts to finish off the scarecrows job once the scarecrow is killed. yes, it is really really cheesy.<br /><br />it thought this movie was full of bull sh*t. sooner or later the only ones living (naturally) are the boyfriend and girlfriend who are the main characters :) the evil is then transfered to the boyfriend, and he kills himself to break the curse so nobody else will be hurt. touching hey? no, don't waste your hard earned money on this, i give it a score of a one since thats lowest, otherwise, it doesn't even deserve that much.
