wow, i was really disappointed. i wasn't really planning on seeing this movie in the theater, and i wish i stuck to that plan. it really should be a made-for-tv movie. i was kind of excited to see it, as i'm a big fan of fairuza balk, but this movie didn't do her justice. infact i'm a little disappointed with the acting all around. what a horrible cover up of fairuza balk's tattoos, it bothered me every time i saw her shoulder. <br /><br />there was no flow to the movie, it was very hard to get into it. one scene we get angry, hyped up, we want blood, the anticipation rises, just then the director takes us to another scene to show the love between annie and bobby. it would have been more enjoyable to follow if it was broken up into three sectional sunday paper comic strip.<br /><br />there was also little logic behind the characters chosen to play some parts. the gangster leaders were scrawny guys, not very believable. matt dillon head of a mobster organization? come on, give me a break. there was just no intimidation there. <br /><br />the soundtrack.. wow. i think this is one of the worst musical scores i've ever heard. what awful guitar solos, my god. the sound of my teeth grinding was more pleasing to my friends, i'm sure. <br /><br />anyhow, there is one positive comment i'd like to make about the movie. the settings were nicely done. i liked the colours, a good job conveying that time period.
