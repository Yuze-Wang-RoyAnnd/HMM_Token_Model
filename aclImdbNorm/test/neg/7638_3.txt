i'm sorry folks, but these enthusiastic reviews on this prestigious site about this movie "respiro" are very strange, to say the least. is craziness picturesque, i ask and didn't find an answer. of course, the movie is beautifully filmed, at part it's almost a documentary. but then, the fact is that when it comes to the women grazia, she shows every sign of a deep illness and i was wondering throughout the movie what the heck she has. her behavior is absolutely worrisome and the (shocked) citizens of the village are very right indeed in wanting to send her off to a proper institution to see what can be done about her condition. she needs treatment, urgently! behaviour like hers is inferno to everybody around her, her husband, the poor children (especially) and the fellow citizens. let's not be falsely romantic about this! i hated this condoning portrait of a mentally ill. why, for god's sake, should the husband not want to have her cured or at least try to do this? why the horror of going to milan (a big city, sure, but lots of possibilities of capable persons to cure her)? narrowmindedness? irresponsibility? anyway, i inspired myself on this site for renting the movie on dvd and after seeing it i had to post this for others to make themselves an opinion on it. frankly, i understand why the movie did not get any further as an indication to the cannes selection...
