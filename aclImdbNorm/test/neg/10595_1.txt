i watched this movie for the first time the other day and was bored to tears. i guess i just was looking for some flashback to the wonderful series that i remembered. i watched the mod squad television show religiously back in the day and it was fantastic. it was action packed and the relationship the 3 had with greer was endearing. there wasn't any of that here. when greer was murdered you get the idea that these 3 could have cared less. the actor who portrayed pete is a really good actor but they wrote his part like he was mentally challenged. pete in the television series was quiet and serious but had a funny side also. they had this guy acting like he was either on drugs on the time, drunk or just plain ignorant. i wouldn't recommend this movie at all. especially if you were a fan of the tv series. it will be a complete letdown.
