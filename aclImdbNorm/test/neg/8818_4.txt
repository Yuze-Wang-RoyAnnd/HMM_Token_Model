i have to give this movie a 4 because of a couple of things.<br /><br />1. what i'll call the "stupid victim syndrome". if you have the killer on the floor and you have his gun - shoot him please. if you are a cop and you have your shotgun pointed at the killer's back - shoot him please.<br /><br />2. when you are in a high stress situation and you have your finger on the trigger of a gun - your first instinct is to squeeze. this is one of the first things they teach you in handgun training and the reason that you don't put your finger on the trigger until you are ready to fire - ask any hunter or infantryman. if you are electrocuted, your muscles should also contract - making you squeeze your finger.<br /><br />3. it's really hard to lay on the floor completely still for 8 hours without 2 other people - one of them a doctor - not noticing that you aren't dead. even more so if you are supposedly dying of a brain tumor and were in the hospital just a few months earlier.<br /><br />4. technically, the killer did kill one of his victims - the guy he injected with poison that had to get the antidote. if you poison someone, that is murder.<br /><br />5. what was adam's lesson that he was supposed to learn? yes, the doctor needed to be there, but what was adam's crime? maybe i just missed something.<br /><br />other than those things, i would have given this movie a higher grade. the plot was pretty good, and the ways the killer chose to kill his victims were very inventive. i can even forgive the terrible acting on the doctor's part - the scenes with his family were enough to make me sick. the cinematography and soundtrack were very good, but the ending seemed contrived and just didn't work for me. thank goodness i didn't have to pay to see this or i would have demanded a refund.
