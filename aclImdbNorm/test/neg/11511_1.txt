i do not find this show at all funny. i actually think it is much worse than any of the other terrible disney channel sit-coms right now. charlotte arnold is an interesting choice to play sadie, because she can't act. the jokes on this show are terribly unfunny, and it makes it even worse when the only cast member that has a little bit (and i mean little bit) of acting talent is justin bradley as sadie's brother hal. jasmine richards and michael d'ascenzo portray sadie's friends. there both really stupid and just terrible actors. two words that can really describe this show is terribly corny. it's corny humor that only little girls find funny because their brains have not developed yet. now i've explained my hatred for the acting and the horrible humor, what's next? the whole premise of the show is a stupid idea. she changed again (not so sciencey an ben-loving) and suddenly nobody recognizes her? it's moronic. in summation, i hate this show, however little girls who do not have a concept of funny will enjoy it, so i guess that's what they're going for over quality. although i can say as much as, the first season is clearly better than the second.<br /><br />bottom line: just don't watch any of it.<br /><br />my rating: awful show. tv g. 30 mins.
