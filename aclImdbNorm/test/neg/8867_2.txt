it's painfully obvious that the people who made this "movie" have never seen such brilliant spoofs as "the naked gun" and "hot shots". this movie is terrible, and so are the actors. they wouldn't know acting even if it hit them in the face, as i felt like doing while watching this total pile of rubbish.<br /><br />the movie is stupid and has no humor in it what so ever. i'm sure that i could make a better movie with my friends. to me it's amazing that a movie can fail this much. not a single clever or funny line. no trace of intelligence behind it. it's a pathetic movie and i'd like to meet the person who actually likes this movie. yuck!
