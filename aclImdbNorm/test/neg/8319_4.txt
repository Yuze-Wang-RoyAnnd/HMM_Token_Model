the brave one is about a new york radio show host named erica bain (jodie foster). her life is a dream living in the city she grew up in and loves. she has her great fianc'e david (naveen andrews), whom she is planning to marry. but one night while erica and david are out walking their dog, they are attacked and mugged by a group of degenerates, leaving david dead. erica recovers but is heartbroken and traumatized later on, and can barely cope with real life anymore. she buys a gun off a guy on the streets for protection. but one day she's shopping in a store, and a man comes in and shoots the clerk dead. it is then that erica shoots and kills this man, and she becomes a vigilante. killing anyone who tries to threaten or harm her or any others. at the same time detective mercer (terrence howard) is tracking down this elusive unknown killer, and in the process becomes friends with erica. erica begins to regain her sanity as she kills these violent people, but is unsure of whether or not what she's doing is morally right. and as her and mercer become closer, he doesn't even realize the unknown murderous assailant is right next to him.<br /><br />jodie foster gives a very good performance in the brave one. she portrays this type of violent, morally corrupted character brilliantly. terrence howard is also great in this movie. both have excellent chemistry together, and strengthen the film to a certain level. the brave one looks visually pristine, and conveys some brilliant camera work, but not all of it works to a great effect. the scenes where erica is absolutely traumatized and afraid to walk out her front door to face the world. the camera swayed back and forth to the sides in an almost dream-like way, and really captured the moment with essence. whereas almost every time erica killed somebody, everything just had to go slo-mo and show her facial expressions in fine detail. the slo-mo was properly used when erica committed her first murder. but why keep doing this effect almost every time she committed murder? the camera work creates a great atmosphere in most of the film, but there a few scenes here that are just plain overkill.<br /><br />the brave one is very much about how these murders affect erica emotionally. her fianc'e is killed by a group of thugs, and suddenly her love of new york city is turned upside down. she realizes that there is a dark side to the beloved city, and she says so on her radio show. i don't completely understand this though. erica acts as if she never realized that violence can occur at night in the city, and that's pretty stupid. if she lived there all her life she must be either blind or very oblivious. erica also seems to be a glutton for inhumane, murderous people. she really doesn't even have to go look for them, they just to come to her as if they're begging to be shot dead for their wrong-doing. the brave one deals with the morals and proper use of violence strongly at first, and then suddenly it glorifies it. the ending is very negative, and completely immoral and inhumane. it also negates the purpose of terrence howard's character, which the movie spends so much time trying to evenly develop, and suddenly his morals take a u-turn. the morals in the brave one become very fractured, and just plain shatter all over the place by the end. so violence is okay? it's a good thing to commit murder as long as it's for vengeance? i pretty much refuse to believe that. you know why? because i have a conscience, which this film surely lacks. it is not right to take the life of another person, no matter how bad they are, or how much you hate them. erica bain sets out to stop these evil-doers, but in the end she is no better than the horrible people she kills.<br /><br />jodie foster and terrence howard provide a lot of strength for this movie. the brave one contains a strong message, but that message is both immoral and wrong. this movie may look pretty, well acted, and intelligently strong. but it becomes pretty rotten by the end. i give the brave one a 1.5 out of 4. the message is very out of line and morally incorrect, and really can't be saved by the good acting.
