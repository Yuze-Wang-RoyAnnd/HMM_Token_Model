this is definitely the worst vampire flicks of all times. i started to watch this right after interview with the vampire and i was thoroughly disappointed. not only did this movie's script have craters as big as the grand canyon, the movie seemed to jump from one scene to another leaving the viewers thoroughly puzzled. the vampire lestat played by stuart townsend was terrible-having a good body does not make you an actor! the end of the queen was too easy and sudden, insulting the viewers intelligence. i'll give this one star because aaliyah actually tried her best in this movie and the soundtrack is pretty good. other than that i would advice anne rice to take an ax and start hacking those who destroyed her brilliant story.
