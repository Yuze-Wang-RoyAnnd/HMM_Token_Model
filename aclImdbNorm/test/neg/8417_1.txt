okay, enough. every time i think i've seen a film that is so misbegotten, so bad in every way that i think that no one could possibly find something to praise, i just come to the imdb where i'm greeted with the usual inane "undiscovered masterpiece" "great film" - i mean, honestly, what movie are you people watching, because it's certainly not the mess i just watched on the new fox/mgm/ua dvd. there are about three amusing lines, and a plot that gives incoherence a new meaning. and then, after ninety-three interminable minutes, it just stops and the end credits begin. then there's another scene. the dvd is fairly wretched, which suits the film. the source material is almost completely faded to an ugly brown. it's hard to imagine this film followed get carter. the critics and the public got this one right back then - it was lambasted and a box-office disaster, and rightfully so. but you pundits keep on trying. and i'll keep on trying to find a movie that doesn't have someone who raves about it.
