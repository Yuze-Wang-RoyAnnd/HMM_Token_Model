this film is supposedly about three young idealistic people, two of whom join the naxalite movement and blah blah. it is really just another film about some beautiful, rich people trying to decide who they should bed next; the peasants and naxalites and the political struggles of the era merely serve as a picturesque backdrop. literally, as we don't hear the villagers say a word, never mind learn anyone's name, thus they occupy the same 'role' as the 'natives' in old hollywood films. the movie is also dull, and the story does not actually get us anywhere - except to various bedrooms. we are apparently supposed to admire the artsiness of it all, which merely means no good song and dance routine, which would not have saved the film of course, but might have at least alleviated the boredom.<br /><br />my friend japna was annoyed at the immorality of the whole story, not the bedroom bit but the whole pointlessness of the story. the message seems to be that ideals are not worth pursuing.
