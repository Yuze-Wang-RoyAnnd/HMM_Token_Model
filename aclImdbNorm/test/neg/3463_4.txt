leatherheads is an apt title, however a leather strap would be more useful to self-flagellate oneself after purchasing a ticket to watch this noxious attempt at entertainment. clooney's attempt at self deprecating humor comes across with a quiet thud as his demeanor implies that he is anything but. perhaps with another actor playing the clooney role, the movie might be marginally palatable. sorry george, i doubt there will be any oscar nods this time. george clooney is definitely a fish out of water when it comes to comedy (unless you are referencing to his politics). anyway, only the most ardent of clooney fans will enjoy watching leatherheads, everyone else will long for the days of the silent picture.
