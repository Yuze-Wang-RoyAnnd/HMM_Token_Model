sorry for any spoilers that this contains. but if you want to read on anyway: i really wonder why so many people are so high on kevin williamson. let's just take a quick look at his work as a screenwriter, shall we? there's scream 1 and 2 (plus the story for the next one), which i think are pretty funny but very overrated. besides, by making scream into a franchise, it ceased to become a parody of horror movies and simply became another one. then there's i know what you did last summer, which is essentially the same movie again. he co-wrote halloween: h20, but even he had the sense not to take credit for what he did on that monstrosity. then comes the faculty, which i can only say was god-awful. (lots of fun to make fun of, though). don't even get me started on the ridiculous, soap-operatic dawson's creek, i could rail about how bad that is for hours. so then we get to teaching mrs. tingle. first of all, there are tons of little implausibilities in this one. for example: in most high schools that i know of, the valedictorian is not the only one who gets to go to college! this idea that katie holmes's character would never go anywhere unless she was valedictorian was absurd. haven't you ever heard of financial assistance, damn it!? also, i don't think you get expelled from high school or don't get into college because of cheating on one test. there are a bunch of other ones, but i'll skip to the big one now. the ending really bothered me: they committed a crime, but it was ok because the teacher was a bitch. great. do you know how many of my teachers i could kidnap based on that logic? i'm sure the police never took any statements to find out the whole story, either. that sure wouldn't be necessary. helen mirren was good, she added some nice flair to a character who (as a previous commenter noted) had no reason for anything she did. and has anyone else noticed that katie holmes absolutely can't act? her self-righteousness became incredibly annoying. "you wanted me to fail. blah blah blah." her last two scenes with mrs. tingle were the worst. the only reason i don't regret losing $8.25 on this disaster is because she got beaten up a bit. no, wait, i do regret losing the money: it wasn't real, and she survived. mr. williamson, if you're reading this, you've made the same movie (some violence and/or scary stuff offset by wise-ass kids who make sarcastic jokes and references to other movies) just a few too many times now (i count 6 so for, not including scream 3 and whatever follows it), and i would really appreciate it if you would stop. otherwise, i might just have to kidnap you and threaten you with a crossbow. ok? :-)
