after consuming "human pork chop" and properly digesting it, i felt urged and obliged to inform potential viewers, that chewing on this product is no fun and its substance of low nutritive value.<br /><br />according to the dull nature of this film, the following is gonna be a warning more than a review. this is the first time i wished, that there is an "i-don't-care-to-rate-this-movie"-button on imdb, because the only reaction to this boring piece of trash is stasis and indifference. every possible rating would do injustice to all the other items listed here, a "10" is out of question anyway, "1" might persuade some readers, that this is one of those cases where "it's so bad that it's actually really bad and that's kewl!", and "5" is unsatisfying as well, people might think, that it's an ok-flick and alright if you wanna have some cheesy fun, which it is not... honest to god, it's neither a "10", a zero nor a 5, it's nothing, a black hole, a futile work conceived by an embryo. i bought the region 3 dvd, which was cheap (7 bucks!!!) at least and of good picture-quality, i bought it mainly because of the positive and promising reviews posted below my own entry. oh boy, was i to be disappointed. this movie is neither shocking nor disgusting nor unnerving nor... it's not even laughable, it doesn't take itself too serious to be laughed at, but still serious enough so as not to be comic. a truly unpassionate, amateurish effort. the only sequence that i found mildly disturbing is when two giggling thugs put an ugly dog in a bag and bash it against a brick wall... but even such a cruel premise only lead to a poor execution. the further down cited toilet scene is unrealistic and filmmed without any sense for suspense, suffering or humiliation - the feces look like painted marsh-mellows!!! there is a butchery scene at the end of a loooong 85-minutes where three men dressed in plastic raincoats (a setup which one finds also depicted on the front cover of the dvd) start to dispose of the female body. reminded me of "american psycho" and "shallow grave", now these flicks are worth watching and true masterpieces.<br /><br />let's be realistic for once and not rush to make a myth out of every asian-wannabe-scary-movie, as seems to happen lately...<br /><br />if you are looking out for some eastern horror then try danny lee's masterpiece of the very same (english) title "ba xian fan dian zhi ren rou cha shao bao" (human pork chop) it's from 1992 and has - not without reason i might add - been compared to "henry: portrait of a serial killer". there is also a similar film telling the same story by a different film crew called "ren tou dou fu shang" ("there is a secret in my soup") of the same year, sort of a rival production. it's available as a region 3 dvd and by most regarded as superior to "peng shi zhi sang jin tian liang". i might add a few more words on the special effects... what special effects?!?... there are a few chopped off limbs, they look awful - in a wrong sense - probably "made in hong kong".<br /><br />that's about all the info i can share on this subject, hopefully it will prove helpful... enjoy your meal!
