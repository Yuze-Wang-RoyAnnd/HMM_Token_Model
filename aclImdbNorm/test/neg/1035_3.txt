a frustrating documentary. louis kahn's son, who saw his father only minimally during his childhood because he was a member of just one of the three separate families his father had created, takes on the task of trying to learn more about his father through an exploration of his architecture and his life. it sounds like a great idea for a documentary, but it ends up flat and uninteresting.<br /><br />sadly, the basic problem is that kahn's son, nathaniel, is not just one of the film's protagonists --- he is also director, writer, producer, interviewer and narrator. nathaniel seems both too inexperienced and possibly too close to the material to function well in any of these roles. further, while he seems like a nice enough guy, he doesn't have much screen presence, so the fact that he is the only constant in the film becomes wearing. <br /><br />nathaniel also comes across as an unprepared and amateurish interviewer --- there are several points where an interviewee makes an interesting or provocative statement and the camera cuts to a shot of nathaniel offering little more than a blank stare and a sort of timid "uh-huh," as if he's a little panicked that he's going to have to come up with something to say in response. at times, i felt embarrassed watching people who might have had truly interesting things to say about kahn (or at least better things to do with their time) seeming to realize that they were in the hands of an interviewer who was going to rely on them to direct the conversation. <br /><br />nathaniel's dual role as both documentarian and lost son seem to do more to hurt the film than help. one senses that some of the interviewees are a little reluctant to really open up about negative aspects of kahn's personality and career, presumably because it's not clear from nathaniel whether he's looking to dig into the truth or simply wants to hear nice stories about his dad -- preferably ones that will confirm his hope that his dad really did care more for nathaniel and his mother than seems likely. his passive approach as an interviewer may stem directly from this conflict. the only person nathaniel does push is his own mother, but those conversations tend to feel a little like bad teen drama (aren't you angry, mom?") and don't offer much in terms of helping us (or nathaniel) understand kahn or the loyalty he evoked from those around him. <br /><br />what the film desperately lacks is shaping by an experienced and independent hand, not to exclude nathaniel, but to balance his subjectivity and inexperience. an independent director could have stood away from the material, given more thought to what the interviewees could contribute and, one hopes, cut out those portions of the documentary process that just don't work, such as the weird segment with the guy who claims to have see kahn die (which made it look as if nathaniel was just being taken in by some loony) or the entire bit about hooking up with kahn's first cousin, who had nothing to add about kahn or nathaniel. too many times nathaniel makes us watch him standing in or near a kahn building buttonholing strangers to tell them that his father was the designer.
