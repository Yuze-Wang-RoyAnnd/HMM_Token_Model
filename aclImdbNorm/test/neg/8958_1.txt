ok, what to say about actium maximus...<br /><br />there are some bad movies that are so horribly awful they circle 'round to awesome. there are bad movies that just suck in their own right. there are good movies, and so-so movies, and movies that are just fun. then there's actium maximus. you can't make a spoiler for this movie because to do that you would have to understand the action enough to comment. this particular movie is worse than turkish star wars one and the sequel too. those movies are so bad they circle 'round to awesome and they make you feel drunk even if you're stone cold sober. actium circles 'round from bad to awesome, but then it doesn't stop there, it takes another trip to badville, then 'round again to awesome, then finally it sets up a little feudal kingdom on the border of "bad" and "stock footage of paint drying while a harpy screams incoherently." if you are into self punishment this movie is for you. it actually will cause your brain to hurt.
