milla stands out in this movie because of her personal sense of style and the way the clothes hang on her. i have learned to hate that crumpled little three-year-old face she makes whenever she pretends to cry. it makes any points she is trying to make as a serious actress drop off quickly. of course, in a movie with a baldwin and denise, she still shines as a mature actor person. david seemed to be doing woody allen by way of howdy doody. not a single word or gesture in the entire movie seemed sincere or even sincerely acted. "how harry met sally" and "two weddings and funeral", even "sleepless in seattle" had scripts, locations and actors. the script seemed to be a string of bad and crude gags separated by a lot of talking. the locations seemed to be within a few blocks of each other. there are only two actors in this dishrag of an indie flick, milla and the lady who played the chick who was into the stars. i watched most of this through the first time with the sound off, just watching milla. that subscript gag was old the first time i saw it and it's a silly rip off of a song in "how to succeed in business without really trying".
