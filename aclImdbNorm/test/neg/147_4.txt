i usually enjoy watching laurel and hardy, but this is obviously one of the films they made while they were on their way to becoming a successful comedy team.<br /><br />the plot is all too simple, and is mainly based on one joke; how strange kilts and scotsmen are. and that's all. okay, there are some other jokes, but i didn't find them very funny at all; they are outdated and (i guess) were not very entertaining when the movie was first released.<br /><br />still, the movie has got two of the most charming faces in history, and they make the best out of the awkward story (which i expect was filmed without a proper script) and the scenery is nice to look at. <br /><br />in my opinion, watching this is only worthwhile for laurel and hardy fans, other people should stay away from it.
