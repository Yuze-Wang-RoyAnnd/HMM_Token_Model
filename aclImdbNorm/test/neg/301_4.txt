***possible spoilers***<br /><br />i've read up on dahmer a little and saw the new dahmer film (with the same name) at an earlier time. this movie here concentrates rather much on the victims and killings, too little on dahmer himself. the film called "dahmer" had the opposite problem, it was too little about his crimes and too much about himself.<br /><br />i did not find the acting to my satisfaction, it had a certain amateur feel too it, especially the probation officer. it also seemed as if the dahmer acting got worse every time he played against the probation officer actor. but i might be wrong about that.<br /><br />what annoyed me a bit was that some of the scenes were quite disturbing but that the filmmakers seemed to try and show "the real deal" about what he did anyway. that is ok - but what i then don't understand is why the guy who ran away from his flat while dahmer was out getting beer, was not depicted being naked, since that is also how it happened. it's not a big deal, but it just eats away further on the movies quality that such details are left out. what wasn't shown either or not even really hinted was dahmers sexual obsession with the dead. again, i don't mind they didn't show it, but at least they could have mentioned it or built it in to the movie somehow.<br /><br />conclusion: i think the really good dahmer film is still to be made, a movie that incorporates not only dahmers crimes but also who he was, and why he did what he did. i think that 1.5 or 2 hours are just not enough to grasp the complexity of it all. this movie was just a cutout (excuse the pun) of dahmers life and personality and does not give you any 'close to good' insight into his life or personality.<br /><br />4/10
