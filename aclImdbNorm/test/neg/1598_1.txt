i usually can tolerate twisted movies, but this one is really a sick obsessive self-absorbed movie!<br /><br />firstly, the writer/director is totally a self-absorbed guy full of sick jokes that are not funny at all. secondly, he is also a sick pervert who manipulates and poisons children's mind! i can't believe my ears when i heard the sick and perverted monologues spoken by the kids!<br /><br />i really feel sorry for zane adlum and devon matthews. they are both very talented, but fell prey to eric schaeffer's dirty little-known movie!<br /><br />and what the hell happened to eric mabius' good looking face? i mean, he met this girl that he's supposed to marry, but he wasn't in the wedding! in fact there is this bald guy in his place! did time really fly that fast?<br /><br />anyway, don't waste your time to see this movie, unless you want to be poisoned and manipulated by one sick eric schaeffer!
