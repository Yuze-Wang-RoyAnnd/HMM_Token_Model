what could have been an excellent hostage movie was totally ruined by what apparently looks like a bored director ... there were so many directions that the movie could have taken ... a vampire slash-fest was not one of these!!! the last 45 mins. or so results in the movie being an absolutely ridiculous waste of time. ...and sex machine?? ... you gotta be kidding me! the acting talents of the likes of juliette lewis and harvey keitel (not to mention george clooney) are completely wasted in this nonsensical movie. <br /><br />the director... robert rodriguez, known for his other gory flicks including el mariachi, desperado, once upon a time in mexico, and the very recent sin city ... really holds your attention with the well executed first half ... which leads you to believe that you are in for an entertaining time ... but then apparently for no reason, and without any provocation, the madness starts ... there's even feeble attempts at parody and comedy ... truly exasperating!!
