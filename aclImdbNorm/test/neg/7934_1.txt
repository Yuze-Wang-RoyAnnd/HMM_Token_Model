i was looking for attack on precinct 13. there, the film is that memorable. who is the star of this? ethan hawke or matt dillon (i can't tell who the lead actor is, that's a pretty big point against the movie right there) gabriel byrne (who could't have needed the money this badly could he?) drea de matteo is stunning but only because of her amazing body. it took me ages to finally work out she's joey's sister off "friends". i agree that the so called swat people attacking the station are pretty crap, as far as tactics go. we were even taught better basic skills than this in raf basic training.<br /><br />avoid this, even the snow doesn't want to fall on a bus full of prisoners! very bad continuity indeed.<br /><br />avoid like the plague!
