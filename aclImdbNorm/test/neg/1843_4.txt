the concept for this movie was quite good. but somehow the execution failed on many parts. there aren't many horror movies that i can think of that used dolls that looked so realistic. especially when these dolls start blinking their eyes or moving hands. so much could have been done with this premise. there were a lot of scenes where there was room for tension and suspense. and i really was expecting creepy things to happen. but never did the movie managed to be scary. one of the main reasons is that the story is too minimal and predictable. i actually thought that they did this on purpose in order to surprise us with some wonderful twist. sadly this doesn't happen. well at least not in the way that i hoped for. the cast also failed to make it all believable. it would have been nice if more background was given on the characters. in the beginning when we get introduced to the main character. it seems that she and other characters are invited by some sort of artist. but it also is apparent that they don't have an idea themselves what they are invited for. of course this is part of the mystery. but it does seem unlikely. if i got an invitation without having a clue what the deal is i simply would not go. furthermore most characters aren't real likable with the end result that you never actually care for them. another flaw is that the director deviates from the basic premise which is scary enough and brings up new elements that never get explained and aren't even relevant to the "doll master mystery". overall this movie has been a big disappointment to me. if you want to see a good horror movie involving dolls go see "dead silence"!
