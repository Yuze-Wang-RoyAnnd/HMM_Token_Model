it is hard to screw up this story. great book / good film version from fred zinneman, yet this film is awful! first the casting was terrible. richard gere should of played the jackal himself as edward fox was a similar type of cypher and they didn't need to mess with the original script by adding so much worthless (expensive) fluff. this film reminded me of so many bruce willis films, as you see huge expense with nothing cinematic to show for it. (it is his "conspiracy theory") it takes some real doing to make a film this bad from such a fine original script. every person from michael caton jones down should be banned from making films for 10 years; such is the insult this film is to real filmmakers. were hollywood to go on trial for having no idea what they were doing, this film would be exhibit a. shame on you all!
