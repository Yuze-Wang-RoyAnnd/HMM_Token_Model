my friends and i have just finished seeing a preview of this new australian film. everyone who was in the cinema agreed, what was the point of this film? there was no good story to follow, the characters were undeveloped, and the plot seemed unmotivated. i find it bizarre that this film, that probably cost in the high millions, got funded and made. it serves no purpose to the drama community, its adds nothing to the palette of australian cinema. it really was a waste of time creating this droll unemotional piece of work and more time really should be spent work-shopping scripts and creating good stories, not creating a mess like this. hugo weaving and rose byrne were ok but severely hampered by a bad script. pia miranda's character was unnecessary and abstract from the plot, and her lines were average at best. a true waste of talent. the saving grace was geoffrey simpson acs' cinematography, which like most aussie films, was superb. <br /><br />come on guys, think about it next time please.<br /><br />4/10
