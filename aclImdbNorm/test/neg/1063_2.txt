... said the continuity announcer as tactical assault was about to be broadcast . after seeing the first two minutes i started thinking rutger might want to get a new agent . after seeing the next ten minutes i started thinking rutger might want to retire thereby saving a potential audience from any more of his performances <br /><br />yup this is a truly terrible movie . i wasn't expecting much and why should i if the name rutget hauer appeared in the credits , but within seconds of the opening title credits that featured nato warplanes with ussr markings bombing bosnia i realised i was going to be force fed inedible turkey three months after christmas .<br /><br />the attention to detail is non existent . nato planes carry ussr markings then were told hauer's character spent six years in an iraqi prison which would make the setting 1997 . what nato were bombing the serbs in 1997 ! i guess the producers didn't think the audience would have noticed this ridiculous inaccuracy but i know i did . the producers also probably hoped the audience wouldn't notice the lack of continuity such as dogfights with iraqi jets that suddenly turned from migs to f-4 phantoms then back again but i did . even stranger characters would take off in f-16s then when they arrive back at base there jet has changed into a soviet built mig <br /><br />oh and if you're expecting a dumb action movie you're only half right because it's dumb but most of the plot centres around a basic instinct revenge plot . i'll give the producers some credit ( maybe credit is too strong a word ) because after seeing plots featuring nannies from hell , policemen from hell , flat mates from hell we now have a fighter pilot from hell which means every single occupation of the 20th century has featured in a from hell type plot with perhaps tatical assualt being the worst movie of the lot
