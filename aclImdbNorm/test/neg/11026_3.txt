extremely formulaic with cosmic-sized logic holes and a pretense at comedy. aw, poor nyc lawyer! he's just scraping by, and when he gets a reduction in pay he doesn't go out to find another job, though he's one of the most respected lawyers in the area. we see him arguing in court so that others come up and congratulate him on his fiery, winning delivery, but he can't stand up to anyone in his firm. at home, problems are ignored until people storm out of the house.<br /><br />the only character you want to root for is the final maid, who seems an actual human being who uses logic and communication to survive in the world. how laughable that the maid should bring the lawyer and his wife a chicken and wine on new year's eve because she feels sorry for them! (the bit's not played for laughs.)<br /><br />sorry, just too unbelievable and with a **spoiler** pat, everyone-turns-180-degrees ending. how'd they get top-notch stars for this? if i'd been at the studio i'd have sent this one back for a complete rewrite.
