let me tell you something...this movie exceeds all of the troma laugh and gore movies hands down as it actually tries to come across as a serious movie. from the terrible acting... "i knew it, i knew she was possessed!"...to the priest accepting sexual favors and getting into showers with naked teenagers...this piece of dung takes the cake. i am at a loss trying to compare this to another movie equally as bad. this may just be in a class all its own. the kicker is that supposedly some cardinal oversaw production to make sure it was true to the actual situation. i did not know that people from backwoods usa act like utter imbeciles. i am not sure if i am upset for renting it or have stumbled across a jewel of comedy. this was a very guilty pleasure...so awful that i watched with hands over my eyes half the time (while i wasn't laughing so hard i was crying). the ending simply made no sense whatsoever, pulling the whole thing together perfectly. if you want to watch something so awful its funny, here is your movie. if you want a scary movie on exorcism....move on.
