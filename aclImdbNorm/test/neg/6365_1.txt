when i heard the film was to be released and the theme of what it was about, i felt very curious. but when i saw it was the biggest deception of my life. technically speaking, the sound is poor, you can tell about man dialogs that were remade on studio that are poorly achieved in the final mix. secondo of all, the photography is mediocre, some part of the films show some soldiers with night vision goggles, and the way the cinematographer achieves that "dark night" is by illuminated everything like if they were in an actual military base with lights, there's no reference used of the moonlight, my god! thir but not least, most of the ac tings are really poor, it's totally not believable the roll of the wife of one of the soldier, her performance it's pretty poor.<br /><br />great disappointing, shame of the jury who chose to send this movie to represent colombia on the oscars.
