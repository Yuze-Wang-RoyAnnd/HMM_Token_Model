so when bob and marion boxletter see a guy at a hotel, marion believes it is her long lost brother brian, but when she approaches him he appears to be someone else just with the exact same face. marion manages to get his fingerprints and takes it to the police and when the identity is confirmed that it was in fact her brother brian she and bob leave for new york after tracing his whereabouts. they get a hold of brian, but still he doesn't know what they are talking about, but all the couple really want to know is where brian has their 8 maybe 9 year old son joey... and even when they see joey he doesn't know them either. the plot thickens and they find themselves one day thinking that they are someone else as well. experiments made out on people only to make the perfect assassins yet the question of why they would bother putting bob and marion in the same building as each other is beyond me. personally gregory harrison played his 2 parts great, but i have no clue what was wrong with the other actors, they seemed bored and lost. 3 out of 10, a little suspense yes but that's it.
