gordon goes over the top in typical full moon fashion, but that's to be expected. combs is surprisingly low-key, keeping his performance at a more realistic level than we are used to seeing. also gone is the usual stuart gordon 'tongue-in-cheek' black humor.<br /><br />the film is quite effective in showing combs' break down and his final heroic act to save his wife & daughter. you actually feel sympathy for his character, despite his short-comings.<br /><br />personally, i was more surprised at the nudity and borderline porno sex scene, than i was shocked by the graphic violence & gore.<br /><br />not classic gordon, but certainly something you might enjoy if you've seen his more famous films.
