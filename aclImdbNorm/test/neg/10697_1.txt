this piece of crap is actually the bomb, as in bottom of the barrel. i can't figure out which is worst; norris' dull portrayal of anonymity (not a great trait in an action protagonist) or christopher neame's hysterical overacting. this film doesn't deliver on any level what so ever. the action sequences are tame, the plot is paper thin, and the scenes that are supposed to be horrific look like a clich'e from the fifties. you can't just fill a room with smoke and men in rubber suits, and expect the audience to scream in terror.<br /><br />visually the film does nothing for me. it actually looks like an unfortunate mix between a cheap porn flick and a miami vice rip-off with a little sprinkling of hell-spawn. no, wait. that should have been hell-yawn.
