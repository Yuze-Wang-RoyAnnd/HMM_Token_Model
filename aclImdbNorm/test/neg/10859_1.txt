i would not recommend it whatsoever. it was like getting stuck in the middle row of a theater, so i couldn't leave, and watching a part porn movie (except they didn't take their clothes off - it was the body language and definitely the language). i have to say i was embarrassed. filming was very low budget, no good dialogue. yuck. actors stunk except the two best characters who got killed off (?) and they were david carradine and dennis hopper. it did smack of kill bill and that old movie with the two guys who ride the dessert on their chopppers. you know what i mean. blablabla. the filming was grainy and just a very low quality. there was nobody in that theater that liked this movie, and the people around me were younger and tattooed.
