what a disappointment. the story line is so simple - "the good guys sometimes do bad things and the bad guys sometimes do good things" - dressed up into a racial setting to make it seem clever, sophisticated and meaningful. it isn't. it lacks any subtlety.<br /><br />everything that happens is telegraphed and then gone over again in case you missed the explanation.<br /><br />for a film like this to convince and move the audience it has to be represent the ambiguity of the characters and their motivation and actions; not simply present it as a series of 180 degree changes in each character's actions.<br /><br />half way through i really wanted to waste no more time on it, but i thought i would stick with it in case it improved; big mistake i should have stopped then - it simply got worse.
