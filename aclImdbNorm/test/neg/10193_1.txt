this movie should have come with a disclaimer that it was akin to the left behind series. i did not know it would be a bible-thumping movie. i expected it to truly be a movie about ufos and alien abduction for entertainment's sake. as previous reviewer comments, it would be fine to show at a church, but not at a public theater, at least not without the consumer's prior knowledge of what the premise of the movie is about. i felt deceived out of my $$ spent for this movie, as nothing in the summary refers to its religious overtones. if you go to church, it'll probably be shown there for free some time. other than the cover-up of its true subject matter, the movie was fine as far as acting and script were concerned. but i have to say i walked out an hour into the movie when i saw what direction it was headed and that i was not going to be entertained, but preached to.
