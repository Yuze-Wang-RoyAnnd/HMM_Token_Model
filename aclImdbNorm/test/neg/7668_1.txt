this film is an absolute disgrace! i thoroughly enjoyed the original airport, and i can't believe how the same people could produce this twaddle nine years on. first of all, the acting is bad. the original had actors who had done quality (non-disaster) films before, but this one uses actors who have done the disaster movie circuit already (blakely, kennedy, wagner). also, george kennedy's character patroni seems to get promoted very quickly. he is now the lead in the film, but his character isn't strong enough to carry it off: he has lost the charm and humour of airport (1970), and the character is now just boring. have i mentioned the plot? is it at all believable that someone would send a missile after the concorde?? no!!! there are also too many loose ends; scenes that have no relevance whatsoever to the plot. the scene where the hot air balloon lands on the runway, the chase of the thief in charles de gaulle airport are two such scenes. both would be interesting - if only they had something to do with the actual story. there also many unanswered questions: why does patroni open the window and fire a flare at the other plane? why does robert wagner's character kill himself? (he must have another stupid and costly way of why is there no enquiry after the missile almost blows up the concorde? why are the back projections so bad? (it looks as though a cartoon missile is following the concorde; although it does work well when the plane lands in paris) why does patroni think that he is in a flight simulator? (when he turns the concorde over) why does he get a hero's welcome in the cabin of the plane after having terrified the passengers? and why is the ending so poor, if it can be called an ending at all? given their one-dimensional-ness, no-one seems to notice this. the blessing given to the young couple on the plane by the girl's coach is shmaltzy, the man who plays the saxophone is annoying, and the woman with the bladder problem is just plain silly. the scenes where susan blakely is lying on the roof of her conservatory, and the when she tells wagner that she still loves him are quite awful. in conclusion, this film should have been the climax of the previous three airport films: instead it is a diabolical, sub-moronic, complete and utter waste of time, money, energy, celluloid and "talent"!!!!!!! remember when patroni asks the french pilot if he has "ever landed on his belly?" this film certainly does the belly flop, and lands flat on its pointy nose...
