the not the best movie in the world???? that was an understatement. i personally didn't like this movie at all. not because of the story line, not because of the graphic violence, and the nudity. the nudity didn't really need to be in it, it did nothing for the story, except maybe the girls were going through a rough time, and being naked probably messed them up even more. but one of the things in the movie that i hated.. was that it was sooooo dark. you couldn't really make out what was going on. i think if it wasn't as dark, and you could see where they were, then it might not have been so bad. all you know that its a basement somewhere. you see no house, no road, the killer in it, all you could see was half his face for about 5 seconds. i wanna see some stuff in a movie. it gets boring after 20 mins of pretty much darkness and all you see occasionally is a flashlight or a wall. then you will hear the girl sobbing. there was nothing that really stuck out to me that was good about the movie, maybe the suspense in the first 10 mins of the film... but not the suspense of how the movie is going to end, but the suspense of.. will i get to see anything in this movie but a few naked bodies and various flashing lights. but honestly people, this was a saw meets blair witch project wannabe. both top notch movies, and both with the correct lighting to figure out what was going on. forget this movie if you can see.. if your a blind person.. you might wanna rent it to hear the screams if your into that sort of thing. but then again if you are blind, your probably not reading this either.. so anyway... bad movie!!!!
