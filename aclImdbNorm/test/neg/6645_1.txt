i would not recommend this movie. even though it is rated g and is clearly for kids there is quite a lot of swearing (including the dreaded 'f' and 's' words). this kind of language doesn't offend me particularly but in a kids film? come on.<br /><br />there was also quite a bit of implied sexual content, between one of the early adolescent male characters and any willing adult woman who came along - including a prostitute! <br /><br />the acting was as good as it gets in this genre of film but the story line was very very cheesy and even my four year old remarked that it was 'stupid'.<br /><br />despite having elizabeth shue, this film is definitely not worth checking out if you haven't seen it.
