i just recently viewed shame which is directed by ingmar bergman. the film was interesting and very unique. i liked how it was in swedish with english subtitles and that it was also in black and white. these features allowed me to better relate to the characters, the time period, and their stories. i didn't like how the movie was very slow in the beginning and how you didn't know what was really going on. at first, it was mainly a story of eva and jan's relationship. the movie also ended on a very depressing note because nothing good came out of all of the conflicts and changes throughout the movie. i probably would not go see shame again, but it was a very cultured experience.
