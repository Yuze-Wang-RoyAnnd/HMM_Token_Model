me being from australia and loving the series, i wasn't expecting much from the american version of kath and kim but i thought i'd watch the first episode to see if it was really that bad.<br /><br />well,whats there to say. its nothing special.selma blair is ok as kim and actually had a few good lines, molly shannon is not a good kath though. the good thing about jane turner's kath is that when she speaks with all her funny accents (such as when she says yumor or noice) it sounds like its just the natural way that she speaks, but when shannon has a go at the accent, its clear that she is acting and trying to be the same as turner. and the show really misses sharon or some one else to give us something to laugh about, because the kal and craig characters in this version are really not funny.<br /><br />so far only the first episode has aired and it is clearly not up to the standards of the aussie version, although if it was a stand alone television show with a different name, not being compared to the aussie version it would perhaps be viewed as being a little bit better. but if there is nothing else to do on a sunday night (or thursday night in america) then you cant do much harm in watching it, or better put on some of the aussie version if you've got it.
