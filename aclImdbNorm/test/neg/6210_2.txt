honestly, i have to admit that i go and see certain stupid films based on the hype they have generated or are currently generating. this dumb salman khan & govinda feature is one of those stupid films. okay, by now we've all seen 'hitch' starring will smith as a date doctor trying to help out odd people find true. then why would we need to see salman khan re-enact this? therein lies the $64,000 question. in case you were wondering, govinda plays the oddball in search of the love of his life (an unreachable socialite) played by katrina kaif.<br /><br />lara dutta is along to play sallu's eva mendes, and sallu's real-life love kaif pretty much plays her character like every role you've see her in thus far, no stretch no acting required. and for nearly three and a half hours we get tortured with spoofs of other bollywood films and characters or better yet we get treated to low rate performances of past hit films. rajpal yadav co-stars. f
