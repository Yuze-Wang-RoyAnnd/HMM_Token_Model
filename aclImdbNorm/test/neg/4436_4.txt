quintet marks the only venture of both paul newman and director robert altman into the realm of science fiction. it was said of newman that he could not do comedy, but he tried until he finally scored a real success in that genre with slap shot. but the failure of this film left him gun shy and he never tried it again.<br /><br />this is one of the biggest downer films i've ever seen. it's a futuristic ice age, brought on by who knows what, but presumably it's a nuclear winter. even during the ice age of thousands of years ago, the equatorial parts of the earth still sustained animal and human life, but apparently not here. seals have survived and paul newman is a seal hunter on the outside.<br /><br />but hunters do need a little r&r and newman goes to a futuristic city where things are so boring the natives have some kind of game played with six people and it's a kind of russian roulette. to win you have to kill five other participants in your game.<br /><br />it's a sad turn to see what man has come down to. which is one of the reasons i just could not get into this story. the atmosphere is bleak, the story is bleak, the people are bleak, it's all so bleak. no wonder this thing came up short at the box office.<br /><br />it's a film that just about everyone thinks is never going to be on the top ten list of paul newman films, including me.<br /><br />this is man's future, what a bummer.
