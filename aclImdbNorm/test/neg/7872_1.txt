i rented this film when my girlfriend was away, hoping to see some serious military/specialist action.<br /><br />after 10 minutes of watching this "movie" i was so terrified and horrified and sick of the quality of everything in this film that i was ready to destroy the rented disc with a flame thrower. luckily i couldn't find one. i've seen many bad films. but this is not even bad, it is total garbage and it does not even deserve to be counted as a movie here on imdb.<br /><br />i feel sorry for the people who have been involved in the making of this total disgrace. hope it wins some oscars though :d.
