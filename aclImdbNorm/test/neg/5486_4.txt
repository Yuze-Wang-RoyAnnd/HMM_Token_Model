i have now seen quite a few films by pedro almod'ovar, but this would have to be the most disappointing so far. this film seemed to lack the zaniness that is usually everywhere in his films, and the story just never got me interested. many almod'ovar regulars appear in this film, so it's not like there was a lack of on-screen talent, but this film just seemed more serious than his other films. if there was a comedic edge to this movie, i certainly couldn't find it, and it made for one surprisingly weak movie.
