granted, hotd 2 is better than the uwe boll crapfest that was the first one, but thats like saying drowning is better than being chopped alive. ok ok, i'm being a little bit harsh with this one, its just that video game adaptations of zombie movies always leave a bad taste in my mouth. resident evil was alright, but its sequels are pure rubbish. the first hotd was entertaining crap more than anything else; uwe boll saw to that. and hotd 2 was...better? the entertainment value was there, the hot chicks were there, the gore was there, but... this is it? the script, even though subpar, was better than the first one. but in the script dwells horribly written characters, stupid action sequences, clich'es, and an ending that drags on and on reaching a level of ridiculousness which would make the bollmeister very, very proud. but, it could've been worse right?<br /><br />hotd 2 stars sig haig (yes, sid haig) as an insane doctor looking for a cure to death. as you may guess, it all goes to sh*t. a nearby college campus seems to be the center for the zombie (or hypersapien?) epidemic, and as you may expect, a group of commandos and two zombie scientists try to save the world by going there and neutralizing the problem. their main goal? no, it ain't blowing sh*t up. instead, they have to get a sample of zombie blood, so they can create a cure to the deadly virus. between this and that lays bland character interactions, an insufferable amount of clich'es (but hey, at least the black guy isn't the first one to get killed), and decent looking zombies. <br /><br />the acting is passable. who would've thought that sticky fingaz was a passable actor? not me. emmanuelle vaugier and ed quinn shine somewhat as the leads. and the supporting cast was passable too. it was all passable. <br /><br />the make up effects on the zombies were alright, it could've been worse like in the first hotd: just guys running around in dusty mummy suits. the gore was alright too. cheap scares and even cheaper tension are almost non-existent in this movie, which is a good thing. the action sequences were stupid as f*ck, but at least there wasn't any sword fighting zombies or that ridiculous slow motion bullet effect. <br /><br />overall, this movie will appeal only to zombie enthusiasts, fans of the arcade games and for someone who wants to rent a cheap horror movie for the weekend. apparently there's going to be a third one as hinted by the ending, but i wouldn't count on it. unless uwe decides to do it. a 4.
