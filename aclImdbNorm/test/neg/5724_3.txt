... when dubbed into another language. let's face it: neither nielsen nor schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialog. and given the campy lines they are supposed to utter this is a loose-loose situation. any type of voice-over is sure to be an improvement (and it actually is - at least in the german version).<br /><br />but that is only a minor point. the acting is bad. the speeded up combat sequences are pathetic. nielsen couldn't use her sword to fight her way out of a wet paper bag. this becomes painfully obvious when compared to the fluidity of motion exhibited by the kid (who has had some martial arts training, no doubt) and to the athleticism shown off by sandahl bergman.<br /><br />schwarzenegger does his conan thing - nothing new here.<br /><br />some of the visuals are nice, i'll have to grant that. the dragon skeleton bridge looks cool. but more often than not the plaster is all too evident.<br /><br />overall the movie isn't worth seeing. even 'conan the destroyer' is better than this (although only marginally). i would have much rather seen bergman as red sonja as she was originally supposed to be, but i doubt that that could have saved this movie - oh well.<br /><br />3/10
