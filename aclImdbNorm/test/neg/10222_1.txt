now i'm a big animation fan -- love svankmeyer and usually am into all applications of stop motion so i had high hopes for this one. then i came on imdb and paused --- i'm always real suspicious of films with a bimodal distribution of votes on imdb. here we've got another --- a bunch of 10s (shill anyone) and then some real low ones. i'm also suspicious of 10s with the word "visionary" in them. <br /><br />sure there are visionaries but this character isn't one of them. despite my misgivings, i saw this film and have to side with the ones. the stop motion animation was okay but the plots were banal and overall it seemed amateurish. treat yourself to the real deal get some svankmeyer and leave this also ran on the shelf.
