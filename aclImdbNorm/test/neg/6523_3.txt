i did not like this movie. i rented it hoping it would be something like the 10th kingdom. i was disappointed when i discovered it wasn't. i also found it just plain nervracking. the acting was bad, the characters where unbelievable and the time jumps were crazy. i only recomend this film if your in the mood to see a crazy dude running around, but i'm sure there are better films with the same thing. i can't believe i wasted my time on this one.
