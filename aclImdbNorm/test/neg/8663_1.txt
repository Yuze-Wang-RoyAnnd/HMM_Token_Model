i agree with several of you that this film was rather boring and dull. i found myself disliking the main character and the following actors/actresses that came in the scenes. the camera work was non pleasing itself. random shots and shaky film scenes made me quite annoyed and i turned the film off. i will make up my time by watching the 1999 adaption and hope that it fits agreeable along with sense and sensibility; emma; becoming jane; and pride and prejudice. i've only a few others to watch besides these films but i believe they were done in great taste. the music was kind of out of place with the film also, reminding me of another show i had seen this year. it was called hex and a show from bbc. i came across it one night on the web. i rather liked the first season but the second season was dry and pulling things out of thin air that should of stayed with the clouds. i found the main male character who was henry in this film out of place. perhaps i just do not like his way of speaking or his stature. well i would not recommend this film to anyone unless they were going to have it muted and they wanted to look at the fashion of the era, or the way homes were kept at the time. again i will watch the 1999 version and hope it is a better and does jane austen some justice to her writing.
