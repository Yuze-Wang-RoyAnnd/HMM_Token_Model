i really wanted to see this film - i thought the plot was really unique and intriguing. a cop (andy garcia) has a son who is dying and needs bone marrow replacement in order to live. the only match is a convicted serial killer, who escapes from jail. to save his son he has to track down the killer.<br /><br />michael keaton plays the convict in one of many disappointing aspects of the film. keaton is a great actor at times but here he is pretty much boring. it's over-the-top to the point where you just stop caring.<br /><br />garcia is better but tries too hard for a film that isn't up to par. barbet schroeder (at one time such a promising director with films like "barfly" that amounted to pretty much nothing in the american market) directs well enough - i honestly thought the script was the culprit here...it's just a big mess.<br /><br />the film ultimately wastes a lot of good material, good actors and a good director - all because of a faulty script. what should have been a tense and thought-provoking film is just a hollywood action dud.
