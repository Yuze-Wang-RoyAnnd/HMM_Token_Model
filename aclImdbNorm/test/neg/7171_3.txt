the willies starts late one night as brother's josh (joshua miller) & kyle (jason horst) are camping outside with their cousin michael (sean astin), they decide to pass the time by telling scary stories...<br /><br />first up is michael with a story entitled 'bad apples' in which a young boy named danny hollister (ian fried) is bullied at school, however the sinister new janitor mr. jenkins (james karen) decides to help him out...<br /><br />next up is kyle as he tells a strange story called 'flyboy' in which an overweight bully with a worrying fascination with dead flies gets what he deserves in a horrible twisted way...<br /><br />written & directed by brian peck the willies didn't do much for me & i doubt it'll do much for you either. the script is strange as far as episodic anthologies go, instead of the usual three or four stories it only has two main tales & a few bizarre 'urban myth' type mini scenes at the start, these consist of the person who orders food from a fast food restaurant only to find a dead rat in her chicken, a man who dies of a heart attack on a ride & someone who tries to dry her poodle off in the microwave only for it to explode. i have no idea what the purpose of these scenes are but they add nothing to the film, as for the two main stories they are both weak. for a start they are too long which is a huge mistake in these types of films, usually the stories in anthologies are short, sharp & quick with a nice twist at the end usually involving people getting what they deserved. however in the willies the stories last for the best part of 40 minutes each which is longer than the average tv episode & i must admit i found both stories very boring, they have very little going for them & seem to be aimed at children. the first story is the better to watch as a whole but it has no twist ending as far as i could see while the second one has a nice 'just deserts' ending but the build up to it is weak & drawn out for no good reason. i really like horror anthology films so the willies comes as a disappointment, frankly it lets the genre down.<br /><br />director peck was obviously working on a low budget & as a whole the willies is pretty tough to sit through, there's plenty of continuity errors & it's poorly made. there's no atmosphere, there's no scares, there's no gore, the special effects are poor & it features unnecessary shots of a dirty toilet several times. overall it's a pretty unappealing film to sit through.<br /><br />technically the willies is rough around the edges to say the least, the effects are far from special & it has an extremely drab & grainy look to the picture. the acting is poor, no ones going to win any awards thats for sure.<br /><br />the willies is a poor film, it's not scary, it's not fun, it's not entertaining & it only features two overlong stories. definitely not recommended.
