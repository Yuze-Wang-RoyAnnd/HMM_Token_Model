five fingers is so bad, that i hardly know where to begin. so let me admit first, that i have only seen the first half hour. when the first finger had been chopped off, i thought sleeping a more useful activity. i told my girlfriend the meaning of "five fingers" and she immediately followed my example.<br /><br />couldn't the producer, the director and/or the scriptwriter consult a chess-amateur? like me? they should have used a digital chess-clock and not an analogue. this major goof makes the mental pressure put on martijn just a laugh. how, when and why did martijn date a moroccan girlfriend? such an affair is very rare in the netherlands.<br /><br />calling me a retard is of course an insult to all those people suffering with a much lower than average iq. moreover, as far as i know, retards don't play chess. i do.<br /><br />the biggest problem is the script of course. just compare the little intelligent movie hard candy. to keep the spectator in a grip, the information must be revealed bit by bit. a nice twist now and then also helps. i understood from other reviews, that there is a big one at the end of the movie. any smart person can guess what it is. this of course just raises more questions - why is the travel guide killed? oh my, why should i even care? the whole movie focuses on just one thing: the chopped fingers. the makers have not even learned hitchcock's lesson: it is thrilling to get a bomb exploded. it is more thrilling to show that bomb ticking. but no, we don't see the paper-cutter until the impossible countdown is over. i will not waste more words on this crap. go see hard candy.
