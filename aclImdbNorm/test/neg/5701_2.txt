this movie has every clich'e of every terrorism or airliner crisis movie.<br /><br />however, it is not entirely unwatchable, thanks to good performances by rowland, loken and smallwood (and maybe enberg).<br /><br />what is amazingly bad, though, is the computer animations they try to pass off as live action scenes. boy, oh boy, the cgi scenes in "the last starfighter", filmed in 1984, are better than these (filmed 17 years later). the feeling of cheepnis really sends shivers down your spine.<br /><br />a pity, this could have been a much better movie with a little more budget and taste.
