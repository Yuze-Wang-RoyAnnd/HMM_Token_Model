after missing out on this innumerable times on tcm uk, i decided to check it out given its sci-fi/adventure/camp pedigree: i knew i'd be in for a thoroughly silly ride - but it was also astoundingly bad! anyway, perhaps appropriately given the characters involved, the script rips off many sci-fi titles then of recent vintage - soylent green (1973), zardoz (1974), logan's run (1976; to the extent that it was filmed on some of the self-same sets!), star wars (1977), alien (1979) and mad max 2: the road warrior (1981)! <br /><br />the plot is simple but not exactly engaging: from the title one can deduce that water has become scarce on the planet where all of this takes place - so our ragtag buccaneer heroes take it upon themselves to steal ice blocks from the tyrannical templar(!) rulers. also involved is a beautiful princess (mary crosby, daughter of bing!) in search of her father, the deposed king; by the way, the cast includes another famous offspring: anjelica huston (daughter of john) as one of the pirate band - thankfully, the actress' mistake in accepting such a role would soon be forgotten in the wake of her winning an oscar (under her father's guidance, no less) for prizzi's honor (1985). since star wars had peter cushing as the "supreme commander", the film-makers opted to have a screen legend of their own - 78-year old john carradine (who's seen strapped to a sort of operating table during his one brief scene!).<br /><br />the most notable bits (for all the wrong reasons) are: the alien using the toilet; the castration machine; the clumsy antics (including karate-style combat!) of the inevitable robot companions; the goofy slave/eunuch make-up worn at one point by the heroes; the recurring attacks by the "space herpies" (whatever that is); the climax in which the characters are made to age when going through a time-warp (crosby becomes pregnant, gives birth, and sees her son grow up in the space of 30 seconds, while leading man robert urich himself is replaced by john ford stalwart hank worden for this scene!) - incidentally, the jump-cuts adopted here (intending to denote the rapid passage of time) are not only unsuccessful but downright irritating.
