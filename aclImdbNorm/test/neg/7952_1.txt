...or is this another way below the bottom-of-the-barrel masterpiece? preferably both! somewhere between 1969 and 1972 came a host of several horrible horror movies that are all but lost again. nothing more needs to be explained, asked, or screamed out loud. if you followed closely at my writings about carnival of blood or guru the mad monk, then you know what's in store with scream baby scream. the title sounds cool; it's just the weak script that should have gone someplace else! even so, this is hands down, the most dreadfully written piece of cinematic mastery ever worked on film!<br /><br />if you thought this is an early slasher (which benefits the average imdb user to write up another comment), better luck next time! the real truth behind the script has nothing to do with the movie, which supposedly tells of a blue-faced psychopath out to "kill" and make some ugly facial sculptures on his victims. it feels like you're watching another early "scooby-doo" episode. my favorite scene is the monkey cage where the four young hippie teenagers play in. and hooray for an actress under the name "eugenie wingate" for giving us the worst facial makeover, ever! 1969 has never been this bad, but it is!<br /><br />try finding this 30-year old rarity at a bargain basement for five bucks; it makes the perfect novelty item for going back to those psychedelic days of flower power, bad fashions, and trashy music! interesting note: scream baby scream is also listed in troma's film archives on the company's website. only time will tell when this reaches the top of the bottom 100 list along with a few more early 70s cheapies; gosh knows they need to!!! plan 9 is history!!!
