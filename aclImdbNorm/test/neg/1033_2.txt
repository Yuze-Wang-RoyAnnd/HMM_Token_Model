i love documentaries. the andy goldsworthy doc was great.i looked forward to this one - but was very disappointed. i knew of kahn and was intrigued by the idea of his lonely death in a penn station men's room. there must be a story here, i mistakenly believed.the only story here is of sadly deluded women who had affairs with an ugly little famous married man. in the absence of anything like an explanation for this guy's horrible behavior, we're given endlessly repeated clips of kahn walking around and painfully long - supposedly contemplative - shots of his soulless buildings.actually, some of the buildings are interesting but the thrust of the film asks us to think about the guy himself. the overwrought soundtrack references an emotional tug that is entirely absent from the film. kahn's apparent gifts do not excuse his behavior or martyr his mistresses. this film seems to want to give kahn the great artiste's free pass and thus make the director and his mother sympathetic figures - i don't buy it.
