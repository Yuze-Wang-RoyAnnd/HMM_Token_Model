this movie was, perhaps, one of the most unoriginal and unfunny films i've seen in a long, long while. to be fair, i was not expecting some revolutionary comic formula, but i was anticipating to at least be entertained. with such low expectations, how could i manage to be disappointed? <br /><br />jim carrey, possibly my favorite actor (not sarcasm), did little more than tread water in this film. he seems to have temporarily returned to his funny-face-making roots and created a character no different from his fletcher reede from liar liar. this new character, dick harper (a.k.a. fletcher 2.0) is a poorly rendered and miserably written whelp. if you find yourself smiling while watching this pitiful and essentially boring character, it is most likely because carrey is trying so hard to bring a third dimension to him. carrey's outlandish posing becomes humorously awkward--and, ultimately, sad.<br /><br />tea leoni as jane does little more than provide the abbott to carrey's costello. i typically find tea leoni refreshing and underused, but not in this case. jane harper could have been easily played by any actress from age thirty to forty-five, and it is in that non-specificity that the character of jane becomes uninteresting to watch. she simply has no defining trait other than her following of the movie's general theme, which seems to be that... wait, no, this movie has no theme. unless you count "big business is evil" as a theme. i thought that was more of a given.<br /><br />richard jenkins and alec baldwin both deliver believable (though tired) supporting performances, but neither man seems truly invested in the role they're playing. it's very clear that alec baldwin was putting about as much effort into playing his role as the sinister c.e.o. as he puts into eating a sandwich (which he seems to be doing a lot of lately).<br /><br />slight tangent, but has alec baldwin played any roles in the past few years that hasn't required him to be a powerful jerk in a suit? <br /><br />anyway, take my advice if you haven't already witnessed the horror for yourself: save your money. this is the one to catch on hbo in a few months. dick and jane are present, but there's no fun to be had.
