===========big spoiler================================== this is a terrible movie with no likable characters. so many clich'es and senseless scenes. it needs a good editor but then there might not be any movie left. please save your two hours. the only decent and unpredictable scene in the movie was when the younger brother refuses to stop his brother from killing himself. the description read "moments of dark comedy". perhaps i missed those when i blinked. the horrible characters start right with the funeral. the funeral goers are laughing and complaining about the food while at the funeral of a very young man who has committed suicide? then the father makes digs at the only son left? right at the funeral? how is it that the next door neighbor whose husband cheated on her with sigourney weaver's character is the bad guy for telling the husband? the father doesn't even know his son can play the piano though everyone else around him seems to know he is a great pianist. the movie tries to shove every dramatic clich'e possible into one movie: father over-driving athletic son to succeed, dysfunctional family losing a chosen son to suicide, the son left feeling lost and alone, drugs, marital affairs, child conceived via affair but raised as husband's son, incest, homosexual tendencies, bullies, possible terminal illness, etc, etc, etc. do not waste your 2 hours.
