i will admit i didn't pay full attention to everything going on in this film, but to be honest, i don't think it would have mattered. basically local councillor sidney fiddler (sid james) persuades the incompetent mayor frederick bumble (kenneth connor) of firecombe to hold a beauty contest, to improve the town's image. they face opposition from women's liberationist augusta prodworthy (june whitfield) trying to sabotage the contest, but they do have publicity agent peter potter (bernard bresslaw) and palace hotel owner connie philpotts (joan sims). soon enough the young, beautiful wannabe models show up, including hope springs (barbara windsor), paula perkins (valerie leon), dawn brakes (goldfinger's margaret nolan), debra (sally geeson) and ida downs (eastenders' wendy richard). when the girls have cat fights, it does draw away regular residents, but after quite a while of some plodding not that funny innuendos and william (jack douglas) having over-active twitches, it does finally reach the competition, and it's just afterwards i couldn't be bothered. also starring patsy rowlands as mildred bumble, peter butterworth as admiral, joan hickson as mrs. dukes, david lodge as police inspector, angela grant as miss bangor, arnold ridley as councillor pratt, robin askwith as larry, patricia franklin as rosemary, jimmy logan as cecil gaybody and dad's army's bill pertwee as fire brigade chief, charles hawtrey had obviously quit the carry ons, but where's kenneth williams? i suppose seeing babs and young, beautiful looking pauline fowler in bikinis, but for comedy value, this fails miserably, and the overuse of the swanny whistle just gets on your nerves. pretty poor!
