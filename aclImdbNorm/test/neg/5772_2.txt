a group of friends receive word from a pal who has found gold in an old mind shaft nearby an ancient abandoned western town of suttersville. despite warnings by the local sheriff, murphy(john phillip law), old man prichard(richard lynch)a bedraggled hick who swindles tourists with supposed collectible wanted posters, and kooky superstitious aunt nelly(karen black)to stay out of the mine due to it's notorious legend(..that an evil coal miner who sold his soul to devil and murdered a priest's(jeff conaway)daughter will return from the dead to kill those who remove the gold from his shaft), these people only see the green, not the blood red which could potentially ooze from their slain bodies. finding the gold of jeremiah stone intact, they line their pockets and carrying cases, prepared for the bright futures that supposedly lie ahead. but, when you do not heed the warnings of those you consider backwoods loons, the obvious result will be gruesome death. jeremiah stone, as we see, is lying merely a skeleton near an alter containing skulls lined next to each other as the candles on top of them light up, the pickax underneath awaiting it's master, with dust particles returning him to a grotesque corpse with demonic exposition, his eyes aglow with wrath. this hapless group, hoping for some fun around the campfire with gold providing them with warm prospects for life ahead, will fall prey to the vengeful ghoul and his mean pickax. another victim will meet the nasty end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of her vehicle, directing it's path straight into her neck. another failed attempt to retreat has stone causing a frightened victim to drive his car into a tree, his body engulfed in flames as he fails to escape without harm. another, a local girl searching for her new friends, worried about their well being, receives the pickax buried into her stomach. aunt nelly informs those still alive about the forty-niner and the curse on those who raids his eternal stash..and pays the price for relating such information. will anybody survive? or, is the entire group fated to perish at the hands of the zombie miner?<br /><br />make-up effects artist and monster creator, john carl buechler directs this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or strong story-telling, opting instead to allow his zombie miner to destroy anyone and everyone who happens to be in his path. he provides just enough back story, and this is feeble at best, for the killer allowing special guest star, karen black(..oh how her career has sunken into the abyss)to explain to the viewer about him. the story given to us has the miner holding a priest's daughter hostage, threatening to execute her as the suttersville authorities warn against such an action. startling enough, stone plants that pickax right into her back, with the opposition unloading their guns with little effect because he sold his soul to satan. retreating to his domain, the mine shaft, stone sends out a warning against anyone even attempting to take what's his, the loot. typical of most slashers in general, this bunch of twenty-somethings are your garden variety victims, with little development other than some banter and exchanging of words provides as filler until the undead maniac pops onto the scene to slaughter them. they are the usual group, from the city, trespassing unto unfamiliar territory, resurrecting an evil that should remain dormant. like many of the later 80's slashers, a good deal of the violence is off-screen. what is on screen, the minimal gore, is rather mundanely presented and happens rather quickly. the ghoul make-up for the killer is only shown occasionally;he's mostly shrouded in darkness, the victims' horrified faces as he catches or chases after them are given more credence than the method of destruction. one thing's for certain, stunt men were set on fire many times. at least three times, a character is burned alive by either a lantern or flaming vehicle. martin cove has a minor cameo as black's former husband, caleb, now living with a much younger, and dense, honey. vernon wells(..of the road warrior and commando fame)has the back story role of jeremiah stone as a human, still capturing the same type of menace he specializes in. john phillip law seems to be enjoying himself as the rather polite and hospitable sheriff, welcoming the outsiders to his neck of the woods. buechler has quite an attractive cast of actresses, all wearing tight pants and smallish shirts, showing off their sleek and athletic figures, especially elina madison as easy-lay roxann, always willing to remove her clothes for greedy jerk, hayden(rick majeske). stephen wastell(the ghosts of edendale) is axl, a rather clumsy foil, used as a butt of many jokes including his "dump in the woods" scene and current unemployment status.
