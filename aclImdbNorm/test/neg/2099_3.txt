looking back on the year 2006,one of the things i will remember most is the "snakeamania" on the internet for a film called snakes on a plane.but unknown to me there was a straight- to- dvd rip-off film called snakes on a train!after seeing this i feel its at best a below-par b-movie.<br /><br />the plot:<br /><br />a husband and wife get on a train to go to los angles,to get help form the husbands uncle who is a shaman.this is because the wife's family do not approve of her marring him,so they have put a curse on her that snakes will "become her".thought with a sixteen hour drive to los angles and a group of passengers the include an ex-narc cop and some drug traffickers.will they get there in time before the snakes take her over? <br /><br />view on the film: first the effects:i have to say that while some scenes with the smaller snakes look good in a gory-way,the main effect shots you have to wait eighty minutes to see!are sadly that bad that they completely kill any good memories of the film(the film makes 198os video games look like t2 next to this!.)one of the things i noticed is that there is no screenplay credit on the film! and the directors make the film so anti-climatic it ruins the whole film. final view on the film:<br /><br />a below-par b-movie,with an unbelievably bad ending.
