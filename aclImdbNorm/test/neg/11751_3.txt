well, i have to agree with the critics on this one, who all said "leave it alone." why they had to make this re-make of the 1960 "psycho," i don't know. my guess is they wanted to reach a new audience and thought color and modern-day actors were the answer, since those were the main changes. the dialog was the same and the story the same.<br /><br />on one hand, i applaud them for not making this over with a lot of profanity and nudity and making it a sleazy film. yet, if they were going to keep everything the same, why bother when you weren't going to improve on tony perkins, janet leigh and the original cast?<br /><br />did they honestly think vince vaughn was going to be as good or better than perkins? are you kidding? ann heche, with her short mannish-haircut, is going to be better than leigh? i don't think so!<br /><br />yes, the colors were pretty in here but it's the black-and-white photography that helped make the 1960 version so creepy to begin with. it's perfect for the story, not a bunch of greens and pinks! once again, i guess the filmmakers were banking on an audience that never saw the original.<br /><br />this was just a stupid project that never should have gotten off the ground.
