swoon focuses on leopold and loeb's homosexual relationship - a facet of the case that has been mostly (and unjustly) ignored since their trial, even by leopold himself in his autobiography. but, even in its treatment of this swoon over does it by far. worse, it twists, combines, and straight out alters the details of the case which will irritate anyone who knows much about it while at the same time managing to confuse those who are not familiar with it. while it is an interestingly made film, swoon stinks.<br /><br />1 out of 10 - awful.
