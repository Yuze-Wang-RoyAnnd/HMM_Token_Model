this film has absolutely no redeeming features. it's not even worthy of being in the 'so bad it's good' category - it's simply bad. badly acted, badly shot, badly written, badly directed, terrible sound recording and the whole thing is just incredibly amateur. quite how this got a release is beyond me.<br /><br />oh, and could someone please tell the lead actress that if you're playing 'mad' that does not mean that you should constantly fiddle with your hair - in a film that was generally irritating, this was probably one of the most irritating things of all.<br /><br />on the plus side, i think this is the only film ever to feature a nazi carjacker ...
