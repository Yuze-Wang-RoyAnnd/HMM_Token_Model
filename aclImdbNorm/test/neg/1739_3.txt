ok, let me start off by saying this isn't a horrible movie by any means. it's just not good. i recall one poster saying the acting isn't campy it's just nuanced. no. i've seen nuanced japanese and asian acting. i'm sorry, you're wrong. this is camp.<br /><br />the characters are totally unsympathetic, the deaths are totally random and utterly meaningless. the writing is bad. i'm fine with suspending disbelief, i'm fine with not having everything handed to me in terms of plot. but this movie has no plot. one reviewer stated "this movie is set in a small town where people are going nuts over vortexes and spirals." that's not a blurb, that's the entire freaking film. congratulations, i've just saved you nearly an hour and a half. there is nothing more to it. no character development, no plot development, no explanations, no resolution. and not even the "acceptable within the realm of j-horror" lack of resolution. just nothing.<br /><br />in addition, the musical score is done by someone who obviously wasn't actually watching the movie at the time because it's random enough to cause whiplash. cognitive dissonance is one thing and done well it can be brilliant (see dark water), but here it just seems as if the score was designed to go with another movie all together.<br /><br />the best example i can give is it's as if the japanese remade evil dead without any of the clever bits or good acting. it just falls flat. it's j-horror without the horror.
