i'm sorry, but this movie is just way to shallow for me. in it, perez is a taxi dancer with boyfriend keitel trying to make it as an actress. first of all, what the hell is a taxi dancer? even after sitting through this, i still don't know. oh yeah, perez also inspires delorenzo to follow her like a lovesick puppy. there's no reason behind the love, it just kind of happens. there are times when the characters and events really try to pull at your heartstrings, but it rarely works. the only character you really do feel anything for or with is keitel's character, and that's only because he does such a good job with it. any other actor and the character would have been just like the others.<br /><br />the script is basically an uninspired rehashing about how hard it is to make it as an actor/actress. it's been done and said before, the language and dialog sounds like it was written by a street pimp. the ending is...well, i don't want to spoil it. let's just say it feels unsatisfying. i'd be more upset if the story was any good to begin with. the directing is average with nothing truly wonderful, but nothing that is really painful to watch either. to reiterate the acting, the only one that does anything worth watching is keitel. though i could have lived on without seeing him in tiger print bikini underwear.<br /><br />oh yeah, eddie bunker shows up. as random as that mention is, that's how random it is in the film. and tarantino does his director buddy a favor by showing up for about 20 seconds.
