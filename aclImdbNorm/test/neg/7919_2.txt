i think that this is a disappointing sequel. i miss a lot of the old characters (king gator, anne marie, etc.), and i don't like it due to the fact that not even half of the original voices are back to do the characters. a lot of personality was lost in charlie, and the villain red is not even half as bad as carface was in the first one. if you're a big adgth fan like i am, it's worth seeing just to see how the story is continued, but don't count on it being 5 stars in your book.
