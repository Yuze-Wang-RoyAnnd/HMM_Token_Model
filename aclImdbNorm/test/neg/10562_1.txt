i have been an avid jane austen fan for many years. i had never seen this adaptation, so when i had heard of it, i came here and read all the excellent reviews. on that basis i eagerly ordered it from netflix. what a cruel disappointment! they have taken one of the most subtle and bright comic novels and made it dull. each character seems to have been dealt a single facial expression, a single tone upon which to base their flat characters. although this adaptation seems to have used every word that jane austen wrote, they appear to have been passed around to characters in a random fashion. even though it was done as a miniseries, this adaptation manages to confuse and feel as rushed as if it had been done as a movie of the week.<br /><br />mr. bennett too harsh, mrs. bennet just a chattering chipmunk, mr. darcy as lifeless as a nutcracker, the bennett girls almost indistinguishable and mr. wickham a man who no one would look twice at - hardly the appealing cad! i'm quite put out!
