ughh this movie is awful. the script is stupid and of course chase doesn't tell zoey he doesn't love her!!! like every episode...ill never understand zoey 101 (the show) also , why the heck does logan's dad act so retarted. and its only about zoey and chase what about the other characters. its always the same in every episode quinn makes and invention something goes terribly wrong with the invention and zoeys brother always gets involved in it. if you haven't seen it don't waste an hour watching this cuz you'll be wasting your time!!smaybe this may be interesting to an eight year old well 8- 10 but i cnat imagine any1 older watching this retarted film. but what can you expect from nick???
