while i agree that this was the most horrendous movie ever made, i am proud to say i own a copy simply because myself and a bunch of my friends were extras (mostly in the dance club scenes, but a few others as well. this movie had potential with bolo and the director of enter the dragon signed on, but as someone who was on set most every day i can tell you that robert clouse was an old and confused individual, at least during the making of this movie. it was a wonder he could find his way to the set everyday. i would also like to think that this might have been a better movie if a lot of it had not been destroyed in a fire at morning calm studios. i can't say that it would have been for sure, but it would be nice to think so. i was actually surprised that it was ever released, and that someone like bolo would attach his name to it without a fight. oh well. also look at the extras for pro wrestler scott levy, aka raven. he was a wrestler in portland at the time...nice guy, very smart.
