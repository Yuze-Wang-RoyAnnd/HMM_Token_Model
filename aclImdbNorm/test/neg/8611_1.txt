this movie is really bad. the hero can't play. you see too much that he learned his walking moves by heart. and believe me, he walks a lot. for 45 min, nothing happens. he only walks to places and gets out..... like if the story was so short that they had to extend it by adding useless and boring "looks-like-a-suspens" scenes.<br /><br />dialogues are very poor. i counted around a lots of "hello's" and few "hang on" on the 1st part.<br /><br />blood is orange like the mercurochrome you put on kid's blisters. and scenes are not following themselves. a bloody neck on a scene, a clean neck on the following.<br /><br />the story could have been improved. yeah i mean what the hell is the story? <br /><br />martial arts? where? is that martial arts? watch how hesitant and slow are the moves!!!!! if giving a kick and receiving a punch is called martial arts, then i am bruce lee!!!!<br /><br />the only good point i have found is on fight scenes : they don't play with zoom and fast switching scenes that gives you headache in most of action movies.<br /><br />there are plenty of low budget movies that are great. that one was just to make money. nothing else.
