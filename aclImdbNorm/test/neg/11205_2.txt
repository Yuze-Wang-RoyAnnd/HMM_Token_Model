look, this film is terrible... the "plot" involves twins who are neglected by their self-absorbed parents, and left in the care of a succession of nannies and babysitters, all of whom the children drive away by being completely obnoxious. eventually the kids engineer ex-convict beverly d'angelo to be their new nanny, do you care why? and d'angelo watches a tv talk show about selling children and decides she will try to sell the twins... and, well, oh, you don't want to know. it's all very unpleasant, and not at all funny. in fact the announcer slated this film before it came on the tv channel i was watching! just don't bother wasting a single moment of your life on this pile of complete trash, y'hear?
