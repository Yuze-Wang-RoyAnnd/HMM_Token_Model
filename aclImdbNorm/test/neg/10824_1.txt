how unfortunate, yet also fortunate, that two films about pot-holing -the cave and the descent - should arrive at much the same time. sadly for the descent its release in the uk on 7th of july coincided with the very day of the london underground tube/metro terrorist atrocity that killed almost 60 and injured hundreds - not a particularly good night/weekend to pop out to the cinema, especially to see a scary-as-sheesh film about likable women being trapped in a deep, dark, claustrophobic underground caving system. the two movies have virtually the same elements - a half dozen or so characters, lost in a previously unexplored caving system, with no-one outside aware they are trapped down there. lots of water, caverns, danger... then ultimately some vicious human-like or human-derived creatures determined to prey upon them. where the two are so different is that the cave is unreal, entirely unbelievable, more alien-esquire sci-fi fantasy adventure than horror, or drama. the comparatively minuscule-budgeted british film (filmed in southern england though set in the appalachians) is five-pair-of-pants terrifying, a heart-stopping shocker so stomach turning that people walk out of screenings early in shock. it knocks off the girls in any old order - you genuinely have no idea what to expect next - surely not her! the descent is also lit in naturalistic manner, making it all the more scary, unlike the laughably lit cave which resembles a giant magical christmas santa's grotto, with cathedral-sized room after room dazzling in gloriously blue light from... who knows where, while the cavers torches are employed exclusively in artistically lighting up the granite-jawed heroes (each more puppet-like than any team america / gerry anderson / thunderbirds creation). fantastic amounts of equipment are carried too, yet despite this the impossibly deep-voiced actors clearly forgot to pack any sense of impending danger, drama, or anything worthy of a horror film - it's strictly pg rated. and in this instance the actors peg out in exactly the order that everyone expects them to - i quickly wrote a list after being introduced to each character, only getting piper perabo out of sequence. the cave script is entirely by-numbers, unlike shakespeare a room full of chimpanzees would eventually write it in under a week... take a typical exchange between the 'good buddy' white and black leads that goes; "how many times have we been in this situation before bud?" - "too many" (replies morris chesnut). i swear, you could hear my suburban london audience gasp at the obviousness. the scariest thing about the cave is that at the end there's a clear opening for 'the sequel' - 'the cave 2: overground' or whatever. be afraid, be very afraid... or instead catch the descent and be truly afraid, very very very afraid. rr
