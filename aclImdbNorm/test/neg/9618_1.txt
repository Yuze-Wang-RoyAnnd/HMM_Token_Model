the dvd version released by crash cinema was very poorly done. the mastering engineer must have been either drunk, asleep or not even in the room while it was being done. it looks like it was mastered from about a tenth generation copy and about halfway through the film, the audio synchronization disappears. the dialog is about 10 or 15 seconds behind the audio. if you're thinking about purchasing this dvd, please save your money. i remember seeing this film at the theater back in 1973. also, the vhs copy of this film under the title of "when taekwondo strikes" looks better than the dvd, but the remaining several minutes of the movie are "missing". where is the original camera negative?
