this film is a very bad example of uninspired storytelling, which tries to hide behind an "artfilm" facade, trying to shock the audience with unmotivated violence (against women) to cover up for it's lack of psychological depth of the characters & internal conflicts. everything in this movie is pretentious, from the thank you's to bela tarr at the beginning, to the photography, the acting, music, the story & editing. when suddenly, without reason, you are forced to watch close ups of "charismatic" looking hungarian country people in their boats, while the soundtrack is trying to persuade you that this is supposed to be a dramatic moment, although they are only on the way to the funeral of the local alcoholic, thats one thing. putting completely unmotivated rape scenes as a shocker is a different thing, for which i absolutely have no comprehension. this movie is trying really hard to enter a certain genre of artistic (east european drama kind of) films but lacks the subtlety, observational skills and "soul" that other directors have.
