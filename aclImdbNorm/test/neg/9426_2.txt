this is a low grade cold war propaganda film crossed with a soapie. it may have some long-term significance as a snapshot of 1950s us thinking, but there is little else to commend in the mawkish storyline, wooden acting and grating style. there are some interesting photos of long-gone aircraft, but that was not enough for even this aircraft enthusiast to leave it on the screen for the full length.
