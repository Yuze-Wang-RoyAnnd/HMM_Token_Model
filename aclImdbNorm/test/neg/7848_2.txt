this must be one of mgm's and frank sinatras worst films. an oddball musical comedy that fails in almost every aspect. silly plot has sinatra trying to carry on his fathers reputation as a kissing bandit. he's no bandit and doesn't kiss!! he does play the "nerdy" character as well as could be expected given the dialog he has to speak. the scene stealer's are j. carroll nash and mildred natwick. too bad they didn't have more scenes together. i've given the film two stars because the sets and costumes are superior and one of the songs sung by kathtren grayson "love is where you find it", is sensational. could have had a repirse of that one. also, a comic type dance number by ridcardo mantalban, cyd charisse and ann miller if fun. so for those reasons and those reasons only, it is watchable. kissing bandit is part of the frank sinatra early years collection.
