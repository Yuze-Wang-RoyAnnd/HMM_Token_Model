seriously i don't get why people are all like "oh my god step up is the best movie ever!!!" it's a bunch of junk! the acting, first of all, is ridiculous, and let's not even begin to talk about the dialogue because it was terrible...movies are supposed to be entertaining, and this, let me be the first to say, was *not* entertainment. i was actually laughing because i was so embarrassed watching it. the music and dancing didn't do anything for me as well. and what's with the channing tatum "hotness" that all the girls talk about? whatever. the movie was pathetic. don't waste your time - or your money. unless you're a dancing movie freak, but movies like that are *not* movies...they're jokes.
