this is beyond stupid. <br /><br />two high school graduates travel to nantucket for the summer and find situations there that are absolutely revolting.<br /><br />demi moore co-stars in this one. as the film was in 1986, was ashton kutcher just a babe in the woods at that time?<br /><br />moore's grandfather has died and his home is on the verge of being sold to ruthless people with a father and son who bring a new meaning to the term mean.<br /><br />bobcat goldthwait, with that obnoxious voice is in the film, as well as two brothers, who make dumb and dumber look more and more intelligent.<br /><br />the writing is absolutely ridiculous. highlights of the stupidity are where one person says to the other: "did you ever notice that when people die, they go alphabetically in the papers?" <br /><br />i rest my case.
