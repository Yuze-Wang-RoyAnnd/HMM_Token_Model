oh, there are many worse wayne movies. this movie is edited poorly but it has a campy element that makes watching it enjoyable. the villain is an anglo actor who sports ridiculous mexican clothes and affects an over-the-top mexican accent which is hilarious. the girl is dressed like a jean harlow wannabe, this is 1934 after all. at least the location shots are beautiful and enjoyable.<br /><br />watch it and laugh. don't expect a serious western, but rather a lightweight and superficial story with poor acting but occasional flashes of camp humor. wayne is almost ludicrously young and handsome and one can see his acting ability blossomed years after this regrettable venture.
