a cheesy "b" crime thriller of the early '50, the story is droll, the characters wooden, allison hayes and abbe lane are the only two sexpots that make it an eye-catcher, but one short shot, only a few frames long, shows an "el" train crossing the river on the state street bridge, of the 6000 series pullman-built cars painted in their original 1950 paint scheme, as they were delivered when new in 1950. for traction fans like me, that one short take makes the picture worthwhile. i think films like this one, ulmer's detour, d.o.a. with edmund o'brien,the fugitive with harrison ford, and others of the film noir genre, (big city crime dramas) make it interesting if for nothing other than the fact that i know chicago and san francisco intimately and recognize most of the street locations. other wise it's a really droll boring film!
