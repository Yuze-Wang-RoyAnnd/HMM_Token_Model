this is a cheapy biography of a star of the black and white minstrel shows, a certain dixie boy johnson. whether this person ever really existed i don't know, but considering the cast lists a certain "lee lasses white" and roscoe karns playing said character as well, i assume the man did exist and that this is a white-washed (pardon the pun) version of his career. the plot, such as it is, follows dixie boy from career heights to depression at the death of his wife in childbirth, his abandonment of the child to friends, and his return at his daughter's sixteenth birthday and stage debut for reconciliation. another forgotten man, benny fields, plays dixie boy. the man has a lovely baritone voice but no acting talent whatsoever and is a boring lump on screen. gladys george valiantly tries her best to enliven the works to no avail. judy clark does the best impersonation of betty hutton i've ever seen although i believe she thought she was being herself. the scoring replete with many musical numbers for its short running time of 70 minutes earned a deserved oscar nom. worth a look.
