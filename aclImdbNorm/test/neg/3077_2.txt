usually, i start my reviews with an explanation of how and why i watched the film i'm reviewing. with this, i simply cannot explain. i needed to be awake early for work the next day so the last thing i wanted to do was watch a film that i didn't know anything about. but something kept me glued to my comfy futon as i watched this heather graham vehicle. oh, that's right. boredom.<br /><br />graham plays joline, a bohemian nut-case who seems more obsessed with her marriage vows than the guy she married (played by luke wilson). when her hubby decides to set off in search of better things (work, women and scripts, presumably), joline begins a fanatical quest to find her husband and free him from his "spiritual wheelchair". it sounds like i'm making this up but sadly, i'm not. in reality, this is little more than an acting exercise for graham as she gamely gives this phoebe-from-friends role a work-out. oh and goran "er" visnjic is in there as well, for some reason.<br /><br />the tv schedules had this down as a comedy but i failed to find a single laugh anywhere. it struck me that this was a personal journey for lisa krueger (the director and writer), in the same mould as "girl, interrupted" but even that had more laughs than this. graham's character is simply too self-centred for the audience to care about and i felt sorry for the hen-pecked husband as he bravely fought for his freedom from his clearly mental wife. very little of this film made sense as characters simply appeared in the story as though they were standing around, waiting for graham to turn up like the extras in "the truman show". in fact, the only positive note i can produce from my scribblings was "heather graham - nice baps". and that wasn't because i was too tired to enjoy the film.<br /><br />in truth, it's very difficult to think of anybody to recommend this film to. graham purists (a very small number of overall movie-goers, i think you'll agree) will have to be committed to watch this dross and possibly hippy students who collect american indian dream-catchers will take something from this. i was amazed that the average rating (at time of writing) was 5.0 - that would make this film as good as "die another day" and "gothika" in my book and that simply ain't right. "committed" is a quirky oddball mess of a movie that neither entertains or enlightens. it's complicated, pointless and simply too boring for my tastes and probably yours too. don't even think about watching this.
