terrible writing, highly contrived, from a "do-gooder" who knows absolutely nothing about race relations in l.a., or the usa in the present day. the gushing positive reviews are a mystery to me - but could only be provided by folks who think that someone's "good" intentions should be applauded regardless of how shallow, simpleminded and just totally unrealistic the results are. if you want to see a film which deals realistically with modern day l.a. race issues - the movie you need to see (and probably already saw) is pulp fiction. there's more honesty and realism regarding race in any two minutes of that film than there are in the full 4 hours (oh i'm sorry, it just felt like 4 hours) of this stinker. <br /><br />if anyone ever needs proof that the path to hell is paved with good intentions - then this is the movie for you.
