i could tell this would be a bad one from the trailer, but the lure of the dvd box got me to rent it anyway. boy was i right..<br /><br />also for some reason the dvd version is very fuzzy and unclear at times (in terms of video quality). it appears as if they shot the whole movie with a 20 year old camcorder, it looks so bad. i really did not like the plot, and after watching the movie i was very let down. i will not tell any spoilers, but let it be said that the end was so bad that i laughed, it has been done so many times before.<br /><br />the whole story seems like something that came out of a middle schooler's english paper. if i had to peg one movie as the worst horror movie i've ever seen, this one may just be it. i can't believe they actually released this film. it really isn't worth the rent, or a penny of anyone's money unless you want a good laugh at the movie's expense.
