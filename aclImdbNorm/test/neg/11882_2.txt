in terms of historical accuracy, this is the absolute worst roman film i have ever seen. the list not only of errors but of plot ideas that are flat impossible would run longer than the three-hour film, but just to give you an idea...<br /><br />julius caesar and augustus are presented as liberal democrats, taking the side of "the people" against "the nobles." this is patently absurd. the caesars were as noble as you could get. their interest was in consolidating power and stabilizing a country that had been wrecked by 150 years of civil war. there had been reformers, notably the gracchi brothers, who lived about 100 years earlier, and to some extent advocated for the rights of ordinary citizens.<br /><br />there are several scenes that are utterly ridiculous, if you know anything about the period. "cleopatra", with richard burton, will give you a much better idea of how events unfolded, fanciful though it is.<br /><br />historical accuracy is one thing. acting and dialogue are something else, and here this film veers perilously close to being a bad junior high school production. i burst out laughing several times, especially when julia, the daughter of augustus, meets a lover. they clutch passionately, as she breathes: "my father..." "ah, your father, your father.... your father would disapprove." peter o'toole is at his worst, forced to gnaw his way through some very pompous and silly lines. the actor who plays augustus as a young man is such a nebbish --- and the character is written as such --- it's impossible to envision him as the cunning, crafty, machiavellian politician who created the roman empire. here, he's just a whiner who has to be told what to do most of the time.<br /><br />charlotte rampling does manage to emerge from an underwritten role as livia, augustus's wife, with dignity. had she been given a fuller role to play, she might have rescued this production from absurdity.<br /><br />there is some nice photography and battle footage, helped by plenty of standard issue cgi. oddly, this was made for british tv (and appears to be a british-italian co-production) but is labeled with an "r" rating.<br /><br />the dvd picture is excellent and the dolby digital soundtrack is very nice, although you only notice it during the few action sequences, as the movie is mostly talk.<br /><br />almost any roman movie, even "cleopatra" or "the fall of the roman empire", has more historicity --- to say nothing of compelling drama --- than this bizarre classics illustrated, jr. adaptation. this one gives new meaning to the much-abused phrase, "based on a true story." in this case they could have said, "suggested by real events."
