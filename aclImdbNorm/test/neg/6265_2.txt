stop me if you hard this one before, some cheerleaders, their coach and a couple guys are trapped within a cabin in the woods when an unseen killer kills them off one by one. shame on me, after i totally wrote off jim wynorski after the horrid "busty cops" (it was a long time coming as his last truly good film was 1990's "hard to die"), i still for some reason got my hopes up for a supposed sequel to "slumber party massacre". sadly even my mediocre expectations were not met. this outing is not nearly as fun as even the three previous films in the franchise (and yes i'm including spm 2, that should tell you something) furthermore how can you have a slasher film with this little gore??? i mean come on now!! <br /><br />my grade: d <br /><br />eye candy: ricky ray gets topless; april flowers and charity rahmer show boobs and buns in a shower scene (april gets nude again later in the film), and tamie sheffield gets topless and bares buns
