the main problem with 9th company (9 rota) is that it is not sure whether it wants to be saving private ryan or full metal jacket. the attempts at spielberg sentimentalism are embarrassing, such as the burley sergeant crying in a field of red flowers!!! the training sequences have none of intensity or realism that kubrick gave them in his masterpiece.<br /><br />a further bone of contention is that the afghan fighters are called ghosts because they strike and are hardly ever seen. here they attack a russian strong hold almost in formation with no attempt to use cover. i am sure tactics have move on since waterloo.<br /><br />every scene in this film has been seen before in other war movies and done considerably better. <br /><br />i have to ask: why do all talented marksmen need to chew on a match?<br /><br />finally, i am always suspicious of a film that starts with no narration yet needs to qualify the end.<br /><br />"we won!" ...errrr....... no you didn't.
