let me say first off i didn't go in expecting much, and watching it at prime-time on opening night should have helped. i believe it would have, had there been more than 20 people in the theater. <br /><br />it sucked so hard. the acting was robotic at best and nothing was really explained until the last 30 minutes of the movie. i guess that was their way of twisting the plot; keep everyone in the dark on crucial info to understand the movies direction until the end and then explain things and hope it feels like a twist of plot.<br /><br />unknowns until the end of the movie: -what the eff is a dark-ling? the cg was cool but i want to understand! -why cant powers be willed? especially if mass murder is the ultimatum. -why is willing away powers so bad? your just normal after, right? -who farted?<br /><br />roughly 50% of the minutes with just men on screen, were shots of them in wife beaters, sleeveless t's and then a gut wrenching pool scene of all teenage men in the skimpiest low riding speedos knowing to ever have been manufactured. i swear you could see the start of the one guys.... well, it was close to soft-core. and of course there was a shower scene, and to mix it up it was of the dudes. butt cracks were abundant, a sausage fest in progress. but there was a single girl shower scene in which nothing was seen and she ambles around the best looking dorm bathroom for around 12 minutes. then there was a girl talk pj party. the other thing i couldn't get over was the amount of driving that caleb did in his super cool ford mustang gt. it was a ford commercial for around 1/4th of the movie.<br /><br />don't see it. or go see it with a friend who likes to make fun of bad movies. then it could be worth it. but don't expect anything breathtaking.
