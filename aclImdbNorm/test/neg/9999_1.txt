when all we have anymore is pretty much reality tv shows with people making fools of themselves for whatever reason be it too fat or can't sing or cook worth a damn than i know hollywood has run out of original ideas. i can not recall a time when anything original or intelligent came out on tv in the last 15 years. what is our obsession with watching bums make fools of themselves? i would have thought these types of programs would have run full circle but every year they come up with something new that is more strange then the one before. ok so people in this one need to lose weight...most americans need to lose weight. i just think we all to some degree enjoy watching people humiliated. maybe it makes us feel better when we see someone else looking like a jerk. i don't know but i just wish something intelligent would come out that did not insult your intelligence.
