i saw "caddyshack ii" when i was ten and i mostly laughed because of the horse scene. i should have realized that the movie was as empty as...i can't come up with a good comparison. it's stupid and not even really funny. the cast members from the original who chose not to star in this made probably the best choices that they ever made in rejecting this; why, oh why, did chevy chase return?! and how on earth did jackie mason, robert stack, dyan cannon and dan aykroyd get involved in this swill?! i bet that every person who had his/her name even remotely attached to this junk (e.g., the caterer) is ashamed beyond redemption. so, all in all, it's beyond dreadful, terrible, and everything such. avoid it like you would the ebola virus.
