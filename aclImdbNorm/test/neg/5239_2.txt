i like christophe lambert as an actor. he has played in several good movies (highlander, subway, greystoke, ...). but i can't even think he has played in that movie. the story is nearly nothing, the special effects are very bad and the actors also. to resume the movie, i have only one thing to say : it's the first time that i go to watch a movie and want to leave after 10 minutes.
