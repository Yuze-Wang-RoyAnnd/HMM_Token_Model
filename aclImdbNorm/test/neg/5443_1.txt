as an avid cinema go-er i felt that whilst i was ranking my favourite movies i felt it only fair to rank my most hated films.<br /><br />i'm afraid i really have nothing positive to say about this movie. it is in fact one of only two films that i have ever walked out on. in fairness i went back and watched the movie again to give it another chance and sat through it only to wish that i should have stayed away.<br /><br />the sad thing is the movie has a really decent cast and crew...but then even the brightest stars in hollywood cant bring a dead duck of a script to life.<br /><br />stay away...save yourself from this truly woeful 'film' 1/10
