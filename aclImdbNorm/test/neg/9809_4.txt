pretty twisted horror film, that has a few good moments here and there, with some creepy blood transfusion scenes, however it's just too dull for it's own good. all the characters are ok, and the story while had a lot of potential is rather dull, however the blood transfusion scenes looked frighteningly real, and as a result they were extremely disturbing. it's well made and decently written, and it started out really interesting, but it just couldn't keep up the pace, plus i found the ending to be disappointing. linnea quigley has no more then a very small role in this so, i was also disappointed about that, and stephen knight does a good job as the lead, as he was pretty twisted, plus i got this in a dvd horror set called a taste of evil, along with a bunch of other horror films. there is lots of blood,however it's not all that gory, and for it's low budget it was pretty well done, however as i said it just couldn't sustain it's interest. this is a pretty twisted horror film, that has a few good moments here and there, with some creepy blood transfusion scenes, however it's just too dull for it's own good, i would pass,but i guess it's worth a watch if you have nothing better to do. the direction is ok. elly kenner&norman thaddeus vane do an ok job here with decent camera work, and doing a good job on it's low budget, however the pace is too inconsistent for my liking. the acting is actually alright. stephen knight is great as the lead, he was creepy, twisted, sick, and gave a very creepy performance, the most creepy thing about it though was he seemed like a normal person. linnea quigley did well in her small role. christopher mcdonald is ok i guess sin his short time. rest of the cast are ok as well. overall i would pass, but i guess it's worth a watch if you have nothing absolutely better to do. *1/2 out of 5
