ok, so this film is well acted. it has good direction but the simple fact is that it undermines what all gay and lesbian people have been fighting for all these years. the straight man "deciding to be gay" and the gay man "deciding to be straight" i did enjoy it up until the last 20 minutes, after that i got really offended. as what usually happens in these films the straight actors play the main parts and the out gay actors play the secondary straight roles. the leads are played by handsome men but don't let that distract you from the fact that this is a a film that leaves you feeling unfulfilled. all the romance and relationships you hope would happen do not. unless you are a priest that is in which case god bless straight woman who cure our homos.
