this movie could have been a lot better than it was, if hadn't been a disney film. i thought that the young girl playing shirley was all right, you could tell that she was really trying to do the job right. the teenage shirley temple wasn't right at all. i think that they should have spent last time on her childhood, the first hour should have been about the young shirley, then the last hour should have been about the older shirley. this was a boring movie, and not a good shirley temple story.
