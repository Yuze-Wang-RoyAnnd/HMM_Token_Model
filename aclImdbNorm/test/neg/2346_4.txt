if you can get past the slow start and bad acting it's worth watching. the story line was pretty decent. the father had a wicked temper because he was unemployed and he hardly got to see his kid except in the summer because his ex-wife had custody of him. the father was very angry and frustrated the majority of the time. the monster in the story wasn't too scary. the movie breaks consistency of the monster being so incredibly strong. the one scene that the moviemakers do this in is one of the times when the kid is down in the cellar and the monster goes to attack him. when the monster goes to attack the kid his arm gets caught in a steel trap attached to a chain. the monster is about a foot away from the kid's face. every other time throughout the movie the monster is strong enough to break through or tear down anything. yet the steel trap and chain holds him back from getting the kid! more than likely the moviemakers did this for shock factor because no one wants to see one of the main characters die. moviemakers just wanted to scare us into thinking it may be a possibility that the kid could die. instead of breaking consistency, the moviemakers should have replaced the kid with someone who they could dispose of!
