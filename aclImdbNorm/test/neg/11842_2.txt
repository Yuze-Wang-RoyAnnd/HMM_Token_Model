we all know that the world is full of dodgy, rip-off horror films. some of these can be fun to watch, due to their stupidity, awful effects and iffy dialogue. but raptor, which could have been in the same league as the equally pointless carnosaur series, does not even attempt to have any enjoyment in it. its so poorly done, it is really unbearable, even if your just watching it with the intentions of having a no-brain day at home. where do we start? well... the sets are pretty drab. my old drama group created more realistic stages. the genetics labs look like they are from a university, and it looks equally unbelievable on the outside (even for cover-up, why would you place yourself near civilisation where people can easily hear the dinosaur roars), whilst the doctors ward just doesn't look believable at all. next up in the complaints list is the creature effects; well, what can i say? absolutely pitiful. also, i think it's worth mentioning, the woman's tits should be mentioned as an effect. both of the main female characters have so obviously had boob-jobs, and it brings the characters down, being one female is a respected member of police, whilst the other is the sweet, "innocent" daughter of the towns sheriff. the acting, though, is by far the worst tragedy. eric roberts can be excused for at least trying a bit to give his role something. thats where it ends. corbin benson should have killed his costume designer for making his lacklustre performance look even more pathetic, whilst the female lead looks so bored (though, with this film you could let her off). the other character i'll point out is the daughter, who lets her tits do all the acting in the "raunchy" sex scene (ten minutes of endless re-run shots of her bouncing on top of some bloke).<br /><br />all in all, and summed up as one. don't bother, just don't.
