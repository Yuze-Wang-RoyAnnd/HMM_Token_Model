if you like to get a couple of fleeting glimpses of cleavage on some attractive women, there may be a second or two of enjoyment from this film. if you enjoy seeing poorly conceived and executed "action" scenes, there are plenty. if you are both blind and deaf, i still advise you to not have this film on in your presence. it is surely the worst or very close to the worst film i have ever seen. and it does appear that there was some money spent on it. talk about throwing money away! as an editor, i would hope that the "editor(s?)" of this "movie" never again be allowed to edit a film, book, or even a post-it note. as a writer, i would hope that the author(s?) never again be allowed near even a broken crayon. you would think that i am not recommending that you view this movie. not so. tape it (so you may stop your pain when you need to) and educate yourself as to how bad a movie can be.
