somehow, i really thought that i was going to enjoy this film because i love pictures with mountain climbing and a great mystery in the plot. i must say that the photography was fantastic and there was some scary scenes that captured my attention. i thought that nicole eggert,(diana pennington),"thank you, good night",'01 played a very convincing role as a young girl who had a tragic loss in her life and meets up with some characters who want her to guide them up the mountain. marc singer, "angel blade",'02, played a very unconvincing weird guy and over acted in many scenes with a bad temper that looked comical. this film was a big disappointed and not worth watching, unless there is nothing on the tv to enjoy!!
