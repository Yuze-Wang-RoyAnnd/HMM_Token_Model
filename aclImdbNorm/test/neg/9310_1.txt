i cannot stress how bad this movie is. this director took every cheap little unintelligent shot at making these people look so "distressed". why are their clothes so dirty? why on earth would you get the new clark kent to play a crack head? you should be banned from motion pictures for the rest of your life buddy giovinazzo.<br /><br />i take serious offense to this fool wanting to cast real actors as thugs and lowlifes as some kind of clever joke. why would you ask clark kent to play a crackhead? why are they yelling so much? why is everyone so mean? why are those kids so filthy? no one would want to be so filthy? not even a crackhead child.<br /><br />you need to grow up and not make any movies ever again.
