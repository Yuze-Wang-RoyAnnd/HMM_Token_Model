this movie was pointless. i can't even call it sci-fi, since that requires more from a movie than merely taking place in space. "max q" isn't even set in space for the entire movie. the story/plot is unoriginal, the cast isn't anything to write home about, although it would be strange with a top cast in a mediocre film... furthermore, it's not particularly exciting or well-told. at least it's evenly balanced in a low quality sort of way, in that nothing or no one stands out. everything is equally bland. i usually find some quality in "space flicks", even if it's just 90 minutes of semi-lame entertainment bordering on low-budget pathetic, but "max q" didn't even give me that satisfaction. all in all , a complete waste of time.
