carlos mencia just plain isn't funny! his show is painful to watch because of that. his sketches/parodies are all very horrible, and this really just feels like a filler for the chapelle show, which while i'm not a big fan of that, it is much funnier than this trash. carlos mencia gives the stupid speeches and he all too often depends on finishing his monologues with a retarded voice and going "der, der der." it's just not funny. he often, when talking to others, makes puns. they are horrible and painful. when people don't laugh, he blames them...why would anyone laugh, he's not funny. he has an immature sense of humor in everything he does on this show, it's amazing that anyone but 3 year olds watch this. one of my least favorite things he does, is water down every topic and make it seem like a joke! i hope that this racist idiot gets taken off the air as soon as possible because he's dumbing down a station that doesn't need to be dumbed down anymore.
