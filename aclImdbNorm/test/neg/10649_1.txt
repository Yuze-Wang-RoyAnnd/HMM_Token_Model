the joe cool review - hellraiser: bloodline<br /><br />starring: bruce ramsay as phillip l'merchant/john merchant/dr. paul merchant, valentina vargas as angelique and doug bradley as pinhead<br /><br />plot: this follows a timeline of the lineage of the merchant bloodline, which started with phillip l'merchant, who created the box that opens the doorway to hell. starting with the 18th century to present time when pinhead first meets merchant and tries to sever the bloodline..(he's the only one who can stop pinhead, you see) and finally in the future, in space, where paul merchant has finally figured out how to send pinhead to hell for good.<br /><br />openers: this is a movie hated so much by the people who made it, they declared fictional director alan smithee would be the credited director. they only pull smithee out of the woodwork when they really think they've made a terrible movie, such as classics as the birds ii: land's end or bloodsucking pharaohs in pittsburgh. no i didn't make that up. how did i like it? you're reading this so i'm sure that's what you want to know.<br /><br />the good: this movie isn't as bad as you've been led to believe. oh i'm not going to sugar-coat it. this movie was filled with so much potential and ended up being a disaster, but it does have some positives. cooler cenobites this time around for starters, such as the twins and the demon angelique. pinhead is still in a main role, and still has good lines("pain has a face, allow me to show it to you") and it's somewhat entertaining throughout. gorehounds will love the movie because of it's endless supply. there is also some continuity with the rest of the series, although you'll have to look hard to see it. the chatterer dog is awesome.<br /><br />the bad: but for a story about hell vs the cursed merchant bloodline that could close the gateway forever, it was really complicated and held together with duct tape. nothing was really explored to it's full potential and there were some really stupid things included. pinhead kidnaps a kid and holds him for ransom! random deaths just to feature more blood(not always a bad thing, but not for the sake of the story). pinhead is at his worst here, he rants and rants and rants even when he's about to die! for the very smart demon that he used to be, he's been reduced to nothing more than a bond villain, at best. if hellraiser fans ever needed a reason why he was moved back into a cameo like role, this is it. bloodline ruined it for us all.<br /><br />the ugly: gore is always mentioned here. this one has skin ripping, drilling, hook impaling, beheadings, and more goodies. the chatterer dog, while awesome, reeks of bad special effects during the chase scenes.<br /><br />final verdict: this movie had the potential for something great, even hellbound levels of greatness. but all of that was wasted. who knows exactly what went down to produce this crap, but we can only blame alan smithee.<br /><br />compared to the rest: this movie is the worst of the hellraiser series. for completists only.<br /><br />rating: 1/2* of *****
