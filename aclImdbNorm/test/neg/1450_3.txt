pluses: mary boland is delightfully on edge as always (i never tire of her upper-crust zaniness, especially in "the women" and "pride and prejudice"). w.c. fields's brief role is fun, though the famous pool table scene stretches its welcome a bit because it seems to go on for ten minutes. the madcap antics of the film, typical of the period, are great. also, a nod to alison skipworth's wonderfully grounded hotel mistress; i would love to see more of her (she reminds me of marie dressler, another personality worthy of high praise). <br /><br />minuses: gracie allen. an irritating, unfunny presence whose annoyance went unmatched until the rise of adam sandler. that near-falsetto nasalness tinged with an accent of unknown origin gets old in her very first scene. this is the first of the burns-allen films i have seen and while i (as a big classic comedy buff) try to experience at least one film with every major comedy star, this is definitely one team i will not be calling upon again. her timing and interpretation of the material is totally off. a maddeningly mediocre talent.<br /><br />the bottom line: an ok comedy, but the gags are few and far between. and at only an hour long, you can expect that this is not an a grade hollywood comedy. recommended only for boland and fields fans who want to see all of their work.
