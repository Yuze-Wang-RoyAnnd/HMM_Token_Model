ill-conceived sequel(..the absurd idea of having the killer snowman on the rampage at an island resort where there is no snow or cold weather)brings back the spirit of the psychopath, returning thanks to a scientific experiment providing foreign elements which reintroduce life to his molecules(..it's the best i could do to explain this preposterous concept).<br /><br />i could go into depth about how he winds up at the island in order to slay numerous tourists, but i simply find no reason to bother because it'd all be so exhausting. anyway, the filmmakers think it wise to kill off the pretty girls not ten minutes after their arrival(..i mean seriously, why worry with even introducing them to us if we can't enjoy our eye candy no longer that this?!).<br /><br />the "snow anvil" murder scene takes the cake. ice icicles protrude from the beach's sand so that a victim can fall on them. oh, and another girl is stabbed with a pair of weenie tongs.<br /><br />look i get what's coming to me when i sit down to watch a killer snowman movie..such a ridiculous supernatural slasher will either tickle your funnybone("oh, it's such a wonderfully cheesy horror movie!")or have you pondering why the hell you're wasting time with such nonsense. jack frost has the power to freeze water(..then how were they able to melt him in the first film?)and causes the island resort to snow. one sequence has jack freezing pool water, encasing a swimming model under the sheet, result being her drowning with nowhere to escape.oh, there's also a recreation of the "tongue stuck to the icy pole" bit from the christmas story("cowatonga dude!").<br /><br />i gotta hand it to the cast, though..they're real troopers for trying to make this wretched material entertaining. christopher allport(..perhaps unwisely)returns as sam, to face his old nemesis, as does eileen seeley, as his wife. the attempts at tongue-in-cheek humor(..for me, at least) fell flat, but the cast soldiers onward trying to make the most of a very difficult situation, with spirited performances they do their best to rise above the pitiful premise and woeful dialogue.<br /><br />a development occurs which increases the danger towards those still around to face off with jack, his genetically altered water molecules, thanks to the introduced foreign elements, allow him to withstand coolant/anti-freeze, and, even worse, he now can reproduce..through indigestion, jack hacks up what appear to be snowballs which hatch to reveal little snowballs with black eyes, mouth and sharp teeth! the killer snowman costume and little snowball puppets introduced later in the film might produce belly-laughs if you are in the mood for such shenanigans, but i personally found this junk rather hokey(..that's the purpose behind it, i suppose, cheap guffaws from those willing to embrace this)and unbearable.the snowball offspring is an obvious homage to gremlins where we get a bar scene where the little bastards are celebrating in number over terrorizing victims at the resort. the weapon against them..bananas! it's explained that when jack went to kill sam in the first film, both fell in a truck bed full of anti-freeze(..an icicle emerging from jack's belly was penetrating sam's chest when he pushed them out a window into the truck bed, and i guess in their being "being linked" by the icicle, jack inherited sam's banana allergy, or so this is what we are led to believe!)and in doing so both "merged" in a sense.<br /><br />phew, such a film as this defies simple explanation. it's a film with effects and plot so terrible, one might find the presentation enjoyable because of it's many failings.
