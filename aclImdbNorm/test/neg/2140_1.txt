italians movie-makers love to rip off american movies. all of our movies, and as often as possible. <br /><br />i'm not stating that as a slur against italy as a whole, but i would like to further observe that the italian film industry does itself great harm by allowing travesties like this to go overseas to be seen by the world at large. that's all i'm saying.<br /><br />and no more grave injury do the italian people subject themselves to than by not sticking a harsh penalty upon those who made the world watch "shark rosso nell'oceano" - which is, admittedly, a ripoff of the far-superior "jaws" (as if you didn't know).<br /><br />let's dive into the plot (get it? haw-haw...): this huge monstrous swimming thing that looks like a cross between an octopus, a shark and steven tyler attacks many innocent americans (ie: italians) off the coast of florida (ie: italy) and the intrepid, beer-swilling peter (sopkiw) sails out with his anorexic, beer-swilling girlfriend and other beer-swilling people whose main purposes are to be eaten by the creature, killed by mysterious forces who want the creature left alone or just stand around and be otherwise useless (and swill beer)...or be the doctor in this film who defibrilates dying patients repeatedly (20, maybe 30 times in a row) without waiting for his paddles to recharge (must be one heck of a good battery there, doc).<br /><br />then there's the monster...brother, if you thought the "jaws" shark was fake, look herein and have your mind changed immediately.<br /><br />this is a movie that was directed as an afterthought (by a bava!), edited with an onion chopper, acted by ambulatory (beer-swilling) pieces of driftwood and written by (presumably beer-swilling) people who should never ever ever ever be let near a typewriter, movie studio or major city in the world ever again. if this is how the people who made this film think real people act in such a situation, they've obviously made one too many of them zombie movies. or swilled too much beer.<br /><br />need i say this movie is bad? it is: bad like green cottage cheese; bad like a hawaiian shirt at a formal wedding; bad like the "bad theatre" skits dan aykroyd used to host on "saturday night live"; bad like calista flockhart weight gain tablets - get it? good.<br /><br />mike and the sol gang slap this beer-drunk beauty upside the head repeatedly and reveal this "horror" film as what it is: horrible. though, with a certain european charm: it's charming, when watched by a european - preferably a beer-swilling one.<br /><br />no stars for the waterlogged, dead fish known as "shark rosso nell'oceano"; six stars for the mst3k version. ...and now, anyone for a beer?<br /><br />
