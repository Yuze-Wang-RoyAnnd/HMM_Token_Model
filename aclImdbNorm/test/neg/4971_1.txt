back in 1993 sega released a dull, lackluster video game of one of the biggest films of all time. quickly realizing their mistake they hashed out a different version of the game, claiming it would be bigger, tougher and better.<br /><br />neither were. both were slow, boring games.<br /><br />you can choose to be either dr. alan grant or...a raptor. both have their problems. why would dr. grant go around killing all those army guys (just what are they doing in the game)? and why a raptor be killing other raptors? weird.<br /><br />obviously not learning from their first mistake sega really dropped the ball on the original release and the so-called rampage edition. one of the slowest, sluggish and dullest platformers i have ever played.
