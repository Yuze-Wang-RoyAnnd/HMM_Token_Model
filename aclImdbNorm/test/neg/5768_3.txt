the storyline is a ticked off claim jumper made a deal with the devil to find gold, and is forced to protect it forever. a bunch of friends find the gold and gets talked by the old miner and they're forced to blow the gold to smithereens in order to send him back to hell.<br /><br />i mean seriously...how did this film not win the oscar for movie of the year? what a compelling storyline of late 20 year olds running from a claim jumper straight out of the 1800's. i love how in other movies you can't kill the monster but they can knock it out...this movie they write the monster as completely indestructible.<br /><br />the opening of the movie clearly rips off nightmare on elm street part 4 but what the hell, not like that movie was a 5 star classic either.<br /><br />highlight of the movie is when we're introduced to a girl who's never been to school, never been out of the town, never learned to read or write....yet speaks perfect english, is smoking hot and wears the latest fashion. how did the oscar's miss that? <br /><br />ok i'm done with the bad jokes, this movie is pure crap and only watch it if u have nothing better to do and all the spices on the spice rack are in alphabetical order already.<br /><br />2 out of 10
