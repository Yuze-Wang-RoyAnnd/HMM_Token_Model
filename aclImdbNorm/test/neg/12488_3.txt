what on earth happened to rgv? there are so many things wrong about this movie that one needs to stop and decide where to start- first and worst - the music. every scene was accompanied with this pretentious background music that was telling you the mood, quite pathetically, i might add. secondly, the lighting - do we really need such dark scenes where we are wondering if the projector is still working? and finally - if you are going to indianise the godfather and godfather 2 - please realize that a lot of us have seen in. nayakan was a ripoff of gf1 but better done, and more entertaining. i have seen a similarity in both company and sarkar and while rgv's ab tak 56 was brilliant, these two movies leave something to be desired. people will not be impressed any more by just corrupt politicians and the lot. maybe rgv should see maqbool, which is good enough to be rgv!!
