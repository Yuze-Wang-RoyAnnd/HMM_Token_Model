although this was the first hunter s. thompson documentary i have seen it was average at best despite the involvement's of huge star appearances such as johnny depp, bill murray, gary busey, and a few others. i was let down by this and yet it was still a little interesting. what kept me watching was some of the old clips from fear and loathing in las vegas and where the buffalo roam. not that good mostly because of the old guys rambling and things any fan would already know. i still think they were milking it because it could have been compressed down by at least half. still if your a fan i would you'll like anything that has to do with hunter. best regards
