when i heard they were making this i was quited happy considering the first film was pretty good, if a little on the short side.<br /><br />but then i remembered some of the disney sequel disasters i have previously watched (im looking at you little mermaid 2).<br /><br />anyway i watched it and unfortunately i was very disappointed. the best thing about it is the animation is superb. it really has that special polish that the "proper" disney films have.<br /><br />apart from that.. the rest is disappointing. the storyline is seriously all over the place. one moment its about something, then completely changes to another storyline and then changes to another completely different storyline. it reminded me of how the family guy movie was like 3 separate episodes, turned into a film.<br /><br />i laughed perhaps once at the most. kronk was very funny in the original film but in this he just isn't funny at all.<br /><br />stay away from this film, unless someone lends it to you for free.<br /><br />4/10
