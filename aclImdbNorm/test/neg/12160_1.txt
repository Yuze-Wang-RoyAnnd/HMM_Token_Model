have seen this movie today. very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist. the most sad things are:<br /><br />1. it's very slow. <br /><br />2. how ghengis-khan, cruel and mighty emperor of asia can be played by a kind, good actor with warm and lovely eyes - during all the movie except one scene? <br /><br />3. lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age. we see an ex-slave without money, power, friends or home. click! - the very next second he's leading the huge army, without any reasons to be a leader. <br /><br />4. the magic of ghengis-khan arise is kindly explained only by the help of one wolf/god/whoever it was. <br /><br />5. can a man make love to his wife that way after not seeing her for years? <br /><br />6. is it enough to win the sword fight if you just riding your horse through the enemy lines, sitting there with two swords and everybody around you dies? does ridley scott know that way? <br /><br />7. why after 20-30 years khan's mother doesn't look older? <br /><br />8. what is the motivation for the main character? (none. literally.)<br /><br />don't waste your time. really. cinematographers's work is good; the nature is outstanding - but the movie cannot be made without director and script. the real ghengis-khan would execute director in a second.<br /><br />kind regards.
