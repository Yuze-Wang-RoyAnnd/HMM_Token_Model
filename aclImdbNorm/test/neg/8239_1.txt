as i sat watching this episode i kept glancing at the clock waiting for something to happen. as the hour wound down i thought they were really going to give us a big pop at the end, and then - nothing. the whole family is huddled around the christmas tree like something from the hallmark channel then, fade to black.<br /><br />perhaps one of the poorest season finales i've ever seen. nothing at all to drum up any excitement for next season. the only thing thrown out as any sort of incentive to watch the next season was the ambiguous nugget offered up by agent harris while pawing a sub sandwich that the guys in new york were looking to get one of the guys in new jersey. wow, really? i would never expect something like that from mobsters, i'm on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />it almost seems like they're trying to get everyone to lose interest. they start more plot lines that end up just disappearing than any show i've ever seen. they tease and hint but rarely deliver any more.<br /><br />what's with the arabs that hang out at the bing? they keep throwing them in front of us and magically, nothing happens.<br /><br />paulie knee caps some kid after tony promised his mother that nothing would happen to her son and, poof, gone in the wind.<br /><br />and how many more meandering drug montages with christopher are we going to have to endure? please, have him get arrested or overdose or something interesting.<br /><br />this was one of the few shows that i used to looked forward to watching but now, forgetta-bout it.
