starting where the last avp left off, an alien "chestburster" emerges from a dead predator on a predator spaceship, and causes the predator space ship to crash into modern day gunnison colorado, where it breeds several more aliens which start to cause havoc. the predator race sends down a lone highly experienced and armed predator to "clean up the mess". our human characters are caught in the middle of the intergalactic battle.<br /><br />the biggest problem with this movie is the pacing. this movie moves along way too fast. the opening credits have only just rolled and already the predator ship crashes into the earth after the alien grows to full hight, a hunter and son character are introduced but before we even get to learn their names they are both killed, then we see the predator home-world and the lead predator flies off to fight the alien infestation, and all this happens within the first five minutes. this unnatural pace does not let up for the entire movie; the national guard comes into town but within two minutes are all killed without even getting a good look at a single ones face, the manager of a pizza store gets one scene of character development only to be killed off the very next time we see him once again without even learning his name, random hobos, a coffee shop waitress and chef are killed again without learning their names. one moment our main characters are at home, the next running around town, the next in a gun store , the next in an apc, and this random set jumping over and over just doesn't ever let up leaving the audience no time to settle in leaving them grasping for straws.<br /><br />another problem is the settings and time frame. the movie is set in modern day gunnison colorado. every other alien and predator movie was shot in enthralling settings, such as industrial space ships, guerrilla war zone rainforest's, alien planets, and underground labyrinths. now comes along avp-r, set in a small modern day american town, with set "highlights" including a sporting goods store, parking lots, pizza shops, and little girl's bedrooms. i mean, were they actually trying to make the movie look as dull, drab and uninteresting as possible?! it's hard to perceive these monsters as frightening creatures when they are standing next to a shelf full of reeboks, or hiding in the bushes outside little girls bedrooms.<br /><br />continuity is a big issue with this film. the alien series was set in the future, no human had even heard of an alien before the first film, and the aliens not only had never been to earth, but if they ever did reach earth, humanity would be destroyed. this movie ruins that entire concept by being set in modern day, with average joes seeing the aliens all over the place, and by the end of the movie, humanity is not destroyed, not even suffering what could be considered minor losses. it pisses all over that entire concept of the other movies. attempts to maintain continuity are made with massive deus ex machina's. the predator just happens to carry around a bottle of unlimited magic blue liquid that's just to melt away any bodies with just a single drop, the army at the end of the movie just happens to go to overly drastic measures and drop a nuclear warhead that just conveniently erases all evidence of the aliens existence despite the fact there were many survivors of the incident who are witnesses, and many more bad attempts are made at filling up impossible to cover plot holes.<br /><br />also, for a "verses" movie, it has unrelenting bias in favor of the predators. for the majority of the film, a lone predator manages to kill dozens if not tens of dozens of aliens, all at m^el'ee range while barely gaining a single scratch, while the aliens just get slaughtered left right and center like clay pigeons, merely waiting their turn to be killed by the predator without putting forth any effort to defend their selves. this movie should not be called "alien vs. predator", as much as it should be "predator massacres aliens". i mean, how can you have two species battle it out with suspense and tension, when one is portrayed as being vastly superior to the other? <br /><br />the characters in this film are amongst the biggest flaws. not only do they pale in comparison to the characters from the previous alien and predator movies, but even as a stand alone movie they are bland, dreary, and even at times cringe worthy. the characters in this movie consist of i kid you not, horny couples wanting to get laid, pizza delivery boys, blonde bimbos, high school bullies, children, and a blatant copy and paste job ripping off ripley and newt; the worst and most clich'e possible ideas for characters. not only that, but all of the aforementioned characters are acted by teenagers. while the casting of teenagers is an obvious attempt to pull in younger audiences, its only effect is to make the movie look and feel like a typical teenybopper slasher-porn movie, with actors who are too young to have learned how to give a convincing performance, with them mostly having completely blank facial expressions delivering monotone dialog. not only this, but these characters do some of the most cinematically retarded things ever, such as using predator guns, commenting the powers out when it has been for hours, following dumb plans to get out of town rather than just walking out of town somewhat quickly, and just so many other idiocies that the movie actually had the audience in my theater sighing out of frustration.<br /><br />in the end this movie is just a horrible b movie, something deserving of the direct to dvd category. the fact this movie was a theatrical release astonishes me, as every part of the movie just ranks of amateur work.
