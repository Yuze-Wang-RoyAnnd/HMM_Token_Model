all through his career hitchcock did great films; this was not one of them.<br /><br />a man knows too much, his daughter is kidnapped to secure his silence, and in the denouement all is resolved to the accompaniment of gunfire and rooftop drama.<br /><br />anyone who has seen 1930s fritz lang films- 'm' comes to mind- will know how far this urban narrative of crime and conscience falls short of what had already been done in that genre at that time. there is an altogether amateurish air about much of the staging and acting which subverts any sense of menace, darkness, and depravity that hitchcock might have been seeking to instil.<br /><br />what it is worth watching out for, however, is the sequence associated with the shooting at the albert hall. once that kicks off it is as if the film has been given a blood transfusion. the camerawork is lively, the cuts are interesting, and the way that everything combines to a climax is masterly. here you can see the future master: hitchcock effortlessly orchestrate all the resources to impressive and memorable effect: when the scream comes you really feel as well as hear it.
