it is amazing what you can see if you wake at 2 am and turn on the telly. i didn't know they showed films like this. i immediately thought of roger corman, who reused locations for movies or used other films locations for his own movies.<br /><br />the makes of this film could just move the camera angles and add some time and they would have an xxx film.<br /><br />there was no story, just minimum dialog that led to stripping and sex. i bet there wasn't 100 words in the whole film, but there sure was a lot of very large busts and hot lesbian action. there was male/female action too, but it was only about 25% of the movie.<br /><br />another interesting thing came to mind in watching this film that may interest those who are buying hi def dvds. sony refused to license betamax to adult film makers and adult films came out on vhs. you can guess what happened to beta max as the adult film industry makes millions of videos. sony has again refused to license blu-ray to the adult film industry and they have just signed a deal with toshiba. you can guess which high def system will disappear.
