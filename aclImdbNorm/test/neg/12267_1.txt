everything about this movie is awful.<br /><br />you can tell in the first five minutes that this movie is going to be terrible. you can't however, gauge how bad it's going to be.<br /><br />we start the movie with a seemingly endless intro scene aided with gay music and no dialogue. having the camera move up and down big guys who are trying too hard to look like mentals doesn't provoke the slightest emotion.<br /><br />what then starts seems to be one of two separate stories. the first half of the movie consists of the wogs going around competing in paid, midnight fights with other ethnic groups. the wogs always win of course, because they apparently lift weights and have "respect". it is in these scenes that we first get to see the degree of bad acting, editing, scripting and hatred for the people who funded this film.<br /><br />eventually the main character and his mate get sent to prison. the entire prison part of the movie is unrelated to what i assume is the plot, and consists of a bunch of fights.<br /><br />once out of prison(3 years for murder?) the main character and his mate reunite with the wogs. they then go to the "other side of town" and try to lay low, because apparently everyone wants to kill them.<br /><br />soon the wogs get set up for the rape of another gang members girl , and run around town fighting off hordes of different gangs. this point of the movie can be compared to an arcade game, as the wogs simply run around and fight off enemies who seemingly get worse and worse as the movie goes on.<br /><br />anyway the movie ends with some massive climatic fight scene in which the remaining wogs (the two main characters) take on every gang they've fought so far. apparently the other gangs don't have a problem uniting to take on the remaining wogs(the skinheads don't mind asians). after about a million more people get beaten up by the invincible wog brothers the movie ends with the main characters heading home. they don't make it home however, because they are burned to death by the the thousands of angry film critics who storm the set and leave angry letters everywhere.<br /><br />this movie may be more like a computer game then a movie, because that would explain how two guys can take about a million punches to the face from a million different people who the majority of the time are twice their size.<br /><br />there are also tonnes more stupid unexplainable events in this movie, such as an asian fighting off his own gang and taking a katana to the head just to let the wogs get away.<br /><br />like someone else mentioned, this movie isn't so bad its funny, it's just so bad.
