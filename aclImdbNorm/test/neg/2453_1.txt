i watched about an hour of this movie (against my will) and couldn't finish it. i'd rate it as a 0. the writing was bad, the plot predictable and one that's been done far too many times. the most annoying part of this movie was the acting done by melody thomas scott. this part did not call for someone appearing snobbish, but she managed in every single scene i saw to look like a (sour) snob or someone who was about to spout something extremely sarcastic or cruel. <br /><br />the two romances which seemed to develop into something serious almost upon the couples meeting was a bit too much. <br /><br />i should know better than to watch made for tv movies. if there is absolutely nothing on the telly and this is the only choice, read a book.
