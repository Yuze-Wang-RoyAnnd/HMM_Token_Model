"tokyo eyes" tells of a 17 year old japanese girl who falls in like with a man being hunted by her big bro who is a cop. this lame flick is about 50% filler and 50% talk, talk, and more talk. you'll get to see the less than stellar cast of three as they talk on the bus, talk and play video games, talk and get a haircut, talk and walk and walk and talk, talk on cell phones, hang out and talk, etc. as you read subtitles waiting for something to happen. the thin wisp of a story is not sufficient to support a film with low end production value, a meager cast, and no action, no romance, no sex or nudity, no heavy drama...just incessant yadayadayada'ing.
