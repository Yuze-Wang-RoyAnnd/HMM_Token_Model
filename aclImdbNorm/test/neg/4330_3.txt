this film has an amazing cast. mgm took some of its finest character actors and starred them in a film with the usually adorable margaret o'brien. lionel barrymore, edward arnold and lewis stone star as three greedy old bachelors who live in the same home. while they have amassed a fortune over the years, they also have been selfish jerks. one of them has an idea to donate some property in order to buy themselves a good name (sort of like carnegie) but it turns out the property they want to give away actually belongs to o'brien. and, since she's an orphan, they volunteer to be her guardians so they can give her property away and look like great philanthropists.<br /><br />there also is a goofy subplot involving fairies--led by the wonderful character actor henry davenport. and, since o'brien is irish (as evidenced by her outrageous accent), she and the little people make up much of the plot. frankly, i absolutely hated this portion of the film and wished they'd just dropped it entirely. instead, the story could still have been about sweet margaret melting the mean old men's hearts--this would have worked. but...the "little people"?!? sheesh! overall, the actors try very, very hard but the silliness of the plot and the deadly earnest way they tried made me cringe. i noticed a lot of people liked this film--i guess i'm just an old grouch! i found the film horrible difficult to watch.
