it is sad what they are letting into film festivals these days. i had to sit through over twenty minutes of this dreary short that wasn't funny at all to get a good seat for a feature film that i wanted to see at a local film festival. the festival planners paired this horrible short with a great feature. i am just glad the feature was good, otherwise i would have not been a very happy camper!<br /><br />for a comedy short film it got no laughs. the title says it all.
