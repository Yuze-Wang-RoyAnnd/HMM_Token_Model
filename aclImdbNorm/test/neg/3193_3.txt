the intertwined points-of-view can come up as a good idea in some movies. here it is a total mess.<br /><br />but the total mess begin with the story: a video-clip bummy wants to shoot a light comedy with a pernicious noir-like female character. she is gorgeous and no men could resist to dive and crawl and suck her toes. she is all the more materialist, looking as if butter wouldn't melt in her mouth.<br /><br />the movie does melt away in its own pretentiousness: being smart/funny/good-looking. phalocretinism at his best. white trash only, please.
