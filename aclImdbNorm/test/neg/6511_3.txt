imagine if you will an alternative universe where someone has made seven where instead of a talented cast and crew they've cast a politically conscious environmentalist and a stand up comedian as the leads . if your imagination can't stretch that far just watch the glimmer man as it's the next worse thing <br /><br />!!!! mild spoilers !!!!<br /><br />jack cole is a cop with a hidden past and it's very ironic that he's played by steven seagal since he's also someone witrh a hidden past , but don't tell anyone because it's top secret . perhaps the biggest secret is how someone like seagal became a movie star in the first place since the glimmer man continues in the vein of all of seagal's other movies in that it's utter , utter crap . look at the way he's introduced as his partner walks into his office " yoi love beads man . in you're in the wrong office " steven replies with something that is side splittingly witty , or he would if anyone was able to understand a bloody word he said because for much of the movie he just mumbles away . in fact the only time i could make out his dialogue was the scene at the school where he bursts in on the gunman holding the class hostage <br /><br />" don't make me kill you " <br /><br />is this what a cop would say to a suicidal gunman ? i'm just thinking that in another movie where steven isn't the hero ( ie a good movie ) the cop would say something along the lines of " don't kill me , i've got a wife and a couple of kids waiting at home " . so anyway suicidal gunman goes to blow his head off but steven saves his life by hurtling them both through two sets of windows . it goes without saying that you shouldn't try this at home<br /><br />as the story progresses steven ( i've given up on calling him jack though credit to the screen writer for giving steven a sensible name ) becomes involved in a case a plagiarism where someone has been stealing bits out of other superior movies featuring serial killers . as steven finds more victims you can see him thinking " what was that movie that starred morgan freeman as a cop ? " as he inspects the bodies , oh and the action keeps switching back to the hero's domestic life just so we know that this guy's good as a family man , this guy's very good as a family man such a pity he's so bad as a movie star
