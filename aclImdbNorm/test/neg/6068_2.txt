for a movie i was really looking forward to, i was very disappointed. i had no expectations of this being another amadeus, but did expect a more significant portrayal of beethovens last years.<br /><br />the performance by ed harris was superb, but the story line was so weak that the film simply moved from one dreary scene to the next with no continuity.<br /><br />the only enjoyable part of the film for me was the performance of the 9th, and from that point on i could quite happily have walked out without finishing.<br /><br />i left feeling very dissatisfied and still have the feeling that something important was missed.
