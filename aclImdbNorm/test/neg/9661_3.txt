wow, this movie sucked.<br /><br />this movie was a embarrassment to the original sandlot.<br /><br />everything about this movie was awful.<br /><br />the acting was horrendous. every part except the part of the 'mexican' sandlot manager was terrible.<br /><br />luke perry, though only bit parts was absolutely awful. this was is worst role ever. even the kid actor playing him as a kid was someone you'd want to punch, even in the end, lol.<br /><br />this movie reminded me of those kid movies that go that extra mile making a part goofy way beyond the funny stage. the humor was for 6 year olds.<br /><br />if your over 12 and want something worthwhile to watch, skip this movie and watch a sitcom instead.
