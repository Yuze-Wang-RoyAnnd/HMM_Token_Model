hell to pay was a disappointment. it did not have anywhere near the substance of a b western movie, and should in no way be compared to a fantastic movie like silverado. the dialog was dull, the plot was torpid, the soundtrack was overbearingly unnecessary, and the acting was awful. even the professionals could've taken some lessons from the sunset carson school of acting. the only positive thing about this movie is that it showcased some of the top cowboy shooters in the nation, but you can see them in a better light in any sass video. the packaging of this feature makes it very enticing, and the preview is decent, but it's all over after that.
