this movie really starts strong. we know that roberts is an atlanta hotshot sent to australia to fix coke's marketing problems. we also know he is an eccentric genius. roberts' fine acting convinces us of this rather quickly.<br /><br />unfortunately, the plot is so flimsy, that whatever fine character development has been achieved, it is negated by voids, inconsistencies, and downright boring film sequences.<br /><br />usually, i am a sucker for bold and far out plots. examples which i am fond of include, "dark star," "o.c. & stiggs," and "popeye." coupled with the fact that i must admit that this film was well acted, it surprises even myself that i cannot recommend this film.<br /><br />the utter breakdown in this movie occurs about midway through the film. all comedy is instantly lost and the film turns dark. afterwards, the film plods along. the film's attempt to get the comedy rolling again is not successful. more surprises await the viewer and they are darker still.<br /><br />to be sure, mixing drama with comedy can be a formula for success. however, with this movie, the result is about as successful as "new coke."
