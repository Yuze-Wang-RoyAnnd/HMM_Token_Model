this program would be useful for training hardened felons basic human emotions. beyond this purpose, the show has no value other than to fill bandwidth that would otherwise go unutilized in the electromagnetic spectrum. i feel a greater sense of suspense and anticipation listening to a computerized voice chip endlessly droning out the products of a random number generator. fortunately, the helpful and frequent music cues will tell viewers how they're supposed to feel, in case they are unable to fully internalize the predictable and shallow plot line. i did find amy to be a superficially positive character, as she is a role model to young women that they can serve in traditionally male fields. unfortunately, her totally subjective approach to the law is guided solely by whatever capricious personal guidelines amy elects to employ, resulting in amy's trials more closely resembling appeals to the personal mercy of a tribal despot than a true administration of justice. this show is unpalatable in any amount, although this is to some extent mitigated after two episodes by the brain's god-given filtering processes, by which the show will thankfully leave the same imprint on the viewer's memory as a television tuned to a dead channel at maximum volume.
