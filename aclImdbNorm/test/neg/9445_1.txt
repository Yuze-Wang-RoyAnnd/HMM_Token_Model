i have to say this is the worst movie that i have ever watched in my life, i cannot believe that i wasted $10 at blockbuster ; this movie should be burned and who ever thought of it has issues. who ever actually spent money to make this movie was insane =d this movie has terrible actors and some of the scenes make absolutely no sense. well, the whole movie doesn't make sense. also the part where those "men" come into the diner ( department of national securities )that happened to be the worst part of the film. how dare they say frank sinatra's name in vain? also, what is up with those glasses? when the guy and girl are in the car and she "drinks" water, you can totally tell that she isn't even drinking! also, what is up with the freaky dinner guy. and everyone knows that you don't stab tires, you slash them.
