i saw this movie in part because of some positive comments here on imdb. after wishing i had those 90 minutes of my life back, i feel it's my duty to get on here myself and say...please don't bother watching this movie.<br /><br />i can't argue with the actors efforts - they did what they could given the material, but that material is dreadful. the pace was deadly - slow, meandering, and you saw everything coming about an hour away, and then it took forever to happen. the dialogue was boring, pointless, not funny at all. the characters were all completely unsympathetic. and the cinematography was, in my opinion, very low quality - the clich'e of "character uses home video machine!" was used to very bad effect.<br /><br />yes, jeri ryan is a cool person. don't let that sucker you into wasting your time on this film.
