jeff leroy wanted to makes fun of scientology so built a horror movie around a cult similar to it. the twist is that instead of frail old l. ron hubbard as the cult leader, there's a centuries old space monster who turns his followers into vampires. our hero is a dirty living college student who is doing research into the occult. his landlord is an attractive blonde who tries to get him to clean up his life with the help of the cult. it doesn't take him long to figure out that she's only after one thing: his blood. "the screaming" was shot very cheaply on video and i just plain ugly. the space monster (which looks like a giant winged cat that looks perpetually mad and has no skin) is alternately a clay-mation miniature and a large scale animatronics puppet, both of which look awful. the acting and writing are both terrible and the director doesn't even try to disguise the fact that this movie was made for nothing. avoid this non-scary, pitiful little excuse.
