the acting is good.thats the positives out of the way! sosn is shallow and superficial.almost all the characters are middle class and english.the gay men are depicted as fickle sexual predators aiming to use children in their empty lives.this film could only appeal to people who know hampstead heath and would get minor satisfaction from pointing out any landmarks.there is no time to engage with the characters and has a result you really don,t care about them,catherine tate at the height of her comedic fame stars as a woman seeking a divorce from her husband and on screen for about the same time as her nana sketches failed to convince,however if she had said "what a f****** liberty" i would have agreed <br /><br />i'd rather take a walk in the park;unintelligent rubbish!
