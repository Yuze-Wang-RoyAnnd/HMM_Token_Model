usually, any movie with steve railsback in the lead is a good movie. however, this movie does not conform to that opinion. lifeforce is a below average movie that is extremely confusing in the beginning (reminds me of star trek: tmp), but is able to pick things up a bit towards the end when london becomes zombie city. a horror/sci-fi mess that is very hard to sit through, although the naked spacegirl/vampire is very easy to look at. this movie deserves a rating of 4 out of 10.
