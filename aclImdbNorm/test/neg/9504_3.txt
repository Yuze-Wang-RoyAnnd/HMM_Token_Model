i usually much prefer french movies over american ones, with explosions and car chases, but this movie was very disappointing. there is no way to write a spoiler because nothing really happens. this french couple has been living in lisbon for years, and they return to paris for a friend's wedding. they announce to another friend they are having dinner with that they are going to split. then nothing much happens, they don't seem to know whether they want to separate or not. i don't necessarily think that their hesitations make for a bad movie, it is very human to hesitate before making such a decision for good, but this could be treated in an interesting manner, giving some flesh to their desires and their relationship, but that does not happen. one gets out of the theater unsure of why these two got together or want to split. the only piece i enjoyed was the conversation with the drunk. that was true to life.
