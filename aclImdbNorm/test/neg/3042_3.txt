while babysitting at an isolated colorado house, a teen girl is terrorized by an elusive murderer on the telephone.<br /><br />remake of the 1979 semi-classic horror film basically takes the opening 20 minutes of the original film and stretches it out to fit an 87 minute time span! so it's pretty needless to say that the plot of this remake is pretty thin. there's little in the way of originality or interest in this movie. there's a lot of camilla belle wondering around a dark house wondering who's calling her and encountering all kinds of false scares. it all gets repetitious and routine after the first 30 minutes and never manages to muster up much in the way of suspense or chills. it certainly never reaches the intensity of the original film, especially since it wimps-out and changes one important plot point from the original. i guess we have the pg-13 rating to thank for that.<br /><br />on the plus side there's an impressive set design and some dark atmosphere, unfortunately there's not much going on around it to save this remake from being sub-par. belle's performance is pretty mediocre too.<br /><br />it's just another unimpressive remake.<br /><br />* 1/2 out of ****
