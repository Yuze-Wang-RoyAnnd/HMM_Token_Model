this movie wasn't the best... but it did have some good actors in it. isiaiah washington was pretty good as a homeless guy, guy torrey was good as his handicapped brother, ice-t was humorous as the landlord and surprisingly...the actress tami roman was good as the judge in the movie. i didn't even know it was her and i am a die hard real world fan. she was totally believable. hopefully this movie won't hinder these actors development. i know that isiaiah has left this movie far behind with the success of grey's anatomy, ice-t with his regular role on nypd special unit and tami roman has landed a recurring role on sex love and secrets (upn's new soap opera). i wish the same for the other actors because one bad movie doesn't a bad actor make.
