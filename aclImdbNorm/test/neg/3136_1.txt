for the people who have compared this trash to the brilliance of david lynch etc... please listen to your carer when they say... dont use other people's pc without their permission! <br /><br />this is complete and utter poo! there is no art here. this is some person trying to make a name for himself with a cluster of gross out ideas which he was not clever enough to enforce into one main idea so instead he went for the easy option. <br /><br />any one with half a brain could sit at home and conjure up some controversial images to shock viewers, but it takes a person with true imagination to be able to make it into a movie people want to watch.<br /><br />i am a lover of shock cinema. i have seen or own pretty much all you can get... and i can strongly advise to anyone who loves the world of movies to steer well clear of this garbage.<br /><br />this one is only for people who like to over analyze what they are watching, or for the 17 year old first time drinkers who dont know any better.<br /><br />0/10!<br /><br />
