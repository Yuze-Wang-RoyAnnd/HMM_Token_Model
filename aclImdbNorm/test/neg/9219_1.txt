as i don't have a tv, and had never heard of this mini-series, i didn't know what to expect from the second coming and hired it purely on the strength of its plot synopsis, which sounded interesting.<br /><br />dear god! (every pun intended.) if someone told me that this had been written by a class of thirteen year olds who had been given the project of turning the second coming into a school play i wouldn't have been surprised.<br /><br />why, oh why did they decide to portray jesus mark ii as what amounted to an idiot savant? is there anything in any of the gospels to suggest this? okay, an ordinary bloke, but a great northern moron. i don't think so.<br /><br />apparently all jesus did to impress people was his miracles, because according to this take his preaching sure as hell never impressed anyone. certainly without the night into day stunt mr jesus eccleston would have been floundering without a canoe, a paddle or any kind of following at all.<br /><br />and the odd little gay polemics put in willy-nilly, without rhyme or reason. other than, of course, russell waving to his qaf fan base. jesus turns up in the pub to recruit 'disciples' (more gormless northern losers and, of course, the gay writer's standby - the harpy woman, nag, nag, nagging away). gay rights are rammed down his throat to no real purpose, almost like russell thought he 'owed it to the lads' to put jesus on the spot. <br /><br />i can't really see the real jesus coming out with "well, i've nothing against it personally, mate." only someone truly middle class and woolly could imagine jesus to be quite this wet.<br /><br />and don't start me on the ending. 'please come in and eat rat poison because the only way we can be truly free is if god dies'.<br /><br />it was like an eddie izzard sketch of god as bill gates. "hello, i'm bill gates, and now you've pointed out to me that my global domination is cramping your style i'm going to give it all to you, my customers." and eat the rat poison, of course.<br /><br />i'm often mystified by the ratings on imdb, but the high rating on this one takes the biscuit.<br /><br />never mind jesus for the new millennium - this is jesus for brainless mtv lads.<br /><br />god help us all indeed.
