ha ha! first of if you've never seen a "dimension film" your in for a real treat! known primarily for super low budget horror/slasher films, "beowulf" was no exception.<br /><br />however, this video was more in the style of ultra-cheesy. i missed the k-r-a-f-t label on the side.<br /><br />consider the anachronisms! (something out of place and time)<br /><br />we had: candles, armour, swords....<br /><br />yet we saw: telescopes, soled shoes, cigarette lighters, loudspeakers, electricity, body bags, aluminum foil tins,, and spoons/forks. <br /><br />not bad for something that takes place in like the 8th century!<br /><br />this is not a horror film, is a horrible film. its very laughable. its really a comedy made to look like a horror film! i couldn't stop laughing!<br /><br />christopher lambert ("the highlander series") -- must have really taken a tumble in his career if he's working for "dimension films."<br /><br />i've learned my lesson though. i'll be looking at the film studios on the videos, a lot more closely now.<br /><br />rated no reels out of five. if you want a good laugh though, its hard to pass up on this piece of work!<br /><br />this move had some cleavage in spots -- i especially liked the blonde bimbette!<br /><br />wayno<br /><br />
