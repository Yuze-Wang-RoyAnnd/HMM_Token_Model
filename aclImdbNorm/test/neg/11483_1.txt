i don't know why all the previous comments are approval of this movie. it is , well not by far but...,the suckiest movie i've seen lately, full of clich'es, bad acting, actually no...very bad acting and has a silly plot...if i would have seen it in a cinema i would have walked out after the first 20 minutes. i f you hate somebody , make him/her watch this movie...that's how bad it is. a girl who has an imaginary boy/friend that gives up a relationship with a real one because her imagination is jealous....but i think it figures...she takes after her parents who also have some mental issues...plus the character who is supposed to be i think the laughing stock of it, the thing that should make you laugh, cal's room mate is a serious nut case and just makes me feel sorry for him...and the whole movie
