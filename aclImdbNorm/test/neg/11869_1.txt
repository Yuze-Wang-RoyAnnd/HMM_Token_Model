ok, ill be brief. this film wasn't just bad it was very very bad, with line4s like " if you deal with the devil you expect to get sh*t on your shoes" you know your in hideous film territory. after watching this film i wanted to kill myself and my entire family, it gave me such a vast feeling of self-loathing i wanted to do murder. don't watch this film. i will kill again. but when i do it will be terribly edited with a pathetic soundtrack and stock shot for hire action sequences and bad shirts.<br /><br />fortunately there is a flipside, its the first action film to feature a three door ford sierra.<br /><br />unfortunately it ends up trashed on its roof :(<br /><br />ps: worse than the marksman
