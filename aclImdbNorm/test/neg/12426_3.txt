what can i say about a movie as bad as this? the people who made this movie, didn't even try to make the monster in it look realistic. you never see more than its head, and the head is just a giant puppet that has little movement except for when it opens it mouth to roar. and the sound they used for the roaring is the best part. at many points in the movie it sounds exactly like a tie fighter flying over! i couldn't believe that when i first heard it and had to rewind several times to make it sink in. other than the terrible looking monster and the noises it makes, there isn't much more to this film except for a few corny attack scenes and the crazy scotsman attacking the kids trying to have an intimate moment in his castle. still, it's watchable if you like this sort of trash. i know i do....
