unimpressive and extremely low budget sci-fi without any charm and appeal. even the scenes related with the fall of the asteroids are stolen from other movies with the same plot. it's just a bad rip-off of "asteroid" (with annabela sciora) and "deep impact" (with morgan freeman). mr. hopper seems to be anxious to slip away from this pointless and dull sci-fi entry.<br /><br />i give this a 2 (two). and don't say i'm not a good guy!
