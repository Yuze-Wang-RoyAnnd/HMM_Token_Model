the biggest problem with "in search of historic jesus" is that there is very little search to it at all. shick-sunn produced these "documentary" films in the 1970s and just into the '80s, which featured interviews with "experts" and discussion of "science" and "facts" to make a case for whatever the title of the film was looking to cash in on.<br /><br />sadly, "historic jesus" is really little more than a third-rate dramatization of the life of christ. unlike shick-sunn's more superior "in search of noah's ark" which spends the majority of its running time discussing the possibility that the ark is resting on the earth today and where that might be, this film is basically the story of jesus with no effort made to prove or disprove his existence. the famed shroud of turrin is mentioned, but little other detective work is given much screen time.<br /><br />for fans of these quasi-documentary films like "jupiter menace" and "in search of bigfoot", etc., this movie doesn't offer much.
