this...thing. oh god this thing. i can't even call it a movie. a movie is something that does something. goes somewhere. has some semblance of a plot or something. i don't know how i'm doing it. i really don't. first i say dark fields is the worst movie ever. and i thought it was. then pirates of ghost island proved me wrong. and now, third time in a row, another film goes above and beyond the call of duty to prove me wrong.<br /><br />(sighs) ok. dark harvest ii: the maize. lord this is awful. let me break it down for you. man senses daughters are in danger through some magical psychic powers he got from his act ii popcorn apparently and races to find them in a corn field. of course this is the hugest cornfield in all of existence, being the size of the cornfields from jeepers creepers, children of the corn, and signs combined. the main character, whose name is shy (awesome name btw) then runs through a corn field....finds some ghost girls, talks to them, and...runs through a corn field. digs a while...and runs through a corn field. and the incredibly sad thing? i'm really not leaving anything out. that pretty much is the entire movie. the only thing i may be leaving out is how he gets chased by two policemen who want to arrest him for... i don't know. pretending to be an actor. i didn't care by this point. he gets away and the police are -somethinged- by the killer offscreen. holy crap there's a killer? apparently yes there is as he's introduced nearly 4/5 into the movie. but wait! then he runs away for a while and there's, you guessed it, more running through the corn field and digging. then there's the ending where he saves his daughters. huzzah.<br /><br />the biggest problem with this movie is, it's boring. it's incredibly, inhumanly, tremendously boring. i can't explain how atrociously dull this thing is. nothing happens, the characters are as appealing as a root canal, and it's just an hour and a half of nothing. the only good thing that came out of this movie was that me and my friend may have found enlightenment due to the near nirvana state this movie put us into after the effects of the drugs in our brain had to kick into overdrive to keep us alive. during the ensuing insanity, i found hugging a wall much more enjoyable and my friend found a new passion for laughing hysterically while flopping all over the floor as if he having a seizure. this is the sort of insanity this movie brings. it's not just bad. it's bad for your health. the cover looks awesome with a picture of an awesome scarecrow killer that i would totally consider dressing up as for a horror con, but this was the most misleading box ever. don't let it fool you too! do not watch this movie. watch a better corn movie. any movie about corn is better. just don't let it get you! don't! a 0 out of 10
