i picked out this dvd out of the cheepo bin at walmart because the cover showed one of the planes i flew during viet-nam (c-123k). i did not fly for air america, but knew being a c-123 pilot, i knew a lot who did, including those who flew in my reserve unit back home. i am not a movie critic, but wonder about the subliminal motivation of directors and writers who make movies like this. the best part of this movie has to go to the cameraman. the flying shots and stunts (although totally cartoon like) are excellent. the movie begins with hollywood's favorite fall guy in 1969. but the fact is, nixon did not start air america, he did not begin the lies. johnson was responsible for air america and nixon inherited the lies, the war, and air america. its not fair or accurate to portray nixon as a liar on the subject of air america. all president's have inherited the lies of their predecessors. nobody smart enough to fly a c-123 was dumb enough to not know what they were joining. that makes the downey character unbelievable. a c-123 was a rugged airplane. it could easily fly on one engine, or the two auxiliary jet engines. the three stooges shooting a duck with one shot is more likely. pilots who flew with air america were civilian employees of the cia, they were not reckless soldiers of fortune. they had a good reason to behave and believe in a future, if they survived their extremely dangerous job. they were given double time towards a retirement pension. they weren't required to sell dope or guns to get a good pension. dope was legal and a way of life in sea, as it still is today in afganistan. if individual pilots tried to make money on the side, it was not cia policy. the cia was fighting a war on communism, not drugs. the writer based his story on "war stories". pilots love to bs anybody who will buy them a beer and listen. the writer and director who had an ax to grind about viet-nam and nixon. see the movie, and remember how it starts - it blames nixon for what existed for years. remember, he didn't become president until jan 20, 1969.<br /><br />my favorite scene is the landing up hill in the jungle. air america pilots put planes in places the aircraft designers never thought possible. their were plenty of funny stories that could have been shown. instead, the director chose to use the oversize rubber scene to show how dumb the cia was. this scene shows that the director and writer fell for some pilot bar talk and the joke is on them. <br /><br />mds fort valley virginia.
