i saw this movie just recently, and i said to myself: "this movie is bad!" william shatner is a great actor, but he is no director! <br /><br />it's not just that the acting is bad, it's terrible. and instead of a plot, we have a very bad storyline that is called a plot! what i really thought was bad was at the beginning where kirk and mccoy were teaching spock how to sing "row, row, row your boat!"<br /><br />do i have something against william shatner? i do not. but when it comes to being a director, he sucks! this film is not one of the worst movies i have ever seen. but it is the worst of the star trek series! <br /><br />i noticed that after this shatner did not return to direct another film in the series. they apparently did not want him to direct another film again after this happened! <br /><br />overall, this movie sucks! <br /><br />2/10
