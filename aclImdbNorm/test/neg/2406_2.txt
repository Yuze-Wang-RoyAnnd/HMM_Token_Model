this film is worse than cat people, which i saw during the same week. it has all the 80's style. mtv punk rockers, the real ones who are anti social, not todays pc commercial type, frat boys, and a bad guy called splater. i really like splater, and the film does that blue lighting 80's feel, but the rest of it looks like low budget canadian schlop. i have seen so much of this while living in this great country, and realize these type of movies were made because of tax breaks. avoid at all costs.
