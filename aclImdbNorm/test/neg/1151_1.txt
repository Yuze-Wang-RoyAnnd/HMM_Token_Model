let me first start with the obvious: antisemitism has been a serious problem throughout history, present in many societies and causing the deaths of million of jews. that said, the problem with this movie is that it views the united states - probably the most welcoming society ever to jews outside of israel - as a not very different place from nazi germany. set in 1943, the movie is about a man (william h. macy) who gets confused with a jew after he starts wearing glasses!. a number of very nasty things happen to him after that (he loses his job and he is unable to find a new one, his neighbors shunned him, all ending up in a violent confrontation). from one of arthur miller's self pitying, patronizing novels, the sort that gave liberalism a bad name.
