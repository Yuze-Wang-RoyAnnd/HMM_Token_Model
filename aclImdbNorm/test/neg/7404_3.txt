i was hoping this would be of the calibre of das boot and echo the stark realism created by acclaimed german director leni riefenstahl in her documentaries, sadly i was monumentally disappointed. the story line is implausible and defies credulity. an raf airman is shot down and somehow finds his way to a hospital in dresden. anna a nurse whose father runs the hospital and is about to become engaged to a doctor she works with falls in love with the airman and they make love. the next evening at a lavish engagement party the airman turns up disguised as a german officer and dances with anna. although well directed and acted, to me it is soap opera of the lowest order.
