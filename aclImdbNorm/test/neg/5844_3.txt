a good example of the differences between american and foreign cinema can be seen in a film i recently watched on television: indecent proposal.<br /><br />indecent proposal's two protagonists, david and diane murphy are played woody harrelson and demi moore. i'm not sure if it was their total lack of chemistry or that they were not acting well, but why we should care so much whether these two stay together was beyond me. love, affection, playfulness, attraction
