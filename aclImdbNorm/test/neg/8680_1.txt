the good news for imdb is that this movie was so very bad that it compelled me to register and make a comment. i should add here that i'm a film buff who rarely passes harsh judgment. but sometimes a movie is so poorly acted, poorly conceived, poorly edited, with a such a poor story line that it begs criticism.<br /><br />i'm surprised by all the claims of how superb, brilliant, dark, and beautifully shot this movie was. i can only conclude that the cast and crew are active posters here. the acting was extremely thin. the pace of the movie was agonizing. i gave it new chances at every turn (mostly because i didn't want to feel like i was wasting a saturday morning in ny), but with every new scene, it dragged longer, delivering characters in which i took no interest, with which i could not connect, for whom i could not empathize.<br /><br />when i see negative reviews on imdb of small independent films like this, i sometimes wonder if the poster has a personal axe to grind (something like. . he used to date the gaffer, she dumped him, and now he's going to trash everything she ever works on). but here, nope. i know no one who worked on this film. and i wish it would have been great. but the film wasn't dark (as some have mentioned) or depressing (as others have claimed). . . those suggest that i connected with the film . . . nope, henry may long was just too long, empty, and tedious. <br /><br />that's the tomas take on this one.
