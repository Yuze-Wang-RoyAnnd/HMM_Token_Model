i consider myself a fan of jess franco and his trash movies, but nearly every time i see one of them, i just see missed opportunities and plots that don't play out well. this film is, unfortunately, no different. the film certainly had a lot of potential, as franco has fused the intriguing theme of the classic film 'the most dangerous game' with his usual brand of trashy sleaze, but the plot here gets lost too often, and it takes an eternity for franco to get round to the main point of the movie. with this being a later franco film, you might be forgiven for thinking that the director would have got better, but actually i've found that the opposite is true; as this and the terrible 'killer barbys' are two of his very worst films. the plot focuses on a stripper and her sleazy boyfriend. the pair is invited to a private island by a rich woman and her lover. however, they soon find that they haven't been invited there for social reasons as they are 'released' on the island so that the wealthy woman and her friends can hunt them down for sport! <br /><br />what attracted me to this film was the front cover and the fact that it was directed by the king of sleaze flicks. you'd think, then, that i'd be pleased that the movie features a plethora of sex scenes and general sleaze; but i'm not. the reason for this is mostly that the sex and sleaze in the film is really boring and most of the time served only in giving me the condition known as 'itchy fast forward finger'. however, my inclination to see everything through to the end ensured that i had to lump it. there was a time when i didn't think girl-on-girl could possibly be boring, but i have since been proved wrong. the only positive i can pluck out the movie really is that the soundtrack is quite catchy, and despite it being silly foreign pop music; actually blends quite well with the sex scenes. i did enjoy the last ten minutes; as that's when the plot finally got going, but it was a case of too little too late and unfortunately, this is a severely lacklustre film. on the whole, i only recommend this film to those who feel they must see all 180+ franco movies...everyone else should watch vampyros lesbos, faceless or she killed in ecstasy instead.
