i agree that this movie is about sex without any seduction or love. in fact, it makes sex seem so boring and makes me wonder why bother. i actually don't think at all this remotely speaks of how canadian indian second generations feel about sex. at any rate, did you know the first hotel/drunk idea was copied from a korean movie, yopgijogin gunyo, made in 2001 or thereabouts? that korean film was actually brilliant as comedy but at the same time compels the audience to reflect on the complexity of man-woman relationships and man-woman difference in experience and thinking. i mean most of the neal n nikki hotel/drunk segment was emulated take by take. can't bollywood movie makers try to make originals only, please? seriously, i never enjoyed a hindi flick that is a copycat. the ones i enjoy have always spoken indian feelings through indian cultural means.
