like most everyone who views this movie, i did it for the stars michael madsen and dennis hopper. the two are extremely underrated and sadly, because of that, have to headline a lot of crap. in this film, hopper plays a guy who accidentally kills a blackmailer and is offered help from the mysterious madsen.<br /><br />the film actually isn't as terrible as it could have been. i've seen both in much worse, both independently and working together (lapd, horrible film). the direction was pretty poor and the script needed a few re-writes, but both give the best performance possible with the material offered. also the ending is pretty strong, so you can tell the story had potential. but when a glowing review of a film is, "it could have been much worse", it doesn't say much for the film itself.<br /><br />all in all, this is one that can easily be skipped if neither of these actors draw you in. but if you're a fan of either or both, give it a watch. they both give strong performances that outshine the obvious flaws of the film. trust me, there are much worse options out there.
