this is without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen. i say this without hyperbole, and believe me, i've seen a lot of bad movies. it's embarrassing and annoying that millions of dollars went into this film and that hundreds (thousands?) of craftspeople spent so much time working on what the writers and producers must have known would be a colossal failure.<br /><br />when a 90 minute film feels this long, drawn out, boring, and incomprehensible, you know that something went wrong somewhere. also, jamie kennedy (whose work i've enjoyed elsewhere) is simply terrible in this role; he was obviously never given a screen test, because no producer in their right mind would consider him entertaining in any way, especially in the guise of the mask. simply awful.<br /><br />personally, i can't wait to see the reviews by the major film critics, because i know they're do a better job than me at tearing this train wreck to shreds.<br /><br />the producers of this film should be embarrassed, and more importantly, never be allowed to make theatrical films again.
