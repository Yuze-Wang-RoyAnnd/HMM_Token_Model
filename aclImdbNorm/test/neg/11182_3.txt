on the pure theatrical side, last stand was great, as the reenactments and soundtrack are very entertaining, but there are better accounts of this battle found elsewhere that, while not as long or as flashy, are far more historically comprehensive.<br /><br />certain little details, such as the misuse of the word "hoplon" for the greek hoplite shield and the mispronounciations of various names and words, really ate at me.<br /><br />my guess would be, that because "last stand of the 300" was aired the eve of the theatrical release of "300", the history channel was only trying to ride the coattails of the movie's hype.<br /><br />if you're looking for a depiction that's historically accurate in all respects possible, you'd have better luck elsewhere.
