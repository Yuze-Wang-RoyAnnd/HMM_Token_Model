dr. marnie bannister (magda konopka) is a horribly disfigured woman. when one of her colleagues discovers a rejuvenation formula, marnie sees it as her opportunity to become beautiful. when she's denied the drug because of possible side effects, she kills her colleague to get what she wants. the drug works and she becomes beautiful. but the formula brings out the worst in her and it's not long before she's left a string of bodies behind her.<br /><br />have you ever heard the expression "as exciting as watching paint dry"? that pretty much sums up satanik. during the film, one of the characters utters the line, "something so horrible, it's inconceivable." i wasn't sure if he was talking about something in movie or the movie itself. i'm really disappointed because i had high hopes for this one. satanik had possibilities, but they're never realized. at every opportunity, the plot has marnie do the dullest things imaginable. the writing is horrible. and part of the problem is magda konopka. she's not that appealing and cannot carry the film on her own.<br /><br />another big problem with satanik is the direction and editing. it's a mess. we see things and places that have no bearing on anything in the movie. the camera lingers on shots too long after the scene is over. i can't think of a single shot that would call anything but unoriginal. this group of filmmakers exhibits little in the way of imagination or talent.<br /><br />i may not be familiar with the italian comic on which satanik is supposedly based, but i'm sure it's got to be better than this.
