this movie could have been oh so much better. it is a beautiful story set in very trying times, and yet it was so poorly executed. the leading actors have in the past done excellent jobs, and for the most part they do an adequate job in this film. although at times their dialogue seems stilted and forced. the directing could have been more concise. the bulk of the criticism should go to the writers, who took a good story and made it tedious. in short, there are thousands of much better ways to spend 2 hours.
