i bought a dvd collection (9 movies for 10 euros) where this one was included. it turned out to be the "uncut version" whatever that means. beside the low average quality and short scenes there was one thing that was really strange - the soft sex scene. it started with a close up of 2 bigger breasts. after around 2 minutes i had an expression on my face which fitted the term "boooooooooooooring!" quite perfectly. 7.5 minutes of not even bouncing concrete like tits (at this point the term breasts is a bad choice) is far beyond from entertainment.<br /><br />the rest of the movie was more like "people aren't /that/ stupid, are they?" <br /><br />lucky me, the dvd was scratched and i got my money back.
