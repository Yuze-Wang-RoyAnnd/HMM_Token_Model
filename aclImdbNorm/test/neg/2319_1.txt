i'll start blasting the movie first. remove abbott and costello from the cast and you've got a badly colored movie, stiff cardboard from the casting department, badly dubbed sound (especially during the singing!) and annoying dialog (ex. listen to the line "mr. dinklepuss" ad infinitum). obviously some studio hack thought that they could cash in on disney's classic presentation of "mickey and the beanstalk", but maybe audiences were either more gullible back then (improbable) or stuck in a double feature (more probable). even children should feel insulted at having this movie shown to them. a total waste of celluloid. now, about the acting of abbott and costello. bud abbott always played the straight man, and by all accounts was the nicer person off the set. on radio, his character was usually the smooth fast talker, and was especially funny when his speed caused him to flub his lines and smooth over the mistakes. in the movies, he still plays the straight man, but is more of a con artist. not that he's bad at it, but that character has been played to perfection by groucho marx. the real travesty of the duo on film is lou costello. again, on radio he was funny. he played a character that was a little slower than abbott, but not too much slower! he was also glib with the lines, and got me laughing when he would ad-lib at abbott's mistakes. on film, i don't know if it was his decision or not, but in the movies his character becomes a shoddy impersonation of stan laurel, which in turn was even more shoddily done by jerry lewis. why the change? he was funny on radio when he was a smarta--, but here he becomes a child-like character that looks like he's mugging for the cameras in every shot. this characterization is shown in every movie they do, and only brings a stain to the reputation they had on radio. what is left to their film career is a poor (very, very poor) copy of laurel and hardy. the movies would have been much funnier if they had played their radio characters instead of retreads of stock casting.
