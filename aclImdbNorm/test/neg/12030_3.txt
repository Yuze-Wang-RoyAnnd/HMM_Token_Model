this homemade horror movie tells the story of a dude who kills people using the motif of stories by edgar allan poe. the local police have bungled the case for a few years, so now the fbi has taken over. they know exactly who the guy is, but apparently no one has thought to swing by his house, because that's where he's hanging out, running around in his vintage clothing and torturing the random locals. so fbi-chick gets kidnapped, which involves her father, the former lead investigator from the local police. to top it all off, a pack of wacky college kids have decided to camp out at the house and smoke a bunch of weed.<br /><br />mostly, the fbi agent winds up shrieking and running around like a little girl, and not a single one of the burly college boys thinks to just stop and take a swing at the wimpy poe-boy. mostly overacted and sometimes underacted, dead end road reeks of a low-budget, cast-with-friends production that has silly points too numerous to cover.
