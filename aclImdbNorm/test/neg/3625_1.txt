i strongly dislike this show. i mean, like, basically everyone at that school is perfect, and rich, and i doubt a boarding school would look as cool as that. and why do they suddenly allow girls into the school? isn't that just a little weird? anyways, jamie lynn spears cannot act. she always has the same facial expression, which really annoys me. she is basically emotionless, and all the guys seem to like her.<br /><br />and shouldn't chase tell her he likes her? its not that hard! really! none of this show is real life, and she isn't "a girl like me" because majority of the regular girls do not go to boarding school, do not have designer clothes, and do not live by the beach.<br /><br />fake fake fake.
