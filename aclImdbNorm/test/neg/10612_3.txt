i'm not one of those folks who bemoans everytime a film based on an old tv show comes out. rather, i usually run out and see it (if i had watched the show) and try to get nostalgic. but if anyone feels like running down films based on old shows, this is exhibit a (so you can actually say something more than just "mchale's navy"). "mod squad" is dreary, tiring, and lethargic. at least the original series was angst riddled long before anyone knew teens could be so glum, making it groundbreaking. this is just tedious. claire danes is nice to look at, but does nothing else but mood swing and sneak around spying on the baddies. giovanni ribisi's acting extent in this flick is that droopy the dog look for an hour and forty five minutes. and omar epps looks like he wants to flee the set, but the script's chlostraphobia has trapped him. sure, the production is nice, with the now seemingly obligitory "rave" nightclub opening action sequence and shootouts galore. oh, and the kids yell and get mad at each other and their superiors a lot too. it's kind of like deciding to use the scooby doo mystery machine to go on a family vacation to hollywood with your teenage kids who you and your spouse know need heavy therapy and prescription drugs. i really wanted to like this movie, and there were promising moments, but the next scene would suck the life out of it. you can knock another spelling remake, "charlie's angels", all you want, but at least that film knew it wanted to have fun with itself. "the mod squad" makes you wonder where the inspiration from the original series went.
