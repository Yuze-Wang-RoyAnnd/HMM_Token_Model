first separate the story from the film. the story about a second continuing war in heaven is good, very good. religious themed films aren't the main choice for a lot of people but angels at war is. i really loved the story, and some of the imagery provided to back it up like the field of angels on spikes....awesome imagery. the actual film though was just poor, i can't find any reason for the main character - the priest-cum-cop being in there at all. the lead female also...no reason to be there, the main characters dialogue was just empty, it had no substance, the story could have been told well without them. now, some sterling performances did feature, walken, stoltz and mortensen pulled off some wingers, though their scenes were mostly with the lifeless leads.<br /><br />one other thing i am not getting from this film is why it features native american rituals to purge the dark soul. the child that carries it is clearly of native american origin but apart from the end scenario there is nothing that connects here with that heritage. the plot concerning the dark soul itself it barely told, odd considering that the dark soul is the driver for the whole premise of the film. the back story of its original owner (the colonel) is briefly touched but not enough to allow understanding as to why its his soul that is the special one.<br /><br />i cannot find a justification for the scrolling scenery shots in this film either, several of the plains around 'chimney rock'. i get the feeling they had a helicopter and wanted to make the most of it as none of the shots have any relevance, nor are they in keeping with the mood -> horror. the film falls into the sci-fi category more than it does horror. there was no real shock or scare scenes, some mild gore and blood but no fear element.<br /><br />so, aside from 3 roles played damn well this film is a big ole' dud. unfortunately the dud factor outweighs the good acting factor, just too many weekend actors.
