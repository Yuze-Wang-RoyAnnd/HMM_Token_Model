this is species already hatching into a beautiful model (mathilda may). a smashing baby with an urge to kiss and kill!<br /><br />the movie begins with a strong launch, and infected by a bore-virus throughout the middle to end.<br /><br />the weakest spot is the presentation of the basic plot/story. as you should have compared it, natasha henstridge's species got the same plot, but adds up much interesting side plot and not mentioning good actions and strong clymatic ending.<br /><br />this explain why patrick stewart joins the fleet of enterprise in star trek next generation; he wanted to find more models in glass cage, floating inside halley-comet.<br /><br />a must see for a science fiction fans.
