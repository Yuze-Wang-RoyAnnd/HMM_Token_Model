an interesting slasher film with multiple suspects.<br /><br />includes typical girl flashing her breasts (denise cheshire) as she changes into her swimsuit, creepy suspect - any one of them could be doing the deed, expected breast baring to get a passing grade (linnea quigley), a very unusual forward pass, more bare breasts, a track and field event that will not be in the summer olympics, and a ghoulish secret.<br /><br />it all comes to a crashing ending. no, there's more. won't this guy die? i bet anne (patch mackenzie) doesn't plan any more visits home anytime soon.<br /><br />if you like teen slasher films, can you possible be a pervert, even if all the actresses are over 18?
