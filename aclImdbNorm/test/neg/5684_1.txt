i watched the first 10 minutes and it bored me to death. so, i fast forward all the way through the end. this movie must be the worst of all in the low budget sci-fi movies category so far. bad acting, cast, directions, lara craft custom imitation, story, plot, everything! through out the entire movie, i think that there maybe only 6 to 7 people in the entire cast, but only two of them started in the entire movie. i was expecting something like the starship trooper, but it was nothing close to it. i was fooled by the movie title and the picture on the dvd cover. don't waste your time watching this boring and bad movie. come to think of it, i wonder why did they even bother to put out bad movies like this one?
