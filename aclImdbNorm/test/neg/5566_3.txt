the actresses are cute and the sets, while simple, quite ok. apart from this, there is nothing to save from this movie. incredibly bad acted, dumb to tears dialogues, all-too-expected plot, a lot of goofs and inconsistencies (for instance, a pretty young girl gets hits in the head by a morning star and not only she survives, but barely with a scratch !)... to make it short because it does not worth more, even the fans of the genre can avoid it.
