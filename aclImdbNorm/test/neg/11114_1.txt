i watched this movie knowing that it would be awful, but damned if it didn't break new and revolutionary ground in the field of making fecal matter acceptable as entertainment. the plot is deep rising with cruddy effects and horrid acting. the lines in this...well...wow there really is no way to put this movie down because i think the words have yet to be created in the english language. the sad part is that the filmmakers thought they were actually making something good. you won't believe your eyes when you see how many movies they ripped off without even trying to hide it. there are scenes/plot devices straight out of deep rising, alien, jurassic park, predator, jeepers creepers, and the list could go on forever. however, unlike any of those movies this one just falls short of celluloid stool. the most incredulous thing about this film, aside from the way it tries to be competent but fails, is that gimli him-freakin'-self is in it. how the hell can they afford john rhys-davies but not decent effects, writing, actors, or sets. really awful...and not the type of bad that's good.
