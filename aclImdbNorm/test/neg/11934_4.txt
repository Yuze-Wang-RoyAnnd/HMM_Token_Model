i would bet a month's salary "the magnificent seven returns" (msr) was made-for-tv. other reviewers attest that msr was a theatrical movie, and i'll take their word for it. the logical answer must assume it was originally shot for tv, and after a change-of-studio-heart, it was released theatrically instead. every actor is primarily a tv actor: mariette hartley, michael callen, ralfe waite, stephanie powers... tv performers all. lee van cleef split his time between tv and theater screens. stephanie powers has only made 3 or 4 "real" movie appearances in the last thirty years of a very prolific television career - proof positive this was shot for tv. minor players are veteran small-screen actors who can be seen on old reruns of "gunsmoke", "wild wild west," "streets of san francisco," and so on.<br /><br />the ho-hum sets are identical to the universal studios tour sets, often seen in old episodic tv. and the editing betrays the one-or-two-takes-hurriedness of tv, with limited camera movements, positioning, cutting, and lighting. the sound track, exclusive of the original berstein themes, are straight from seventies television. yep, i'd bet money it was shot for tv.<br /><br />that's an important point in evaluating msr. initially i watched msr on cable assuming it was an old theatrical release. in comparison to the original "magnificent seven", it's a joke, a cartoon, an amateurish attempt at movie making. acting, lighting, writing, settings, action, cinematography, music (exempting the berstein themes), editing, pacing,...on and on....all pale in comparison to the classic "magnificent seven" which is close to the perfect 60's western, and one of the great action movies of all time. <br /><br />however, viewed as an early 70's made-for-tv movie, as i suspect, the film is actually better than average. those unfortunate enough to live through the 70's as an adult, know what i'm talking about. msr would have competed against "alias smith and jones" and similarly bland network shows. during the seventies, "gunsmoke" was a quality show, concentrating on character development rather than action, deemphasizing gun play to two shootouts a week. the first shooting, usually a murder, sets the hour's plot into motion - the second shootout climaxes the episode by killing the guest star, his nemesis, or otherwise resolving the conflict with marshal matt dillon. msr has more action than a whole season of "gunsmoke." in this light - in this frame of reference - msr is passable entertainment, a cut above the tv fare from that decade.
