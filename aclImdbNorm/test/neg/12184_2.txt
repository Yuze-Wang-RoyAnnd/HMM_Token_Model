in the twilight years of his career, charles bronson forged long-running partnerships with several directors, most notably j. lee thompson and michael winner. he did two films for one-time bond director peter hunt too - the first being the decent 1981 actioner death hunt, the second being this indifferent political chase thriller. assassination is pretty dull if truth be known, and come the end you'll find yourself longing for something with a bit more passion and pace, like the wilby conspiracy for instance (which, plotwise, this film resembles).<br /><br /> bronson sleepwalks through his role as bodyguard jay killian, whose assignment is to protect the american president's wife, lara royce craig (jill ireland, real-life wife of bronson). killian believes that mrs craig has been targetted by assassins; she thinks he's an over-protective, paranoid pessimist. turns out - surprise, surprise - that killian was right all along and someone is indeed out to eradicate her. the pair of them go on the run, pursued by the assassins.<br /><br /> everyone knows that the wife of an american president is known as the first lady. for some reason, in this film they have renamed her "one mama"! quite what the point of this is is anybody's guess, but it's indicative of the film's pointlessness as a whole. most of the film's performances are lazy, and the script takes a heck of a long time to get to where it's going. if i had to label assassination within a specific genre, i'd say it is supposed to be a "thriller". i'd say that with some reservations, however, as to say that it's a thriller it has precious few thrills.
