an ex- informant of the east germany finishes in mexico like spy of a student group in 1971 in where she falls in love with one of the activists. this is the first co-production of mexico with germany, and although it is a good picture of the ideals that marked, and continue marking (at least to the cgh), youth, as much finishes being something insipid since to the internal dilemmas that it faces dark brown (noethem) like the passion by his ideals that adela feels (campomanes), as soon as they glimpse, in the case of him, i want to suppose, by the barrier of the language; and in the case of her by its lack of experience. reason why in the end a concrete identification with any of them does not exist, which causes that what could have been films that even served as document like red dawn, finished being one more a film; although i want to clarify that in the room many of the assistants were excited in the conversation with the director, which says to me that no longer they are so young or my ideals have changed.
