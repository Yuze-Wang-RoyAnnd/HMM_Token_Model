slayer starts in the south american rain forest where captain hawk (casper van dien) & his men are attacked by a bunch of vampires, they barely manage to escape with their lives. jump forward six months later & hawk is called to see colonel weaver (lynda carter) who informs him there has been other reported sightings of vampires & that his ex-wife & her goddaughter dr. laurie williams (jennifer o'dell) has gone out there on an expedition to study beetles, worried she ask's hawk to take a squad of soldiers back to south america & officially provide back up to captain grieves (kevin grevioux) & his men while at the same time unofficially look for laurie & not get killed by the vampires who have decided to venture out of the caves & into the civilised world...<br /><br />edited, written & directed by kevin vanhook this is yet another poorly made sci-fi channel original which just isn't very good in any respect. the humourless script has nothing going for it as far as i could see, it's one of those modern vampire films which decides to pick & choose the 'traditional' vampire film lore rules it wants to use like these vampires can be killed with stakes through the heart & have fangs but at the same time can freely walk around in sunlight & they don't sleep in coffins. the film moves along at a reasonable pace but it's all very dull, bland & lifeless. the story is poor & just rather stupid, the character's are terrible, the dialogue is forgettable & there's very little here to recommend. slayer also tries to have some sort of ecological message as the head vampire claims they are only starting to kill human beings because of their systematic destruction of the rain forest where they have lived in secret for centuries, unfortunately there's no conviction there & is more like a throwaway line to fill the time than a serious statement. there isn't enough exploitation content & is a rather unsatisfying way to spend 90 minutes of your time. the makers don't even do anything with the jungle setting, hell i didn't expect predator (1987) but i hoped for a bit more than this.<br /><br />director vanhook has made several horror films all of which i have seen have been equally poor, i'm sorry but he does nothing here & turns in a throughly forgettable looking & feeling film. there's no atmosphere or tension & as for genuine scares forget about it. the gore is restrained, there are some bitten necks & a bit of spraying blood but it's nothing we haven't seen before or has much impact. there's also a huge vampire monster creature at the end but it doesn't look that impressive & it gets itself killed far too easily.<br /><br />with a supposed budget of about $2,000,000 this actually had a decent sized amount of money spent on it but it's still a rubbish film, it's reasonably well made but nothing special or memorable. the acting sucks, i'm sorry but that's the way i saw it.<br /><br />slayer is yet another poor, stupid & boring made-for-tv sci-fi channel rubbish that i simply can't recommend. not to be confused with the rather fine one time british 'video nasty' gore film the slayer (1982) which is 100 times better than this so track that down & watch that instead.
