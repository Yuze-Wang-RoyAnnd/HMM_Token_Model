a gut-ripping baby t-rex is on the loose in a small western town, prompting sheriff eric roberts and animal control agent melissa brasselle (who walks through her role in a very disinterest fashion) to get to the bottom of things. they discover that a mad scientist (corbin bernsen) is, unbeknownst to the government sponsorship, continuing on with a long-abandoned us research project called operation jurassic storm (ha!) by creating an army of dinosaurs in a secluded underground lab facility. before long, our heroes become trapped inside, the marines are called in, the power goes out and the dinos are set free to make a quick lunch of everyone they can get their claws and jaws on.<br /><br />despite an often infuriatingly inept script full of plot holes, character inconsistencies and loose ends, this direct-to-video copy of jurassic park and carnosaur is fairly digestible trash, thanks to good production values, passable fx, the occasional laugh and plenty of brainless action.<br /><br />someone pointed out that an opening scene in this film was stolen from carnosaur, but anyone used to watching roger corman productions knows he allows directors to liberally reuse clips from his early films to save both time and money.<br /><br />score: 3 out of 10
