in yet another case of misleading marketing, this film is included in a 10-movie dvd set called "women who kick butt", but even in its original cover it seems to promise shannon tweed in an action role. actually, during most of the movie tweed plays the typical whiny and prissy female character who has to be rescued by the male lead, and even when she's trained in jungle warfare she still has to be dragged around by him! there is one female rebel who is a stronger character, but she's mostly kept in the margins of the movie. the male lead is reb brown, and he does have some (unintentionally, i think) funny moments (like when he gets electrocuted). the action scenes are badly directed and poorly acted: some of the stuntmen needed a few lessons on "how to get shot and die convincingly". i suppose if you're in the right mood you can find some things in "firing line" to laugh at (at one point, we can hear tweed speaking but her lips are not moving!), but mostly i was just bored.
