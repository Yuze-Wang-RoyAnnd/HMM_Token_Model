this is slightly less sickening than the first two films, but otherwise it's business as usual: a scuzzy, sleazy and unbalanced slice of diseased cinema. charles bronson is back, blasting into action when his friend is killed by yobs terrorising the neighbourhood. crime, you see, is up 11% in the south belmont area... so what's to be done? a stronger police presence? tougher jails? harsher sentences? nope, the only solution is to send in a loose cannon like bronson to mete out bloodthirsty revenge
