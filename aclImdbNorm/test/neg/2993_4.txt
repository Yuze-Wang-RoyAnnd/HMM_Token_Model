this movie is about a depressed and emotionally constricted man has a distant relative move in with him in his apartment in istanbul. as time passes, their relationship becomes more and more strained until finally he begins yelling at his house guest--who is out of work and doesn't appear all that eager to find work. that's most of the movie in fact. the problem is that although emotionally constricted and depressed people are very withdrawn and non-communicative, they don't make for a very satisfying movie. that's because most of the time he (and his roomie) just stare into space and say nothing. i think all these flat moments could have been shortened to make a 30 minute movie--i certainly wouldn't have minded.
