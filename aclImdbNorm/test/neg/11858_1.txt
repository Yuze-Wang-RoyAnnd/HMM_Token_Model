my brother-in-law and his wife brought the movie over one night to watch on video. this should have given me the first clue that it would be horrible. it was. from the very first frame to the last this movie is terrible. it does not even quite register as a "b" movie. maybe an n or a p. one of the worst 5 movies i've ever seen. from the rubber raptor-on-a-stick to the still-breathing corpses in the car to the beyond horrible closing lines, this movie isn't worth watching if you've received it for free.<br /><br />skip this one altogether--unless you want to play mystery science theatre with your friends, it will provide good ammunition.
