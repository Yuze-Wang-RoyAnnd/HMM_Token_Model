i have never seen a movie that annoyed me that much. it is a movie about stupid people that are doing stupid and terrible things. this is not a funny movie. i must say that the plot line is awful. i did not had patience to watch it so that i only saw half of it, but it was enough for me. the characters are not very inspired. just terribly annoying. this movie is all about a goofy guy trying to hook up with his tyrannous boss's daughter. when he finally manages to talk to her, she asks him to go at that night at her home to watch her father's owl, and he thinks she had invited him to go with her at a party and to be at her home at 6 pm. he gets to be very disappointed finding out that he only has to take care of the owl and that she has a boyfriend. after her father leaves home leaving precise orders, about taking care of the house and his beloved bird, appears a secretary, a renegaded son and all sort of not funny stuff happens in the house. but he finally hooks up with his boss's daughter. trust me this movie is terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!
