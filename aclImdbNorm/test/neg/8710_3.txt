i watched this series out of curiosity,wanting to see if they could possibly and with all this modern technology,out do cecil b. demille's classic epic of 1956, starring charleton heston,yul brenner and sir cedric hardwicke. of course, i was let down. yes, they had all the biblical characters correct, but they didn't give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes, that held your interest throughout the first movie. if you going to have a mini-series, you have to have some "rivoting" scenes, the "burning bush", parting the "red sea",drowning "pharohs armies", "building sethi's pyramids", could have been done with todays' technology on the scale of blockbuster movies such as "lord of the rings" or the matrix. obviously, they didn't want to leave a lasting impression of "faith and sacrifice", which is much needed in these trouble times.
