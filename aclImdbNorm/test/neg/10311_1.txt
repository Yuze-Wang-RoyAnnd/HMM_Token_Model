the prior comments are way to generous. this movie is a waste of electricity and plastic. on the other hand, i have had a great deal of fun giving it to friends to watch and describing it beforehand as "beyond belief!" "no words can express how i feel about this" "this movie will move you" as expected, the friends took these nondescript comments as enthusiastic endorsements. they were wrong. the sadistic pleasure i had foisting this on people was well worth the $5 i paid for the movie. on the other hand, one (former) friend says i owe him 90 minutes of his life back. i particularly enjoyed the "gun's eye view" of parts of the movie. truly awesome in it's absurdity.
