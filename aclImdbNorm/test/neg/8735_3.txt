first and foremost i'd like to state - for the record - that it's incredibly dumb to call your movie "embryo" when the subject matter exclusively revolves on scientific research performed on fetuses (animal as well as human) aged 12-16 weeks. the embryonic stage is over at the end of the eighth pregnancy week and from that moment on the unborn critter enters the fetal phase. okay, in all honestly, i didn't know all this, but i took the effort of looking it up and that's the also the least thing the creators of "embryo" could have done. don't worry; i'm not just stumbling over details or being exaggeratedly bitter, as there are several more reasons to state why "embryo" is a huge failure. actual science can be considered as boring and inaccessible, and thus science fiction is a cinematic genre created especially to make the otherwise tedious, yet educational science topics more interesting and comprehensible to larger audiences. by depicting ambitious scientific experiments that go horribly wrong, or space missions that encounter evil aliens instead of light-years of void, filmmakers usually manage to entertain people with spectacular special effects and, at the same time, teach them useful little trivia about science. in order to make a good or at least halfway-decent science fiction movie, writers and directors only have to comply with one basic rule: don't be boring! if they can't fulfill this one condition, the viewer might as well read a theoretically accurate book. something must have gone wrong during the production of ralph nelson's "embryo". the basic premise is potentially fascinating and even involving, as we're all sensitive about saving the lives of unborn babies. there also were some very prominent names involved in the production, like main stars rock hudson ("giant", "seconds"), diane ladd ("chinatown", "alice doesn't live here anymore") and director nelson himself was responsible for the acclaimed classics "soldier blue" and "charly". then what went wrong? simple. the script is irredeemably boring, clich'ed and the whole thing looks incredibly foolish because the lab scenery & scientific equipment is clearly too primitive to achieve any medical breakthroughs with. <br /><br />rock hudson, in a very poor performance, plays a doctor who hasn't put any passion in his research work ever since his wife passed away. when his car hits a pregnant dog on a rainy night, his passion returns and he does everything possible to save the dying animals' fetuses. he manages to keep one fetus alive, impressively accelerates its growth process and trains it to become an extremely intelligent dog. because his procedure is so successful, dr. paul holliston convinces his friend at the hospital to repeat his tests with the human fetus taken from the womb of a pregnant teenager who committed suicide. the female subject unexpectedly keeps growing at a fast rate, however, and after only a couple of weeks she's a full-grown, ravishing and super-intelligent woman. the good doctor naturally falls in love with her, but the groundbreaking new growth treatment also begins to show horrible side effects... absolute nothing happens during the first 45 minutes of the film, apart from a lot of implausible and overly melodramatic mumbo-jumbo and one or two deeply impressive tricks performed by the dog. that second half of the film does contain a little bit of (grotesque) action and suspense, but by then the stupidity of the dialogs and the implausible plot-twists already ruined the potentially fabulous sci-fi idea. there are some really cool scenes, most notably the chess-showdown between victoria and roddy mcdowall (in a highly memorable and ultra-obnoxious supportive role). the grand finale is absurdly grotesque and literally on the verge of ridiculous, and it almost feels like ralph nelson put in that final disastrous shot because it was the general rule in contemporary thriller & sci-fi cinema. the last sequence, including the horrible freeze-frame shot at the end, certainly doesn't fit the tone of the previous 100 minutes of the film. but anyway, my sincere admiration and respect to the dog and his trainers. an animal with such intellect and talent surely deserved to demonstrate its tricks in a much better film.
