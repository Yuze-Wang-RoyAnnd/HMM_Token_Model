"the chilling" directed by deland nuse and jack a.sunseri is one of the worst zombie flicks i have ever seen.why linda blair("the exorcist","witchery")appeared in this stinker is beyond me.the plot is really dumb:the frozen bodies at a cryogenic lab are revived after lightening strikes and turned into cannibalistic zombies.the characters are completely one-dimensional and stupid,the zombies look horrible and there is no gore.avoid this cheap piece of trash like the plague.my rating:1 out of 10.
