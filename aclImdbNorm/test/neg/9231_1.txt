it is sad that some find this film worth watching. i am russian, and i am disgusted. there is nothing in this film that deserves praise, except cinematography. however, i am not one of those who find beauty in death or perversion. i think this film is poorly designed and directed. there is nothing more irritating and even enraging than shameless speculation in art (if you can call this garbage art). balabanov wanted to shock the viewers by pervasive evil, and he succeeded in creating a hopelessly dark film. but the biggest shock is balabanov's primitive directorial work. i would never advise any of my friends to watch it. huge disappointment!
