a quick resum'e: almost nonexistent, badly chosen musical soundtrack, steady-cam filming done without the steady but with lots of coffee and a hyperactive cameraman, no plot, and nothing ever really happens. the film goes from one dialog into another, sounding hollow, never achieving depth, never creating the illusion that you really are inside a cobweb of conspiracy, and the everybody-has-an-affair-with-everybody is just a boring excuse to show the main actress in nice underwear. (which, combined with her rusty voice certainly is nice, but nothing to base a movie on) the high point for me is the opening scene, and the film just degraded from there to a point where i just wanted to quit the film about 45 minutes into the story. i regret sitting it out.
