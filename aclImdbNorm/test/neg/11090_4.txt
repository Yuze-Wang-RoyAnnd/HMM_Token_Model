julie delpy stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in france of the 14th century. the film attempts to shatter the romantic chivalry image of the heroic medieval knight, by showing a rather dreary image of the period, defined by psychological dysfunction, and violence. <br /><br />the movie opens with a child, francois, growing up in the shadow of the hundred years' war, told by his father to keep his mother safe and to wait for his return. francois takes action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed. francois murders him in the name of defending his father's honour. like father like son, francois grows up, and leaves his family, also to go to the same war. this setting is somewhat of an explanation for the events to come, as on his way home, we already notice that something is wrong with francois. the war has not done well with him, he has changed.<br /><br />the daughter, b'eatrice de cortemart (delpy), awaits her beloved father, to return from captivity of the english. she is pure of heart and she was left to take care of the estate while her father was gone. in her father's absence, b'eatrice needs to deal with financial difficulties, which strengthens b'eatrice's hope that her father will return to save her. but, upon his return, she notices that he lost the will to enjoy life, and he tortures and humiliates everything around him, even his own daughter. from this points the film depicts various ways how francois torments his family. starting with humiliating his own son, and ending with the rape of his own daughter, b'eatrice.<br /><br />setting the film in the middle ages supposed to soften the blow, as the viewer may tell himself, that these kind of violent acts were held in difficult times. and indeed, many films on the topic of incest, such as tim roth's "the war zone (1999)" which are contemporary were more shocking because of that.<br /><br />delpy appears in this film in several daring nude scenes. indeed she appears to be angelic and beautiful.<br /><br />i was annoyed when i saw some animal torture scenes. i believe, and this is not confirmed, that some birds were killed for the making of this film, which really upsets me. the quality of a film drops when real violence is used towards animals. i would hope that this movie will be re-released without those cruelty scenes. those scenes do not contribute much to the film storyline.<br /><br />overall, the movie is too long. the script is problematic. we don't get to see francois and b'eatrice before the war, we don't really get the answer why is he changed to such extreme. i would have pass on this film, however, i have to mention a few scenes that made this film worth watching:<br /><br />* scenes of a young child being able to murder in cold blood is truly shocking. i saw it first time on "city of god (2002)". here, francois, murders his mother's lover, while his father away at war. excellent scene and very graphic. * the scenes from b'eatrice being raped by her father till she finds out she is pregnant from him are truly shocking and interesting. the scene after the rape, where delpy burns her cloths and cleans herself. she asks her brother to kick her in the stomach with hopes to have a miscarriage.<br /><br />* the brother humiliation scenes where the father dumps his son's head into the food - humiliating him then ranting about the war. later, dressing his son with women's cloths.<br /><br />the film won the c'esar (french oscar) for best costume design, i agree, the costumes here really make the film look authentic for the time period. the movie location is ch^ateau de puivert, a real 12th century castle and a historical monument, located in aude, south-central france. beautiful castle and mountain view, really helps you set into the period of this film. the film also nominated for 3 more c'esar awards, but they were all snatched to the widely successful french film "au revoir, les enfants" ("goodbye, children", 1998).<br /><br />--- released as "beatrice" in new york city, march 1987. only to be screened in france on november 2007. watched it on yes3 on 3 may 2007, 17:45, at work.
