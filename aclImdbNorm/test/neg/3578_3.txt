good actors, good director, well acted, well directed but...where's the movie? did they have an script or just improvised it all? at least it is a short-length movie (only 80 minutes, including credits). nothing seems to happen in this film, nothing at all. a couple of small time drug dealers caught in small time troubles, but you'll never get a clue of what's happening, nor even what are they talking about in some sequences of the movie. tons of "f***'s" and "motherf*****'s", but nothing else...<br /><br />for the people who love abel ferrara's films such as the funeral, 'r xmas is going to be a big disappointment, as it's been for me. what was he thinking about? did he really think that this was a good movie? and if he didn't, then why did he made it?
