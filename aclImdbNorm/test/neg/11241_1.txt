the first time i saw this was when i was with a date, and she thought it was an awesome movie. i didn't.<br /><br />the second time i saw this was last night on tv. it still sucks.<br /><br />as a love story this sucks. as having julia portray a street hooker, this is repulsive. to me she was a librarian with a miniskirt and heels. she had no tough shell to her. she wasn't tortured, anguished, enraged, starving or anything else. her "hooker" character was so flawed, like comparing a cubic zircon to a diamond. the two simply don't fit, no matter what they look like.<br /><br />the only cast i felt was worth watching was the 2 bitchy saleswomen, whom were excellently cast. they did such a fine job that i hated them for the few seconds that they were on screen. they had real definition, for the minor roles. ok, so the movie wasn't entirely trash...the two ignorant saleswomen saved the film.<br /><br />aside from those two women sales people, the rest of the cast...including the big names was just crap. either everybody was an ass-kisser or had absolutely no reason to fill any dialog in the movie aside from just complimenting julia roberts or kissing ass to richard gere.<br /><br />this was a movie about how when you walk around in high-heels and a tight skirt in beverly hills, people leer at you and guys who work in hotels gawk as if they just had a baseball bat struck to their face.<br /><br />while in reality, the women who are dressed to the nines in beverly hills are hookers and prostitutes to a higher degree, but since they aren't wearing the gaudy madonna looking jewelry or the patent boots, they can look down on the others who do.<br /><br />the hotel cast was sickeningly sad to watch, and anybody who had any real character had less than a minute of screen time.<br /><br />this is an insult to romantic movies, comedies, dramas and even to prostitutes who face wealthy customers on a daily basis with hopes of having their lives work out perfect.<br /><br />the story is about julia roberts being pimped (yes pimped) by a multimillionaire in a business suit and limousine.<br /><br />she is still owned, still told how to act, how to move, what to wear, what to say, where to go and what to do. he is more controlling than a street pimp, but the folks at disney/buena vista butter it up to make it easier to swallow.<br /><br />had richard gere been a black man with a gold tooth and an ak-47 at his side instead of an attach'e case, this movie would be about how a woman has to struggle to get away from the harshness of prostitution. same story, different characters will make a very different outlook.<br /><br />oh yeah, change the white man for a black man or asian or spanish, have the land business deal be changed to a deal of weapons or narcotics and the entire concept of romantic comedy is thrown away.<br /><br />as far as i'm concerned, pretty woman is still trash, dressed with ribbons and bows.<br /><br />i didn't like it 15 years ago, when i didn't understand it and was led by the hollywood hype. i hate it now that i can see past the pretty decorations that is called "love".<br /><br />this movie is not a romantic comedy. it's a story on how to control a woman as long as you have the means and income to do so.<br /><br />this is an insult to strong women, weak women and women in general, as well as to my television screen.<br /><br />do i hate it? yes. does it suck? yes would i recommend it to you? no...well maybe if i really hated you.<br /><br />will this review get posted? we'll see.<br /><br />anywayz, that's all for now.
