jack black and kyle gass play fantasy versions of themselves in this comic showcase for their side-band tenacious d, an art-rock outfit with satirical, barbed lyrics. an ex-runaway obsessed with heavy metal and a beachfront-living, pot-smoking slacker who pretends he's a rock god meet and form a band (the birthmarks on both their butt-cheeks form the group's moniker). opening with a funny prologue which apes a twisted sister video from the '80s, "the pick of destiny" is a fairly well-produced movie aimed at older kids; it occasionally resembles nothing more than a middle-aged variation of "wayne's world", with jokey-stoner interludes and a climactic bout with beelzebub himself, yet black and gass have an enormously comfortable rapport (they also acted as producers, co-wrote the script and all the music). the target audience will obviously go for it, though inspiration is a bit low, particularly in the second-half (just about the time our heroes impulsively outrun the cops in a student-driver car). the music sequences are far more successful than the attempts at movie satire and, for the first thirty minutes or so, jack black's manic enthusiasm is infectious. *1/2 from ****
