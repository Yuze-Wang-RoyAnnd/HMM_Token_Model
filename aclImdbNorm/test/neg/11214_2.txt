this review contains a spoiler---<br /><br />the movie is an american ninja mysteriously trained in the martial arts. he falls for the colonel's daughter and turns from the most hated grunt on the post to the "people's hero" at the end of the film. this film is extremely cheesy and very poorly researched. it is good for folks who do not care about plot development or reality. good for kids under 14. the military errors in this film is comical. i remember during my three years in the military, us privates were not required to salute or call nco's "sir", the film does this in various spots. the colonel's hair is way too long on the ears. the master sergent's moustache was against military protocol in length. on the post, the colonel was the only officer around. not one other officer was shown walking around the post. you had idiot ninjas brandshing swords against troops with m-16's, rather poorly made.<br /><br />folks this filmed reeked. michael dudikoff is not really that bad of an actor he just has lousy scripts. the ninjas were more hilarious than dangerous. avoid this film
