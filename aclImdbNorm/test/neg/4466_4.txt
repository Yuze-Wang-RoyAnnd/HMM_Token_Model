after seeing the previews awhile back, i looked forward to seeing steve martin in a comedy that i thought might be a keeper. unfortunately, i was wrong. problem was, the previews were the only funny parts to the movie. the rest of the movie was pretty much a bunch of junk, scenes that have been done to death and characters we've all seen a thousand times.<br /><br />this movie was proof positive that if you put enough cash on the table, you can talk anybody into anything. steve martin is a favorite of mine but this one was a big clunker. the only actor in the movie who was worth watching was eugene levy; he was the best of a mighty lame group.
