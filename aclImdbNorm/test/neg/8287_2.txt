a high school track star falls dead after winning a race; shortly after, her older sister (patch mackenzie) returns home in time to notice that all of her sister's track team members are disappearing. who could the killer be? you may not care enough to want to find out.<br /><br />crude, cheap, amateurish slasher is just about completely worthless, although top-billed christopher george (as the nasty, hard-driving track coach) tries to give it a lift with an intense performance. not even the gore is worth mentioning. the whole thing is lame from beginning to end, starting with opening the movie to a track meet montage set to disco music, and the casting of e.j. peaker, once a co-star of the movie "hello, dolly" as a character named "blondie"! that's right, "blondie". this may mean that we aren't supposed to take the movie seriously, but in any case it's a shambles.<br /><br />it's the kind of routine slasher junk that makes the "friday the 13th" movies look like works of art in comparison.<br /><br />the only point of interest may be wanting to see an early film appearance by vanna white, of all people.<br /><br />2/10
