was the cast and crew on drugs before they started filming this? there was a hole in the plot...so big...nothing could have filled it up. from the first scene when the co-star is late for dinner, was there any doubt where he was and what he had just done? the suspense was over from there. now, it was going to take another 85 minutes before the mystery was solved. i must confess that the biggest hole in the plot kept me awake for hours, wondering how dumb the screenwriter, the director, chrisian slater, molly parker, and stephen rea could be not to at least explain how our murderer, who was not a lawyer, or a policeman, could go into a locked cell at a jail, kill his second victim, and tie him up from a noose to make it look like suicide??? i kept wondering if i had fallen asleep out of sheer boredom and missed how that happened. if someone can explain it to me, please do...and then, why, for god's sake, did he kill the third victim? nothing made sense...and yet, someone thought this film was worthy to be an official selection at a film festival. perhaps it was a comedy and i failed to laugh.
