it's about jealousy, it's about racism, it's about manipulation, but the underlying message is love. geoffrey sax tried to pull off shakespeare's othello, by bringing it to modern day context. however, the actors were not convincing enough to pull this off. there were extra bodies to help put everything in to perspective, however, john othello, played by eamonn walker, over reacted a lot in this film, causing for the down fall of keeley hawes, dessie brabant, eventually ending in dessie's death. <br /><br />ben jago, played by christopher eccleston, was seen as the main character in the film. he didn't give enough evidence for dessie to be cheating on othello, with michael cass, played by richard coyle. instead he just played a friend to all and gave one reason as to why she "was" cheating. in the play, it took a lot more convincing from iago to make othello even suspect anything. this change made the movie more about rage for the wrong reasons, than what the book was based off of. however, the movie did have a few good points. it turned the army scenes into more a racist group toward blacks, where othello is the main chief of the police squad. these scenes are made believable by the raging crowds, and burning fires. you are able to sense the amount of racism in the movie, more so than you can in the book. this book plays up the modern day scenes by making it much easier to understand, than the shakespearian times it was written in. in the play iago (jago) gets tortured at the end, but in the film he gets his satisfaction, and gets othello's position. he never gets what he deserves and is never caught for telling the lie to othello until it is too late. i saw this as a downfall in the movie, because i feel that the villain is granted his treasure of the promotion out of lying, and in the book, he is found out by rodrigo. overall, the movie could have done a better job based on the play than what it did. i feel that the director of the movie left out some of the most important parts of the play that were mentioned or there to make the play flow, or make it more of a tragedy. i would say that you should read the book first, in order to understand all of the events that happened in the movie, otherwise you may find yourself lost, and confused.
