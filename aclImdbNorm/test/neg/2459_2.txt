i don't much mind the factors that others here have objected to - acting, lighting and so forth. for the most part, these things were executed well enough to carry the film and put its points across. it's just a horror film, after all.<br /><br />what bugged me were the points themselves. because this is a deeply moralistic film, and its morality is deeply tacky. in fact it's actually fundamentalist christian morality, and this is a fundamentalist christian film. look at the 'sins': <br /><br />* sutherland's character picked on a kid at school when he was a pre-teen, leading to his accidental death.<br /><br />* baldwin's character used masculine wiles, persuasion and good looks to shag quite a few women, some of whom he videotaped. ooh, the swine! how unlucky for him that women are such passive, gormless creatures that they had no complicity in the matter.<br /><br />* roberts' character's dad came back from vietnam a junkie, so ashamed to be caught shooting up that he kills himself. yes, what a terrible sin! why couldn't he have just become an alcoholic like all the others?<br /><br />* and bacon's character picked on another schoolkid. how awful! the fact that he was a child himself apparently counts for nought. children, it seems, are divinely judged by adult criteria.<br /><br />well, maybe lots of people support this level of moral absolutism. it certainly seems to have gone unremarked in this movie's comments. does everyone just buy this stuff? at least human laws treat children differently from adults, recognising that their ethical sense is partially-formed. this film has no such qualms, and i find that pretty objectionable. ditto the notion that women are helpless, fluffy creatures before young men's evil lusts. or that a vietnam vet driven to drug addiction is so shameful that suicide is a valid option. pathetic.
