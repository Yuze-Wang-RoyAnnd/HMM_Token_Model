this episode sucks.<br /><br />over the past few years i have watched all episodes of "next generation" and "voyager" and am now watching "enterprise".<br /><br />i am thoroughly enjoying this series. until this episode. i stared at the screen in horror at the destruction of character and entertainment. it is more like an attempt at slapstick.<br /><br />it does not build the characters but throws them out on a limb - and leaves the audience gasping. it does little to build the series.<br /><br />why this was ever allowed to go to air amazes me. was it the writing? was it the directing? was it the producer? we'll probably never know.<br /><br />but one bad apple isn't bad i suppose. i say that hoping it is only one.
