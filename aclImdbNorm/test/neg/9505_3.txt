this movie is very difficult to understand, why do the couple want to divorce ? no reason is given, we don't know anything about their life in lisbon, and even nothing about marie's job. we may only understand that a certain bore appeared in this life. we don't even know who took the initiative of asking the divorce.<br /><br />the way of filming is kind of special : i didn't know the director's name before the end of the movie, when i read it on the screen, i understood why it was so slow, only 42 shots in a hundred minutes (i counted them) ! it reminded me of some japanese movies i saw in the 90's, in fact we must accept that this is the expression of another culture even if the set is occidental. i don't know if this story would have suited a japanese couple.<br /><br />one can see the logic of the scenes but the result is a bore, anyway i decided to watch it to the end because i wanted to get the spirit and the meaning of it all. in fact, i only understood that the story of these two beings may not be over yet since the train leaves the station without marie. this is few for such a long time ! i can't recommend this work.
