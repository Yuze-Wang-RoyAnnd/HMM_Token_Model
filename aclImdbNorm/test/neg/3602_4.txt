what we have here the standard disney direct to dvd sequel, where i would expect cots are cut in all areas resulting in an okay animated movie that falls well short of the original. that is not to say that this is a terrible movie it is just that it is a very mediocre movie full of the preachy messages intended to show children the virtues of friendship and being nice to one another and unless done subtly (which it is not here) can quickly become grating for adults. the film has a very thin plot line with kronk trying to win the approval of his father, and ending up finding the true meaning of wealth and success. this has it's comedy moments but is really nor enough to carry a full length film.
