i wasn't able to last ten minutes on the this terrible film. in and age of dv cameras, it looks to have been shot on vhs without aid of any color correction or microphone.<br /><br />as a filmmaker myself, i know the constraints of indy film-making and, even keeping those things in mind, i'm amazed films can be made this poorly.<br /><br />the only praise i can offer is that this film got distribution as i've seen considerably better films still seeking modest domestic or international release. i'm guessing the box is what sold it...it does have good box art, but it all goes downhill from there.<br /><br />side note: it seems the director has 11 friends since no one on the this planet would give this film a "10".
