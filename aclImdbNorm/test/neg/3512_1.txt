this movie was horrid and at the end made me wonder why someone went to the trouble to make it. now it was not all bad, i have studied film and this film was put together very nicely and had very good cinematic everything with interesting angles to very nice lighting and excellent camera work. i wish i could have seen it back in school because it would have made a good film to write a paper on. but........ since i have graduated and lost most of my film pretentiousness i have realized that a film should be entertaining above all, this movie was long and boring and i'm not sure when it finally got to the point that it was worth my time.<br /><br />
