after an astronaut dies in space, he is brought back to a military base. inside the man are discovered alien embryos -- he is the host for what could be a terrible alien invasion! this film comes to us from director bernard l. kowalski, who also directed "attack of the giant leeches" (see separate review) but may be better known for his work on "columbo". executive producer was roger corman, known as the creator of much better films than this one... particularly in the 1960s.<br /><br />this movie is cheesy and poorly constructed. what comes across as interesting is the poor effects, not the actual film itself. one scene shows a close-up of the alien embryos and it's an embarrassing cartoon representation. even for 1958. and then when a full-grown alien appears... you'll wonder why he is wearing shoes. or if you're really perceptive, you'll wonder why you've seen the alien suit in other movies.<br /><br />by no means is this the worst science fiction film you'll ever see. and you almost have to give it some credit -- the alien host overtaking a military base idea predates both "the thing" and "alien" by a number of years. i don't know if these films were inspired in any way (i doubt it), but at least it was ahead of its time. beyond that, though, the film flops and is only great for heckling when drinking. i haven't seen the "mystery science theater" version, but this sure is one film worthy of their insults.
