*****spoiler or two, not that is matters******<br /><br />two things stand out about this movie. first is it's been titled both "bruno" and "the dress code," and if you've seen this movie you'll catch the irony in that.<br /><br />second is it's addressing issues completely off the wall. the adventures of a grade school cross dresser isn't something that there was a crying need for a movie about, nor a topic that i think most people would be interested in. shirley maclaine manages to walk around the issues of gender by tying bruno's desire to wear a dress to religion, which probably opens up an even thornier can of worms--what was she thinking? <br /><br />yes, there's some humor and it's not directly offensive, but the kind of unsettling feeling in the beginning just keeps on growing. it doesn't do much except repeat the liberal mantra that "different" people should be accepted (or maybe excepted?) no matter what. <br /><br />which is fine----but in order for people to live in a society everyone has to give a little to get along. bruno doesn't just want to wear a dress, he wants to show up looking like a miniature gladys knight on awards night, and his final costume makes him resemble a cabbage patch cowgirl doll. yet all the other kids dress and behave, well, like regular kids. so what gives? if it came down to it we all could declare ourselves special or different and behave any way we felt like, and the result would be total chaos. <br /><br />this accepting of people who are "different" is also pretty narrowly defined, i doubt we will ever see a movie about a kid finding his true self and wanting to wear overalls, hunt geese, and go to tractor pulls, and demanding everyone else just accept him as he is. "bruno" is one stupid movie, and a complete waste of time.
