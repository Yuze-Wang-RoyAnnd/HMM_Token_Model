solange is not a great italian thriller. get ready for the spoiler - the main suspect, the professor, didn't do it. but is it really a spoiler? no, because you know that he couldn't have been the murderer from the very beginning; he and a student witnessed the first murder. so, there is absolutely no suspense as to whether or not the professor is the killer. there is a long, tedious build up to the final explanation of the mystery. the solution is interesting, but it comes out of nowhere. the rest of the movie (and it's not a short movie) is just not exciting enough to hold your interest. even in the tradition of "wrong man accused" it fails, because the police never seriously accuse the professor, and the killer is never after him. dull, dull, dull.
