a friend of mine loves tacky horror films so i often get to see low budget stuff like this. this is, however the first time i have been compelled to write a review of one...<br /><br />put simply this is probably the worst film i have ever seen! even worse then boggy creek ii!<br /><br />the entire budget for the film seems to have been spent on a brief scene in the middle when dr. klaus stands in this chamber thing & turns all vampire-ish.<br /><br />the only good thing to say about it is that it was hilarious after a few beers (but for all the wrong reasons).
