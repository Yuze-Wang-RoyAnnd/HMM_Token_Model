everyone knows the so-called plot, so let me cut to the chase.<br /><br />forced frivolity. miscast performers working hard to have fun so you can have fun. the brilliant meryl streep gives it a great try. pierce brosnan just plain embarrassing. inexplicably set on a greek island. lots of squealing, shrieking women. lots.<br /><br />it was a silly juke box musical on stage, now it's a big, splashy, poorly shot screen juke box musical. if you like abba, so-so. if not, an assault on the senses and an insult to whatever intelligence you're left with when you exit the theater. i readily admit that i didn't really want to see this movie and went with some friends who did, but for the love of god. why does my gender shriek and squeal to convey delight? ever sit next to a table of women who have had too much to drink and are absolutely determined to have great night out on the town? that's the feeling of this whole project. it just felt so good when it stopped.
