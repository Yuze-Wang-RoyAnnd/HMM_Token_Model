i was surprised after watching this piece of crap , if you have seen an episode of tom and jerry in which jerry pours some liquid onto him and becomes invisible than you are likely to see the same cartoons with added erotic topping a man becoming invisible and doing s*i* is the conclusion of the movie. involving too much sex in a cartoon themed movie doesn't increase its worth :( , and most of all i was surprised when the same cartoon ending was used to show up the mr.invisible and that was really awful i must say , flour drops off the rack and our very own mr.invisible becomes visible "watch zack and miri make a porno" i bet you wont get bored, <br /><br />1/10 from me
