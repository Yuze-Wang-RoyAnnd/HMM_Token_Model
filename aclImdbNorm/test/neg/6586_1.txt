"the polar express " was an awful movie .what makes this movie worst is the hypocrisy to present itself as a innocent ,sugary and harmless tale for children about the "true " meaning of christmas . i never read the book of chris van allsburg in what it was inspired ,but the most disappointing is that it was directed by robert zemeckis ,the same who made the great "who framed roger rabbit?",a excellent movie where he proof that the animation could be appreciated for kids and adults equally ,while in this movie it seems that he was victim of his own ambition and he give too much importance to create impressive level of detail than a interesting story .i'm sorry to say this ,but "the polar express " have so much artistic level as a publicity campaign of a video -game or toy . everything in this movie seems to be so lifeless : the characters could look like humans ,but they don't have nothing of life on them ,and they have a malevolent touch in their eyes .<br /><br />but the worst ...is the "message" in this movie .you could see it at some parts of the movie ,and believe me ,it was vile .take for example one scene ,where one kid refuses to enter to the polar express . notice that the character that looks like tom hanks makes a gesture like saying "you are stupid to don't accept my offering " .second ,when the girl says that the toys are so "warm " and things like that . all the damn movie the kids keep talking about how big would be the gifts that santa would give to them . there is even a song about the gifts !the vagabond is a irrelevant and weak character . and ,in the last scene the character seems to "discover " the true meaning of christmas : and what would be ? what do you think ? the gifts ! many christmas movies are close to say something like it ,but "the polar express " it's a ode to the materialism and greed . seriouslly ,i refuse to call it a "children's movie " , because if is that what the kids would learn ,i don't want to think how would be our future .
