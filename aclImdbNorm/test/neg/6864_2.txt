this movie was a waste of the celluloid it was printed on. it is a disastrous scene, much like a particularly gruesome train wreck.<br /><br />watching this is like trying to explain the meaning of life. the main plot point is that the character played by steve guttenberg is a party animal who's not supposed to gamble, because that would violate his parole. the kids he befriends refuse to play with him as coach for a while, because he gambles. but... a few minutes later, after they've won the championship, a large sum of money saves their shelter. and where did they get the money? gambling!!! add this to the creepy scenes at the funeral home (why exactly are there bedrooms in a funeral home?) and the useless peripheral character
