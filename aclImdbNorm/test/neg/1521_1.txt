i had seen rik mayall in blackadder and the new statesman, so i thought i'd give this film a try.<br /><br />at around 4 pm i bought it, at around 8pm i started to watch, at around 8.15pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't. at around 8.45pm i threw the dvd into the dustbin. and that's where this "film" belongs.<br /><br />what ever happened to british humour? the humour so fine and witty, intelligent and artful that you find in yes, minister, blackadder, vicar of dibley, fawlty towers or the fast show? the black humour britain is so famous for? i don't want to insult anybody, but i presume even stupid children wouldn't find this funny. they deserve more intelligent fun. and rik mayall, you can do better, so please, do!
