schieder delivers a semi-believable part as the president of the united states with politically correct maria conchita alonzo as the female vice president. the movie just stinks. with so many plot holes its a wonder they got it to stick to the film it was shot on. relegated to late night hbo time schedules, this film is not worth seeing at all. 10 minutes into it, you are asking yourself why it was written. 40 minutes into it, you are wondering why you are watching it. save the effort and watch a re-run of hee haw or something. anything is better than this clunker.
