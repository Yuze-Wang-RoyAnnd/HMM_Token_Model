it is quite rare that a movie comes along that is so useless, that i with imdb allowed the use of negative scores. in fact, i reflect back upon this movie and i truly cannot think of a movie that had so little going for it. acting: your kidding right. direction: no. a plot: no. this movie has nothing going for it if you take it as a serious movie, this is often the case with movies of this genre, but most movies of this nature can be watch as if they are a comedy and you can laugh at how pathetic the characters and situations are and almost get your times worth. this movie is so empty, that it cannot even suit that purpose. i have to give this a -1/10, three points lower then any other movie i have ever rated. i truly feel that the staff involved in this movie should pay me for the 83 minutes i spent watching it. i do not really have the words to describe how bad this is. no one should ever watch this for any reason again.
