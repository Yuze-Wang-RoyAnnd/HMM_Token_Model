the russian space station 'avna' with a crew of four russians and two americans is threatening to re-enter the earth's atmosphere in a matter of days. russia asks for nasa's help in rescuing the stranded crew and nasa scrambles the space shuttle atlantis. the nsa also have an interest in the 'prometheus', a prototype microwave power source being tested aboard 'avna' and organise for one of their men to be placed on the mission.<br /><br />that's the plot. onto less important things. the space station and the shuttle are the same, blatantly obvious models used in 'fallout', 'memorial day' and 'dark breed' (and a handful of other films, i suspect). the model effects are so obvious throughout the entire movie and make the film look very 1960s. the sets are a little better but are far too '80s for what is supposedly a brand new station built by an american company (which later comes in as part of a conspiracy to destroy 'avna' and the 'prometheus' and claim the insurance. the script has a few good moments (including yuri's farewell and the little spiel at the end) but is otherwise fairly bland and sub-standard. the acting is okay; the only real standout performance comes from alex veadov who offers up some of the film's better dialogue. michael dudikoff is, surprisingly, one of the best parts about this film. ice-t is ice-t. 'nuff said. the film offers a few surprises, though, that i don't wish to spoil.<br /><br />certainly one of the better low-grade, contemporary-set sci-fi films of the last six years, but not the best. the film is watchable but the special effects and plot will probably put a lot of viewers off. rent the other 'stranded' sci-fi film instead.
