inappropriate. the pg rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the mpaa. whale rider gets a pg-13 but this movie gets a pg? please. parents don't be fooled, taking an elementary school child to this movie is a huge mistake. there were numerous times i found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids, but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary.<br /><br />but all that aside, the cat in the hat is still a terrible movie. the casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces. the beautiful kelly preston and the always likeable (or hateable in this case) alec baldwin are both good in their roles even though preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this. the kids are conditioned actors and it shows, especially with dakota fanning. fanning is the only human aspect of the film that kept me watching and not throwing things at the screen.<br /><br />did i mention there was an oversized talking cat in this movie? mike myers is absolutely deplorable. i didn't like him as the voice of shrek, and i truly believe now that myers should not be allowed near the realm of children's films ever again. his portrayal of the cat is a slightly toned down version of fat bastard and austin powers.<br /><br />in the end, the cat should not have come, he should have stayed away, but he came, even if just for a day, he ruined 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and strife.<br /><br />the cat in the hat may be the worst kids movie ever.
