very disappointing and incoherent - every now and then a germ of an idea would develop and be discarded in the next line - it had the feel of a film that had been cut and re-cut to try and make it work - i was bored and distracted all the way through, and i'm speaking as a huge fan of the series. many of the jokes were unoriginal and tired, the medieval section went on far too long and the quality of acting was very poor - some on the tiny guest spots, like simon peg and liam cunningham did more in their alloted 30 secs than the main cast did in 90 min's.<br /><br />it's a shame, really.<br /><br />the only really interesting thing was getting a look inside the little shed on soho square - which is something everyone who is ever in that part of london wonders about.
