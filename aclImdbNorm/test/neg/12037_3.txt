some movies you watch and you say, "well, that made no sense." and you don't really mean it. you're just saying things were overly complicated or slightly nonsensical.<br /><br />"bread and circus" makes no sense at all. and i mean it. and that's not because it's surreal. from the start, it's pretty clear it's a feeble excuse to do splatter special effects. there's no script. there's no plot. there's no story of any kind. one event does not lead to the next -- that's how fundamental the bad writing is here.<br /><br />so what? i mean, there are tons of movies out there that fall into that category. they want to show you gore, they give you gore. why even talk about it?<br /><br />because, in this case, "bread and circus" gave me hope. okay, there are some surreal elements. vaginas, in the ground -- people crawling out of them. the earth, in space, two legs on either side. these sorts of images are wonderful, fun, odd, crazy. but the movie doesn't do anything with them.<br /><br />stuff happens, the movie ends, and it's all very unsatisfying. i suspect the script was made up on the fly. too bad. if there had been a story of any kind at all, it would have made for a much more entertaining film.<br /><br />the film is very much like the beautiful car you would love to own. then you lift up the hood and there's no engine. just a small man peddling a bicycle.<br /><br />grr!
