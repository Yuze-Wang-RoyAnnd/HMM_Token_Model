after his success with a nightmare on elm street in 1984, director wes craven for some reason decided that his next project would be this tv movie. i'm not a big fan of this director on the whole; early exploitation flick the last house on the left as well as his modern slasher scream sit well with me, but the rest of his work is very hit and miss and i'd hesitate to call him the master that others have labelled him as. the main theme here is cryogenic freezing, although it's more a springboard for the plot rather than an important part of the movie. the main influence here is obviously the excellent 1974 zombie film deathdream and we focus on miles creighton; a businessman cryogenically frozen for ten years before an accident that means he has to be thawed out immediately. miles is a part of a project for people that are ill; they pay to be frozen in the hope that they will be revived in the future when their illnesses can cured. miles is successfully revived and it's seen as a miracle...but the person that wakes up is not the person who was frozen, as miles returns without a soul.<br /><br />this film could actually have been quite decent judging by the idea behind it, but instead we're given a plot that doesn't really have a lot to it and it has to be said that craven doesn't make the best out of the potential of the film. the 'soul' is the main focal point, but it would seem that not having a soul and simply having a murderous intent/no compassion are the same thing, which feels a bit unimaginative. the film was made for television so it's not particularly nasty and it's obvious that not a lot of money was spent on it as the whole production feels very cheap. michael beck never became a very popular actor and that isn't surprising judging by his performance here; while he is passable, he largely lacks charisma and is not formidable in the central role. the plot doesn't flow too badly but there's a real lack of suspense and/or tension and things slow down too much too often, which results in the film being rather boring on occasion. it all boils down to a predictable ending also. overall, i have to admit that i was not impressed at all by this film and as far as craven's filmography goes, chiller would have to go down with shocker, the scream sequels and the hills have eyes ii as a miss.
