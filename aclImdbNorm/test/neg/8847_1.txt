i never fell asleep during a movie. never. this movie did the impossible.<br /><br />while many people claim the superiority of japanese horror films over their american counterparts, this movie was a lesson in over abundance. as in, the movie was 30 minutes too long. it would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work, but instead, all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow movement. the acting was absolutely terrible, bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to ad-lib something called a script. did these people even get any direction? were they coaxed to be boring and dull? either therory wouldn't surprise me.<br /><br />what was even worse was the rather unscary make-up involved with the creatures from the other side. either way, they all stunk. don't watch this film. that's all i can say (unless you're an insomniac).
