me and a buddy rented this movie the other day. at first look, it seemed to be another teen movie, which was also what we hoped for, being fans of simple horror and comedy.<br /><br />it seems that the movie is designed to disappoint the viewer as much as possible. it quickly accelerates into something that holds a lot of potential. unfortunately it never quite leaves the ground. we had watched it for something that seemed like 1 hour, when i finally, half-sleeping, managed to say :"dude, this movie sucks" it was only 35 minutes actually... dude agreed.<br /><br />the problem is: the movie is simply not funny. it was undoubtedly supposed to be funny, but it failed. it failed in a way that made me sad. it kind of reminds me of myself. i had the potential to be anything i wanted, and instead i ended up watching cheap horror/funny movies all the time. i pity the makers of this movie from the bottom of my heart. its so sad. all that potential.. and nothing.
