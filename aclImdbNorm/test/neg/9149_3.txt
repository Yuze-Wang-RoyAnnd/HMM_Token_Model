like the beauty of the jungle, jessica alba's gorgeous smile and sultry looks loom over the film, but alas they are the only two things worth watching this film for. when in theory we should be watching for the narrative.<br /><br />the plot is thin on the ground, and hard to believe. as beautiful as jessica alba is, she doesn't add any of the spark that she injected into the credible 'dark angel' series. since dark angel it seems that alba has been reduced to mere eye candy(but what eye candy!), and is the sole reason for putting her into films.<br /><br />the concept of the sleeping dictionary is daft and implausible, with little character development (or character for that matter) to make us want to undertake the 109 minutes run time with this world. despite the films short running time, it still manages to feel to long and too laboured.<br /><br />it seems a shame that such talent such as brenda blethyn, emily mortimer, bob hoskins are wasted on a threadbare narrative which barely raises a pulse. this film seriously misses a trick, an exotic setting, a more than capable cast, with lovely cinematography, and a chance to utilise the themes and the dualistic concepts of 'civilisation'. but there is little narrative to speak of, no drama, no sense we are watching a story of love, more a story of lust and woman happy to please men without question. lets be honest, if jessica alba was freely allowing you to sleep with her, do you seriously think you'd be able to concentrate on learning a tribal language? therein lies the great problem, both in suspension of disbelief, and also what the female characters are limited and reduced to. take for example the fact that jessica alba's character undergoes the mental and physical tribulation of pregnancy and birth to her forbidden love, yet all we see is her looking lovely and curvy one minute, then lovely and curvy, with a baby, the next.<br /><br />it's a sorry state of affairs to see a film with promise not live up to anything near it's potential. i could write endlessly of the films flaws, but it pains me to do so. the film looks good, the premise could have been made into a lovely film, but sadly it wasn't to be.
