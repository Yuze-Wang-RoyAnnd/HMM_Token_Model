since i'd bought the dvd, i watched as much of this as i did out of a sense of obligation to my wallet.<br /><br />the plot has kirk douglas as a successful first novelist who hired laraine day as a secretary, falls in love, and marries her. complications ensue.<br /><br />douglas is usually thought of as an intense actor, given to heavily dramatic roles, sometimes hero, sometimes rat. he's not bad in this thoroughly comic part. the problem is that the part isn't particularly comic and neither is anything else.<br /><br />the plot rambles on. a dozen "quirky" characters come and go -- most prominently keenan wynn as douglas's friend who does nothing but make wry comments. thelma ritter was better at this sort of thing.<br /><br />well, if the plot is weak it could still have been rescued by some sparkle in the dialog but there is none to speak of. some gags are silly. others don't clear that bar. here's what i thought of as an amusing line. douglas has just hired day and wants to get her down to the beach house and seduce her. day is disturbed and remarks that she's never heard of a writer working in a beach house. wynn asks if she liked douglas's previous book, "last year's love." yes, of course she did. "well, most of 'last year's love' was done in the beach house." ha ha.<br /><br />nice cast, including support, but a failed comedy. there have been better sitcoms on television.
