i will never, ever forget watching this show around the age of 13. even at the young age i remember thinking, "this is a baywatch rip off show without the one thing that makes baywatch tolerable. the girls in bathing suits." nonetheless i was too small in those days to be the holder of the remote in my house. the high point of pacific blue was an episode in which a couple of thugged out gangsters are coming to whack someone with submachine guns ... on bikes!!! as a thirteen year old i never laughed so hard at something that was supposed to be taken seriously. even i knew that the task of going out and acquiring uzis (for murder) is a task that should never come before borrowing someones car for the day. that had been the defining moment of this show. simple crimes and situations tailor made by hack writing so they could be taken care of by the unsung hero of the crime fighting world the bike cop. does not get much dumber.
