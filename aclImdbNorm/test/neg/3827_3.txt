this turned out all right and looks interesting. however, as it goes on the attempts at creating emotions between the characters is so inept that it really turns the horror off and is an insult to serious viewers. the story this is based on "i walked with a zombie" is probably much better although unfortunately i haven't seen it yet. "ritual" looks so exciting and could have been a great movie about zombies and voodoo but in reality it has turned out very poorly which is a shame. it's hard to say what is wrong with it. i guess there are just too many inept scenes and it is hard to believe, for example, in the lovestory between alice (who is called alice dodgson like the girl who supposedly inspired lewis carrol to call his heroine alice) and the younger brother. absolutely nothing has been built up between them and then in the end they get married. anyway, this looks great, and it was worth a look - but the movie is just so poorly performed. 3/10.
