ugh. this movie has so many unbelievable plot contrivances that they made what could have been a good movie into a hideous mess. the story is halfway decent, but the holes in the plot make the execution literally laughable. we're actually supposed to believe that the secret service would go against all common sense and allow the president of the united states to be put at unbelievable risk. if this is an indication of the kind of thinking that passes for good judgment among the president's protectors, then we're all in trouble. roy scheider turns in a good performance as the president, but it is unfortunately offset by the truly loathsome acting of patrick muldoon (who somehow continues to get jobs in hollywood based solely upon his good looks and his uncanny knack of smirking at every opportunity, regardless of whether the script calls for a smirk). perhaps someone will see this and be inspired to make a good movie from the premise--or, perhaps someone will see it and say, "hey, if they can get a movie this bad made, maybe i can, too!"
