-so the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground. his super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life. one day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life. unfortunately for him, the god loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story. if that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up <br /><br />-this movie is terrible. there's really no other way for me to say it and i just can't stretch it enough. the only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played jamie kennedy's wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching. i know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash. why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap. the original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling. this one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable bo gross i'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer.<br /><br />-the cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the sugary colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up. if there was music, i didn't pay attention to it because i had already punctured my eardrums to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog. then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays. you could watch an infomercial and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but i can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f**king take. if new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out <br /><br />-bottom line if you're a sadomasochistic and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
