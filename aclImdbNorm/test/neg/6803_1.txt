what were they thinking when they made this truly terrible film? <br /><br />arbus, one of the most important photographers and women of the twentieth century, had a fascinating and dramatic life. what possessed anyone to make this film, which explains her unique artistic vision, as being the result of an (imaginary) affair with a grotesque, yet charismatic hairy freak (played by downey)?<br /><br />in real life, arbus broke out of a traditional marriage and woman's role to express herself. in this movie, arbus is an ultra-dreary nicole kidman whose inspiration is all attributed to a "beauty and the beast" devotion to an interesting man.<br /><br />for this reinvention, the film is truly shameful. independent of that, it is also just dopey and dull.
