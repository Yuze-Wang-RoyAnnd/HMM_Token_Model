i just caught "wild rebels" on one of the "mystery science theatre 3000" archive compilations, and this movie was so bad even the mst3k crew couldn't make it entertaining. there are some mst3k "targets" that were films whose concepts were so dippy they couldn't possibly have been good movies (like "the green slime"), and others whose basic premises could have been made into genuinely entertaining films if their filmmakers hadn't bobbled them in the execution. "wild rebels" is a film whose basic premise did make a good movie three years earlier, when don siegel directed his remake of "the killers" at universal. both films are about a failed racing driver who's seduced by a femme fatale into driving the getaway car in a robbery masterminded by the woman's boyfriend -- only in "the killers" the driver was john cassavetes, the woman was angie dickinson and the criminal mastermind (cast wildly but successfully against type in what turned out to be his final film) was ronald reagan. steve alaimo, bobbie byers and willie pastrano are quite a comedown! but what really makes "wild rebels" an awful movie is the direction by william gref'e (note the accent over the final "e," present in his on-screen credit), which has absolutely no sense of pace whatsoever and seems to let every shot run at least half again as long as it needs to to make its dramatic point. it's only a pity that someone didn't do a mocking commentary on this movie now (in 2009); the comparison between steve alaimo's hairdo and rod blagojevich's would have been irresistible!
