this son of a son of a sequel was terrible to say the least. you would think that production would be better 10 years after the original was released, however retro puppet master was not directed by or written by the original writers and contained poor story, lack of any emmontional connection to any characters, and dragged out slowly scene to scene. no build up of strong plot, very weak climax, you will find yourself slowly getting antsy throughout the movie, if you can sit through the whole reel. i never could understand why a horror movie continues making sequels after the release of their "final chapter." i hardly suggest watching this flick, but if you must i wouldn't recommend making anyone else sit through it with you.
