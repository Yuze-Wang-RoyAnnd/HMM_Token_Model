too bad mike meyers picked this for his dramatic debut. this film looks like it was put together by a committee that couldn't decide if it was a comedy, drama, suspense, or sci-fi. it starts out sort of playful, then quickly gets darker, and then at the end, apparently shortly after one of the main characters has been killed, the whole family is standing in the backyard laughing about something. it's totally weird and impossible to string together. the acting is extremely uneven, with the older professionals engaging your attention, and then the younger and less experienced actors looking like they are in a high school play. this movie showed me that it's probably harder to make a good movie than is evident from the truly professional fare we see in the first-run and art houses. this would be a good film for a film class to analyze. plot, character, theme, consistency - they are all either faulty or missing from this film.
