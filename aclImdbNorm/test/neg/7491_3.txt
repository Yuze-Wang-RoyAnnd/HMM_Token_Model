the c class cast and poorly transitioned scenes, complete with terrible acting have led me too believe this would make a good tv only release such as the fx presentation of a smallpox outbreak. at my local blockbuster however, about 9 copies are held on the shelves, none of which were checked out when i rented the title (i wonder why....) anyway, this title was almost ridiculous in the "fear factor" the director was going for. the whole "death count" on the bottom of the screen completely contradicted the plot at times, such as when the chopper was going over angola, and the toll was speeding at a breakneck pace from 23 million to 24. however, as the movie ends, (possibly several hours or even a day or so after the chopper has landed) the death toll counter is reset back too what it was at the moment the chopper was approaching the area. the movies end left a huge whole in th entire plot, and god knows nobody is waiting for the sequel. anyway, do not rent this, i only advise watching this if you have obtained the title with no monetary loss, and you are in the mood for a cheesy suspense movie.
