wretched. talk about botched. beyond the poseidon adventure is bad in every respect. salvagers michael caine and karl malden decide to tow the wreck of the eponymous ocean liner with a really creaky tug boat. they're challenged by ruthless telly savalas and his gang of machine-gun toting goons. this part sequel, part remake has caine, malden and another group of poseidon survivors making a similarly dangerous trek out of the sinking ship. among this group are shirley jones, slim pickens, peter boyle, shirley knight and slim pickens. jack warden plays a blind man. surely, you'll wish you were blind after seeing this mess. sally field is particularly annoying as a stowaway on board caine's tug.<br /><br />disaster master irwin allen not only produced this one, he decided to direct it as well.
