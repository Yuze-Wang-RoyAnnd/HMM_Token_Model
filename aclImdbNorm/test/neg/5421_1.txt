oh boy! i really trashed manhunt in space. i think this flopper deservedly rates worse than manhunt. it goes nowhere and fungi growth was more exciting than this tripe.<br /><br />poor cleolanta. she's so misunderstood. smug rocky struts around and thankfully, there's no mention from winky about his "gay nightlife". there's a lot more talking, a really awful (to watch) space marriage on the rocks, and crappy space effects cut-outs. then, there's bobby. you decide who's more annoying: bobby or the winkster? personally, i'd jettison them out of an airlock into a black hole not before first subjecting them to killer flesh eating alien mutants.<br /><br />at least there's vena. she's just a cosmic girl!
