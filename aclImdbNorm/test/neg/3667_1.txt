<br /><br />in japan and elsewhere in europe new technology is enabling filmmakers to bypass the closed shop of the hollywood mainstream and avoid ed wood like visible low budget production values to produce compelling films. what a shame that in the uk we can find examples such as 'avatar' (name of many a video game) where brain dead attempts are made to imitate so many films - and console games beloved of girlfriendless teens - that themselves are cheap photocopies of clich'es abound like testosterone fuelled kangaroos. check out a bit of the synopsis:<br /><br />"set in futuristic london, 2024, it tells the story of a team of virtual reality virus exterminators faced against the ultimate internet virus."<br /><br />go back and read that quote again - avoid guffawing - and try to find a single original idea in it. this should have seemed a tired, sad concept in 1993, never mind 2003. ah, but there is more - the 'ultimate virus' has already caused planes to crash, infected the air traffic control centre, etc. it has been developed by a 'child genius' and manifests itself as a scantily clad, athletic, mammary jiggling discount lara croft imitator who does a great line in snarling and cod martial arts moves straight out of the playground - the living product of adolescent fantasy. oh, and she is accompanied by 'predator' like sound effects to emphasise her remarkable powers.<br /><br />the whole thing has a 'futuristic' vision of stunning originality - the lloyds building filtered with aftereffects to look somewhat green. the budget does really show - which in this day and age should not. on the whole, a pointless mess of cheese, ham and clich'e that roger corman would have left on the cutting room floor in his most shameless, desperate moments. shame that such an alleged labour of love delivered nine minutes of wasted celluloid.<br /><br />
