without a doubt this is the worse comicbook movie every made. period!! yes, it's worse then dolph lundgren's (1989) punisher. yup.. worse then the 1979 & 1991 captain america movies. oh yeah, it's even worse then christopher reed scripted superman iv: quest for peace movie. sheeshh.. that movie was so bad that the guy who played nuclear man only starred in one other film and it was only on t.v. =op<br /><br />this movie is "d" quality. i had a chance to watch it on the scifi channel back in 1997. i had heard it was pretty bad, but had nothing else to do that night so i figured i check it out. what a waste of an hour and a half. i would have been better off watching reruns of different strokes. besides having the lamest special effects and worse acting i've ever seen, the whole script was just awful and not well directed at all. thankfully a new fantastic four movie is being done and hopefully this version will do the heroes justice. i was hoping for a new spawn movie in the future, but it has yet to materialize. <br /><br />do not rent this movie. if you happen to see it being televised on cable, check it out. be warned though, you'll most like be flipping the channel after the first 15 mins.
