why???? what a disgusting joke of a supposed movie...from the poster it looked like a cute movie.. what a disappointment.. who the heck is the male lead? he looks like an old retarded retired reject cop... i am a cop and i can tell.. the man can't act... go back to being a cop..no screen presence.. why did they show his bare ass so, as if he is mel gibson,, hell no... put the filmmaker out of business.. this guy has no business making a movie... i seriously doubt women or gay men find him attractive... whoever cast the film is a no talent hack who cast no talent hacks in the lead.. it's great that us white guys are alway getting the asian women but why an ugly white guy why not dean cain or brad pitt as the white boyfriend.. why to asian women like ugly white guys or black guys in what i see??? don't get it.. must be low self esteem..<br /><br />the only hot girl who can act in the movie was the kate holliday..why was there one hot white chick among all the rest of the ugly asian chicks who think they are hot and can act???<br /><br />only two actors in this movie the host of the poetry at the end of the movie and the one hot white chick in the massage house.. tl young and kate holliday should have been the leads in the movie..<br /><br />the asia character was ridiculous looked like she was trying too hard to be some kind of ghetto/sexy black girl...key word here is "trying"..<br /><br />gina.. you can't act and you are not hot enough physically for this kind of role.. you need to play character roles and be more humble in your self presentation..<br /><br />i think the actress is gina hirazumi... i looked her up on the imdb and she is a great asian actress???? if that is the case i don't want to see what the bad asian american actresses are..<br /><br />. no wonder hollywood doesn't have asian american actors!!! if this is the best they got!!! they were supposedly winning some kind of asian film award?? give me break...it looked like they just made a movie for the sake of putting a bunch of asian girls in them.. they aren't even hot..gina...you are not hot.. stop trying..play character roles and improve your acting..you are not a leading female type...<br /><br />if this movies makes money pigs can fly..sorry for being so blunt but i feel that these actors/ actresses need to either get better or work on their craft: for the exception of the two actors i mentioned who should have played the leads.. i say this in love for all the asian lead girls in the film please do what your parents say and go and be doctors/lawyers/and engineers...and do acting on the side for fun..hopefully that is what you are doing now.. i am not trying to be mean but hoping this will be read and push you people to either get better or go do another business.. there was not even a message ethically in this movie..<br /><br />i would not be surprised if "soap girls" was secretly funded by members of the ku klux klan special department of asian american hate propaganda of the klan<br /><br />.. otherwise asian people must hate themselves..seeing this film makes me as the viewer grateful that i am not asian..you folks are pathetic..have some self respect you asian people.
