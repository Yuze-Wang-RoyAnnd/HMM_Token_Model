last night, i got bored and decided to watch a movie called 'out kold' which i had once bought with a whole lot of other cheap movies from a videostore. seemed like a good old action movie, so i took out the chips and coke and was ready for a relaxing evening. well, the pain started right from the beginning. the main character is a boxer who is the nicest guy i have ever seen. as the good person he has to be nice of course, but he is just a pussy! that totally doesn't fit with a boxer that has 28 ko's and starts working for a pimp to earn some extra money. even nice guys can still be cool. well, then came his first fight while he was working for this pimp. every punch was clearly missed and that became even more annoying because the sound effect weren't synchronised with the punches. then there is this totally worthless acting of the whole cast, and you have enough reasons to leave this movie for what it is. i gave it a 1 because i have never seen such a bad movie.
