i watched this movie so that you don't have to! i have great respect for kris kristofferson, but what was he thinking? he did this for scale? <br /><br />at least the film's title practices truth in advertising, since people and objects routinely disappear throughout the film, adding to the confusion. kristofferson mentions this in his commentary that even he wasn't sure if genevieve bujold's character really existed. this does not bode well for the viewer being able to follow the story!<br /><br />the "making of" feature was far more interesting than the movie itself. it explores the difficulty cobbling together funding for an indie, even as the film is being shot.<br /><br />to it's credit, this movie is visually pleasing and doesn't in any way look like a movie made with just slightly over 1m. too bad the money wasn't spent on a better project.
