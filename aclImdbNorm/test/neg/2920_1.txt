me and my friend read the summery and watched the trailer and were very interested and excited to go rent this movie. bad idea. we thought a movie with actors that influential would have been a sure hit, but our expectations fell extremely short. first of all, the trailer and summery are misleading to the point of lies. the movie started out slow for the first 1 1/2 hours(reminder, its about two hours long) and when it finally started to gain momentum, it sucked. plus, the plots were very hard to follow. it confused us because it kept skipping from one story to another in random order. the characters where not very realistic when it came to reality. sure the mum and son could be actual people in reality, but everyone else seemed to be one extreme or the other. if your a person who likes sick, twisted, unusual movies, then go for it. but we advise not wasting two hours of you life you cant get back. unfortunitly, no one told us that...
