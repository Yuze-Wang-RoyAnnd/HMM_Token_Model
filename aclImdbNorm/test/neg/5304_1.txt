ok i was bought this a few xmas' ago by my brother in law, who took me to see "get shorty" in the cinema, which the both of use were "uber" impressed with. and watched both get shorty and be cool one after another. i have read reviews of people that had not seen get shorty and thought this film was quite good.... i just think its another way for film companies to cheat the paying customer. all i have to say about this film is wtf? after nearly 10 years and chili palmer had become a pussy.... the script was basically the same, they teamed up travolta and thurman after their success of plup fiction, threw in a couple of big stars(plus a shed load of nobodies) and thought that it was going to be good..... vince vaughn's character was just annoying, despite me being a fan of both him and the rock both of the actors were way under utilised and unrealistic. basically i am glad that this was bought for me as a present as if i had paid money for it i would have been super annoyed.
