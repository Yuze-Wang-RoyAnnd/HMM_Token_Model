this movie has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that perrugorria have done. <br /><br />it looks like a commercial from beginning to end. the "director"spent the whole time on a tripod, it doesn't have pace, rhythm. it's illogical. what a mess. you can tell what's gonna happen since the first 15 minutes, and the ending...wow<br /><br />------spoiler-------<br /><br />jesus christ, how the hell perrugorria got shot? are you serious? worst scene of someone getting shot ever!<br /><br />------end of spoiler-----<br /><br />bad directing, bad script, bad acting...really bad overall. i wouldn't recommend this movie at all. it's a waste of money and time.
