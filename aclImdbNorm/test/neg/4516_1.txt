this is truly abysmal. i just got a copy of "disco beaver from outer space" after hearing good things about it, and i have to say, this was just so incredibly unfunny and bad, it will leave you numb and mystified how this ever got made.<br /><br />i mean, what was it? is it that this is typical late 70's humor? i don't think so. this is just so bad, and believe me, i don't mean "so bad it's good" either. this is a collection of extremely unfunny skits as if you are watching cable tv. sure enough, this was an hbo program, and to think this may have been considered groundbreaking is scary.<br /><br />there is one somewhat pretty girl in it, and there is some old nhl footage of the ny islanders hockey team, which is fun to see even though i am a lifelong ny rangers fan. but they even mess that up, as they try to get some humor out of two hockey players scuffling on the ice as if they are "dancing" and, even worse, reverse the videotape of two hockey players fighting to make it look like they are having sex. oh, how funny! in one slight bit of cleverness, there is an interview a hockey player named "chico" who resembles ny islander goalie chico resch, but they even blow this by having him wear a rangers jersey! well, maybe that was intentional, who knows.<br /><br />the bottom line is, "disco beaver" is just so blatantly horrible, so unbelievably bad, you will definitely feel cheated after watching this and wasting almost an hour of your life. you'll wonder what possibly made the makers of this garbage think they had something funny here, and you'll also wonder why these skits can't even come close to the worst saturday night night slop. incredible. just incredible.
