have just seen this film for the first time after purchasing it on dvd<br /><br />it comes across as a cheap attempt to cash in on the two conan movies.<br /><br />unfortunately, this film didn't appear to have the same budget as the conan films and hence some of the sets and effects aren't as flash and some scenes seem hurried. <br /><br />nielsen is ok to look at but unfortunately she couldn't act if a gun was put to her head. <br /><br />arnie's supporting role looked like it was done as a favor to director fleischer, who also directed conan the destroyer. maybe arnie wasn't confident that he would go on to headline films like predator, total recall, t2, etc.<br /><br />some of the female guardians of the talisman early in the film looked like they were struggling to lift their swords and the looks on their faces suggested they were having great fun making this film. i couldn't be so jovial if i was fighting for my life.<br /><br />all this aside, this film required very little concentration to watch and was mildly entertaining. i've seen a lot worse. two stars.
