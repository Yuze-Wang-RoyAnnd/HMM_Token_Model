this movie is of interest to the fans of the famous rock group "the band" in that singer/ keyboardist richard manuel appears in several scenes. it looks to me like the movie might have been shot some years before 75, judging by richard's looks. interestingly, jones would later act with the band's levon in a considerably better film "coal miner's daughter." anyway, you really need a special reason to outlast this tough to watch art film. alas, the famously sensitive manuel would commit suicide. i've never heard how he ended up in a movie. four of the five members of the band would appear in another bad film "man outside."
