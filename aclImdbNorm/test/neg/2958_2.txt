the film begins with ingrid bergman and her two freaky servants arriving in new orleans from paris. apparently years earlier, her mother was involved in a scandal and ingrid returned in an effort to irritate kin who would have sooner forgotten she or her mother existed. that's because she reasons if they are shocked enough, they'll pay her off to get rid of her. then, with this money, she will leave new orleans and seek out a millionaire somewhere else, as she poses as a countess. along the way, gary cooper shows up and looks totally out of place as a love interest.<br /><br />it's amazing that this film wasn't the reason that ingrid bergman's film career plummeted--her performance and character were that bad! instead of the classy and demure female she usually played in films, she is probably one of the most annoying characters in film. her fake contessa was shallow, demanding, unpredictable and stupefyingly dumb. how she was able to vamp any man seemed a mystery, as she seemed less vampish than just plain nuts!! i am not exaggerating to say that she behaved, at times, like someone with a combination of a severe mental illness and a personality disorder, and all these together make me think "who in the world would fall in love with this mess?!". frankly, i couldn't stand watching her histrionics and narcissistic behavior and she looked more like a guest on "the jerry springer show" than a leading lady! confusing, awful and overacted are words that come to mind when i think about her role.<br /><br />the rest of the cast is, frankly, overwhelmed by bergman's ranting and hysterics. while gary cooper is generally an excellent leading man, he is dominated by her and just looks lost. and, oddly, they cast two total weirdos as her entourage--flora robson and jerry austin. ms. robson is best known for her portrayals of queen elizabeth i, but here, for some odd reason, they coated her in makeup and the end result looked much like the love child of a cigar store indian and aunt jemima! her face was very wooden, she sported odd eyebrows and she dressed like a slave. as for mr. austin, he was a dwarf and while this shouldn't be held against him, his role was written like he was a court jester--a very, very thankless role for someone who is "vertically challenged"! overall, the rotten acting, writing and limp direction make this one of the big stinkers of the age--nearly as pointless and dull as such famous turkeys as parnell and swing your lady.
