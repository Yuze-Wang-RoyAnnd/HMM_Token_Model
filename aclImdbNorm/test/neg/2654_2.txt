i clerk in a video store, so i try to see the movies we're about to put out each week. i don't have a problem with this; in fact, i sort of feel it's a privilege. not so with this film . . . after an hour and a half of our hero whining and growling his way through scene after scene, i was truly wondering if they planned to get to the point. i felt like i should be getting paid for watching this at home, in my free time. and if i'd known there was another hour to be endured, i might have given up right then. i didn't care about the characters, the filming was unremarkable, and ford made kissing look like a chore. even the score was incongruous and jarring. what a waste.
