this film did entertain me with lots of laughs at the actors who kept the film moving along in all types of crazy directions. if you like suggestive language and sexy looking gals they were all in the picture and gals and guys all looking burned out before they even graduate from high school. there is one scene where the teenagers drive their car into a very fake deer and then proceed to throw it out into a lake or ocean, which is repeated over and over again. there is no horror to this film except the word horrible for the entire picture and arnold who plays a plastic cop is really one sick character. please don't waste your time viewing this film.
