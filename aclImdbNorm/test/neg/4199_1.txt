no. just no. that's all that needs to be said.<br /><br />summary: a random guy is in a cornfield. for some reason, i'm not sure, but it's his duty to run around inside. the next great thriller?<br /><br />a five year old could make a better movie just filming an anthill, or even just grass growing. seriously.....<br /><br />you can't say it has bad acting, because there is no acting. you can't say it has bad writing, because it has no writing. you can't say it has bad cinematography, because there is no cinematography. you can't say it's a bad movie, because there is no movie! if you don't believe me, go watch it. just don't say i never warned you.....
