big (and we mean plus sized big) baddie sebastian cabot is trying to run salt of the earth farmers off their land in order to get the oil rights. when sea faring sterling haden's pop is killed, how will haden put an end to terror in a texas town, armed only with a harpoon? <br /><br />first off, this isn't a b-western. there are no singing cowboys, no daredevil stunts, no interesting action sequences. it's just an independent movie -- you know, the ones that use unimportant actors to say "important things" and cover the general low budget vapidity of the goings on with interesting camera angles.<br /><br />second, this movie, to avoid compromises (one expects) that would cause the elimination of trumbo's important statements about justice in america, and the rather sick relationship between the chief henchman and his girl, is really low budget. the main problem that causes is that the acting is really, really bad. sterling haden is decent enough in tough roles, but he is the last guy you want playing a sensitive swedish sailor gone to find his fortune in the west. sebastian cabot tries to do a sydney greenstreet as (very) bloated plutocrat. it's not a bad idea, but cabot does not have the acting chops for it. the guy who plays the hired gun with the missing arm and soul (johnny crale) has the best role in the film. he does nothing with it.<br /><br />third, the script really isn't all that. trumbo gets some digs in about the immigrant isn't going to get a fair shake from the sheriff in a corrupt town, and the people, when up against real oppression tend to back down. this is a pretty stale movie message by 1958 -- high noon, bad day at black rock, devil's doorway -- are all westerns that deal with the evils of western society with an eye to the evils of 50s america. trumbo, in '59, certainly had every personal reason to agree with those sentiments, but he isn't doing anything new or interesting with them.<br /><br />so, given all the negatives, why does this movie get a 4? mostly because there are interesting quirks throughout the movie. (the relationship between crale and his girl is, um fascinating.) and trumbo, while a mediocre writer when pursuing his political affectations, is very good in creating both interesting characters and intelligent interactions between them. just when one is ready to pass out from indy movie boredom, will come an exchange of dialog or simple quirkiness that gets one realize that guy writing the script was not simply a hack.<br /><br />if you don't like trumbo or westerns, give this one a miss. otherwise, try it. you might like it more than i did.
