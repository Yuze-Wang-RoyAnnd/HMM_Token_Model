this movie came as a huge disappointment. the anime series ended with a relatively stupid plot twist and the rushed introduction of a pretty lame villain, but i expected shamballa to tie up all the loose ends. unfortunately, it didn't. it added more plot holes than it resolved, and confused more than it clarified. the animation and voice acting were great, but with an idiotic plot, dull setting (most of the movie doesn't even take place in dull wwii earth rather than the alchemy world), and disappointing ending (ed is useless for the rest of his days in a world with no alchemy, and he ditches winry?), it was altogether pretty lackluster. do yourself a favor-- disregard the last half of the anime as well as this movie, and read the manga.
