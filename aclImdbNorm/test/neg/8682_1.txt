<br /><br />very dull, laborious adaptation of amis's amusing satire. the hero is portrayed not as a likeable loser but a merely oafish cretin. most of the rest are pure caricatures with only helen mccrory putting in real quality and providing something of the novel's wit. the period setting is camped up as if it were the 1920s, not the post-war period of horror comics and rock'n' roll. a real dud even by the standards of bad uk tv.<br /><br />
