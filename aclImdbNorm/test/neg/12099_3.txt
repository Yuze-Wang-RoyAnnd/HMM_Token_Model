cheesy 80's horror co-starring genre favs ken foree and rosalind cash along with brenda bakke are some of the featured players in this tale about a haunted health club. goofy dialogue and some nasty gore effects make this movie watchable. not bad but no great shakes either.<br /><br />recommended for the bad dialogue and acting. b-movie fans only.<br /><br />b
