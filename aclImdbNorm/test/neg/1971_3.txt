there were so many reasons why this movie could have been great. i'll give you three.<br /><br />1. sienna guillory. she is extremely hot in this movie and was the reason i chose to watch it in the first place.<br /><br />2. tim curry. amazing bad guy and i always get excited seeing him in movies (even home alone 2).<br /><br />3. jason donovan. for all you aussies and poms out there, this is a rare treat. former neighbours star 80's heart-throb dressed in drag selling drugs.<br /><br />however none of these things nor the fact that the movie is about the drug/rave culture managed to make this movie even remotely interesting. the script was dull, the performances ordinary and despite the scenes with j.d and any scene with sienna i found everything about this movie pretty passe.<br /><br />3 out of 10.
