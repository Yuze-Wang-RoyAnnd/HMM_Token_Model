this must rate with the worst films i have ever seen. it just wasn't funny. my wife fell asleep. i suppose if you are the sort of person who goes all gooey eyed at the sight of a dog then it may do something for you. if you expect a comedy film to have some humour in it then you will be disappointed unless you find an english radio announcer saying the f word a lot hilarious. the strippers in the club kept their underwear on so there wasn't even a bit of nudity to relieve the boredom. what did happen in the strip club made no sense at all. there was a great deal of mumbling by the lead character with whom i developed no sympathy at all. mena suvari was hardly in the film, presumably just there to make people think it was a serious attempt at producing a film. the bad guys were unconvincing and carried as much menace as a dead sheep.
