pretentious horror film that looks like a soap opera gone goth about a drug that send you to a fantasy world where strange creatures lurk. the film has some good imagery but its odd mix of whats real and whats not doesn't go anywhere. worse are the vague pronouncements in voice over from one of the characters. it seems to herald a more serious, more meaningful film, but i don't think they even got into the serious or meaningful territory to begin with so trying to over sell the meaning comes off silly. there isn't a great deal to say, people talk, take drugs have visions...they talks some more. its not bad so much as pointless and dull. the dull is the sin here and the reason you'll want to avoid this.
