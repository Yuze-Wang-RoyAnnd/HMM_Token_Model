this movie was horrendous... it had absolutely nothing to do with dark harvest. and the dvd was very misleading because it showed a scarecrow and a scythe, neither of which appeared in this movie.<br /><br />the beginning was a jumble of random scenes that, most of which, had nothing to do with the movie, except that they sort of show that the man is psychic... but not too well...<br /><br />after the first 10 minutes of the movie there is an hour of just the man character looking for his daughters. it gets vaguely interesting when the daughters meet two girls who died the year before. but that's the extent of it.<br /><br />and why, might i ask, was this movie rated r? there were two drops of blood and 4 curse words. and how on earth did it get into a video store?? this movie was poorly acted, poorly filmed, poorly written, and overall horribly executed.
