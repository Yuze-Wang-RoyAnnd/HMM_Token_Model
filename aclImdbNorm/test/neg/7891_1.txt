this is a movie about a black man buying a airline company and turning the company into a african-centric over the top airliner. they even portray the owner as not only being in control of the airline, but also controlling part of the air terminal at the airport. one day this guy wins $100 million dollars a the next time you see him, he is walking all over the airport acting like the owner of the airport. everyone calls this movie a parody, but nothing about this movie shouts parody! this movie is a flop and will forever be in the $4.95 bin at wal-mart.<br /><br />i can't even come to terms to why mgm would waste 16 million dollars on this movie. this movie doesn't even warrant straight-to-video status. the writers (one black and one white) should be blackballed from hollywood forever. not only do they over-stereotype blacks, they portray them as ignorant human beings. i would be ashamed of going to a movie that constantly humiliates me. don't waste your time at the video store, wal-mart, pay-per-view, or on a sunday afternoon when the movie is shown on tbs.
