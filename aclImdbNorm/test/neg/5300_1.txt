uma and travolta were very good together, but - unfortunately - when they left the screen, the movie was nothing but a bunch of very boring and wordy secondary characters wrapped in some extremely bad writing. occasional glimpses of greatness like the dance scene between uma and travolta quickly eroded when the likes of harvey keitel and similar uninteresting thugs came on. and the white dude who tried to act black got very, very tiresome after way too much exposure in the picture. he weighed down a fairly good performance by the rock, the only secondary character who you couldn't wait to see leave the screen. bad, dumb plot. the writers clearly couldn't figure out if they writing to generation x or the 12-15 year old rap crowd, and the combination turned into a film that kept me staring at my watch!
