dead man's bounty (the film's american title) has the look and feel of a classic italian western. the cinematography, costumes, and sets look great. the cast is rugged, not a pretty face among them. at the beginning i was preparing for a pretty cool movie but what i eventually witnessed was an absolute disaster.<br /><br />the script was perfectly dreadful. there was no suspense whatsoever and very little action or worthwhile drama.<br /><br />despite looking great, the cast spoke (english) with heavy european accents that were often unintelligible.<br /><br />the final nail in it's coffin was the broad streak of pretentiousness that paints most of the picture, focusing heavily on the character of the barmaid who's featured in a couple of very awkward sex scenes. also her speech near the end was pretty repugnant!<br /><br />the only novelty comes from the stunt casting of val kilmer in the role of the dead man, continuing his recent string of doa performances!
