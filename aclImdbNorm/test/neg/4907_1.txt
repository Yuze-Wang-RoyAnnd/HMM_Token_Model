this was one of the most contrived, tedious and clich'ed films i have ever seen... and, yes, i've seen pearl harbour. even the likes of gina mckee couldn't act their way out of the appalling dialogue. it has been described as 'art-house', this can only be a euphemism for dull, dreadful and, quite frankly, artless. why is it that when a film is devoid of plot, critics feel it deserves to be called art? but far more baffling, why did america love it? without you, this film would have remained on the shelf where, perhaps, it belonged.
