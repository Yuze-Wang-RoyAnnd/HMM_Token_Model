wow. after seeing this film, you will know why america's youth continues to lack intelligence and any traits to contribute to the wellbeing of society, except for making themselves more inept to function.<br /><br />jackass number two stars some of the most repremandable people imaginable, who at there core lack any sort of talent or brains to make anything of themselves (especially bam margera and steve-o), and there only option for fame was to make a living entertaining those as stupid as them by harming there being. a guy drinking horse semen? just flat disgusting. a man putting a fish hook through his cheek and acting as "bait" for sharks? this isn't humor, it's evidence for institutionalizing him.<br /><br />overall, i walked out of the theater with no hope for mankind.
