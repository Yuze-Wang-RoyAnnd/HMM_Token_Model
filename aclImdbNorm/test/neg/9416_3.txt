mario van peebles tries to go the jean-claude van damme route and play a renegade robotic soldier who goes awol to preserve himself, however the government isn't going to take this lying down, so among the simplistic plot van peebles protects villagers from the rebel forces and defeats a improved version of himself in this disappointing film. this blatant rip off of universal soldier (which is far more fun then this) simply goes nowhere. the main problem is that the movie is so unbelievably inert. van peebles just waits around and there just isn't enough ass-kicking to justify a viewing. on the other hand the movie does sort of resemble a competent version of r.o.t.o.r although where as that abysmal bad movie was hilarious, this one only yields occasional laughter in its laughably unconvincing action sequences. also like r.o.t.o.r it makes no sense in its narrative and basically the movie is awesomely boring. plus the villains are disappointingly weak and basically the movie needs an actual action scenario to work, because the material is too dull. in all regards solo is a very weak film.<br /><br />*1/2 out of 4-(poor)
