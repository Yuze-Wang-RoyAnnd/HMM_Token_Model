as a child of the 80's like so many of the other reviewers here i hated the original v and v: the final battle. i own both on vhs and never hook up the vcr to watch them. i do remember not liking this short lived series very much, but i couldn't remember why, so i rented the first disc. by the third episode i had my memory refreshed. it's terrible. the writing is beyond horrid. it's not even fun. they had a lot of material to work with here, but it seemed like they just didn't know what to do so they turned it into 'days of our lives with lizard aliens'. how cool and full of potential is the concept of elizabeth the starchild? all they could think of to do is grow her into a whiny, boring teenager to compete with her mother romantically? marc singer looked less embarrassed to be in beastmaster ii than he did when he was trapped in this drivel....point is, whether you're one of the younger folk who's just discovered v or one of us older sci-fi fans looking to rediscover some old fun, spare yourself and skip this!
