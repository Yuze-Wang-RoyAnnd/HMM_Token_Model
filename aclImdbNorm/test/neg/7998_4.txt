this is a very famous ninja movie but it isn't a nice movie. if you want to see some ninjas and some figures, want to know some things about ninjas see this movie. this movie only for ninja fans and who wants to make nostalgia.<br /><br />first 20 minutes and last 20 minutes of the movie are best. you can just see ninja figures and fight in this scenes. between these are below the average, nearly bad as a movie. acting is bad. sho (black ninja) is the best actor in this movie. frank nero is a good actor and charismatic but he cannot fight good. scenario is also not good. its so simple. franko nero comes near to his best , old friend from army and war. he also protects him from mafia but he is having sex ( go to bed ) with his wife and his friend knows this but don't say anything to nero negative. is this possible in life ? what a friendship !<br /><br />finally this movie started a genre ; ninja movies. also there is the ninja master sho kasugi but some fighting scenes are not realistic and not fast even with shoo. this film is below the average even it is a classic.
