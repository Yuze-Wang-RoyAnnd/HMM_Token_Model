tru calling was good but it could have been great. the concept was intriguing and allowed for seriously strange and frightening story lines that might have been explored in future. unfortunately the writing and an actor let the show down.<br /><br />the writing wasn't too bad but there were holes. in episode 13, "drop dead gorgeous", an incredibly toxic poison was supposedly used to kill the victim. this was so toxic and killed so quickly the victim had no time to run or even scream for help. yet there was no plausible explanation for how the killer obtained such a powerful poison.<br /><br />in episode 15, "the getaway", the off-duty policeman responded unrealistically. in the second diner scene he (meekly) tells the robber to drop the gun and when she doesn't follow the order, and in fact turns the gun in his direction, he allows it to turn into a standoff and then escalate into a hostage situation
