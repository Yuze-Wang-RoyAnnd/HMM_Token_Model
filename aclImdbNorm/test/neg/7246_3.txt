i happened to have seen this movie this morning on tcm. very bad acting, low budget and poor plot are the impressions i felt while watching the movie. the only highlight of the movie was watching tender young rita moreno, (23 years old), playing a teenage indian squaw in love with an older man in his 50's. she reminded me of a earlier version of sue lyon as lolita (1962), only a more innocent lolita. she bounces up and down like a 1950's teeny bopper, almost as if you would expect her to be chewing gum, falling all over this old man, willing to give him anything, as he plays it off like she's a hindrance to him. any man in his 50's that had a beautiful, virgin, teenage girl willing to do anything for him and be his bride, would be insane not to take advantage of her. it's too bad that the censorship board back when this movie was released didn't permit more of an expansion of a character such as rita moreno's. the only reason why i gave this movie a 3 instead of a 1 is rita moreno's appearance in the movie.
