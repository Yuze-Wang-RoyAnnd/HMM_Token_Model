what can i say about this movie, it really is one of the worst gay themed movies, ever to come out of the uk. i can only imagine the likes of diana quick and georgina hale, needed the money. what story there is, is such a rambling mess that you loose interest pretty quickly. it's supposed to be based on real life events. well, all i can say to that one, is that it's an insult to the real life characters. the dvd is out at the moment in the uk. it's available in either the split screen format, which must make it even worse that the full screen version i watch. gay cinema can be so much better than this, and we deserve more.
