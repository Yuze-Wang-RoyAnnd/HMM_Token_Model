eh. i watch this movie in class because someone taped it and brought it in. i was expecting some half hearted attempt to portray the herakles myths, and because the commercials for it looked serious, i was expecting something that was halfway decent.<br /><br />ten minutes into the film, i realized that it was utter crap. the only things in the film that are halfway true to the myth are the bare(and i mean bare) minimum. parents, half brother, and labors seemed to be named correctly. other than that, the rest of the film seemed to be one giant inaccuracy. <br /><br />i would say that this was not much better than the disney version of the film. the disney version was made for little kids, therefore wasn't too serious. this movie, with all the sex, violence, and nudity, was clearly intended for an older audience, yet the story presented in this was nearly inaccurate as the disney film.
