i'm afraid i only stayed to watch the first hour of this movie as it really seemed to me to be mindless tv-trash and a waste of talent. liv tyler plays a sumptuous beauty, but her acting skills are not yet sufficiently developed to give the part any real kick. as she slowly seduces a bartender into a life of crime it is difficult to feel any real concern over any of the characters. even john goodman delivers his weakly comic lines with an absence of panache, as if the witless humour needs to be recited slowly in case anyone misses the joke. the ending is supposed to be good, but the starter and main course left me with no appetite to find out.
