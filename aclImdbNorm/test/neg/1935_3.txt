i saw this when it came out in theaters back in 1996. i remember i was already familiar with elijah wood's work (that's right, he made stuff before "lord of the rings"!) and the merchandising tie-ins to the film were pretty abundant ("flipper" water guns were even circulating).<br /><br />adults were reminded of the old movies and tv show and for nostalgia's sake took their kids to see it, who were excited because it was a movie about a dolphin and a stupid boy.<br /><br />unfortunately it wasn't what anyone expected and flopped severely. you know a movie's in trouble when a boy swims away from a hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean, and a pack of dolphins scare the shark away, and the kid -- instead of getting out of the water into a boat -- floats in the water for five minutes thanking his dolphin for saving him ... apparently he hasn't taken into mind that the shark is still out there, perhaps even below him.<br /><br />another problem is paul hogan. he looks old, crusty and tired of recycling his croc dundee shtick. by now, no one even remembered "crocodile dundee" much less hogan, and i half expected him to suddenly start pretending he didn't know what a hair dryer was for the sake of fish-out-of-water/social-satire laughs.<br /><br />all in all this is a really poor "family" movie that is amateurish and almost hard to watch at times. i hated it when i saw it in theaters back in '96 and i hate it more now.
