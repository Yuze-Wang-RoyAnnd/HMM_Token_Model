lonesome jim is kind of like a romantic dark comedy about a dysfunctional family whose two boys are total losers. both boys around 30, living at home, with absolutely nothing going for them. i live in the midwest and i can't name one family like this. i picked it up because i kind of like buscemi acting humor. now i realize i need to have a counteracting agent to that humor to make it work. the acting and camera work and editing was fine. the first 15 minutes got you set, and the last 15 minutes helped prevent the film from being totally depressing jerry springer trailer trash type of story. the female members of my family were begging me to turn it off, but i prevailed under the premise that there had to be a turning point near the end, and we watched the entire movie. the male family members, as expected, simply walked out after the first 30 minutes.
