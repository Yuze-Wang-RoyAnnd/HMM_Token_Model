skip this hollywood version, a real piece of garbage. a cheap insult to the brilliant original "spoorloos", or by the english title also called "the vanishing". it completely misses the mark in typical, grotesque hollywood fashion, usually due to a bunch of talentless, corporate bean counters who haven't the vaguest idea about anything artistic, they just look for the "successful formula" and want it applied to everything to glean a profit. much like the awful "the scarlet letter" made in 1995, which twisted the original story around so much to suit the macdonaldsland crowd, that it became an aberration, not even a bastardization, but a pile of goop that has been sort of shaped similar but does not look, feel or even remotely resemble the spirit of the original. except that movie at least had gary oldman, who is interesting to watch in anything he does. this dog has nothing going for it, even the usually very talented jeff bridges is an embarrassment. great tragedy is not nor never should be "the feel good movie of the year" but rather takes one or more of the sadly much too frequent tragic events in life and allows the reader/viewer to draw meaning and insight into the human condition.<br /><br />do yourself a great favor if you're looking for a rental and skip this grotesque garbage and pick up the original made in a dutch/french collaboration in 1988. that is a great film. this is a horrific mess.
