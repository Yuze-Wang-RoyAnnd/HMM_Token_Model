when i watched this crap, it reminded me of the the title of the movie fire, which is where this garbage belongs, in a fire. i don't even know what to say the acting blew, the fire looked really fake, andy the chicks are'nt exactly supermodels. and lastly i don't know what you people are complaining i own this damn movie, yeah happy birthday to me well i guess it could be worse i could be watching left behind 2. and to make things worse i have the whole set on dvd fire,volcano,earthquake,avalanche. all i'm missing is the awesome tornado movie which i hear sucks balls.<br /><br />well until my next crap movie peace
