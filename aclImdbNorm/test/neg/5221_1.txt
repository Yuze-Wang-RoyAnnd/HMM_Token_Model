normally, i don't like chuck norris films. i appreciate his work as a martial artist, and his fight scenes are usually fairly well-choreographed. chuck is undeniably one of the martial arts greats. so, in my local used bookstore, i found a film i hadn't seen before and took it home.<br /><br />while the acting in this movie was worse than most chuch norris films, i was hoping to see at least one fight scene. i quickly began to realize that this wasn't a typical chuch norris film; rather it was a christian film, destined to illustrate the "good will win out" paradigm.<br /><br />there is really nothing on the packaging to indicate that this is a christian film, with the exception of the label ... goodtimes entertainment, which i had never heard of before. i'll certainly keep that in mind the next time i see a film from that company.<br /><br />i don't have a problem with christianity ... i do have a problem with sneaky proselytizing. if someone is going to make a religious film, at least have the good sense to indicate to the viewer that such is what they will get. the only redeeming part about the exercise is that i spent only $3.25 to spend 97 minutes to watch a great martial artist not fight. at least it was during supper-time, and i spent some of that cooking and eating.<br /><br />in short, if you're looking for a mediocre martial arts film, and not hoping for much, don't bother with this film because it doesn't even offer that.
