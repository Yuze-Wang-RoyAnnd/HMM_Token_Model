this is not the worst movie i've ever seen. i did not feel like i wanted to remove my eyeballs forcibly after watching galaxina. it just is not good. the jokes are almost funny, but fall short. all of them. the few gags that come close are beat back down by repeating them over and over. the production values are, well, non-existent. the sound is bad, the lighting is bad, ... it just seems cheaply made; overly so. the dialog ... well, often it is missing - many awkward silences; they are all just standing around, and it seems like someone should be saying something. the film even seems ambivalent about what it wants to be - it is not always clear that it was intended as a comedy - like maybe that developed after shooting started. it feels like someone's film project that they threw together the night before it was due, and if they had put two weeks into it, it could have been good.<br /><br />and i'm easy to please. i thought "mom and dad save the world" was a hoot. i like "pluto nash". "mystery men" is one of my favorite movies. "spaced invaders" is well nigh unto a classic. this turkey just doesn't do it. "space truckers" was more believable.<br /><br />avery schreiber, who can be very funny, tries too hard. his part calls for a straightman, and he plays it leaning toward sitcom. dorothy stratten is ok in her role, but not particularly noteworthy.<br /><br />oh, yeah, the "my watch is always slow." line was funny. i'll give this movie all the kudos it can get, it needs it.<br /><br />the space vehicle models are not bad, but they are few and are not used effectively. the space scenes are vague. no sweeping passes, no close up detailed fly-bys, not even appropriate action scenes when they dock. (the infinity does crash land very oddly at one point.) the flight dynamics are terrible; worse than anything you've seen, they're jerky, not smooth. the initial battle is stilted and static; even though the two ships have just shown that they can maneuver in their jerky fashion, they trade (slow) shots at close range in a manner that is more reminiscent of a 16th century sea battle, except not as exciting.<br /><br />the aliens - imagine if all of star wars was the cantina scene. that many rubber masks could get dull rather rapidly, no? a few are used as sight gags that work ok the first time, but not the fifth.<br /><br />mercifully, if you attempt to watch galaxina, you are likely to fall asleep. (i got busy doing something else and missed the last ten minutes, and did not feel like it was worth replaying it. if that doesn't say "it sucked", i don't know what does.) sadly, there is a lot of potential, and this could easily have been a good movie. it would be easy to remake this and have a decent film.<br /><br />madkaugh
