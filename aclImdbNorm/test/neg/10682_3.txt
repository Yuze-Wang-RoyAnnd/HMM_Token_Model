the movie razor blade smile has an interesting title as well as leading role. now most may not like this movie for the plot and acting was a little cheap, but that is the appeal of a movie like razor blade smile. in a way it was suppose to be bad movie. <br /><br />however, if you watch this movie all the way through the end you'll see it is as i said a cheap vampire flick with a little humor. (also how they manipulated colours in a few scenes is very interesting.) <br /><br />so in conclusion this movie is a type you rent and laugh at with your friends and enjoy it for what it is. for no movie is throughly bad. <br /><br />as lilith silver says: "humans just don't smile enough..."
