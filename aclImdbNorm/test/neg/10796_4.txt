first of all, since i'm one of the people who never saw the mst3k chopped up version of this movie, i can't comment on that.<br /><br />however, i did see the original version of this movie on the sci-fi channel and i thought it was just as good as anything else on that channel. in fact, i thought it was one of their better offerings.<br /><br />i've noticed in perusing the comments here that the people who write in detail about soultaker with a modicum of intelligence, thoughtfulness and maturity tend to like at least a few things about this movie and rightly so. in it's original cut, most reasonable people i think would probably rate it at least 4 or 5 stars out of 10. five is average to me and i think this movie is about average for a sci fi pic.<br /><br />in contrast to the above, i've also noticed that the reviewers who seem immature, dull and flip and as a result come off as boneheads from where i stand, are the same ones who can't find anything good about this movie and basically trash it without cause based mostly on seeing it chopped up and fricasseed on mst3k. or if they have seen both cuts it seems they were greatly prejudiced by the mst3k viewing to begin with.
