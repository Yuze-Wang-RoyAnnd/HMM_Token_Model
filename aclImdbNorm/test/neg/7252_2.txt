i don't think the number of blunders militarily and strategically contained in this turkey can be beaten. everything in this mess was done on the cheap and made soldiers look really stupid. examples: at the start the 2-star general is given strategic advice by a lieutenant and accepts it unquestionably. the map used by the lt. shows enemy positions but they apparently have only a single narrow valley to use in advancing on the battalion (even though the map showed a dozen more). the rear guard takes up position from which they are clearly spotted by the enemy and exposed. they pound our heroes from high ground but this superior fire power makes little difference. an single enemy tank advances near the end (at the beginning referred to as armored division), proceeded by a solitary infantry point (!) who moves extremely slowly without cover scouting the area, then waives the tank on when he deems it save to proceed - a most bizarre scene. the soldiers take cover in a cave. all around them is ice and deep snow but in the cave not a yard from the entrance is a deep puddle through which they all wade repeatedly - their feet would last mere minutes before they freeze off. later the survivors wade pathetically slowly and chest high through a river to return to their unit. remember it is deep winter and the ground is frozen. yeah right!<br /><br />and on and on it goes. they yell commands to positions on higher ground, they lay mines near their own position and warn each other not to trample on them (!) at the start, credit is given to some soldier who had been awarded the congressional medal of honor. was he blind, or did director fuller just ignore him?truly the most inept soldiers i've ever seen. <br /><br />one of them pokes around in his own wounded leg with a bayonet and eventually pulls out a piece of shrapnel, without a wince or a moan. he announces that that should qualify him as a surgeon. now that was funny.
