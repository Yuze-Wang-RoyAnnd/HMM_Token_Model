the presentation is very shabby. (to my notion) as documentaries often are. michael moore's "documenatry" - farenheit 911 is far more convincing but has far too much media and political influence. cant wait till saturday when i get to see the docudrama "the game of their lives" . ifc goes right of center. i have started a collection of ifc movies from off the internet due to "tgotl" *** out of ********** on "decade". wanna see good documentaries? stick to the history channel.. or try docudrama. you cant go wrong with them my friend. cant go wrong. the seventies were ten years of reruns. or so the old times would have you to believe. disco died and it is gone forever. when elvis died o yes we all did grieve
