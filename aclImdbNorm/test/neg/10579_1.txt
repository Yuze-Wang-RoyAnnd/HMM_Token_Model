scary movie 1-4, epic movie, date movie, meet the spartans, not another teen movie and another gay movie. making "superhero movie" the eleventh in a series that single handily ruined the parody genre. now i'll admit it i have a soft spot for classics such as airplane and the naked gun but you know you've milked a franchise so bad when you can see the gags a mile off. in fact the only thing that might really temp you into going to see this disaster is the incredibly funny but massive sell-out leslie neilson.<br /><br />you can tell he needs the money, wither that or he intends to go down with the ship like a good capitan would. in no way is he bringing down this genre but hell he's not helping it. but if i feel sorry for anybody in this film its decent actor drake bell who is put through an immense amount of embarrassment. the people who are put through the largest amount of torture by far however is the audience forced to sit through 90 minutes of laughless bile no funnier than herpes.<br /><br />after spoofing disaster films in airplane!, police shows in the naked gun, and hollywood horrors in scary movie 3 and 4, producer david zucker sets his satirical sights on the superhero genre with this anarchic comedy lampooning everything from spider-man to x-men and superman returns.<br /><br />shortly after being bitten by a genetically altered dragonfly, high-school outcast rick riker (drake bell) begins to experience a startling transformation. now rick's skin is as strong as steel, and he possesses the strength of ten men. determined to use his newfound powers to fight crime, rick creates a special costume and assumes the identity of the dragonfly -- a fearless crime fighter dedicated to keeping the streets safe for law-abiding citizens.<br /><br />but every superhero needs a nemesis, and after lou landers (christopher mcdonald) is caught in the middle of an experiment gone horribly awry, he develops the power to leech the life force out of anyone he meets and becomes the villainous hourglass. intent on achieving immortality, the hourglass attempts to gather as much life force as possible as the noble dragonfly sets out to take down his archenemy and realize his destiny as a true hero. craig mazin writes and directs this low-flying spoof.<br /><br />featuring tracy morgan, pamela anderson, leslie nielsen, marion ross, jeffrey tambor, and regina hall.<br /><br />hell superhero movie may earn some merit in the fact that it's a hell of a lot better than meet the spartans and epic movie. but with great responsibility comes one of the worst outings of 2008 to date. laughless but a little less irritating than meet the spartans. and in the same sense much more forgettable than meet the spartans. but maybe that's a good reason. there are still some of us trying to scrape away the stain that was meet the spartans from our memory.<br /><br />my final verdict? avoid, unless you're one of thoses people who enjoy such car crash cinema. as bad as date movie and scary movie 2 but not quite as bad as meet the spartans or epic movie. super villain.
