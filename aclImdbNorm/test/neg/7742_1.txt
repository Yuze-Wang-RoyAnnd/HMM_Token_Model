boy, this movie is bad. and not in a good, cheesy, fun way, either. even mst3k couldn't stop it from being boring, and it's also confusing as all get out. but the most annoying part of this dull mess is ireland's hideous high pitched voice, which i was tired of listening to in the first five minutes. not to mention how really unappealing her character is. even her dad ran away and abandoned her! i can see why, frankly. if he'd had to listen to her whine in her little mouse voice for more than a few minutes, he'd have been tempted to do her a great harm. as i was, by the end of the movie. plus, she's useless and annoying. when she falls down the long hole in the earth a la alice in wonderland, she'd have been done for in the first ten minutes if that inexplicably australian accented miner hadn't kept saving her from all of the various plights she kept falling into. he should have just tied her to the atlantean version of train tracks and been done with it. and this atlantis underground with the weird, confusing obsession with bone density,i have to ask-where was the light coming from down there? did they have generators that imitate the sun? no matter. there's no real plot anyway, just a bunch of oddly costumed goth wannabees running around trying to catch kathy(probably so that they can stick a gag in her mouth). stupid, pointless film. thank you golan globus, for this cinematic abomination. may you burn in the seventh ring of hell for all eternity.
