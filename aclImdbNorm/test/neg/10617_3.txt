i watched this movie which i really thought had a promising beginning but then it just led me to feel disappointed in the end. the problem i think with this film was that the director was trying a bit to hard to make this film weird and original. there were too many flashbacks and too many bad "effects" which got me annoyed through the film. i love debbie harry and isaac hayes but they disappointed me in this film, they could of done much better. this film seemed promising in the beginning, dragging in the middle and then disappointing in the end. the film could never beat stanley kubrick's geniousness when it comes to controversial matters, weirdness and originality in movies.
