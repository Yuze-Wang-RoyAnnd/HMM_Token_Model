i'm a christian, and i have watched pretty of christian movies, but this one is too bad. they try to make this good, but it's too hard for them i think.<br /><br />- you can see the film is badly dubbed in many places. - you can almost think that the mainpersons in this film was the only ones left behind. i think there will be a lot more of them.<br /><br />- the quality is poor, and the acting could have been better too. the story is not so very bad, but could've been better. the only plus i give, is to the story in this film, but totally i can't rate it more than 3/10. watch "left behind" instead!
