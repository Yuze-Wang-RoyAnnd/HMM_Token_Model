though it pains me to some degree that i'm bothering to christen the comments board for this new series - mainly because i'd hate to give the false impression that there's actually any semblance of public interest in it - i feel compelled to throw in my chips on this one.<br /><br />to put it simply, never before have i felt so persuaded to root for a tv show's swift and merciless cancellation based solely on the merit of its promo ads. and, in case you're wondering, i'm a dude.<br /><br />listen, comedy network: though your existing original programming is already, shall we politely say, of a 'questionable' quality (i'm looking at you, "girls will be girls") you have truly outdone yourselves on this one. whoever green-lit this thing could not be further out of touch with what's cool right now.<br /><br />best of luck.
