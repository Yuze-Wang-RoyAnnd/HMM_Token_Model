if you think it's beautiful to be obsessive about who you are in love with, then i can imagine giving it a good rating... but i cannot imagine that this theme of obsessiveness and having little respect for others (such as the way paulie treats the teachers who try to help her) is anything you would want to teach your children. yes, it's also bad the way victoria treated paulie, but guess what. that's life. isn't it a more important lesson to learn how to get past these disappointments and make the best of your life? or is falling off the roof a better lesson to teach our children? secondly, when mary's father didn't show up for the dinner, and paulie helped mary release her anger, that mary even said she wished he were dead... somehow i don't think this is a good message either that you deal with your disappointments through anger.
