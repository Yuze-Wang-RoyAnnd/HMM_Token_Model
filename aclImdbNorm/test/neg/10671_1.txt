i have to hold my hand up and say that i was one of the first (and probably the last!!!) to see this film. where do i start, it's a complete mess. the main attraction of course was the soundtrack. which goes without saying is brilliant - it's what himesh does best. but as they say, don't give up your day job - hr definitely shouldn't.<br /><br />hr's acting is plain and simply awful. even if the film had a plot, the thing that baffles you most is why this man is up on screen and what the hell is doing there. two words of advice to hr - give up acting and secondly, use chapstick.<br /><br />hr has no screen presence, no acting skills and the female lead looks just a little too young for him. as for malika sherawat - just the same old bollywood vamp crap. <br /><br />you can package the product as much as you want, but if there's no substance it won't hold. don't waste your money...
