"ordinary decent criminal" is sort of based on the exploits of martin cahill, already the subject of john boorman's 1998 film "the general". cahill had a rough upbringing in a slum area and graduated from petty crime to armed robbery with honours. he justified his criminal career by pointing out his poor background at every opportunity. this is a common excuse for criminals that conveniently overlooks the thousands of slum-dwellers who don't turn to robbing post offices and selling guns in order to make ends meet. cahill made fools of the police and local authorities, not to mention the ira, which earned him a sort of "folk hero" status as well as making him many enemies. however, he was basically an amoral, self-serving thief.<br /><br />my primary problem with "odc" is that the protagonist is made out to be a lovable irish rogue. kevin spacey does a good job portraying michael lynch with a blend of oily charm and quiet menace, but the character is too amoral and selfish to be seen as any sort of hero, even an anti-hero. <br /><br />the film is well shot and well acted by a fine cast, but what lets it down is the script. writer gerard stembridge can't make up his mind; is he writing an irish "lock stock" or a grittier treatment of martin cahill's thieving career? that's the problem when a writer bases his central character on a real person. <br /><br />it's also unfortunate that "odc" followed the cinema release of john boorman's "the general", which was a more accurate portrayal of martin cahill's story. cahill was a cunning thief who knew the value of good publicity, so it's not surprising that his exploits got the movie treatment.<br /><br />what is surprising is that a studio was prepared to take cahill's story and give it a happy hollywood-style ending. kevin spacey's charismatic-twinkly-bigamist-thief michael lynch gets to ride off into anonymity on his motorcycle in "odc". in the real world, martin cahill was executed by the ira, just to prove that no-one makes fools of an out-dated, sectarian and corrupt para-military organisation and gets away with it. <br /><br />the real cahill would never have walked away from his notoriety because it bolstered his "man of the people" self-image. having michael lynch give up everything to avoid death in "odc" is a cop-out ending to a weak and shallow movie.
