i saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me, and we both had the same feeling about it: it wasn't terribly motivating, and didn't even broach the idea of what a training schedule would look like, so that non-marathoners could have an idea of what it would take for them to train and run one. in fact there was almost zero technical information at all. i didn't expect this to be a tech-heavy instructional video, but when that info was near zero then the film just wasn't balanced, and wasn't particularly useful to non-marathoners contemplating their first run.<br /><br />there were other problems. some of the very first images were people collapsing near death while trying to run a race. yeah, real inspiring. the timing was also hard to follow, because it was semi chronological, but the filmmakers rarely gave you any good clues as to what point in time you were looking at. and they withheld information. you see that kantor has an injury, and you just assume it's from all her training, but then several scenes later they finally clue you in that it's because she tripped over a pine cone in her yard.<br /><br />some parts were very good, though, like the bit about a woman defying race officials who wanted the run to be men-only, and the coverage of a chicago race where two of the runners portrayed earlier were vying for first place.<br /><br />off the top of my head, i'm thinking of other chronological documentaries, like supersize me, and grass, where you always know where you are, and you feel like they told you everything you wanted to know.<br /><br />in short, it wouldn't have been hard to make a better marathon film, and as it stands i can't recommend this to non-marathoners to educate and motivate them to try one, because i don't think it will have that effect.
