coltrane and idle are members of a bank robbery gang who double cross their leader during a robbery. they hide out in a nunnery school and disguise themselves appropriately to avoid detection from the mob and the police. alot of catholic humor and slapstick but the script is kinda thin as are the laughs.. there is a good shower scene though... on a scale of one to ten..4
