this movie was horrible and the only reason it was even made was because the story appealed to the far-left. i consider my self a moderate, so i was able to see this film as the pile of garbage it was. while i'm not a bush fan, your dislike for gw is not enough of a reason to see this movie.<br /><br />to start, the movie was shot on such low-grade film that it comes off as cheap, rather then artsy. additionally, the characters are seriously lacking in depth. chris cooper's character was a poor parody of george bush; better suited for saturday night live then a dramatic film. the rest of the characters are walking clich'es and are poor facsimiles of other characters from much better movies.<br /><br />avoid this movie at all costs!
