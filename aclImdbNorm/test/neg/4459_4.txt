though i had sort of enjoyed the satanic rites of dracula (1974), i knew i shouldn't expect too much from its even more maligned predecessor! surely the least of the hammer draculas (marcus hearn on the audio commentary for the creeping flesh [1973] even goes so far as to call it the studio's nadir!), the film really flounders due to its totally unhip - and now embarrassingly dated - updating of the myth (the modern-day setting actually suited satanic rites rather better)...even if, truth be told, it's still vastly preferable to dreck like dracula 2000 (2000) or van helsing (2004)!<br /><br />despite christopher lee's vociferous bashing of the film, he still cuts an undeniably striking figure as the undead vampire (even if he appears very little and is inexplicably confined to one setting); likewise, peter cushing delivers his usual committed performance. the only other noteworthy acting job in the film is that given by christopher neame (son of director ronald) as johnny alucard(!) - even if that's only because of how unbelievably hammy it is! unfortunately, the two best-known female members of the cast (both of them horror regulars) - stephanie beacham and caroline munro - can't rise above their physical attributes.<br /><br />the camera-work is by dick bush (who had shot the blood on satan's claw [1971] and, for hammer, when dinosaurs ruled the earth [1970] and twins of evil [1971] - but is perhaps best known for his longtime association with ken russell) which manages some nice atmosphere throughout, especially during three crucial sequences: the carriage-ride scuffle at the (properly gothic) beginning; the hysterical black mass sequence, followed by the resuscitation of dracula; and the final confrontation between lee and cushing's van helsing.
