<br /><br />after the wit and liveliness of highway 61 and roadkill i expected this movie to shine, but it was as bloated and self-deluded as the hard-rock stars it parodied. the pace dragged, not helped by an over-long hallucination sequence, the characters were flat and unmemorable, and art bergmann is no jello biafra. i had to poke myself to stay awake.
