i'm a big fan of the first critters movie. the second episode is good,but it's not as good as the first critters. the third episode is a little bit boring,but lovely. and what is this?? what a crap! it's stupid and really,really boring. it's the worst of the series. i can't watch it again,because i felt asleep at the first watch. and ug's evil side...eeewww...that's one of the most horribble moments of the movie. in the first 50 minutes,we can't see the little,furry monsters,that's the reason why the audience fell asleep at the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />it could have been much better.<br /><br />2/10
