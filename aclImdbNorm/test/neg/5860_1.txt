despite the potentially fascinating premise, series 7 is weak attempt at attacking reality television. aside from its bargain basement production values, which present an eyesore 10 minutes in, the overall tone of the film is misguided. several reviewers have attacked the acting in the film, but i think the real problem is this lame attempt to make the film into a farce. aside from the fact that the jokes are not funny (a pregnant woman swears a lot, a young girl gets a bunch of guns), it doesn't gel with the overall tone of the film. had the makers actually made series 7 to bear a striking resemblance to actual reality tv-colorful yet hollow edits, lame sound effects, sweeping camera motions-maybe their point would have been more solid or at least more palatable. instead series 7 meanders through the already harried world of death and game show. you can just imagine the director slapping himself on the back for stating the obvious
