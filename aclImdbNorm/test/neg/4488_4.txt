this movie had the potential to be a very good movie in my eyes, nicholas sparks is a great romance author and this movie had every chance to be just as great as the notebook but whats sets the two apart is the notebook had a dream team of leads in mcadams and gosling but here the balance is thrown miserably off by the inept acting of channing tatum<br /><br />i felt a lot of the scenes were uneven purely because of his performance, a lot of the emotion in various scenes is lost because he cant act, leaving an awkward and uneven situation, amanda seyfried given a great performance only to have tatum drop the ball and the mood is lost and the scene cant recover.<br /><br />this story deserved to be cast right, but what it got was a pretty boy who cant act. tatum should stick to what hes good at, movies that are more about his physical ability, albeit horrible, like gi joe, step up, and fighting. the less he talks the better.<br /><br />try not to think of me as a jaded hater of channing tatum i went in to this movie with an open mind, because i've been surprised many a time by the likes of adam sandler in reign over me. i gave the same chance to tatum i didn't view him here as the sum of his past roles, purely just by his performance in this movie, which sadly was a letdown
