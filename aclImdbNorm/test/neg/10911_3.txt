and totally non-scary film. the characters doesn't interest at all, and most of the time is spent in a car. the dog is at best ugly, never really scary. to interest, a more threatening menace would have been needed, at least a few people you care for and evokes some emotions in you. and, not the least, something interesting must happen. something unexpected. as it is, this film just drags on and on, in what seems like forever. maybe a saint bernhard was not that smart to choose as the terrible threat to life and society?<br /><br />in most scary movies/thrillers/mystery, just whatever genre, there must be characters that sparks interest and makes you want to know what happens. here you really don't care, you just wait for it all to stop, and wondering if it wouldn't be better to see something else. one of the weakest king adaptations.
