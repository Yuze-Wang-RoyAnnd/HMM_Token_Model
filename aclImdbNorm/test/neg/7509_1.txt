once a month, i invite a few friends over for a "retarded movie night". we look forward to movies that are either so bad they're funny or movies that know they don't have a plot and just show a lot of chests. last night, we were unfortunate enough to have zombie planet as one of our movies. the cinematography is on par with what we're used to, but the acting was a different story. the lead role is played by a johnny depp/rob zombie wanna-be who couldn't get a role in a high school play, let alone a low-budget horror film. our indecisive hero, who couldn't tell whether or not he wanted to be a bad-ass this scene or a whimpering coward was one of the reasons why this was the first movie of 30 that i have ever had to stop early during a retarded movie night. it had the possibility for greatness with a great twist on the standard zombie infection, but they took it an entirely different direction based on johnny zombie. i personally would not recommend this to any of my friends. however, it's unfortunate that i already invited a few over last night to suffer through 80% of this movie with me.
