if you want a complete waste of time, because pulling lint out of your belly button or cleaning the wax out of your ears or grouting your tile is your idea of a carnival thrill ride, then you'll not want to miss this one.<br /><br />for one thing, forget the vhs cover. no body in this movie looks that attractive (ie, the indian girl). someone else commented that whoever posed for the cover is not the same girl and i agree. the cover is the most exciting thing about this movie.<br /><br />to put this in perspective, i bought this vhs for 99 cents at k-mart and three minutes, no, 40 seconds into the movie, i knew i had been ripped off.<br /><br />i finished watching it because 1) i did pay 99 cents after all and, 2)there might possibly, conceivably been a hair of chance some scene in this turkey was worth more than a pinched loaf.<br /><br />there wasn't.<br /><br />good grief, fonda. i know you were hard up for roles when you did this, but this is beneath you.
