i give this piece of hollywood trash 1 out 10! seriously! i mean, i like comedy as much as the next guy. i also can take just plain stupid comedy and actually sit back and laugh with it. but this film had nothing to laugh at or with.<br /><br />i like nearly all of the actors in this film. so i thought i'd overlook what many people told me about it (my fault for not listening). i was just mortified at how stupid this script was! just ridiculous and not even in a funny way. the only funny scenes were in the previews that everyone saw in the theater when seeing other movies or on tv. i was very disappointed and i really would like to know why these otherwise relatively good actors would read this script and then still sign up to be in it! bad decision on their parts...<br /><br />*********************major spoiler************************<br /><br />okay - here's my biggest question on this film.......if the characters are looking back on this story of jewel (liv tyler) after the fact....then how can paul reiser have gone to a therapist remembering the past!?!?!?!? he dies in the last scene by being crushed by the dumpster!!!! can anyone answer me that?!?!?!?!? major goof on the part of the film makers.....nobody noticed this?!?!?!?!?!?!
