this 1988 movie was shown recently on a cable channel. we wanted to see another film, which supposedly was starting, but because a mix up, rent-a-cop, was shown in that time slot. never having seen it when it was commercially released, we took a chance at it. bad decision.<br /><br />one wonders what possessed the people behind the picture to go ahead with "rent-a-cop", or how they sold it to the studio behind the distribution. it appears this movie misfired big time. this film doesn't add anything new to its genre. it's totally predictable, as once the basic premise is shown, we know how it will end.<br /><br />burt reynolds plays a wooden church. this actor can do better, but who knows what was going on behind the scenes, or perhaps the direction given to him by jerry london, had the opposite effect. mr. reynolds has one expression throughout the movie. he just doesn't register any emotion at all.<br /><br />lisa minnelli, as the hooker who witnessed the original slaughter at the chicago hotel, makes no sense at all. the romance between her della and church seems phony from the beginning. she and mr. reynolds play one dimensional characters.<br /><br />don't waste your time with this turkey.
