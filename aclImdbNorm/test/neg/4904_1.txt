hideously bad movie purportedly about a croupier who wants to be a writer and the incidents that make up casino life. moves at a snail's pace. dull, dull, dull! virtually everything about this movie is amateurish and unconvincing - with one very notable exception: the performance of clive owen, who is like a rolls royce purring through a slum. advice for the casino sequences were allegedly provided by a professional but judging by the way in which they are handled they were completely ignored by the director. while casino staff may very well be a different breed to the rest of the world they are nowhere near as witless and booooring as the characters presented in this script. odds and ends are thrown into the script in an attempt to provide it with convincing background but would appear to have been jotted down in a list on a cocktail napkin. for anyone who makes a living in the casino business (as this writer has for the last forty years!) this is a poverty stricken depiction of their world which even in the farthest and most obscure reaches of england has never been this wanting! an appalling, insulting mess of a movie that plods and plods and plods along to an idiotic and unconvincing ending. american critics loved it.
