this overheated southern gothic "mellerdramer" has a few decent moments --but is too often spoiled by a novice director piling clich'e upon clich'e, and a star who apparently decided to take it upon himself to turn the picture into his personal showcase, rather than allowing writer/director gabel to update inge or williams as a sort of contemporary "midnight cowboy" meets "lolita" tearjerker.<br /><br />close your eyes, listen to the exaggerated southern accents, and try to decide if you're witnessing a feature film, or an acting class -- full of eager amateurs. <br /><br />johansson is for once tolerable (i.e. less pouty than usual) -- though by no means good, macht is decent, though a little too pretty-boy cute to be believed, and travolta chews the scenery as never before (with the help of a decent editor and some directorial restraint, his performance might have been really touching; as it is, he -- and almost everyone else -- is too unlikable to ever move us past the point of boredom or revulsion). kara unger is perhaps best of all; had her role been developed beyond a few lines, she might have even found herself with a best supporting actress nomination. <br /><br />pic is almost saved by leonard cohen-style growling theme song, decent production design and locations, and continual reference to literary works (which has earned the otherwise standard screenplay reviews such as "poetic.") also helpful are a few old pros in the cast like sonny shroyer, and perhaps most importantly, soderbergh cameraman elliot davis -- whose fine work will no doubt be credited to the first-time director, who, ten or twenty years from now, may actually learn how to direct.<br /><br />but probably not.
