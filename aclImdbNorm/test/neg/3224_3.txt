this movie might be o.k. if not for all the language in it. i think that the storyline itself isn't bad, but i would be too embarrassed to let my wife or kids see the movie. i know that kids will learn all the swear words along the way eventually, that's true, but parents should not assist them in the process by letting them see and hear the stuff in the guise of entertainment.<br /><br />i used to quite like robert loggia; he has a distinctive gritty quality with that rough voice of his, but in the last few years all i have seen him do are roles with a lot of language in them. if we had an award for over-use of the f word, he would have to be a contender. unfortunately, i think he's now lost me as a fan. when i see his name on movies in future, i will be thinking twice about picking up that title.<br /><br />look, i'm no prude. i use language sometimes too, in extreme circumstances, but when we're watching a movie it is for the sake of e n t e r t a i n m e n t, something which we hope will bring us some joy and escapism. i do not want to be reminded of what's happening out on the streets in any big city these days, and it's a hassle to have to wonder whether or not a movie is alright for my family to watch.<br /><br />i like matt modine too, but it's a pity that he has associated himself with a picture which has let his image down like this. he probably did an o.k. job in the movie, but i turned off about 1/4 of the way through after having had my ears assaulted once too often by others in the cast. why can't these actors just say no when these scripts ask them to carry on with this gutter language? once enough actors, (especially the big names), kick up a fuss about it, the writers will stop putting it in the movies!<br /><br />i'm sorry, but i cannot recommend this picture. it's a pity too, because i think it would probably have been alright, if it had been made well enough for decent families to watch! thank god i only wasted $2.00 on it!
