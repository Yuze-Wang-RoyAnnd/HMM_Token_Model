i am seldom motivated to write a review unless inspired by the quality of the movie. in the case of comanche moon i was so uninspired i felt the need to warn others how bad this tv mini series is. here are a few thoughts.<br /><br />the indians: they came across like they were in a saturday night live skit, making fun of how indians talk. when mcmurtry writes dialogue in his novels it reads so interesting; i am not sure how they ended up with what they got.<br /><br />gus mccrae: looks like festus from the old gunsmoke series. acting is ok and the mannerisms from robert duvall's mccrae are right on, but the look is pure comedy cowboy.<br /><br />clara: maybe you could use a little dirt or sweat on her next time. ever been in austin in the summer before air conditioning? i promise you women did not look like that. do you think they never saw any episodes of dearwood?<br /><br />gov. elisha pease: again whenever they are in the governor's office it feels like a saturday night live skit, and the skit is bombing.<br /><br />woodrow call: call is the most reasonable character, of course he talks so little how can you screw up that? but hey, what about that hat?<br /><br />blue duck: see above and include the fact that he isn't even a tiny bit scary. they should have gotten javier bardem to play the part.<br /><br />the rangers: right out of "o brother, where art thou" i expected george cloony to come riding up and them to break into a song.<br /><br />perhaps i am premature because the miniseries isn't completed but i doubt i will watch any more of it any way.<br /><br />i would not expect anyone to be able to duplicate the enthralling feel of lonesome dove, but i watch this and it seems like they have no feel for the old west at all.
