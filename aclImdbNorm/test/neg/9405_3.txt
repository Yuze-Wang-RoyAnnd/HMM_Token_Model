just finished watching 2ftm. the trailers intrigued me so much i actually went to see it on opening weekend, something i never do. needless to say i was very disappointed. the story has so much potential and it's frustrating to see it get screwed up. i really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and matthew mcconaughey. first off i am not a mm hater, i thought he was awesome in both reign of fire and lone star. i enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off 3-4 times. yes we all get it that he a good-looking guy with a nice body, but i think most people knew this 10 years ago when he came on the scene in a time to kill. showing him with his shirt off pumping iron like a sweaty madman 3-4 times in the movie is totally unnecessary. i think one time would have been sufficient. it wouldn't surprise me if they threw those unnecessary scenes in so girlfriends and wives would be willing to tag along with their significant other, no woman wants to see a movie about sports gambling, unless......enough about that, let's get into his role. i feel his acting was very forced and he didn't seem very comfortable. i know his character was supposed to be this charming southerner, but his lines were corny and cheesy. it was almost like he was referencing days and confused lines a few times! in short, i didn't like his character even though i was supposed to. the accent, his shirt off, corny pick up lines, weak sales pitches. his character was just too much of a tool, as brandon or jonathan. pacino and assante were great, but that' no surprise. piven is fun to watch as arie....oooops i mean jerry. i just feel this movie was very commercial and put together poorly. it's insulting that they could take a great story, and throw in crap ingredients to try and make it a box office success. 1. cool story that appeals to the male man 2. hunky hollywood actor for female women (make sure he has numerous scenes with shirt off lifting weights) 3. al pacino with 4 great speech scenes, and 25 great one liners 3. every character shall be dressed in thousand dollars suites and have an extremely dark tan 4. jeremy piven to play the same character he did in entourage and old school 4. throw in armand assante to seal the deal 5. plot, good writing, character development, and intelligent casting are unnecessary<br /><br />this will be good enough for most people, but not me! anybody who disagrees with me, ask your self this. would this movie be much better if: a. directed by sodeberg b. decaprio or ed norton as brandon instead of mm<br /><br />i will probably be part of the minority in thinking this movie sucks. i realized this when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous ending scene of pacino shedding a fake tear while embracing russo. the financial success of this movie will ensure one thing. the movie going public gets what the movie going public wants, big budget crapola.
