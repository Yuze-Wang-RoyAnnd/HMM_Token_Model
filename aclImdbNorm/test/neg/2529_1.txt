i can't believe it! were they crazy in filming a movie about connecticut in southern california? for god's sake, there's palm tree's everywhere. in one of the opening scenes a guy says "welcome to connecticut" and throws down a newspaper, the newspaper says something like "greenwich herald". greenwich connecticut doesn't have a "herald" it has a "times" as in "stamford advocate and the greenwich times." (refering to the stamford, connecticut newspaper). maybe the film makers should have done a little research, i mean my god, at least get the name of the newspaper right, or film in locations that look at least remotely like connecticut.
