being a wrestling fan, movies about wrestling generally suck (backyard dogs, bodyslam, jesse ventura story) but this one isn't the worst i've ever seen. yes its bad but its better than some of the others i've mentioned.<br /><br />hulk hogan stars as basically himself and for some reason, a rival network wants to beat him up because he doesn't want to be on that network. let me explain it so everyone can understand....picture usa network having rip...and tnt will go to any lengths to get him.<br /><br />does this make sense...no? well don't feel bad because it doesn't make sense. nor does it make sense to have a legit ex con have a real fight with rip at the end of the movie.<br /><br />none of this movie makes much sense but compared to other wrestling movies and later hogan films its not so bad.<br /><br />4 out of 10
