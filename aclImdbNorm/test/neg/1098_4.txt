this movie is very much like every other modern horror movie. it's predictable in the way it gets build up and progresses and just never succeeds in bringing anything original or shocking to the screen. that's really the biggest disappointment of the movie, that overall still had a promising main concept for a movie of its sort.<br /><br />you can call this movie a big walking modern horror movie clich'e. it has all of the elements in it that make modern horror movies often not so very great ones to watch. one of these aspects is a moaning and very naive little kid. why do they keep putting this sort of stuff in movies? same goes for the sort of drama aspects, that involves the family. it just doesn't work out for the movie and is far from interesting or effective. it often instead causes the movie to drag in parts and become an annoying one to watch. <br /><br />so it has all of the clich'es present but it also doesn't succeed at bringing any of these clich'es well to the screen. as an horror movie this simply is a very poor one. it doesn't handle its horror or tension very well. for the fans of the genre there is very little to enjoy. the movie its story isn't too well connected and build up within the movie. too often the movie sleeps in at parts and it doesn't ever allow its horror to fully kick in.<br /><br />the movie is also often way too dark (no doubt as an attempt to hide its fairly low budget) and it shows very little gore as well, mostly due to the fact that you simply can not always see things so very well.<br /><br />you can just tell by looking at this movie that director j.s. cardone doesn't has much talent for the genre and doesn't know how to handle its present ingredients properly. he did some attempts in the past but all of his movies have failed so far. he just keeps trying unfortunately. who knows, perhaps with the right people behind the camera's (like tobe hooper, who was initially attached to direct) this movie still could had been something decent.<br /><br />it's a poorly cast movie, with mostly big unknowns in it. biggest name of the movie is ben cross but his role is just way too small and in a way also not really relevant enough for the movie and its story. it didn't even seemed like he had much fun playing.<br /><br />just skip it.<br /><br />4/10
