a blatant rip-off of "air bud", this movie is really about parents worrying too much about parenting. all the foibles of the characters (eg; adult coaches who dont know the game) are taken to the extreme- so much so that they are totally unbelievable, not funny.<br /><br />there is no semblance of reality here, folks and you'll not develop sympathy for any of the characters.<br /><br />the best thing about the movie is the good looking kits (uniforms) of the opposing team in the first game the dog plays. perhaps chosen because the setting is supposedly near arlington heights, il, the home of the columbus crew's franchise player, brian mcbride.
