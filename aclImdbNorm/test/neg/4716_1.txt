i swear, i had never seen such a bad movie as half caste is. not only because it just makes no sense, is a huge piece of egolatry and self-confidence that makes me puke.<br /><br />sebastian apocada (in spanish apocada has a similar pronunciation to "apocado" which means "out of life and happiness") makes here a one man army movie thinking he is sam raimi or the boys who directed the blair witch project. this is the blair kittie project, with an expensive low budget.<br /><br />the story, a couple of american filmmakers that go to africa to make a documentary of the half caste, is just no-sense. the way of filming, inserting high speed shots with slow motion shots, just revolts your stomach more than the stupid lines (what the hell is that dialog about bestiality?) or the lame performances. by the way, i don't believe this cast (or caste?) is american, they all look european to me.<br /><br />to finish this, just say that the filmmakers made an intelligent move about selling the movie. they put a fake award achievement (as most original film) and a nice cover (in spain the cover had the half caste image in negative), so i feel now unhappy, because i can't demand my 14 euros back.
