what a boring movie. while it did have humorous parts, it was just plain boring and lengthy (for a 90 minute movie). i believe that the cause was a lack of action.<br /><br />when i rented this movie, i expected to see white blood cells combat the evil viruses, but no such luck. it was more that the virus was thwarted than defeated.<br /><br />the movie had promise, but since made for little kiddies in mind, it did not meet its potential, in my opinion.
