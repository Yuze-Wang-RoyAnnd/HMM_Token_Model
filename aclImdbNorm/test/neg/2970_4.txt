42/100. often referred as "tarzan with clothes on", but it's not at all in the same league as his far superior tarzan series. basically, the jungle jim series became a tarzan replacement for johnny weismuller, after he started getting too out of shape for a loincloth. in jungle jim, he is fully clothed. it can't compare to the tarzan series in any way, not in acting, screenplays or quality of production. it's pretty hokey stuff. this one is the first the best in the series, and that isn't saying much. too much stock footage is used, and it is so obvious. the score is overdone, and the plot is lame and the production is so poor it makes it hard to watch at times.
