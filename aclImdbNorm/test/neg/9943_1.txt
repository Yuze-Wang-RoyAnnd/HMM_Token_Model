i've watched hundreds of kung fu movies and i've heard some good thing about this movie, so i decided to give it a try. what i saw was one of the worst displays of movie making i've ever seen.<br /><br />i can't help but feel like the director want to have every muscle guy in hong kong in this movie. everyone overacts to the point of stupidity. even conan the barbarian had some civility. this movie just has half-evolved men screaming in every scene and stupid women who has no self-respect. the narrator's character should've be killed for sucking so much...she really didn't deserve to live til the end. the entire movie was a melodramatic mess, with horrible acting, bad directing and bad action. they should've just rename this movie to 'the stupid one-armed caveman with a blade" here's a question...why do some director use quick cuts for some action movies? answer: to can hide the deficiencies of the actors. nearly every scene was close up and quickly cut without any kind of flow. the movie tried so hard to show intensity, but it became almost laughable. please stay away from this movie it you have any kind of taste in kung-fu movies...or any taste in movies.
