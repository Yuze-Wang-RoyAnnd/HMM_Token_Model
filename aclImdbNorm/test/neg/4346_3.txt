not "confusing" in the sense that, "gee, this movie is really complex, and thus hard to follow!" but confusing in the sense that, "gee, this movie really has no idea what it's doing!"<br /><br />dream of a warrior is a hong kong/south korean collaboration, but it's all utter nonsense. a movie about parallel universes mixed in with time travel mixed in with love story mixed in with silliness.<br /><br />the film has the type of concept that boggles the mind. again, not boggles the mind because it's so great and complex, but boggles in the sense that it's so ridiculous and one can't conceive of anyone ever coming up with such an awful premise to begin with.<br /><br />nothing in dream of a warrior makes sense, and that's because the whole movie should never have been made. it is quite awful. the only saving grace is the actress who plays the female warrior (not the female lead).<br /><br />3 out of 10.
