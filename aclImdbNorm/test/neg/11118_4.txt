without john rhys-davies, i have to admit that this would never even register on my movie-meter. but in spite of that single fact, this is not a bad little thriller, considering the low budget, the low quality effects, the stiff acting and the sci fi channel aspects. the blood effects are very convincing, and the chupacabra actually looks realistic... regardless of what you think a chupacabra looks like this is one good-looking chupacabra.<br /><br />aside from the positives, this runs kind of like kolchak: the night stalker (darren mcgavin, remember?) meets the love boat, but in spite of the ultimate cheese of this work, it still holds something resembling a plot, and actually attempts to gain your respect while making you laugh and roll your eyes.<br /><br />as conflicted as this work is, i still managed to find some enjoyment herein. maybe you will, too.<br /><br />it rates a 5.2/10 on the made 4 tv scale.<br /><br />it rates a 4.1/10 on the movie scale from...<br /><br />the fiend :.
