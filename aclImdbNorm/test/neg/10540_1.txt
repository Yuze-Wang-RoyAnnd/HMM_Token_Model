the best thing about the movie is the name, as it both describes the plot and the acting. at least they cannot say they didn't warn you... kind of like the button labeled, "don't push this".<br /><br />segal must have run out of things that move like planes, trains, and ships but the plot remains the same. under cover guy who fights slowly, but still beats like 40 mercenary types and doesn't even blink when doing so. what amazes me is that segal is now as big as a barn and the bad guys still cannot hit him in a hallway with a machine gun and 50 clips of ammo. where do all these bullets actually go to? the only redeeming feature of this movie is watching nia peeples pound ja rule (real name jeffrey atkins doesn't quite sound so punk) into the floor. i could spend days watching that woman kick her foot over her shoulder like that... especially wearing an outfit like that! it was just a bonus watching jeffy get is *ss kicked, and fun hoping one of those kicks actually landed. sorry, it's just time we get stupid wannabe tough guy can't act rappers out of the movies. pleeeeease! who came up with idea anyway? i'd lay odds it was the person who decided that cameron diaz and drew barrymore would pass as witty athletic angels.<br /><br />the only surprising twist in this movie is that they don't do the politically correct thing and have jeffy come in and save the day. no doubt if snoop (otherwise known by his momma as calvin broadus which again doesn't sound so cool when you refer to him as cal) had been in the movie, he'd throw some signs down on her and probably saved segal's life or something.
