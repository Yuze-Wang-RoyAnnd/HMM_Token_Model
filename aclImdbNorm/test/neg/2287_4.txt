this is more than just an adaptation of bond: it's a plain rip off! with mediocre character sketches that ian fleming would not have approved of, this film goes down as the worst 007 movie. an older (even haggard) connery tries to relive his past 12 years later. the result is a humourless, tacky version of the classic hero. give me roger moore any day!
