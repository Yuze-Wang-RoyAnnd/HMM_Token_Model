"tenchi muyo in love 2" is the third tenchi movie. it seemed that its creators took elements from the first two to make this one. at the risk of giving out spoilers, tenchi is kidnapped and the team has to get him back. nothing new there. a past love of yosho's is the bad guy. that was done in the second movie. the battle between aeka and ryoko and is starting to get boring. the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy. i personally don't know what aic, it's makers, were thinking. i gave this movie a vote of 4.
