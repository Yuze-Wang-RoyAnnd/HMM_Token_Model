i saw this film because calexico did the score. a real disappointment. annoying, trendy scenes, with urban hipsters and their cliche hip lifestyles. cheesy stereotypical mexican border culture (mystic grandfather with the rattlesnake and potions, granddaughter in her mariachi-style restaurant getup). a few laughs, but hipper-than-thou, and sorely lacking in vision and basic filmmaking talent.
