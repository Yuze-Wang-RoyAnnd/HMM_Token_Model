gave it two stars because the dvd cover was good enough to make me buy this piece of horse manure. i paid a dollar for it at the local dvd exchange and i want my money back. i have a couple of good movies(at least i think they're good) that have never seen the inside of a video store. after seeing this, i'm really insulted by that. light years worse than anything i've ever seen, i can't even recommend this as a campy joke movie. it is so bad, instead of making you laugh it makes you angry. how did this awful film find any kind of distro? i can only believe it was self distributed as the amateurish dvd authoring would suggest. to the producers of this "movie" get out of the business, it's obvious you have no talent for it.
