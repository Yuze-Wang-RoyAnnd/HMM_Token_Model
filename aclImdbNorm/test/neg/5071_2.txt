i'd love to write a little summary of this movie's plot, but...there simply isn't one! if you just take a look at the plot keywords for this title, you pretty much know the entire content of the film: sex, breasts, exploitation, female frontal nudity and women's prison! 80 minutes of pure sleaze and nothing more. "escape of the island women" (an alternate title that isn't even listed here) clearly wanted to become another notorious and controversial woman-in-prison classic, but it totally lacks the brutality of one. wip-flicks are meant to blend graphic sexual images with shocking violence, but the violence here has just been replaced with more sex. director erwin dietrich surely can't compete with specialists in the field, like jess franco or joe d'amato, and he should have sticked to making ordinary soft-core flicks. the only aspects that slightly look like cult-cinema are the resemblance of the tyrant-president with fidel castro and the group-rape of a (minor?) girl by soldiers. the girls are ravishing, though, and the ibiza filming location looks very enchanting.
