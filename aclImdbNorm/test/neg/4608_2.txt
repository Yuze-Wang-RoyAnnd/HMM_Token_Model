i would have given this movie a 1, but i laughed so hard, so many times, that i had to give it a little credit, in the off off off off chance the film was supposed to be funny. a movie so bad you'll think chimps wrote it. you'll wish chimps had written it. dialogue so canned that only it and the cockroaches will survive the coming nuclear holocaust. the movie exaggerates its awfulness by intersplicing scenes from the original carrie (a really good film) into scenes from this one. like intersplicing scenes from taxi driver into baby geniuses. do not rent it alone, as you will not enjoy the experience. you will need someone next to you to confirm the badness of what you are viewing. worst actress of the millenium goes to poor poor amy irving as the stone-faced, monotone, disastrously wooden school counselor. worst movie of the year so far (see also _arlington road_). --frink-3
