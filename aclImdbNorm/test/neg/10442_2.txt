now out of all the shark movies i've seen, this one takes the cake! the plot of the movie was good, but the excitement factor sort of took a nosedive afterwards. antonio sobato, jr. does an excellent role as a son who seeks the shark who killed his father. a megaldon is one of the biggest sharks of all and the most dangerous one as well. the view of the shark was indeed scary in some angles, but the effects were a blur, and the scenes were a little weak in some places. with the mini-sub's weapons there, that would take out a whole school of sharks there. it was great that the son would get the exact revenge on that monstrosity, although it would indeed cost him his life as well. like they say revenge has it's price, but was it worth it? that answer could go on and on, and this movie was a major letdown. the beginning was fine, and at the end, it went like the titanic. 1 out of 5 stars!
