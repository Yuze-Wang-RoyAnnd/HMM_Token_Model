this is a woeful hollywood remake of a classic british film. everything that made the original "italian job" entertaining has been bled out of this festering sore of a movie "scripted" by donna and wayne powers and listlessly "directed" by f gary gray. i am amazed that troy kennedy martin (the screenwriter of the original film) allowed his name to be used in the credits for this pig's ear. martin has worked on some of the finest film and tv projects of the last 40-odd years. even being vaguely associated with this stinker is not a good thing.<br /><br />the humour is forced, the drama is laboured, all the characters are cookie-cutter likable crims (with the exception of charlize theron's implausible, beautiful safe cracker/rally driver)and the plot only matches the original on the following points:<br /><br />(1) three minis (the modern bmw-made versions, but minis nonetheless)<br /><br />(2) use of the names croker and bridger for 2 of the main characters<br /><br />(3) disrupting a city's traffic control system to provide a safe route through it.<br /><br />(4) er, that's it.<br /><br />otherwise, what you get is a bland and implausible american by-the-numbers heist movie in which a gang of jolly pirate chums eventually get the better of their evil associate. believe me, it feels like an awful long time before they do. the cast do their best with what they're given but it seems that they all accepted it as a turd-polishing exercise after reading the script. none of the original film's quirky nature and distinctly british flavour has survived being fed into the hollywood hamburger machine. <br /><br />do yourself a favour and watch the original 1969 movie instead of this sucking chest wound. it's a wonder that noel coward hasn't done an aunt nelly, jumped out of his grave and kicked the teeth of everyone involved in this tepid remake halfway down their throats.<br /><br />italian job? more like italian jobbie.
