it's complete nonsense. i've studied nazism and read many manuscripts from the day - the "parallels" use most of the classic debased apocryphal myths of nazism and then compare it with complete specious generalizations about what constitute 1/3 of the planet. it's crafted for an audience of polly-anna complacency who diet heavily on spoon-fed gibberish, horribly thought out arguments, irrational conclusions, fallacious ideas, and nonsensical logic.<br /><br />who made this hit peace? easy.<br /><br />when all is said and done; que bono? that is, who benefits, in the long run?<br /><br />you don't. you sacrifice money and rights. muslims don't, they get our bombs. try again. answer this, and you've unlocked a major door.
