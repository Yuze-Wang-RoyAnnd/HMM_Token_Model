debra winger's 1987 "black widow" is much better.<br /><br />this is like a lame version, and jane seymour usually does better.<br /><br />chad allen is pretty poor in this too. just playing his usual role as a boring rebellious child.<br /><br />maybe the both of them being from dr. quinn was supposed to make us get excited.<br /><br />if it's on, go grab a copy of "black widow".
