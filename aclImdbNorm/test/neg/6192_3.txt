it is a movie which sheds the light on the begging of the palestinian struggle against the israeli occupation of palestine but it does not show the real feelings of the people back then and how they were tricked into believing that they could return to their home soon , it does not mention the massacres committed by the jews like der yassine and how they tortured and killed and destroyed the family of any palestinian freedom fighter it lacks the credibility about the real palestinian struggle and about anything palestinian , however it has something about the suffering of palestinian citizens ending up as refugees in the nearby arab countries , the movie focuses on the story of the man in coma he is now in the present time and through his story we see the film . the movie is just telling the life of one person and has some nudity scenes which are irrelevant to the story.
