i saw this on sci fi, and in retrospect, i'm not sure how i actually managed to watch it all the way through. this is utter trash. it's not a b movie, it's a "d movie" at best.<br /><br />basically this grim reaper looking thing on a horse (and sometimes not on one) goes killing everything in it's path somewhere in the mid west of america. a load of people are missing (infact murdered) and a bunch of mismatched spec op soldier types go looking for them. the best part of this movie, i'll tell it now, is there's some really cute girls. let me now spoil this by telling you that all but the least cute one get their heads either chopped off, slashed apart, or hit so hard with a m^el'ee weapon that the head explodes off. that's no spoiler... the gore in this movie is over the top and really grotesque. it serves no real purpose, either.<br /><br />here's what's good: the sets look ok, the actors sometimes act ok, the outfits and props, some of them, are decent.<br /><br />everything else that you can think of, sucks. a lot of the badness is in the editing. some times it just switches over from a rapid action scene to a real quiet and dormant scene. sometimes the characters do non-understandable things, and they're always splitting up, but not even in a way that the viewer can follow. looks like they get split up without realizing it amongst themselves but they also all seem to know that they're splitting up all the time and are ok with it even tho they're in a really dangerous situation and there's bodies all over the place and people are dying right and left. nothing in this movie is the least bit plausible, most of it is incoherent and confusing, and i don't really get how this immortal, indestructible bad guy killer was able to be stopped in the end, and frankly, i don't care. too much stupid, hilariously bad nonsense happens during this movie and i don't really care to list it all here. and they're all so serious throughout the whole ordeal when it's almost laughably bad... just awful.<br /><br />this movie is a complete waste of time. there's no excuse for watching this, unless the only channel you happen to receive is scifi and you're bound to a chair in front of the tv. but if you're not bound, you're better off doing a crossword, throwing a frisbee, or even just thinking. there's lots of much better b movies that you can watch.<br /><br />my senior year in high school my friend and i, in visual communication and deign class, made a long movie trailer type deal for our own movie (there was no full movie, just a really long trailer) and we did a better job of filming and editing the piece with premiere. it was better work than this movie. that really says something about this and i'm puzzled and troubled as to why sci fi would show anything like this when there are so many good low rate movies they can show.<br /><br />the only movie that i've ever endured that was worse than this is raptor island (another brilliant scifi work)-though it had smoother and more followable flow than this movie- but this comes very close and is definitely 2nd on my list of worst movies i've ever seen.
