awful, awful, awful times a hundred still doesn't begin to describe how crappy "biggest loser" is. picture this: take two fat couples with nothing interesting to say, humiliate them, and let them work to lose weight, all on prime time television. am i the only one who thinks that this isn't something people with iqs in the 3-digit area want to watch? everything drags on forever, with the lumps of lard whining on about how losing weight is going to mean so much for them and their lives. does anyone care? do they think we care? do they care if we care? probably not. i think i'll videotape myself doing crunches and sell it to some major television corporation. if this passes for television, then so can my workouts!
