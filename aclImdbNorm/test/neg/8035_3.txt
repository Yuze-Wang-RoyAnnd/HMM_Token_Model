on the way home from a day at the beach, four young people seek shelter from a torrential downpour at the home of lord and lady alexander after their car runs out of gas. they don't know it, but the house they're staying in is to be the site of a satanic ritual. jane (camille keaton), the only female of the group, is to be sacrificed. as her male companions rush to her aid, one of them accidentally kills lady alexander. things really get out of hand and everyone else attending the black mass is also killed. the four try to make an escape, but soon discover there's no escape from what they've witnessed. one by one, they meet their fates.<br /><br />gong into tragic ceremony, i was positive i would enjoy it. slow-burn gothic horror is right up my alley. i'm also quite fond of some of riccardo freda's other movies like the horrible dr. hichcock, the ghost, and i vampiri. tragic ceremony seemed to be a sure thing. unfortunately, things don't always work out the way they should. the biggest tragedy with respect to tragic ceremony is the time i spent watching this mess of a movie. with a few minor exceptions, nothing about the film appealed to me or worked for me. the characters are unlikeable, the plot is incoherent and schizophrenic, and the pacing is terrible. there's a subplot about some cursed pearls that goes nowhere and only serves to confuse things even further. in addition, nothing interesting happens for most of the movie. by the time the four leads realize they're in danger, i was well past the point of caring. and i don't understand the reviews i've read that praise the acting of camille keaton. i suppose it's a terrific performance if you consider an emotionless daze to be acting. the three male leads are the very definition of nondescript. they do nothing to stand out. the supporting cast includes some genre favorites like luigi pistilli, luciana paluzzi, and paul muller, but none is given anything to do. in fact muller's main contribution is a two minute long monologue at the end of the movie that attempts to explain what happened in the previous 80 or so minutes. it's a weak attempt to provide a wrap-up to a very weak movie.
