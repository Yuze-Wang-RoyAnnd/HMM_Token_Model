john madden's cinematic interpretation of edith wharton's ethan frome falls short of doing justice to a great literary piece. while the story is maintained the elements that give the novella its soul are skewered and all in all lost in the film. madden fails to convey the innocence, and overall tragedy of ethan and mattie's relationship instead transforming it into a morality tale. the mark is missed and the point lost in added details and poor dialog. zeena (zenobia) in the book is almost completely the antagonist, the books least sympathetic figure, where in the movie she can be almost pitied though it's a stretch you kind of feel bad for this sick woman who is being cheated on. the book more accurately describes zeena's tyrannical control of the house and of ethan. the movie just ticked me off. the addition of the fox was pointless, as well as the scene with mattie trying to kill herself. it was just poorly interpreted and done. film mistakes: ethan's elusiveness in the church dance scene, interactions with denis eady, addition of love scene, fox scene, store scene, saying his plans allowed, lack of displays of ethan's inner emotions and thoughts, introduction of the priest instead of nameless engineer, let on to much that zeena knows about the growing relationship where in novel reader never knows what zeena is thinking or aware of. just too many flaws and poor directing decisions.
