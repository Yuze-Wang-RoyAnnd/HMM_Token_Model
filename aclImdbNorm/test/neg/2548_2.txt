i rented the matrix revisited with a friend of mine. we both loved the matrix and we both love filmmaking so we wanted to see what was going on behind the scenes of the matrix. it turns out that the matrix revisited tells you hardly anything about the art of filmmaking or even how the matrix was made. it is basically a huge commercial for the matrix, a movie that the target audience of the matrix revisited has already seen!<br /><br />if you really want to know about the process and the troubles and the stress and the detail that went into making of the matrix, look no further than the bonus features on the original dvd of the matrix. there are things they show in those documentaries that i had not even realized had to be done or was done. the matrix was such a difficult and challenging film to make that it deserves more credit than a "documentary" that's about as informative and interesting as an mtv special.
