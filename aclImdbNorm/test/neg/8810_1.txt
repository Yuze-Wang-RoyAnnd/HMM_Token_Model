danny glover and carey elwes obviously forgot how to act when they made this movie, the acting is absolutely atrocious. the pay-off is even worse. i feel sorry for danny glover, i hope he got paid well for this because it makes him look completely foolish, the same goes for mr. elwes.an absolute slap in the face to any horror movie fan. despicable. this is probably the worst display of acting by veteran actors i have ever seen. i wonder if they bothered to look at the script, or if they did it must have said "forget everything you know about acting" because this makes the two of them look ridiculous. for two seasoned veterans to act this way is appalling, i hope the pay check was very large, i thought, at first, it was a spoof. if you can find satisfaction in this movie then more power to you.
