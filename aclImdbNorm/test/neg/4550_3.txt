if you like soap-series, you might like this film. i recommend this film to fans of dutch soap-series like gtst, westenwind or even american stuff like the bold & the beautiful. if you don't like that stuff: stay away from this movie. it has the same kind of visual style, the same quality of acting, direction and writing.the film was a big hit at home territory, but wasn't sold anywhere else outside holland and belgium. pretty strange for a commercial film like this.<br /><br />maybe it says something....
