the emperor's new groove was a great twist for disney. it wasn't a musical! it had clean, fresh jokes and no political twists. it was just a darn funny movie.<br /><br />kronk's new groove, on the other hand, is tired and weak. my 3-year-old still loves emperor's new groove, but fell asleep during kronk's. there really isn't any really conflict (that, in the first movie, lead to all of the wacky adventures). because of the lack of conflict, it almost seems like the animators threw out the writers and just made the storyline up as they went along.<br /><br />i kept waiting for something to happen that would make the movie fun . . . and still am.
