i agree with the user "specialagentfoxmulder" that this episode is awful- posisbly thr worst of the entire show. now i'm not keen on many episodes of the later series but this one takes the biscuit! it was unfunny and unoffensive. as for the ending, i'm sorry but it disgusted me more than any other episodes combined.<br /><br />i mean, the boys think they meant well but the ending was so upsetting- that they think the whale belongs on the moon and over the credits, we see it has died. wht could have saved the episode was if the pranksters were able to confess for what they did.<br /><br />there seem to be no outgoing message. okay, south park may be guilty of preaching too much and its always nice to see an unpreachign one (such as make love not warcraft") but this episode was just wrong! avoid at all costs! helen xxxxx
