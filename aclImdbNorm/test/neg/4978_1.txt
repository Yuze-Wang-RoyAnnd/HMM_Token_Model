when i heard disney had the rights to "underdog",i figured at the very least it would be a cool pixar partnership affair,and we'd get a great adults & kids film like "the incredibles". alas...i forgot how disney must dumb down classic material for today's dumbed down youth. what were they thinking? "underdog" was a product of the 60's,your prime fanbase is in their 40's and 50's,why would you refocus it to 5 year olds? it should have been done ala "roger rabbit",half animated half real. instead we get characters like riff raff ( a wolf!! ) dumbed into another dog."underdog" can't have an "energy pill",as we're now so "enlightened" it would obviously be a steroid or drugs reference.the only good casting was patrick warburton as "cad" because he actually sorta resembles the cartoon version. otherwise,old school "underdog" fans should avoid this like the plague it is. what next? a live action version of "the go-go gophers" disguised as a re-visionist history lesson? ( my advanced apologies if disney jumps on this! )
