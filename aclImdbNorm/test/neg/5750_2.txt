well, now that all of the director/ productions company's friends and relations have posted their shill reviews after seeing this at various festivals, i guess it's time to show reviews written by people who actually paid 10 bucks to see it.<br /><br />like the director's "dear jesse" (the only other one of his films i have seen), "loggerheads" suffers from a lack of focus and too many ideas crammed into an indie budget. i swear, this guy might have better luck doing miniseries. i kept waiting for the various plot threads to come together, but they only intercepted at points blatantly forshadowed in a way obvious to all but the most dense viewer. it was like watching a season of lifetime made-for-tv movies crammed into one, long (did i say looong) sketch on the old "carol burnett" show. maybe an enterprising male suitor could take his girlfriend to see this and then exclaim "hey...remember all of the chick flicks we went to last year...the one about the adoptive mother...the one about the gay guy...the one about the christian housewife. we went to three chick flicks last year; so now we have to go see terminator 4!" i guess one has to do anything to cast a familiar actor to get funding, but what oh what is bonnie hunt doing in this flick? she isn't exactly known as a dramatic actress, and this attempted "performance" won't be sending mr. oscar to her door. i mean (speaking of lifetime original movies), wasn't valerie bertinelli or farah fawcett available? ms. hunt has always come off to me as cold, maybe she should have played the other mom? i wish i would have chosen "capote" to fill my weekly gay-themed indie allowance..oh well, maybe next week. i think there is a good reason why capote is playing at tons of theatres all over the nyc area and this one is playing at only one; let the distributors faith in this flick assure to to run in the opposite direction if you don't trust this review!
