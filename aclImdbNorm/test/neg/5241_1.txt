<br /><br />i've seen this movie during a festival here in munich with a huge crowd of real fantasy fans. at about the middle of the movie one part of the audience was sleeping and the other part was booeing. boring dialogues, badly choreographed fighting sequences, a terribly dumb story and even worse special effects. well, at least the actors hadn't much to do, except for looking concerned or (in case they were female) showing their breasts in the right light. even g"otz otto, who was among the audience admitted afterwards that ge could understand the disappointment of the viewers. be warned, folks, of the cheapest fantasy movie ever........
