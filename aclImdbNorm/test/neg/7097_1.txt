this is one entertaining flick. i suggest you rent it, buy a couple quarts of rum, and invite the whole crew over for this one. my favorite parts were.1. the gunfights that were so well choreographed that john woo himself was jealous, .2. the wonderful special effects .3. the academy award winning acting and .4. the fact that every single gangsta in the film seemed to be doing a bad "scarface" impersonation. i mean, master p as a cuban godfather! this is groundbreaking territory. and with well written dialogue including lines like "the only difference between you and me rico, is i'm alive and your dead," this movie is truly a masterpiece. yeah right.
