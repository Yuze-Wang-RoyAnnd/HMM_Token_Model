this movie has got to be about one of the worst i have ever seen. the humor was crude, hardly funny and been heard a million times before. the start was noting special and it got worse and worse as it went on. i got about halfway through and couldn't stand to watch any more of it. luckily i was only watching it on tv so it didn't cost anything, but i seriously recommend you do not waste you time or your money.<br /><br />nothing in the movie was new. the characters were not at all developed. i actually think it would have been better as a little kids movie in that it was full of stupid unrealistic "funny" events occurring ... thats like what happens in home alone or something. not to imply home alone was in any way as terrible as this.
