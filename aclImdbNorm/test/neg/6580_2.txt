i do think tom hanks is a good actor. i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little. i was very disappointed in the movie. one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard. there is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene. there are some characters and scenes that seem scary for little children for whom this movie was made. the north pole scenes with santa and the elves could have been cute and charming. there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters. it usually doesn't work to make a short children's book into a feature film. this movie totally grates on my nerves.
