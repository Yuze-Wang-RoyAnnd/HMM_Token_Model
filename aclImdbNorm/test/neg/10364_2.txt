every time i see a film like this i get sick to my stomach. when i watch a movie i like to see what i see in everyday life. as i go through my day i see blacks, whites, asians, latinos etc...how do you cast a film and don't even think of the possibility that other ethnic groups will walk past you? i'm sure they didn't do it on purpose but pay attention. i don't care if it takes place in kansas or south central. all i saw was one token black. this was typical in the 80's. hey! it's 2007, with all the rappers, singers and athletes working as actors thomas haden church could have paid more attention to his cast. aren't actors supposed to be more liberal?
