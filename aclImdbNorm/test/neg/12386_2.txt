ok, this 'horror' film was meant to be a joke, right? please tell me it was supposed to be a joke, then i'll understand.<br /><br />a big cawing bird with giant claws - or one claw, anyway - swoops down on unsuspecting folks on the ground and gobbles them up. mara corday and jeff morrow sufficiently overact in order to keep things interesting, but at least you'll enjoy a hearty snicker when you see the 'monster'. it looks like a cross between a deranged chicken and mortimer snerd.<br /><br />either director fred sears just made this picture in a hurry and knew the bird looked utterly ridiculous, or he really thought his film and creature were genuinely frightening. i prefer to think - and hope - it was the former.<br /><br />p.s. the bird needs a haircut.
