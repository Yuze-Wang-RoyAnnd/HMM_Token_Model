so we're supposed to find it funny that this woman travels all the way to the jungle - to the warzone - just to find out why her fianc'ee didn't travel to switzerland? or are we supposed to take it seriously? it's not even remotely funny, clever or entertaining - it's stupid - and so is the movie. the lead actress is one of the most annoying characters i have ever seen in a movie - even worse than jar-jar binks. dialog tries very hard to be funny (almost all the time) but it never is. the number of funny jokes is somewhere between zero and nothing. and as for the plot - did they even once bothered to explain to us what are the rebels fighting for (other than being anti-government)? i guess that didn't matter to anyone - neither to the rebels nor to the characters who just blindly flew to the battlefield. don't waste your time. "coronado" is neither funny nor entertaining.
