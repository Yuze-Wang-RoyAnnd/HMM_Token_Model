i won't reiterate what so many others have said about this film; i'll try to add a few new points. the coolio-as-vampire bit is a nod to fans who are familiar with his turn on the blondie song "no exit" in which he assumes the role of a rapping vampire (it actually works as a musical concept and is in fact a great song). casper van dien is no worse than brad pitt and is actually more handsome. and really what does anyone go to a brad pitt movie for other than eye candy? same here, although this is poorly filmed (check out "starship troopers" instead). and of course udo kier, after having played dracula in the morrissey/warhol film, has little more than a cameo. enjoy it if you can.
