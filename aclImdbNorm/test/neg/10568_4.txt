i was more entertained by watching my wife almost pull her hair out in frustration through most of this movie. i thought something that would tie it all together would be just around the corner of the dairy barn any minute. so i cheated, grabbed the remote, and was relieved to find out it was ending in merely 20 minutes. i should have turned the channel. cute, it had potential, but yuck!
