after the opening credits over a black sheet of paper with spots of white paint sprayed onto it, oh ok i'll be generous and call it a star field, we witness an alien spacecraft crashing into a meteorite and being forced to land on earth. a terrible looking model spacecraft lands on a terrible looking model field. three nearby campers investigate. from the burning spacecraft a reptile like looking alien, the 'nightbeast' emerges, ok so i lied it's a guy in a dodgy rubber monster mask and silver spacesuit. the campers are quickly killed by the nighbeast's laser gun which shoots awful special effects at people. the towns sheriff jack cinder (tom griffith) is informed. he alerts his deputy lisa kent (karin kardian) and gathers a posse of men together to investigate. meanwhile the nightbeast has killed an unlucky motorist who stopped on the side of the road for a leak. his two annoying kids run for help. they approach a house, inside two young people are kissing, the girl says "someones running towards the house". the guy gets up to take a look and is attacked and gutted by the nightbeast, it kills the girl as well. then it manages to kill the two kids with his laser, maybe the nightbeast ain't so bad after all. once the sheriff and his men arrive at the scene they have a gun/laser battle with the nightbeast. after possibly the most unexciting gun fight in film history only the sheriff, his deputy and a local man jamie lambert (jamie zemarel) survive. but the nightbeast is still alive, bullets seem to have no effect on it. the next day the sheriff visits the towns mayor, bert wicker (richard dyszel) and his girlfriend mary jane (eleanor herman) to get permission to evacuate everyone in the town. he refuses saying a party he is holding for the governor (richard ruxton) cannot be cancelled, and that he doesn't want to create a panic situation. the sheriff evacuates the town anyway. two doctors, steven price (george stover) and ruth sherman (anne firth) are attacked by the nightbeast before they can leave. however, they manage to scare the nightbeast away and survive. together with the sheriff his deputy and jamie they decide to stay behind and fight the alien. written and directed by don dohler this has to be an amateur film, made with family and friends, look at the credits and see how many dohler's are involved. for that reason i should probably cut it some slack but that still doesn't stop it, or excuse it from being a throughly awful film in every department. it has no story or purpose, things just happen to waste time, whats with drago (don leifert) strangling his ex girlfriend suzie (monica neff)? this and many more scenes add nothing to the film. the script has no logic either, why does the nightbeast stick around the town once it's been supposedly evacuated? the special effects are embarrassingly bad, just look at the effect when the nightbeast shoots someone with his laser, a computer effect an 80's spectrum would be ashamed of. there's not really much blood or gore in it, a ripped open stomach, a severed arm and a decapitation but they all look predictably poor. credit where it's due, the nightbeast itself looks alright for the most part. there's a sex scene between the sheriff and his deputy which has to be seen to be believed, music that even a porno would be embarrassed about and two really ugly naked people make this a difficult sequence to watch. less than stellar acting, photography, music, lighting and editing make it a real chore to sit through. and the worse thing about this film? it commits the mortal sin of being boring and not fun in the slightest. sorry don mate, but don't give up the day job! definitely one to avoid.
