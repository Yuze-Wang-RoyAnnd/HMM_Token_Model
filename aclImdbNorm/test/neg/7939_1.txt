this was perhaps the worst movie i've seen in a long, long time. forget that it's clear no research was done regarding detroit (forest in downtown detroit! bwahaha!!). the writing was horrible, the premise completely implausible, and quite frankly, the characters were embarrassing. i cannot for the life of me understand why seasoned actors would stoop to such a low and participate in something this god awful. now, i have never seen the original and don't know if this movie pays tribute to it's original form. it's my understanding that the original was not set in detroit. why they would deviate from that without researching details about the setting only tells me that it was more than the cast that was looking to pay the rent. <br /><br />don't waste your time on this junk, unless you're from detroit and wish for some comic relief.
