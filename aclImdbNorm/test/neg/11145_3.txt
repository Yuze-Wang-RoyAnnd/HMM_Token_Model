all the hype! all the adds! i was bummed that i missed this on the big screen. where this film worked was in the little details. in everything else it failed. arnold has done so many better performances in the past few years. i thought the days of commando and last action hero were gone from our lives. sadly this film panders to the lowest common denominator and reduces arnold to a bellowing, grunting, face contorting muscle that just knows how to shoot guns and blow things up. in a cliche last moment (and at one other time), that was predictable from the start, we see a glimmer of the actor that has proven he is more than what he got paid for early in his career. i was unimpressed with the film as it never broke new ground or went anywhere but where you expected it to.
