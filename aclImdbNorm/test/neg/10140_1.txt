reba sucks. it sucks hard. it's about this awful country singer attempting comedy. they might as well call this show "generic", because that's what it is. it's dumb and generic. reba, you're not funny, and i'm glad your retarded show was cancelled because you suck, and so does brock, barbra jean, the red-headed teenager, that jockey guy, and the 12 year old who got knocked up. you all suck, and none of you are funny. oh, and i heard a rumor that reba is actually a gay devil-worshipper who idolizes hitler and tortures animals. and she puts subliminal messages on her show and in her "music" in hopes to make children kill their parents and kill themselves! but it was just a rumor. anyway, this is the worst show ever, reba is gay, i do not like her, i think the office is better than this show, and this show sucks.
