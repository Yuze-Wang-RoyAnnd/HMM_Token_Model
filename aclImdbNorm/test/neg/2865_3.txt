i have really enjoyed several movies by g'erard depardieu and expected i'd like this movie a lot more than i did. the biggest reason was that i just didn't find the movie very interesting or funny--so, it didn't hold my interest. also, although he does not sleep with his headstrong daughter, the idea that she is lying by telling everyone that he is her much older lover is just plain icky! yes, i know there is no incest and i know that nobody around them knows he really is her father, but i found that any kid passing her dad off as her sexual paramour is too yucky and prevents the movie from truly being funny. in addition, i really didn't like this little brat very much. apart from her lies, she seemed very sassy and self-involved. i would have preferred if somehow she'd gotten her "come-uppance" and somehow been punished, as i just didn't like her.
