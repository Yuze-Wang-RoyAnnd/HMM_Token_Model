************* spoilers below ************* "'night, mother" is the story of jesse (sissy spacek), a divorced epileptic woman who calmly announces to her brash mother (anne bancroft) that she's going to commit suicide. this is a fascinating premise that is drained of all vitality and excitement. the brilliant hook turns out to be a cheat- the story that follows is lacking in substance, gravity and revelatory value. where are the shocks and surprises as mother and daughter have what may be the last conversation of their lives? where are the secrets revealed, the confessions and fantasies and regrets? they're here, but they've all been painted the same dull color that keeps emotion in the background and celebrates the 'genius' of playwright marsha norman at the expense of everything else. the result is not a film but an exhausting endurance test.<br /><br />let me preface my comments by saying i find sissy spacek to be one of the greatest actresses in the history of motion pictures, a woman so magnetic, so natural that she continues to surprise and amaze me after twenty years of stardom. she brings a touch of class and magic to everything she does, and i've seen her rescue more than one film from the recycling bin with her angelic face and vulnerable eyes, her soft voice and sweet smile. it was because of the great spacek that i watched this film in the first place, and for one of her movies to be terrible it has to fail in a significant way. this film fails in two.<br /><br />first and foremost the film is adapted so faithfully from the pulitzer-winning stage play that it is claustrophobic and repetitive. the entire movie is a two-woman dialogue between jesse and her mother. what worked on stage- a middle-aged mother and daughter argue for two hours in small house- dies on film. a play, no matter how great, needs to be *adapted* for the screen
