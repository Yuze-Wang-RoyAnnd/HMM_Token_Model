just been on sci-fi channel uk, 5th july, its was ****. shame on jrd! may be he was bored one week ! he cant be skint after lotr. i suppose he wasn't to blame. mr sheppird was. i turned off after 50 minutes, couldn't bear it. the cgi ship was bad and the creature looked like a large 5 foot bat. who funded this project? i think the whole thing must have cost $250 bucks. avoid at all costs, don't think about buying the dvd if they release one, i cant imagine they would spend dollars on producing one. lets hope someone makes a decent chupra film and a decent bigfoot movie. sasquatch was okay, poor lance. its a shame a big studio and direct wont risk it, no more super hero films please!
