this is the epitome of bad 80's film-making, unless you are a pre-pubescent girl. riding on a big name like madonna, a story line that physically assaults one's intelligence and humour that is most suited for a nursery school. if there was ever any doubt i think this turd of a movie clearly displays madonna's absolute lack of acting talent and made me feel highly embarrassed on her behalf. the only thing i can't believe is that they ever let the director near another movie again. madonna spends most of the movie prancing around like an infantile rag doll, and talking like a baby. it is painfully obvious that the only reason this movie was ever made was due to the fact that madonna was a big name in pop music at the time. do not be duped into seeing this awful attempt to cash in on pop stardom. stay away at all costs!
