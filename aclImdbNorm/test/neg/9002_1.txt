this isn't "so bad it's good"--it's "so bad, it violates the geneva convention's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment"! only by reading the synopsis can you even figure out the "plot" of this straight to video disaster. it's a hodge-podge of grainy stock footage spliced together with some of the all-time worst acting you'll ever have the misfortune to see. comparing this incompetent, turgid, humorless mess to "dead men don't wear plaid" is like saying that "gigli" is like "citizen kane". the talentless cast are costumed in cheap, j.c. penney "goin' to church" clothes, and there isn't the slightest attempt at period hairstyles or make-up. if you really want to see how this sort of "homage" can work, check out "the lost skeleton of cadavra"--it's clever, well-written, and best of all, performed by actual actors who aren't such agony to watch. for that matter, seek out the work of phoenix artist paul wilson whose sci-fi short "the attack of the 70 foot courtesy lady" leaves this film in the dust. the people in terror in the tropics look and sound like they were pulled off the street and given their scripts to read during the one and only take. this is an insult to bela lugosi, boris karloff, lon chaney, and anyone else involved in the films they cannibalized to make this schlock-fest! money isn't the problem--a lot can be accomplished with very little expense. a good script, decent actors, and above z-grade costumes and production design should have been a given before the so-called director created this stinky pile of cinematic offal. let's hope the "promise" of a sequel doesn't come true--that was by far the scariest thing shown in the whole movie!!
