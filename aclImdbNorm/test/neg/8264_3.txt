masters horror: sounds like is set in seattle where larry pearce works as the manager of a computer software call center, having lost his 6 year old son michael (nicholas elia) to a rare heart condition he finds that he has ultra sensitive hearing. larry hears everything in ten fold, from people typing on computer keyboards, people whispering across the room, people tapping their foot on the floor, dripping taps & eventually even people breathing become unbearable for larry as he is constantly bombarded with mind piercing noise. eventually larry decides he's had enough & if he can't stop the noises themselves then maybe he can stop himself hearing them with the help of a large meat clever...<br /><br />this canadian american co-production was episode 4 from season 2 of the generally hit-and-miss masters of horror tv series, written & directed by brad anderson i thought sounds like was a definite miss. the script was based on a short story by mike o'driscoll & i am genuinely surprised by the amount of very positive comments it has here on the imdb at the present time, for a start i would be very hard pressed to even describe this as a horror film & it feels more like some bizarre sentimental drama until the last 5 minutes when howard berger, gregory nicotero & the boys at knb effects actually get to do some work. larry has this strange unexplained ability to amplify sound & noises from the start so this episode ends up like 55 minutes of exactly the same sort of repetitive build up which leads up to a gory ending although it comes to late to save the episode. this is pretty slow going & while it's well written isn't this meant to be horror themed & i'm slightly confused as to who this is meant to appeal to?<br /><br />director anderson does ok but he just keeps repeating the same things over & over again, until the last 5 minutes there isn't a single drop of blood in the entire thing. there's no horror, there's no scares or tension & absolutely no atmosphere.<br /><br />technically this is very well made, has good production values & doesn't look like a cheap made-for-tv program. the acting is very good actually & it's shame the story is somewhat limited.<br /><br />sounds like is one of the very worst masters of horror episodes, a lot of people seem to like it & that's fine but it's definitely not for me. another masters of horror, another disappointment.
