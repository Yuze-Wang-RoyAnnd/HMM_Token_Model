first the premise stinks...little boy likes to dress in girls clothes. it reminded me of norman bates in psycho or ed wood in ed wood. the jokes are lame and old, you've seen 'em in a dozen 50's & 60's films. the whole cast is wasted. i bet people signed on just to be in a shirley maclaine vehicle. please, would somebody tell shirley she did her best comedy in two mules for sister sara. see it...if there's no reruns of andy griffith on.
