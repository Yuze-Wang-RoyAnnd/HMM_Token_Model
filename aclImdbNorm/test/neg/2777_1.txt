i'm not sure i've ever seen a film as bad as this. awful acting, all over the place plot, terrible special effects. there are some 'so bad its good' moments in here but not really enough to maintain interest. the woman who plays tracey looks hideous. there are some fairly worrying scenes with a dwarf which leave you feeling ever so slightly violated. on the plus side the operation scenes are fairly amusing for the special effects as is the car chase where one car is "trying to force us off the road" without actually making contact. guess the budget didn't stretch to trashing cars. oh and what looks like a postcard of the taj mahal is shown every time they cut to the fictional foreign country.
