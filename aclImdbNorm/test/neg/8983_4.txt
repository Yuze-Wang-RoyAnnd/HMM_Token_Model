'carolina moon' is an adequate made-for-tv movie about a girl with psychic powers who returns to the town where<br /><br />she grew up in and where her childhood best friend was murdered. turns out that every year on the same date another<br /><br />young girl is murdered and tori, played by claire forlani, must solve the mystery before she ends up dead. claire forlani (meet joe black, csi new york) is the female lead and does a pretty good job of it, ably supported by the rather delicious oliver hudsom and a still luminous jacqueline bisset. the script, adapted from a nora roberts novel, is bog-standard and the plot<br /><br />is tediously predictable. that, however, is offset again by, like i said, the rather delicious oliver hudson.
