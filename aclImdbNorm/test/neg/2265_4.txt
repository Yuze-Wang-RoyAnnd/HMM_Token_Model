i've read the book 'scarlett' and was expecting a good movie the first time i saw it. i'm afraid to say that i was disappointed. the movie did not follow the book and made many changes that i did not like. <br /><br />one of the changes that i did not like the way that lord fenton was portrayed. it made no sense to make him out to be a bad man. the way that things ended between lord fenton and scarlett was a lot different and their whole relationship was too intimate. <br /><br />there was also a lot less confrontation between scarlett and rhett in the movie than was originally written in the book. the movie sent the two in two completely opposite ways and they did not seem to cross paths often enough to make it seem like there still could be love between the two. a fine movie, but i believe that it certainly could've been better than it was, had it more true to alexandra rippley's book.
