am i the only one to notice that the "realism" of the 19th century ship is erroneous. actually it's a 15th century, right around 1620 if memory serves me, because the "realistic" ship in the movie is the mayflower, now as far as i know the mayflower never went to australia or even attempted a voyage to australia. i don't know who handled r&d for this film, but using the mayflower and hoping that no one will notice is a poor job indeed.<br /><br />they even printed it on the cover art and the dvd. i wonder how may other people noticed this little blunder? not to mention that the movie itself was just plain awful, i would have expected better from sam neill.
