the film "chaos" takes its name from gleick's 1988 pop science explanation of chaos theory. what does the book or anything related to the content of the book have to do with the plot of the movie "chaos"? nothing. the film makers seem to have skimmed the book (obviously without understanding a thing about it) looking for a "theme" to united the series of mundane action sequences that overlie the flimsy string of events that acts in place of a plot in the film. in this respect, the movie "choas" resembles the canadian effort "cube," in which prime numbers function as a device to mystify the audience so that the ridiculousness of the plot will not be noticed: in "cube" a bunch of prime numbers are tossed in so that viewers will attribute their lack of understanding to lack of knowledge about primes: the same approach is taken in "chaos": disconnected extracts from gleick's books are thrown in make the doings of the bad guy in the film seem fiendishly clever. this, of course, is an insultingly condescending treatment of the audience, and any literate viewer of "chaos" who can stand to sit through the entire film will end up bewildered. how could a film so bad be made? rewritten as a novel, the story in "chaos" would probably not even make it past a literary agent's secretary's desk. how could (at least) hundreds of thousands (and probably millions) of dollars have been thrown away on what can only be considered a waste of time for everyone except those who took home money from the film? regarding what's in the movie, every performance is phoned in. save for technical glitches, it would be astonishing if more than one take was used for any one scene. the story is uniformly senseless: the last time i saw a story to disconnected it was the production of a literal eight-year-old. among other massive shortcomings are the following: the bad guy leaves hints for the police to follow. he has no reason whatsoever for leaving such hints. police officers do not carry or use radios. dupes of the bad guy have no reason to act in concert with the bad guy. let me strongly recommend that no one watch this film. if there is any other movie you like (or even simply do not hate) watch that instead.
