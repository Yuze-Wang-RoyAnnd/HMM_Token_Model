the movie started very well..so far isabelle's exorcism could be believed....but later, gosh!!! i didn't know if it was a horror movie, a drama one or a must not see one! the possessed creature attacking the sheriff had no connection at all with the movie....the make up!! well it looked pretty real at beginning, but at the end, last part of movie, the make up (especially teeth and eyes) was very exaggerated. if you want a good "exorcism" movie watch "the exorcism of emily rose".<br /><br />together with "hard candy" (totally boring, pathetic plot and ending), these two movies are the worst i've seen from lionsgate!! but well the movie company has given horror movie fans excellent films, but with this one, you will wish you never rent it!! exorcism movie fans, just stay with two "the exorcist" and "emily rose's exorcism"
