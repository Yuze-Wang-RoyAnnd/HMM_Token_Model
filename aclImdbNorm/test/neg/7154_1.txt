i was looking forward to this movie. i like road trip thrillers. i like sex, drugs, youth, action and a great sound track. and i was especially interested in taking the movie trip across europe to see if i recognized any of my own travel spots.<br /><br />from the first scene, however, this movie was unwatchable. what was guy doing driving on the wrong side of the road? what could possibly have blown up the van that rolled gracefully down a shallow grassy incline? if they're such bad drivers, why would they take a delivery job? and that's just the first scene! not even bad enough to be campy or silly. just horrible! horrible! horrible! waste of time. move on to something... anything else!
