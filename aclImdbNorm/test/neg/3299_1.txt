i watched the first episode of "the war at home" because i thought it was worth replacing "arrested development", boy, was i disappointed. it should be clear to everyone that this show was blatantly ripped-off of "grounded for life", "titus", and "married...with children" since they are all similar in plot and overall mood. the so called "punch lines" are all repetitious and formulaic, even more, those "punch lines" aren't even funny at all, to me, they're more along the lines as being crass and crude. the main character dave gold acts like a white trash thug, who thinks he's being funny and cool, which he's not. (even hillary (dave's daughter) said so in the episode "gaza strip").<br /><br />in the episode "dream crusher", hillary wanted to be a singer {but was actually pretty bad}, dave and vicky then gladly decided to crush her dreams by telling her she sucked. after that, she then wanted to be a child psychologist and planned on going to harvard, after telling dave and vicky so and left the room, the two of them began mindlessly mocking her. also, in the first episode dave said of hillary's {black} boyfriend "does she actually think we're gonna let her go out with this guy? i'd rather drink my own urine", that line has to the dumbest line in the history of television. and dave is constantly making fun of larry (his son) when he breaks the fourth wall because he thinks he's gay and is a geek. also, let's not forget that he also made fun of larry's (fat) girlfriend. dave is the father he's supposed to stand up for his son no matter what. "the war at home" is without a doubt the worst tv show for family. that clearly explains why the show should be canceled since it spreads a racism and homophobic agenda. it's like the show wants to be funny for always putting in that stupid laugh track every time someone says something, but the lines are all somewhat forced, idiotic and pathetically juvenile.<br /><br />another reason why the show's horrible is the acting, mike rappaport and kyle sullivan are terrible, terrible actors. rappaport has to always move his hands around when he's in front of the camera, he not only does this on this show but he also did that during his time with "boston public". sullivan talks and acts like some kind of robot every time he acts (he also did this in "malcolm in the middle"}.<br /><br />so to wrap this whole thing up, you all got your reasons of what's wrong with this show 1.it's unoriginal 2.the acting sucks 3.it's not even funny 4.all the jokes are the same 5.has lousy script 6.the characters are pitiful and unlikable 7.the dad's a rip-off of archie bunker<br /><br />fox needs to take this trash off the air, because anything's better than this.
