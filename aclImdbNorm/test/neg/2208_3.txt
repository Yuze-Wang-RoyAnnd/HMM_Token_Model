poor casper van dien, his career has slid a long way from tarzan and starship troopers.<br /><br />in meltdown he's a policeman who just happens to be dating tv reporter stefanie von pfeten and her brother is a scientist who's trying to deal with a speeding comment headed for earth. but in the runaway comet business, even a near miss causes some real problems as the earth's orbit goes out of kilter.<br /><br />from the survival of the earth we go to the survival of van dien and his immediate family. his daughter's gangbanger boyfriend, ryan mcdonell actually proves to be of some use especially when he suspects a guy he knows as a crooked cop might mean the van dien group a lot of harm.<br /><br />my only question here is, why didn't they have bruce willis, billy bob thornton and the rest of that crew to deal with the nasty comet?<br /><br />pass this one up folks.
