feeling minnesota is not really a road movie, but that's still the best categorization i can generate. a road movie does not primarily depend on a great story line, and since the plot of this movie is truly pathetic, it does fulfil that description. to be interesting, such a movie must rely entirely on moving and intriguing characters, and on the chemistry between them. unfortunately the staff of feeling minnesota fails utterly in producing this excitement.<br /><br />the initializing presentation of the characters is unsatisfying and confusing; i can, for example, not figure out whether jjaks (keanu reeves) did grow up in the house of his mother and brother or not. it is said, by his mother (tuesday weld), that he must live with his father, but nothing in the film suggests that it ever happens. the same goes for the rest of the characters - i never get to know them. they appear irrational, and no real explanation is given to why they do so.<br /><br />the bottom line is that i leave the movie without any feelings for the characters, except dullness and perhaps a tiny kick of attraction for the cute cameron diaz.
