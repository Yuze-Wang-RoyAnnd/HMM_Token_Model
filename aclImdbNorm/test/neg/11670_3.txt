intelligent summary, isn't it?<br /><br />if mad max was something of a simple, straight forward, nothing special but nothing wrong either kinda film, they totally made up for it with it's sequel, the road warrior. so, in theory, with a third great film it would've been a great trilogy... now, it's not!<br /><br />such a huge disappointment beyond thunderdome was! it's main premise is pretty cool, with an 'underworld' (think a mix between metropolis and the time machine), but it all isn't carried out with too much conviction. add the obnoxious tina turner and the no good story-line of the people waiting for a plane, and this is just one huge stinker.<br /><br />maybe they can brighten things up again with part 4 (although that one is just probably gonna be 1 huge budget-explosion kinda thing), because this just isn't right.<br /><br />3/10.
