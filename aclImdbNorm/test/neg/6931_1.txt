this is a piece of hollywood product that should have never left a film can. dialogue without a plausible thought, plot without a point, staging without skill, directing without direction, and acting without the worth of some backwater high school's freshman class play. the entire cast should have been arrested for over acting.<br /><br />but otherwise, okay!
