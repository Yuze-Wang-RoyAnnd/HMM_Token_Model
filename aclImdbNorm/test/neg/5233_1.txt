reading the book i felt once again drawn into castle rock (needful things being the final part of the rock trilogy), and the plot was a variant on the "demon comes to small redneck village" type story king likes to tell. the characters were all described in loving detail, and it made both a good psychological and gory horror. the film on the other hand is awful. gone are the character interactions and clever plot, and replaced by a story that tries to be exciting but misses by a mile. if you haven't read the book then you might enjoy this, else avoid at all costs, as with most films of king's books.
