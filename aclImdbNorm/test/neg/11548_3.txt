this unintentionally amusing mid-80s tv movie is based on the premise that sex bomb donna mills (in a mostly appalling wardrobe throughout) is a neglected housewife, pining for her sexy past as a cheerleader. she escapes her empty life by fantasising about random sexual encounters with one of the many attractive men she comes across, finally giving into her fantasies and indulging in a bit on the side, although all she really wants is to reignite the flames of passion with her boring husband james brolin.<br /><br />there are many laughable aspects to this film, mills' first foray into co-producing (later, following her departure from knots landing, she found great success as a trashy tv movie queen starring in mostly issue-of-the-week melodramas through most of the '90s - she usually played a victim of some sort, clearly determined to wash her hands of the wonderfully wicked and entertaining conniver she played for so long on knots). funniest are the drawn-out fantasy sequences, filmed as though they are meant to be soft-core porn (wind and smoke machines, backlighting, porno music), but as this is a network tv movie the scenes are all very chaste and ultimately not very sexy at all. the most amusing (and bizarre) scene has mills taking a walk on the wild side downtown among the spiky-haired punks (complete with robert palmer soundtrack). <br /><br />less laughable is the dreadful dialogue that the cardboard characters are forced to utter (pity poor cicely tyson as the mandatory psycho-analyst, or veronica cartwright as the mandatory best friend, or even pre-babs james brolin with that daytime soap style of clenched fist anger.)<br /><br />of course, as in all of these sorts of films, we learn that all problems can be solved through psycho-therapy and then the film just becomes silly, as we explore, briefly, the reasons for mills' "shocking" behaviour (as if it can't just be that she wants a good shag!)<br /><br />vacuous.
