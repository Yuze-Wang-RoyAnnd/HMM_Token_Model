i loved this movie when it first came out(but i was just 12 years old then - and i had forgotten this film existed until one day i found a used copy for sale at a gas station. i bought it and i couldn't wait to watch this film that had i loved as a kid, and then as i saw this film again many years later,it hit me.... why in the world did i like this film as a kid, watching it again as an adult i realized that this film is terrible. the saddest part about this film is that they had everything in place to make the greatest western ever and they blew it!!! the costumes are perfect,good actors, there are 2 music scores the orchestrail score is wonderful, and keeps with the classic spirit of the old timey lone ranger alive, the second score is a series of songs by country music artest like merle haggerd, and the statler brothers and those songs like "the man in the mask" are so bad that they are funny. this movies strongest point is that it had a briliant storyline, and one of the best western plots ever, and for a while its fun to watch as john reid is nursed back to health,after he and his fellow rangers are ambushed.its fun to see him grow into his new life and identity as the lone ranger,as he concels his identity, and goes on a revenge run to get the gang responsible for killing his brother and all his fellow rangers to whom he rode with. but unfortunatly,as good as the storyline is, its all ruined by merle haggard narrating everything as you are watching it happen(for the love of god why did they do that?) between merle haggard's narration and the statler brothers singing corny(stupid) songs like "ride little cowboy" being playing in the backgound make this movie impossible to take serious. i would love to see a really good producer take this same script and story and re-do this film right,because at the heart of this silly film is a great western.---i would descibe this film as a beautiful woman dress in the ugliest clothing. i give it 4 stars out of 10 --if your 12 years old, and dont know better, then you might love it.
