i like to think of myself as a bad movie connoisseur. i like to think that the films most people label as the worst of all time i can easily withstand.<br /><br />but...there are exceptions. i can only recall three movies i have had the misfortune to see that i have repeatedly used the fast-forward button for large chunks of the story. those movies are the mighty gorga, night of the seagulls, and this little crap, deep blood.<br /><br />in the world of jaws ripoffs, this falls off the scale. deep blood doesn't have the realistic storyline of the original crocodile, nor the incredible effects of the sea serpent, nor the commentary of tintorera. no, instead we are treated to a handful of teens from any random failed '80s public access sitcom battling bullies and the local sheriff.<br /><br />shark attacks are realized by quick cuts of documentary footage with actors thrashing about in the water, occasionally with a bit of what appears to be orange-ish paint thrown into the water. not a minute of original shark footage exists in this celluloid waste dump.<br /><br />normally, i, or somebody like me, would read a dismal review like this one and say "cool, i gotta find a copy of this!" that's the same thought i had when i read another viewer's review on this very site. how wrong i was.<br /><br />so...from one bad movie fan to another...let this collect dust on the shelf...grab up from the depths or the great alligator instead to satisfy your need for something evil lurking in the water.
