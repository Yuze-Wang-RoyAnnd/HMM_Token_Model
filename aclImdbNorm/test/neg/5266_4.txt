this film is really quite odd. clearly certain *events* portrayed identify the main protagonist as the dublin criminal known as "the general" but almost everything else is just wrong. we are not talking of a distortion of ancient history...but a complete distortion of irrefutable, documented facts. the question indeed is why? the garda are shown as latter day keystone cops, his gang as non-menacing, and the man himself as..well kevin spacey. almost pure fiction anyway, why bother to try to give a semblance of realism? having said all that, it is a poor exercise *any* way you want to look at it. not worth a second of anyone's time.
