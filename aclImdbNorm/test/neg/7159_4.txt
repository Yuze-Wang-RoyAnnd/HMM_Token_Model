this glorified discovery channel documentary, part biblical study, part treasure hunt, all misappropriated, might have sat well in it's television origins but falls flat as a feature film. right from first glance of it's cheesy looking cover art, one may cast doubts upon the integrity behind this serious subject, shown on front case relegating the search for jesus's tomb to a generic action font that looks more national treasure or tomb raider then any informed debate and examination of the historical burial site should. such is the underhanded way in which the entire proceedings revolve.<br /><br />more curious child then worthy researcher, simcha jacobovici's explorations come across as self-indulgent while his research comes across as manipulative. for all the fascinating revelations this filmmaker tries to impart on his viewers through supposed evidence, a flood of repetitious statements reiterating the same research and findings over and over proves the lost tomb of jesus has very little information to back up the bloated, albeit entrancing claims. what this amounts to is a very frustrating attempt to beat the audience over the head with the same small factual evidence in support of this tomb's authenticity, which ironically detracts from it. while tirelessly linking together many of these mini-coffins found together to support the jesus of nazareth theory, this research forsakes a well-rounded approach to continuously pursue this romanticized archeologist's singular obsession. there may be some impressive factual data which helps shed some light on many traditional dogmatic christian-held beliefs, but essentially the shady nature of this project made it come across as merely an exploitation piece, financed at a time when the da vinci code was all the rage.<br /><br />in the end, the cheesy cover art was right. despite my appreciation for documentary form, the lost tomb of jesus takes an always interesting topic and turns it into overlong and unvaried geriatric adventure hunt, substituting any relevance and sacredness for the uninspired motivations behind this team. by the time these tomb raiders have finished their explorations, reluctantly having to stop research because of social demands, viewers are left with the sense the director was insistent on forging this mystery whether it was there to begin with or not. there are a few genuinely potent moments where the halls of history come marching through this documentary in unassuming ways, but all the decoding, exploring, and theorizing in the world still left this misguided vanity piece in an uneasy void of apathetic response.
