for a norris movie this is pretty tame. for an action movie it is kind of dull, and as far as predictability goes my friend and i almost had every turn of this movie nailed. it was nice that the killer's every moves were not telegraphed by the cliche's of 80's action movies, but come on, the only non-predictable move defies the plot and the set-up of the editing. mainly, it is said rather early on that the killer (jack o'halloran, whom is one of the few slightly known actors) only kills women. yet, he all of a sudden stops his m.o. and kills men, huh?. i guess it can be construed and rationalized some way, but why is the movie edited to show that he is going to kill women?? <br /><br />yet again, i'm sure that there is a reason (i.e. to build suspense), but why spend the time watching it when many other suspense movies are vastly superior.<br /><br />fans of "renegade" may enjoy the small cameo by branscombe richmond as victor, but his brief appearence cannot save the movie and even a vote of 4 seems generous.<br /><br />
