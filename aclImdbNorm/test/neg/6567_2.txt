while star trek the motion picture was mostly boring, star trek the final frontier is plain bad. in this terrible sequel, the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the federation that ambassadors representing earth, romulus and kronos (the klingon home world) have been kidnapped by a renegade vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier. there, he hopes to find god. using mysticism and bad writing, he persuades many of the senior officers of the enterprise to betray kirk and get a hold of the ship. they do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god-like alien. this one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin. at the core is a good idea that is never really developed. the plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before. it is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco. the action scenes don't have the suspense of wrath of kahn, the philosophy is boring, and the humor is stale. now i will focus most of my anger on william shatner. when he takes the director's chair, the ego gets bigger. most of the focus is on him, spock, and mccoy, but does not give the others enough to do. moreover, whereas shatner is usually guilty of over-acting in previous movies and television spots, he is just plain bad in this one. now kirk is reckless, a practical jokers, and silly. one of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song, "row row row your boat" in a round by a campfire. in any case, this is the worst of the star trek franchise. i should have given it three out of ten instead of five.
