what can i say? after having read herbert's books and loving lynch's movie version, i was extremely disappointed. i felt i was watching a reject version of buck rogers. the sets looked like left overs from a star wars tv special! i felt the acting was a bit amateurish by most. the costumes were garish and over done which gave it a '60s flash gordon, pulp feel. the worms! they're supposed to be sand worms and yet they appeared to "big stalagtites" with a mouth at the blunt end. the effects in general were pretty second rate. i won't even start about the disgraceful "navigator" effect.<br /><br />this so-called "frank herbert's dune" wasn't even faithfull to his books! it should have been called "frank herbert's dune - for dummies". key plot elements were left out, names were changed and the entire "feel" of the story was "sanitised". i didn't even recognise the harkonnens! in fact most of the characters appeared nothing like herbert's descriptions had depicted them. i'm starting to get upset just remembering what a tragedy it was. i'm glad i couldn't stomach the second installment....
