well, i think i've finally seen my last woody allen movie! i read the review in the newspaper and went to see this movie with the expectation of having a good woody allen experience (as i've had many times in the past). well, that was not the case. this movie has nothing to offer. even with the wonderful performance by the talented sean penn - this movie failed. one of the features of his other movies is multiple characters - variety, witty dialogue. this movie basically consisted of only one character - very one dimensional. it had almost no laughs. it probably looked good on paper! i think the only thing special was the performance of samantha morton. now i'll be looking for her movies in the future. so, in conclusion, this movie was a major disappointment. >
