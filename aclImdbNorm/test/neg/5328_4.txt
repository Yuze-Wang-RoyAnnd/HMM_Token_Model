i know i loved this movie when i was 12-14 years old. now that i am 24 i watched it again, and i wished i hadn't. because all the things i laughed at when i was younger, is no longer funny. so this is an hour and a half without fun. for me the jokes were lame, not funny or just too childish. so the same thing i loved about the movie when i was a kid, is now the things i don't like about it. besides not being funny it is not actually believable at all. the evil character is very poorly done but i guess that is the kind of movie it is. and the last 20 minutes of the movie is pretty lame with bad fighting sequences and so on... but if you are young you will probably love it. i rate this movie 4/10
