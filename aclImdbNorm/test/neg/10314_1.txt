the dvd release of this movie hopes you will buy this movie on the name and face of sandra bullock. her picture (from years after this film) basically is the cover art... and the back cover art... and the inside cover art... the same picture. her name is prominently shown on the front cover, all 4 edges and the disk itself. she is the first name in the list of stars. her biography is printed inside the case. this film must revolve around her character, right? wrong! it is her first movie and she plays a minor role. after watching the movie, every role seems like a minor role. the character dog actually displays some personality. less than an hour after watching it, i don't even remember the names of many characters.<br /><br />maybe if i watched it several more times, i could actually figure out the plot, but i don't think it would be worth the effort.<br /><br />oh, wait, i just remembered a funny bit! shoot-em-up video game fans will get a kick out of the "doom-cam". looks just like a first-person shooter game. hands and gun pointing out in front of the camera.<br /><br />i am generally not a person to be critical of movies, but this may be the worst movie i have ever seen. i kept expecting some silhouettes to walk across the screen, sit down and start making fun of it.<br /><br />i'm just glad that the money we spent on this (used) went to charity.
