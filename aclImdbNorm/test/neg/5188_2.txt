on this quagmire of mediocrity? you are so much better than this.<br /><br />simply put, frostbite is worthless. bad acting (and i use that term loosely), minimalist "plot," sophomoric humor, and lackluster snowboarding. there's not even a sufficient display of feminine pulchritude to spark the prurient interest of socially inept, but red-blooded, males.<br /><br />top gun had spectacular flight sequences to goggle at. days of thunder had heart-pounding racing action. even point break had skydiving scenes to its credit. frostbite has none of these. it's not worth your time, my time, traci lords' time, carmen nicole's time, nor the time of anyone involved with this destruction of celluloid that would have been perfectly usable on something worthwhile had it not been wasted on this fodder for the recycling center.<br /><br />the world will be a better place when we forget that frostbite ever existed.
