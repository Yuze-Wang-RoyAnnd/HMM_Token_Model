this movie purports to show a middle class family's attempt to figure out what is "going down" in the america of the late 1960's. their trip to a rock festival is as far as their refurbished old bus gets. without exception, the characters are superficial stereotypes.<br /><br />if you want to know which well-established hollywood actors were desperate for a paycheck in those days,.. just look at the credits. sal mineo, i had forgotten just how badly his career had hit the skids! thank god, his career rebounded before his untimely death.<br /><br />the writers on this television turkey were clueless. outside of doing weed, their insights into the "hippie movement" were laughable.
