i rented the dvd in a video store, as an alternative to reading the report. but it's pretty much just more terror-tainment.<br /><br />while the film may present some info from the report in the drama, you're taking the word of the producers - there's no reference to the commission report anywhere in the film. not one.<br /><br />the acting, all around, is pretty bad - pretty much all of the stereotypes of 'hot shot' bitchy foul mouthed government agents, each thinking they know more than everyone else. there may be some truth to it, but it really has a bad hollywood stereotype smell to it.<br /><br />imdb's user community ratings & comments tend to be more right than wrong, and i have started to glance at the ratings before renting whenever i can.<br /><br />i wish i had on this one.
