not only have i read the book and watched the movie, but i was stationed on the uss john f kennedy when they filmed this. needless to say, film crews and actors can be trying to people trying to do their jobs. now, about the movie. as a career navy man, i was pretty upset on how they showed life on board an aircraft carrier. i could pick apart the inaccuracies throughout the movie (anyone that has lived on a carrier could), but that would take pages. one scene that stands out in particular was when they were in the cic (combat information center) and they were watching a radar contact move across the screen. each time the contact moved, it beeped. unfortunately, that equipment doesn't beep like that (i was a technician on that equipment). the book was based upon fact, the movie wasn't. the follow on tv series was just as bad and the navy finally realized that support for this series would just make them look bad. if you're a navy person, watch this to see how a movie about carrier life is seen from the eyes of hollywood. if your not a navy person, watch midway or top gun, at least those movies are entertaining and based upon fact.
