the only good thing of this movie is its final twist. in 97 minutes of film we can only save one single idea, which was totally wasted in this movie i must say! for more than 90 minutes this film is just a collection of clich'es, bad acting, stupid ideas and disclosures, complete lack of suspense, stupid deaths, terrible special effects; all this in a pathetic and unoriginal plot
