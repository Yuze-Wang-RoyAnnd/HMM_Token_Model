imdb lists this movie as a comedy. i have no idea what genre this movie falls into but it certainly isn't comedy. tragedy maybe.<br /><br />i won't say whether this is a good movie or not. all i know is it is not a comedy. i wanted a laugh tonight and what i got was some bizarre notion of someones attachment to some ugly chair.<br /><br />this movie is not what is advertised. it's film school tripe that i can only assume is intended to "make people think". i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone that i know, or even that i don't know. it's ridiculous drivel that makes no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />it made me think alright. it made me think, "i wish i had those ninety minutes of my life back."<br /><br />i'm sure the world is full of armchair critics who have a liberal bent on their world view that will make this movie something worth watching to them.<br /><br />i am not one of them.
