my girlfriend wanted to see this (lol this is the case a lot)...so i rented it. then i saw how acclaimed this was nominated for 10 oscars. great! this should be good ol' drama. this movie had a lot of potential...the direction and the way everything was paced was very well. but once the movie ended, i couldn't help but ask myself if this story was really worth making a film for. virginia hill (annette bening) was extremely annoying, i just couldn't tolerate her character at all. warren beatty was excellent in the film acting-wise, but again i just found it hard to have sympathy for his character....he just came off essentially as a idiotic, hotheaded loser of a gangster..who had no place in 'the life' in the first place. how'd he get in with the likes of meyer lansky and lucky luciano anyway??? this film just left me with a bland but uneasy feeling...what was the big deal with this movie? i just didn't feel a completeness with bugsy. beatty's antics, although acted quite well, just seemed too random and illogical. i'm guessing that's how siegel really was....but it was just too much of that. there just didn't seem to be much of a real story here. my basic assessment of it would be <br /><br />"a hot-headed, playboy, underachieving gangster falls in love with a loser of a woman, comes up with the idea of 'las vegas'....but his failed attempt at the casino he builds, along with having no regard for his mob bosses' money gets him killed."<br /><br />what else is there besides that? i just didn't see the big deal with this, and it was a big disappointment. there must've not been many movies to come out in 1991, how this was nominated for 10 oscars is beyond me (although the two it won is justifiable). 1.5/4 stars.
