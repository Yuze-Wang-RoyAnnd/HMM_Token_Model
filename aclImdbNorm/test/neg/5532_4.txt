this is a very interesting acquaintance! "two-fisted tales" contains three foolish and childish episodes - genre isn't actually horror or action, more like something in between. where's the suspence? where's the fun? where's the common sense? definitely not in here but if you don't expect to get it, you don't necessarily miss it.<br /><br />first segment is called "showdown". it's a violent, absurd western. i failed to understand the whole idea of it. "king of the road" is a stupid story starring brad pitt. at the time of "two-fisted tales" he was just a pretty face who really didn't know how to act yet. luckily he learned the skill later and now he's a fantastic, talented actor - one of the big ones of the younger generation. story is almost ok in all of it's stupidness. final episode "yellow" is the only segment that's almost entirely successful. it's foolish but funny. we have to thank kirk douglas for that.<br /><br />this movie is something to watch when you sit in an easy chair and eat popcorn. (i should know, that's what i did) if you loved "tales from the crypt", you'll love "two-fisted tales" too because basically it's all the same. i understand these three episodes are actually extremely rare "piece of art" and very difficult to find anywhere. i have the whole package on vhs but i don't think it's a big privilege. you'll have to be a fanatic brad pitt fan to search it out. otherwise don't bother, it's not worth the effort. silly crap.
