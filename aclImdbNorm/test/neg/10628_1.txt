about the movie itself, there are ample comments. <br /><br />i just wanted to say something about the german version, which i have seen recently on tv. it is heavily cut. from 103 to 76 minutes! it is usual that the most bloody scenes are cut for german tv. i understand the reasons for that, but this movie was something else. they did not only cut "gore-shots" - they have cut entire sequences, sparing only glimpses. like: "we have to attack them" - one 5 second shot of explosions in the camp - protagonist running away.<br /><br />when the assault on the island begins, it isn't even possible anymore to follow the storyline. all the cuts create something that amounts to a string of erratic, disconnected scenes that don't make any sense anymore.<br /><br />i could not stand to watch the end after spending 60 minutes on this nonsense.<br /><br />i think i would have given the original 7/10 the german version is worth only 1/10<br /><br />get it on dvd (and check the runtime first) or forget about it.
