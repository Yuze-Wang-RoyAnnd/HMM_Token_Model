i have seen a lot of movies. in fact i love b horror movies, they are one of my favorite genres. however this "garbage" (i refuse to acknowledge that this was given the honor of film) was the worst piece of crap i have ever had the torture of watching. i actually signed up on imdb purely for the fact that i needed a way to at least voice how awful this "garbage" was. i have watched "films" (they at least deserve the honor) done in basements by high school students that were better written and directed. i have nothing but pity for the poor actors in this "garbage" because they were just trying to earn a pay check. they will now and forever have this stain on their records like a virgin who was raped and given herpes! if writer/director john shiban has any dignity left at all, after obviously fellating countless people to get this made, he should never allow himself near a camera again and try applying his so called "gifts" to something more suited for him....like mopping the floor of a peep show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
