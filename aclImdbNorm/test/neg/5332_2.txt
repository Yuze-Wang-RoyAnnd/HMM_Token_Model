this movie is bad as we all knew it would be. most times i usually love the bad 80s / early 90s trash-can comedy (haha no pun intended). i list ski school, career opportunities, hot shots, summer school and many more made around this time. this even has the classic yet forgotten comedy of dean cameron (aka.. ski school section 8 instructor and party maniac for summer school). but this movie is just to slow. it takes almost 30 min to get going and we have to sit through pointless dialog between to half-wits the sheen boys (e&c). and yes i can hear the bloggers dieing to trash me with "obviously you don't watch 2 and 1/2 men). well charlie was not at the level he is now during this flick...not that he's anything worth watching now. charlie only shines when his co-stars support him and emilio isn't anymore than an overused wonder bra offering little support. actually, this movie was written by emilio and it shows. it has no real ending (come on emilio, even the ski school 2 writers barfed out an ending). no idea how any issue brought is solved, no hot babes, no swearing to lighten the bad plot, characters, acting... i'm now tired of this tirade. just save your time and watch the movies i listed above. you'll enjoy them much more.
