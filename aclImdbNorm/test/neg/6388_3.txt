maybe it is unfair for me to review this movie because i walked out well before the end. that's odd, because i usually like shakespeare on the screen and i enjoyed midsummers night's dream once, many years ago, when i saw it on the stage.<br /><br /> i think that two things did me in: that squeaky twerp with the shakespearian name, calista flockhart, and michelle feiffer sitting in a giant clamshell. well, i suppose you could say it supposed to be a comedy -- but when the scenery is funny and the actors aren't, i'd say we have a bad movie on our hands....
