veteran tv director ted post treats us to a plodding, confused and ultimately pointless story lifted from column b of the harold robbins big book of plots. set against a smoggy phoenix skyline, post-charlies angles jaclyn smith takes a star turn as "the woman whose eyes are mysteriously shadowed at all times" while jfk impersonator james franciscus lounges around the fringes. <br /><br />mannix goes western, monkeys are abused, models lean against classic cars, and smith is constantly upstaged by sybil danning until a giallo style wrap-up brings the whole sorry mess to a bitter end.<br /><br />oh yeah, and bob mitchum is in there too. somewhere.
