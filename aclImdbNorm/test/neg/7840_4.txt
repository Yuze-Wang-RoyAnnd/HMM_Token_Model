"maximum risk" is a step sideways for van damme and just more of the uninspired b-movie action stuff we've come to expect from films featuring the macho belgian martial artist. the flick has gaping plots holes, goofs galore, a messy conglomerated plot, and a gorgeous henstridge who spends most of her time looking like she's waiting for a cue. "maximum risk" doesn't distinguish itself in any way and will likely not have much appeal beyond the usual young male audiences. (c-)
