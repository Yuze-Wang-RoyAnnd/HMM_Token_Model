luther the geek (1990) is a dull horror movie and is really bad even by troma's standards!! it's about a freak who bites the heads off chickens, and kills people by biting their necks out, and he actually thinks he's a chicken himself!!!!! luther gets released from prison after 25 yrs because apparentely he's been a "model" prisoner and deserves another chance in life (which is very hard to believe after you see how he acts and treats people throughout the movie).<br /><br />after killing an elderly lady in a supermarket car park, he manages to sneak into a womans car, and proceeds to torture her, her daughter and the daughters boyfriend at their family home in the country.<br /><br />then we get treated to a long winded and boring movie, with awful acting all the way through, before a useless cop turns up to try and kill luther once and for all!! oh and the film has a ridiculous and laughable ending too!!! i love low budget horror movies and i think "the toxic avenger" is an all time classic, but i'm afraid luther the geek is just boring, illogical and dull, not much in the way of gore too, just afew bloody neck bitings and thats about it! 3/10
