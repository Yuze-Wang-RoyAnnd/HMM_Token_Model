once upon a time theresa russell made a few halfway decent movies, so i keep hoping that one of her efforts from the past decade or two will merit a rating of at least 6 or 7 (out of 10). however, dark world is just the latest in a string of disappointments. the first 90 minutes are very hard to watch. the lines are delivered by the lead actors as if they are being read at a first rehearsal or even a casting session (in which the actors are doing it for the sake of their agents, but do not really want the parts for which they are perfunctorily reading). the sets and props seem "off" somehow (what kind of a police department would allow a detective to have a whole living room wall shelved full of case file holders?). the screen is constantly cluttered with meaningless time and datelines, which appear with no rhyme or reason. now, if the scriptwriter were standing here after the lights go up from a film fest screening, they no doubt would crow about how all these shortcomings are really clever clues to the plot turning topsy-turvy in this misfire's final five minutes. well, for those audience members whose only other movie experiences are tv: the movie and surfer, dude; they might be bamboozled into nodding their heads in agreement. but it is hard to believe that anyone who has seen 10 or more movies in their life--and is not a close friend or relative of a dark world cast or crew member--could fall for such a lame canard. despite what the d.v.d. box might lead you to believe, this movie has about as much resemblance to sunset boulevard (dead narrator device) or hitchcock (schizophrenic protagonist device) as a drained jim beam bottle refilled with urine has to booze!
