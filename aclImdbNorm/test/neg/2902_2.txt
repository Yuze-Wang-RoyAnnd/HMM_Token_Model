...and boy is the collision deafening. a female telephone lineman is taken over by the spirit of a recently-deceased ninja, strips down to her undies, pours tomato juice on her body so her boyfriend can lick it off, performs a seductive dance, then goes off to kill the policemen who killed the ninja she's possessed by. only to be hunted down by a one-eyed ninja master. just like in real life, eh? enlivened only by sho kosugi's martial arts choreography (and his declining to put his obnoxious kids in this one), you really have to see this to believe it. it's the ultimate mix of totally at-odds genres.
