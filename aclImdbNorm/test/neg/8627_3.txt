a real insult to the original "spoorloos", which is one of the most genuinely disturbing films (and i intend this as a compliment!) i have seen in the last years.<br /><br />where the original is chilling and brilliant, the remake is flat and even boring, especially the "happy end" finale takes away what little suspense there was in this film in the first place.<br /><br />while such a distortion (especially grafting a "happy end" which wasn't there previously) is quite frequently the case in "hollywood" remakes of european art-house movies and could've been expected, the biggest disappointment lies in the fact that this inane mess was created by the very same filmmaker who did the original "spoorloos"...<br /><br />why mr. sluizer decided to ruin his masterpiece in such a fashion is beyond me.<br /><br />avoid this abomination at all cost, as it might spoil the original for you even if watched *after* that, let alone the other way round...
