barbara payton is the suppose-to-be sultry sexy young hot chickie wife of the geezer plantation owner somewhere in a jungley back lot set at a cheap studio in hollywood. raymond burr wears his working shirt with the top button undone as the hunky chunky plantation foreman who mrs payton is desiring to blow the joint with. there is another girl, some sort of peasant slave thing that burr used to fool around with but he's given her the old heave ho so the obligatory squatty old voo-doo hag is conjuring up a good spell to cast on him and the payton tramp. i watched this only part way through because its really awful, so didn't even get to see the star of the show---which i guess is a gorilla that the voo-doo hag turned someone into or whatever.....who cares. i give this one half star out of a possible ten. it's not even campy, just really bad.
