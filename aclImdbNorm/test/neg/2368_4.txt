doesn't this seem somewhat familiar? oh wait, that's right.. 90% of the jokes in this movie have already been done in the tv series. what's the point in repeating yourself, you may ask? is it for the benefit of the americans who haven't seen the programme? did the scriptwriters run out of inspiration? or maybe everyone on set suffered a sudden attack of amnesia, and forgot they'd covered this ground already? either way, for someone who has sat through the first three series, this was just really boring. i had to turn it off during the 'tablets that turn your water green' part.. yes it is very funny, but give us something original for goodness sake! actually, if the best new stuff you can come up with is leonard rossiter's take on saturday night fever, you can forget it.<br /><br />the guy they got to replace the late richard beckinsale is a lookalike alright, but not half the actor. personally i would exorcised the role, as a mark of respect to him. or better yet, not bothered making the film at all, and just let the hilarity of the tv series speak for itself. but no, they couldn't do that.. not as long as there was money to be made. sad, really. 4/10
