i remember seeing a clip of this movie on hbo when i was a kid and it scared the ever living crap out of me. when i found it, i watched it. i wish i hadn't. the movie wasn't scary.<br /><br />the plot revolves around an old woman running the castle. she feeds this horribly disfigured person in the cellar of a 12 century castle. she continuously beats the poor guy every day and feeds him. well, that day, she dies. then, a few months later, a family moves in. a father, a mother, and their blind daughter. the father was involved in a horrific car accident that got their son killed and left their daughter blind.<br /><br />later through the film, the daughter hears sounds, things break, etc. and everybody is not concerned about anything at all. that is until a few people turn up dead. apparently, the creature in the cellar has broken free and is killing people. how this thing survived for the past few months without food or water is impossible! every time i saw the creature, it gave me the creeps. the creature goes on a gory killing spree and the police blame the father for the deaths.<br /><br />it was a pretty bad film.<br /><br />i give this film 3 stars out of 10. creepy not scary!
