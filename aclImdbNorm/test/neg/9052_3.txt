an asian blowgun assassin takes out victims in niagara falls and new york city before getting run over by a car. sheila morris (former miss sweden janet agren, given a hilarious "southern belle" dub to show she's from alabama) finds a connection between these killings and the disappearance of her sister diana (paola senatore) and sets out to investigate. this brings her to new guinea where she promises a sleazy guide (robert kerman i.e. american porn star r. bolla) 80,000 dollars to help locate her sister. after barely making it through a jungle full of bloodthirsty cannibals, they finally locate diana, who's under the control of jim jones-type cult leader jonas melvyn (ivan rassimov). jonas does the typical mad guru-style things, like passing out lsd, initiating group suicide, threatening to kill anyone who disobeys him and raping agren with a giant dong dipped in cobra blood. every once in awhile a character will look to the right or left and see a gory scene lifted directly from jungle holocaust or man from deep river (both of which were also directed by lenzi). i'm pretty sure they also use at least two scenes from cannibal holocaust as well. here we get the expected animal slaughter scenes (gutting a gator; natives eating live snakes), plus some additional nudity and a castration. me me lai shows up to give her breast implants another workout playing a widow who is gang banged by three of her brother in laws on top of the ashes of her freshly cremated husband. mel ferrer briefly appears as a professor and isn't given much to do.<br /><br />so anyway, with mangiati vivi! you pretty much get a promise fulfilled with all the nudity, gore, dead animals and bad taste you expect with one of these titles, so if you're a sleaze hound, by all means watch it. personally, i got bored with it about midway through and just wanted it to end. the original (heavily cut) u.s. release in 1985 was titled the emerald jungle in order to trick people into thinking they were actually renting john boorman's emerald forest. it was also called doomed to die and eaten alive by cannibals!
