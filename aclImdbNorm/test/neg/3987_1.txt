this was supposed to be set in the "bible belt" of northern ireland. well, as someone who grew up there,and was a child in the era depicted in the film it just didn't ring true! the accents were all over the place - anything but county antrim/derry. the church didn't resemble any i have ever seen. "the church of god" is a pentecostal denomination but the one in the film was certainly not pentecostal! the elderly minister at the beginning was dressed in the robes of the church of ireland (anglican)- and no c.of i. would call itself "the church of god". the minister was often addressed as "reverend" - they may do that in some parts of the world but i never heard it when i lived in that area. ministers were addressed as "mr ......"<br /><br />this film was very badly researched and cast - fairly typical of irish cinema - annoying! a film can have a great plot, but if it doesn't look authentic, it is rubbish.
