this is by far the worst film i have ever seen it has next to no plot and the plot it does have is very scattered. the story line is lacking in both content, suspense and subtitles, as what would appear to be story line is in russian. the set appears to be only one room with various lighting effects and at the moment you think something good is about to happen you are let down by the total lack of acting, drama, suspense, horror, gore, story line and mythology. the directing style has been done to death(the fisheye camera). it would seem that the only action in this film is within the last 10 - 15 minutes and the action is made worse by the actors inability to portray the suspense correctly. the only interesting thing about this movie was my dog barking at the surround sound.
