if you have ever shopped at wal-mart, then you probably know about the $5 dvd bin that sits by the electronics department. well, that is where i found this movie. however, i was tricked! you see, the cover of this particular dvd had a big picture of sandy bullock on it and even listed her name as a "headliner". i picked it up thinking, "wow, i didn't know sandra bullock did this movie?!?!" so i was pumped to go home and watch a cool sandra bullock movie. much to my surprise, ms. bullock had a small role.....very small role. she plays the girlfriend of the son of the cia agent. talk about supporting actress. she may have had no more than 2 lines in the movie. besides being deceived of this being a bullock flick, i looked past that and i continued to watch an "action-packed" film. negative! at one point, for special effects, a gun was taped to the camera. you gotta watch it to laugh at what horrible really is.
