basically, this was obviously designed to be promotional material for the movie produced by the same horrible director, which happens to be even worse than this documentary and absolutely the worst movie i've ever seen, so avoid it at all costs.<br /><br />as for this documentary, it's entertaining; entertaining and blatantly misleading! most of the "historical" looking footage is most likely just that, historical footage from completely unrelated events that were sadly cut and pasted into this documentary to make it more dramatic than it would have ever been otherwise. there's no doubt that waverly is a pretty interesting place with plenty of it's own fascinating history, but manufacturing a documentary to market the locale and the related production is, for lack of better words, appallingly useless.<br /><br />and yes, i've lived in kentucky my whole life, and i have visited the location numerous times. waverly hills deserves respect; and there's nothing respectful about this lame documentary.
