first off, i've read the comments by the director further down and i'd like to thank him for offering his opinion. i've always wondered what the makers of the films lambasted on mst3k felt about their works being shredded (not to mention how best brains acquired the rights). rissi's comments make me curious, however, as to how much sci-fi could have cut the film to make it seem different (now i'm thinking i might rent it from netflix). of course, i've never seen the uncut, non-mst3k version of this film but even having seen it on mst3k, i never thought of it as a bad film or something unwatchable (though i did think it was a pretty funny mst3k episode); certainly not, as pearl describes it, "skin-peelinging awful"; not after seeing the likes of "future war" and "hobgoblins." <br /><br />as far as cutting the film, it's been done before on mst3k, at least once. case in point: the joe don baker flick, mitchell, in which the subplot involving john saxon's character is cut in the mst3k version, yet joel and the bots comment on saxon's absence after his appearance in the beginning of the movie. if i may submit a criticism of mst3k, if you need to cut the film for time considerations, fine, but be fair to the film being cut (even if it is a film as lousy as mitchell). of course, such criticism is rather pointless what with the show being over, but i think that aspect of the show was kind of unfair. but anyway, if it's the case with soultaker, it gets my sympathies. <br /><br />still, i maintain that it's an enjoyable mst3k episode though the movie itself, even the version that's been "hacked" in mst3k, is no where near terrible. <br /><br />as a final note, in a weird coincidence or perhaps a case of synchronicity, i happened to watch the hudsucker proxy the day soultaker aired and wouldn't you know it, the guy who played vivian schelling's father had a bit part in that movie; one of his three other credited roles, actually. i thought that was kind of weird.
