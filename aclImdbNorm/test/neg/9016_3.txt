warning: spoilers dear roger,<br /><br />during your distinguished career, you've made a wide range of entertainment, some good, some notsogood. "night of the blood beast" falls in the latter category. it's not as unredeemingly awful as say, "the phantom from 10,000 leagues" or, maybe, "the dunwich horror." nonetheless, one of my greatest criticisms of this movie is that i could have made it for you faster, better and cheaper.<br /><br />let's start with the foreward and titles. roger, the rocket sequences look like something from disney's "man into space," not as good, of course. the futuristic rocketship looks like nothing in contemporary 1958. why didn't you just use a vanguard, atlas, or even a viking launch? better still, why not dispense entirely with the launch and start with a shot of space and the capsule floating in it? that's what i would have done for you, roger. second, why have the spaceship crash upon reentry? even a middle school physics student could have told you, your astronaut would have arrived on earth extra crispy and largely deboned. i would have shown your astronaut becoming "possessed" by the monster (maybe by using that great "negative/positive" stuff you used in "war of the satellites"), losing contact with earth and landing in the wilderness. that would also explain how you "blood beast" could impregnate your astronaut during the tremendous heat of reentry, but still be destroyed by fire. even with these stupidities. the first half of your movie is pretty good. had you spent some money on decent music, it would have been as good as a mediocre episode of "outer limits." but, once again, your writer describes ed nelson as the designer of the landing system, then gives him some stupid dialogue regarding magnetism. the biggest problem with the second half of "night of the blood beast" is michael emmet. he's terrible as the doomed astronaut. you should have fired him on the spot and replaced him with ed nelson. you could have combined nelson's responsibilities with those of john dunlap and saved yourself the cost of one actor. i don't know if you actually paid any of these people; but, at least you would saved the cost of catering three meals a day. i'd had also ditched the "scorched parrot" costume and spent the extra money using makeup to have the astronaut turn into the "blood beast". maybe that was a little too close to "the creeping unknown" for you, but it would have helped the pace of the second half immensely. if you are going to have a "blood beast," wouldn't it be a good idea to show a little blood? yeah, i know the title comes from the embryos in the astronaut's blood, but kowalski could've done a lot better job for you if he poured a little chocolate syrup around. after all, it looks like blood in black and white. what've that cost you, maybe two bucks? i'd have also used some closeups. for some reason insipid dialogue and bad acting don't seem quite so bad in closeups. look at almost 70s tv series and you'll see what i mean. oh, in closing, roger, a note to your writer. you can't use a fluoroscope to show some poor schmuck full of alien embryos when you don't have any electricity. remember, you fried the generator in the first reel? oh,and i almost forgot. roger, couldn't you afford a fake knife? you know, the kind where the blade goes into the handle. i had one of those when i was 9, which also happens to be the year "night of the blood beast" was made.it cost, maybe, another two bucks. i think i knew enough then to make you a better movie. i know i know enough now to do so. so, roger, if you decide to remake "night of the blood beast," or if you are looking for a writer/director to work with you on some other project, i'm your man. i'll work cheap, 'cause i'd really like to make a movie for you, roger.<br /><br />i give "night of the blood beast" a "3". special note: if you like to watch kitschy movies like "night of the blood beast," the dvd i bought for $3.99 was very good quality. you can also get "night of the blood beast" along with a lot of other terrible horror/scifi movies at places like bestbuy for about $6.
