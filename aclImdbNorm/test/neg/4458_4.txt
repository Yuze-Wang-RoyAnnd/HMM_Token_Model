being too young to have experienced the hammer films when they were fresh and new, i am discovering their hallowed horror films as i find them on dvd. i know it was almost a decade and half between them but it's hard to see much of the magic in the original hammer dracula in this late entry to the christopher lee series. the original hammer vampire story had lots of atmosphere and a terrific story to get involved in. lee was a great dracula, a vibrant vampire if that possible, in the early outing but here he is nothing more than a cardboard character that mostly stands around and looks threatening. the modish young people talk like cartoon characters (even though my aunt lived in england during the 1970s and she says people actually talked with those awful clich'es). i had no interest whatsoever in who lived or died amongst the younger crowd. they were all pretty terrible characters anyway. i did enjoy seeing a young and charismatic caroline munro; but she leaves the story too early. lee and his historic nemesis peter cushing add an air of authenticity to the film but they can't draw blood from this empty film. it's d.o.a.
