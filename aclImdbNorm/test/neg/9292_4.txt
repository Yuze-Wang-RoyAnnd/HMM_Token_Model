you may be interested to know that barricade was viewed as a failure by the studio and shelved for a year before alice faye's popularity reached such a high that the studio decided to release the film despite the fact that it was never fully completed. it fared modestly ok at the box-office.<br /><br />faye refers to a murder during her nightclub stint in new york city--and this scene was actually in the script and was the way the film was to start. instead, it is entirely missing and what could have been an exciting sequence (including a complete song number by faye) was never filmed. however, the rest of the story is pretty much intact and made release of the film possible at a running time of 71 minutes.<br /><br />a tired looking warner baxter is too old to be believable as faye's romantic interest and is merely perfunctory as the broken down reporter. audiences today would be offended by the depiction of chinese using fractured english phrases like "me likey make noisy". key luke is one of the chinese loyalists but plays his role in a low-key, straightforward way. arthur treacher is all but invisible and yet gets fourth billing on screen due to editing changes in the story. originally, joseph schildkraut had a role in the film but his part was eventually edited out.<br /><br />a mishmash of a film that will serve as entertainment only for the most die-hard alice faye fans who will get a chance to see her in a dramatic role--albeit a weak one. charles winninger is totally wasted as a kindly man running the american consulate.<br /><br />despite all the weaknesses, there are a couple of scenes involving narrow escapes that are effectively played and karl freund's b&w photography is top notch.
