very odd, this seems like a very average movie to me, if not slightly less. it is brilliantly shot but, together with the performance of r. lee ermey, that's about the only redeeming aspect i found in the movie which consists of two separate parts. <br /><br />the first part covers the basic marine-training which, watching it in 2007, comes off like something i've see a zillion times before in dozens of other movies and series and it's not particularly gripping. after 30 minutes i got the idea and wished they could just get on with it. the drill sergeant is about the only believable character while everyone else seem to be just cardboard cut-outs. the general acting is staggeringly haggard and the screenplay is devoid of anything interesting and consists of little more than the sergeant shouting. the boys make it through their training and end up in vietnam. oh, and the fat weirdo shoots the sergeant (what a surprise..), probably in the mistaken belief that it was actually the scriptwriter. <br /><br />so, one hour passed and nothing worthy of note happened. nothing...<br /><br />then we have the vietnam-part.<br /><br />it opens with a bunk-scene where reporters of stars and stripes are bored and are making small talk to pass the time. at first i thought they were re-enacting some movie scenes from old films, it sounded pretty bad. but no, they were actually muttering their script lines. then the camp is besieged. some 20 vietcong enter the camp through the main gate. too bad for them they are being dropped like flies because they simply walk into several manned gun posts with no means of cover. is that normal behaviour? were the vietnamese all suicidal? if so, how come the us didn't win this war during the first two months of engagement? the rest of the movie continues with even more completely illogical war scenes. <br /><br />furthermore, the whole plot is altogether pointless. none of the characters inspire much sympathy and the story is frankly rather uneventful. it shows little more other than some war-reporters hooking up with a platoon with some guys getting shot because they are disobedient morons and who also seem to think that somehow a gaping hole in a wall will protect you from bullets.<br /><br />what was the message of this movie..that people died in vietnam? that people are animals in war situations? that if you want to dispose of really dumb people, you send them to a war zone? or that somehow in vietnam concrete can actually burn? <br /><br />i'm sorry, but if this movie deserves an 8.3, then apocalypse now deserves a 38.3<br /><br />5/10
