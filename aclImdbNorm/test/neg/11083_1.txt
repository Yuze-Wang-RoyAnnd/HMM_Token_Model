possibly the worst movie i ever saw. the person who shot this movie probably never learned not to film directly into a shining light. you can't see anything in this movie. it is way to dark. the parts where you can see something the camera is directed straight at a light source so you get big lens flares. so you still can't see. this movie should have been a radio play or something. some parts of the movie are actually edited upside-down for some kind of crap effect. low budget movies can be done so much better then this. and low budget is no excuse for this. an editor should have said something when he started editing and saw that you couldn't see anything. maybe the makers should have spend some of their low budget on a preview monitor so they could see what they shot. the only good thing about this movie being so dark is that you can't see the awful acting. it also covers up the crappy sfx. people at beginner film schools make better movies then this. movies shot with handy cams look better then this.
