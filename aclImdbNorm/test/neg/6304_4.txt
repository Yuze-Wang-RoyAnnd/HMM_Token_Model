i like all of the main actors involved in this quite bizarre film. terrance stamp, guy pearce & hugo weaving have all proved themselves as some of the best & most capable actors around, but i could not get into this. i don't know if it's because i don't understand the lifestyle or what, but i could not get my head around this film. worse than anything is that the actors made some of the ugliest drag queens i've ever seen. i think that was part of the point, i don't know. i realize that is probably an insult, but i don't know what else to call them. i must say i bought the guys as the performers (the correct term?) but the story just wasn't very good or very interesting either. i will say that i can't usually appreciate costume designers very well, although i notice them when they are wrong or out of place, but i was very much impressed with these. very creative to say the least, just not attractive, but i don't think they're supposed to be. i don't know i am definitely not the target audience and would never go see a performance done by these kind of performers, but i wouldn't go see ballet, or opera either so i don't know. if this is your kind of film then you will probably like it, but if it's not skip it because it is...well not for most of us. i just checked it won the oscar for costume design & i will say rightfully so. i must say ebert didn't care much for this film either, though he liked it better than i did.
