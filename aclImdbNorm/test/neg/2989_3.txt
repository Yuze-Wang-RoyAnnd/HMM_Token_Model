i've seen comments from turkish people (which i'm not) saying this movie is fantastic and accurately portrays turkish life. all i have to say is... turkey must be one of the most boring and depressing places in the world, because in my opinion, that is exactly what this movie was to me. if i were turkish, i think it would have had a greater impact. but if you're not from turkey, i would advise you not to waste two hours of your life on this.<br /><br />"distant" seems to lag on forever. many scenes are painstakingly long with little or no purpose. i don't understand the director's objectives in even including many of the scenes. it is pointed out that the director used his own car, apartment, and friends in making the movie...well guess what? it shows. it looks low budget. the acting is poor. if it's a cultural thing then so be it. i just don't understand the purpose of basing a movie on this story. it's unbelievably boring.
