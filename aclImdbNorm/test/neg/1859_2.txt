a group of teens have their car break down in the middle of nowhere. they seek shelter in a farmhouse. but three murderous convicts are there killing the owner of said farmhouse and his family. one of them accidentally brings zombies around by knocking over a scarecrow. cue blood, gore, carnage, bad acting. better than the first but only by default. i still wouldn't wish it on my arch-enemy, bob. in the end the filmmaker wants it to be a parable about how we us americans are killing ourself and our forests (huh? ok, whatever buddy) dude i'd rather chop down forests then have my braincells diminish and my grey matter leak out of my ears. in other words become a simple-minded idiot liberal.<br /><br />my grade: d-
