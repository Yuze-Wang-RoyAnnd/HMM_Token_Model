it was dumb. sort of like an adam sandler movie. <br /><br />there were a few funny parts but not that funny.<br /><br />i liked some of the actors in it though. <br /><br />there were some sat. night live people in the movie. but i wouldn't recommend this unless there is just nothing else better on. and it was still better than any jennifer lopez movie.
