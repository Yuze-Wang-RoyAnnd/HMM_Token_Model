granny, directed by boris pavlovsky (who?), sees eight friends experiencing a night of terror when a psycho-killer dressed in a old hag rubber mask and a nightdress interrupts their party.<br /><br />they say you can't judge a book by its cover, but it appears that the same is not true of dvds: i was in the mood for a really bad horror film last night, and since the cover of granny featured a shoddily photo-shopped image of the titular killer swinging an axe, terrible typography (they even use the system font sand, a definite design no-no!), and credits featuring absolutely no-one i had heard of, i reckoned it would be pretty lousy.<br /><br />it was!<br /><br />when a film clocks in at just under an hour long, it really shouldn't waste too much time before getting to the action; granny, however, spends the first 20 minutes or so with its unlikable group of friends indulging in pointless games and extremely banal conversation. anyone who actually stays with the film long enough for the killing to begin (and i doubt most sane people would bother) will be treated to several dreadful death scenes featuring amateurish gore, loads of awful acting, and a surprise ending that comes as no surprise (if you've seen april fool's day, then you'll guess what the twist is way before it is revealed).<br /><br />granny is uninspired, unexciting, and almost unwatchable. avoid.
