a wasted effort. on the surface it's a typical disaster movie: we're involved in the lives of a few people who get caught up in the big event. however, the script is so awful and there's so much explaining of the characters' background within the dialogue that we feel we're being treated like morons. even sesame street didn't explain the origins of mr snuffleupagus or how mr hooper died: we can work it out. someone thought that entering 'enron' into the script would give it currency when discussing power companies. the acting is by and large bland, with the exception of the older performers (randy quaid, brian dennehy), and after the first hour, i couldn't care less about who the storms took out.<br /><br />but maybe there are the special effects to watch. sadly, no. even on a 20-year-old tv set i could see one tractor and trailer were computer-generated
