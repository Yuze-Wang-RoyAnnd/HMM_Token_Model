welcome to the world of vikram bhatt, the man who was once successful and got several hits with small actors like kasoor, raaz and also the multistarrer awara paagal deewana and his one film with aamir ghulam<br /><br />one sneak peak about this films are that all are hollywood remakes and some decent ones like the once which worked<br /><br />speed is a remake of cellular and that too a terrible one <br /><br />a look at the stars, we have the once saleable but now out of work urmila and sanjay suri, then we have the flop aftab, ashish chaudhary, zayed khan and others<br /><br />the film could be a decent thriller but many problems are there the storytelling has several cringeworthy scenes like zayed hijacking a mobile company and many more and the stunts too are laughable while the twists in the end are too laughable the film also took a long time to reach the theatres which looses it's spark<br /><br />direction is awful music is outdated<br /><br />zayed khan screams, makes faces.etc what he does always urmila is good in her part, sanjay suri is not that convincing ashish chaudhary tries hard in a negative role and he is okay aftab is horrible and he makes you laugh in a negative role surprising the same director gave him his only solo hit kasoor sophie is horrible tanushree is a non actress
