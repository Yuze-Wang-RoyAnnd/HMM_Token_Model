here's a couple of paragraphs out of an essay i wrote for university about tbor.<br /><br />"the book of revelation is an erotic thriller about sex, power and a talented dancer's struggle to regain his sense of self after being unfortunately raped by three cloaked women. the three women that violate him all have distinctive marks on the bodies; one has a giant birth mark on her buttocks, another has a butterfly tattoo on her lower stomach and the ring leader has a small circle on her breast. so he lives his new life in search of these markings, and to find them on these intimate places he does what any sane man does when he needs to see as many naked women as possible to solve a mystery, he has sex with them. an hour and ten minutes into the film and you feel like he has almost had a piece of every woman in melbourne.<br /><br />the film is a giant chunk of pretentious celluloid; it is like grandiloquence drips from every frame. at only one point towards the films final climax does kokkinos give a scene the same energy and strength as her debut feature head on had in droves. as like many films funded by the government bodies the film takes it self way to seriously, the script and its execution appear to be chores rather then gifts and unfortunately for the talented thespians, their brilliant performances (particularly tom long as the fractured protagonist) are stuck within the confines of a pompous wan k fest."
