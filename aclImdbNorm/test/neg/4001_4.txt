ordinarily, i love these "stranger within" thrillers. some good examples are "fatal attraction," "single white female," and "audition." done well, they can be a lot of fun, and worth an hour or two of solid shocks and scares. of course, the opposite can be true: done poorly, they can be tedious and stupid. "the hand that rocks the cradle" is one of the latter.<br /><br />the bartels, claire (annabella sciorra) and michael (matt mccoy) are welcoming another member to their family. but busy claire is persuaded by michael to hire a nanny. one day, a woman named peyton flanders (rebecca demornay) shows up, and because she seems perfect, the bartels hire her. of course, once she shows up, their idyllic life is slowly unraveling...<br /><br />this film suffers from a plethora of problems, but the biggest one is the handling of the villain. peyton is never believable. part of this has to do with how she's written, and how she's acted. the things that she does that are supposed to put us on edge are so contrived that they're laughable. de mornay doesn't help much. she portrays peyton as two different people. while it's true she's supposed to be the perfect nanny while hiding her psychotic tendencies, de mornay's performance creates a divide between the two facets of her character.<br /><br />the other actors are good, however. annabella sciorrra is terrific as the asthmatic claire. sciorra is very natural in the role, but unfortunately, the script lets her down. matt mccoy is almost invisible. however, julianne moore is delightful as claire's friend marlene. moore is a firecracker, but unfortunately she's only on screen for a total of five minutes.<br /><br />curtis hanson is a good director, but you wouldn't know it from watching this dud. the film has a few decent shocks, but it's poorly paced, and the climax, while generating some tension, is actually kind of laughable. that being said, he's working with a script that at best, could charitably be called pathetic.<br /><br />trust me, when it comes to nannies, stick with fran drescher. this one should have gone to the direct-to-video bin.
