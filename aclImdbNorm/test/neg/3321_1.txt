i remember all the hype around this movie when aaliyah was killed. being a fan of ms. rice's novels, my first thought was "how can they do queen of the damned without doing vampire lestat first?"<br /><br />having finally seen the movie, now i can see how they did it. if you have read these books, imagine taking out the gory parts from vampire lestat, cramming marcus and marius into one character, and removing everything to do with lestat's beginning (the wolf hunt, his violin playing, the theatre of the vampires, and also louis, claudia, and gabrielle), then in the last 15 minutes cramming in queen of the damned.<br /><br />what we loose is a very important piece of lestat's character. his inner agony of having to kill to live, the fact that he carefully tries to select killers as his victims, and his love-hate relationship with louis, armand, gabrielle, and all the other vampires.<br /><br />also important to the story is that we loose the "story of the twins", which is the genesis of ms. rice's vampires. and while i am sure the cannibalism was to intense for showing on the screen, they could have done something closer, and showed us more of ancient egypt.<br /><br />even worse, we have this love interest thrown in between jessie and lestat. the vampire chronicles is basically an american yoni story. for those that do not know, yoni is another form of hentai (japanese porn comics). but in yoni, it is about gay male relationships, told by a female. while i am sure many men object to the "gayness" of the characters, in this movie they went to the far extreme the opposite way. for instead of lestat persueing killers, he goes after young female groupies.<br /><br />and the other flaws in logic and storyline are vast. at the beginning lestat emerges from a century long sleep, then later on asks marius how he made it through the 1950's in red velvet. marius has no idea who elvis is, and says he slept through that period. makes you wonder how lestat knows about 50's fashion and music, since he slept through the same time period himself. and nothing is ever even mentioned about louis, claudia, or gabrielle. i think that is a huge shame. is like seeing "snow white and the 3 dwarfs".<br /><br />overall, the movie i thought was really bad. about the only good thing about it was the soundtrack. most of the acting was poor, the accents drove me up the wall, and all of the really in-depth parts of the book were removed, leaving us only with a hollow shell, kind of like enkil after he was sucked dry.<br /><br />if you want to see a good modern vampire movie, get lost boys, the original interview with a vampire, or even some old episodes of dark shadows. let this one rest in piece, with a stake through the heart, cloves of garlic around the neck, and a vial of holy water in the mouth.<br /><br />in ending, remember that before aaliyah was killed, this was intended to go straight to video, no theatrical release was planned. it is obvious now why this was. it is only sad that somebody as talented as she will be remembered for this dog of a movie, instead of something where she really might have shined.<br /><br />i rate this a 2 on a scale of 1-10.
