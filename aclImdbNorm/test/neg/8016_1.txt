this film is an almost complete waste of time. i am studying the book for my english a level, and the film only contributes in one way, and that's getting across that the whole scenario is set in a rural idyll. the acting is wooden, the filmography is laughable, and the so called dramatic scenes in the film had the majority of my class (including me) snickering into their texts. the book, although not my favourite literary choice, is miles better than the film is, and the sound track is just plain irritating. don't watch this film unless you are looking for a timeless, quality storyline transformed into mindless, media waste.
