let me first state that i really really wanted to like this film. for the most part the actors and actresses looked their parts, and did fairly well in their roles, but the movie lacked any real plot. it seemed so wraped up in seeming 'wacky' that no interesting story ever shone through. also, the camera work was often sloppy, attempting snatchlike camera work and failing miserably. most of the time, shots meant to look cool ended up being confusing. perhaps something was lost during translation, but some of the characters were just... stupid. the crazy pretty boy who sniffs people like a dog? uhhhhhhh. ok. overall, a fat stinking 1/10. not worth your time.
