killjoy 2 is the same as killjoy 1. bad acting, bad characters, annoying clown, bad lines, you name it. honestly, i'm not all that surprised that more people haven't seen this movie. the only reason i watched killjoy 2 is because i wanted to think that the filmmakers learned from their mistakes. they didn't. this movie is just as bad, if not worse, than the first one. that clown.... that goddamn clown.... i hate him! i hate him so much! and i don't hate him because he is a good villain... i hate him because he is annoying beyond belief! i hope that the filmmakers realized after trying and failing again that this movie is unrepairable. the last thing we need is a killjoy 3.
