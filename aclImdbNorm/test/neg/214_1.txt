this movie is sooooo bad that it forced me to create an account with imdb just to warn others about it.<br /><br />i have been using imdb for a long time, and many movies have come close to making me want to register to either praise or bash them, however none have ever been that worthy. until now! <br /><br />i am a huge matt dillon fan. all i could ask myself throughout this movie is "how did dillon choose this script"? really. i mean there are holes in it larger than vredefort. <br /><br />i mean it is a modern day heist movie, not one set in the seventies. for crying out loud, even a child knows that armored trucks have gps tracking and the sort. makes you wonder what it takes to get a script produced in hollywood.<br /><br />i could go on for ages, but i wont. believe me when i say this. save yourself the time and give this a skip.<br /><br />sorry matt, i'm still a fan, but this movie sucked.
