okay... she's on the boat with this guy, realizes he's out to kill her, knocks him out, and then finds the reason he's out to off her is this disk that got her coworker killed. so what would any rational person do? maybe conk him over the head again to make sure he's really out?? tie him up?? look, sandra honey, you've got the chance to escape while the guy is out for only so long. until you know how long it will take you take you to escape, make sure he's not able to come after you. i hate these stupid female victim roles. the rest of the movie was just a series of twists and turns that were completely convoluted and too unbelievable to remain interesting.
