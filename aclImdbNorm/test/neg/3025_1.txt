good lord.<br /><br />i'm going to say right off the bat, i only watched 20 minutes of this movie. as i am a hardcore eraserhead fan, the "what, you can't watch a wierd black and white movie with little-to-no dialogue?" defense does not apply. i simply can't watch terrible weird black and white movies with little-to-no dialogue.<br /><br />this movie is what happens when you give an angsty goth-child with no talent and nothing to say a camera and budget, and let him/her put as much meaninglessly offensive imagery on screen as possible. it was clear from the start that this film should have been 5 minutes long (assuming it should exist at all). shots that should last a few seconds drag on for minutes, because the director has "i-just-love-the-sound-of-my-own-voice" syndrome, and refuses to cut to another shot until the entire piece of footage has been viewed. from the moment the girl in the mask started masturbating the corpse of "god" (the opening scene of the film! joy!), i knew it was only a matter of time until i turned off the tape. after at least 10 minutes of a different corpse being pulled around, twitching, on a rope, by a gang of cloaked mystery-men, i knew it was time to give up. rarely do i give up on a movie. i sat through the entirety of blair witch 2: book of shadows, albeit not happily. this did not deserve the 20 minutes i gave it.<br /><br />if you're an eraserhead fan, do not let simple-minded comparisons to said film con you into renting this piece of amateur trash. allow me to refer you to tetsuo: the iron man, for a watchable and enjoyable piece of incoherent black and white weirdness.
