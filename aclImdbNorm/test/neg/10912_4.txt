cujo is a giant, lovable, gentle and affectionate st. bernard owned by the camber family, during the opening sequence cujo chases a rabbit over fields and through a local wood somewhere in castle rock, maine. the rabbit disappears into a burrow and cujo sticks his head into the entrance hole. the rabbit vanishes from cujo's sight, angry cujo starts to bark and in doing so inadvertently wakes up and annoy a colony of bats, one of which bites him on the nose. donna trenton (dee wallace-stone as dee wallace) is having an affair with steve kemp (christopher stone, dee wallace's real life husband) which her husband vic (daniel hugh kelly) who works in advertising, discovers. obviously their relationship becomes strained. happily oblivious to all of this is their young son tad (danny pintauro). joe camber (ed lauter) fixes cars for a living out of his barn on his farmhouse. joe is planning a guys weekend with one of his friends gary pervier (mills watson) when his wife charity (kaiulani lee) wins $5,000 on the lottery and decides to take their young boy brett (billy jayne as billy jacoby) with her on a trip to see her parents. arriving at gary's house to pick him up joe finds him dead on the floor, he goes into the kitchen to call for help and his dog cujo who is now rabid attacks and kills him. donna and tad drive to the camber's farmhouse to try and get her car repaired. the place is deserted except for cujo who is now completely rabid, foaming at the mouth, his fur stained red with blood and maddened by pain. cujo attacks the car to try and get at donna and tad, luckily for them the windows hold firm, at least for the time being anyway. donna tries to start the car but it has completely broken down, they are both trapped with nothing but the hope that someone will come and rescue them. cujo lies in wait, ready to attack and kill anyone who crosses his path. directed by lewis teague i thought the film was a bit slow for my tastes. the first half plods along, the second half builds up a head of steam but i still felt it was a little underwhelming and unexciting. the acting is fine by everyone involved, i've no complaints there. technically the film is ok, photography, music, special effects, editing and it's generally well made. the big problem is the script by don carlos dunaway and lauren currier and in particular it's first half, most of which appears to be padding to stretch the run time out. clocking in at just under the 90 minute mark it felt longer. it's also a little predictable as well. cujo as a monster never really scared me either, i just don't find slobbering overweight st. bernards scary i guess. i suppose there's nothing really wrong with it, but i don't think i'd be in a hurry to see it again. average, not too bad if you can find a copy going cheap or catch it on t.v. for free.
