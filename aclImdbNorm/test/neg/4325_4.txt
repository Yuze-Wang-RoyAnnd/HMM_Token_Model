if at all possible, try to view all five of the universal "mummy" films in order, not so much for the continuity between films, but for the very evident lack thereof. of course it goes without saying that the original boris karloff classic "the mummy" really shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath as the so called "sequels", all of which come off as campy or cultish. <br /><br />this time around, it's revealed that the mummified remains of princess ananka have made their way to the united states. and once again, as your eyes deceive you, kharis the mummy didn't really die for the second time in "the mummy's tomb", but is alive and searching for his lost love princess ananka, with the help of the rhetorical nine tana leaves brewed during the cycle of the full moon. to complete the mythology, kharis needs a caretaker, ably filled by a gaunt john carradine as yousef bey, entrusted with the task by george zucco's andoheb, high priest of arkan. <br /><br />kharis and ananka are to be returned to their final resting place in the hills of arkan in egypt. but as we've seen before, being entrusted with the duty of a high priest is a sure bet to end in failure, with carradine's character falling for the reincarnation of ananka, amina monsouri (ramsay ames). it's shocking to see yousef bey and the po'ed bandaged one come to blows over the gorgeous amina. <br /><br />riddle me this - in both "tomb" and "curse", lon chaney portrays the mummy with a limp right arm folded helplessly across his chest. when he encounters the fainted amina, he lifts her up in both arms with no problem; as soon as he puts her down his right arm returns to it's crippled position once again.<br /><br />the ending of the film is most notable - the monster gets the girl! but it's a short lived victory, as the mummy and his kidnapped bride succumb to a swampy grave, an ancient egyptian curse is fulfilled - "the fate of those who defy the will of the ancient gods shall be a cruel and violent death".
