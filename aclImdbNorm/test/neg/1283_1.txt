this movie should go down in the annals of fiefdom as one of the worst of all time. i will stop short of saying it's the worst movie ever, only because i have yet to see every movie ever made. i cannot make such lofty claims until then. the story is stale, the acting is horrible, at best, the "special" effects are no more than a couple of lbs. of dry ice and a fan. somebody must have been related to someone to get this movie made. mr. busey mailed this one in! the dog is well trained and cute, making it the only redeeming quality in this never-should-have-made-it movie. two hours and $3 of my life i will never get back.
