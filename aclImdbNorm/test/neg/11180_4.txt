there are so very few films where just the title tells you all you need to know about the film. such a film is i was a communist for the fbi. another example would be i married a monster from outer space.<br /><br />the really interesting thing about this film is how in heaven's name did this get nominated for an oscar in the documentary category? it is not a documentary in any sense of the word, it's not even in that hybrid category of docudrama. it's just a rather exploitive film about the work of an fbi undercover agent named matt cvetic who infiltrated the communist party in pittsburgh and got active in trying to take over the steelworker's union for the communists and reporting on said activities to his handlers in the fbi.<br /><br />a documentary of that work might have been interesting, but what we got was a film to fit those paranoid times. i found it fascinating that when cvetic finally broke his cover it was to the house un-american activities committee rather than the trial in new york of the communist party leaders. there was a moment in the film where head communist james millican tells his followers to start spreading the word that the house un american activities committee was composed of a bunch of right wing yahoos looking to get their names in front of the camera. now what could have given him that idea? anyway just connect the dots and no doubt the word their came from j. edgar hoover trying to give some credence to huac by having an effective undercover come out there rather than at an actual trial. little thing there called cross examination.<br /><br />warner brothers who produced i was a communist for the fbi later produced big jim mclain which starred john wayne about a huac investigator in hawaii. huac did grab on to credit for the work done by the honolulu pd in breaking up a communist spy ring there among the dockworkers. but at least in john wayne's film nobody claimed it was a documentary.<br /><br />frank lovejoy is in the title role as cvetic and his fbi handlers are richard webb and philip carey. dorothy hart plays a pittsburgh school teacher who says that there are 30 or so like here in that school system indoctrinating the young among whom is ron hagerthy, lovejoy's son. she has a change of heart about the communists and lovejoy has to save her from a homicidal fate planned by his superiors. ironically hart left the movies and went to work for all places, the united nations which as we know has been accused often of being a communist nest in the usa.<br /><br />over half a century later and we really have very few objective works on film or in print about the communist party of the usa. they were in fact a very active bunch in the labor movement. the real heroes in stopping them were labor organizers like walter reuther in the uaw or david dubinsky in the ilgwu. but since they were people of the left they just don't have the following on the right to be suitable propaganda material.<br /><br />anyway i was a communist for the fbi is an exploitive work based on a real life character and a testament to those paranoid times.
