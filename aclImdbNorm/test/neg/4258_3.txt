nishabd means wordless. this must be the condition of the script before the shooting of this film started and therefore throughout this film cries for content. what you go for is an unusual love story between a 60-yr old man and an 18-yr old girl and what you get are very usual, very common events that neither excite nor surprise. so what we are left finally is with picturesque locations of kerala shot brilliantly by cinematographer amit roy and camera friendly histrionics of newfound jiah khan. this does not cover up for lack of a concrete script. producer-director ram gopal varma who has such a good track record of films needs to pull up his socks. as far as mr. bachchan goes, i don't want to discuss him in context of this film.<br /><br />while reviewing, i am feeling loss of words. i am left speechless rather wordless !<br /><br />personal opinion : this film can be compared with an equally bad film released some time back called black. i don't see the difference between the histrionics of lead characters in both the films. what did you say just now- that was a world-class cinema blah blah, and i don't have any taste. well, take a walk. no i don't mean literally but actual one to the theaters showing this film. because in that case you might find this film an oscar-level material.
