welcome to the plan 9 from outer space of star trek movies. come on, trekkers, admit it. this movie is so bad, so staggeringly inept in every department, it's become something of a classic.<br /><br />the shat gives the worst performance ever committed to celluloid. "boones! hi, bones" brilliant! this isn't just ham - it's several large pig farms in kentucky! <br /><br />the "special" effects. should be done under the trade descriptions act for using such a term. the enterprise is a moving piece of cardboard in this film. really! even the star trek tv show had better.<br /><br />bones, spock and the shat sing! yeah, spock sings row row row your boat. after struggling over the meaning of the words!!!! "capt. life is not a dream" poor leonard nimoy, he must really want to strangle shatner for this. could the shat not have given us his rendition of mr. tambourine man, or harmonised with nimoy on ballad of bilbo baggins? sorely disappointed.<br /><br />a sean connery look-a-like plays spock's half-brother. only cos they couldn't get sean connery! uhura does a fan dance! that would have been sexy in 1966. in 1989 it's like watching your drunk granny embarrass herself at a christmas party.<br /><br />cat woman jumps on shatner's back! shat twirls her around a few times like a wwf wrestler, and chucks her off. yayy the shat! seems connery 2.0 was a bit of a vulcan rebel. which explains why spock hasn't previously mentioned him in 79 t.v episodes and 4 movies. mccoy apparently mercy-killed his dad, but afterwards they found a cure. tell me this isn't hysterically funny.<br /><br />the 11 deck enterprise suddenly grows another 400 decks for an escape sequence in an elevator shaft. spock's antigrav boots amazingly support bones and the shat as well. should also have used em on the humped-back whales in star trek iv! shatner meets god! or what purports to be god, but i assume is really some kind of alien being. god looks a bit like charlton heston in the 10 commandments. sean connery the 2nd calls on god to share his pain, and promptly dies. or something. god punishes the shat for questioning his identity. so spock kills god with a photon torpedo. i'd love to know what jehovah's witnesses made of this scene.<br /><br />the shat, having killed god, promptly goes back to his sing-song with spock and bones. altogether now, row row row your boat.....
