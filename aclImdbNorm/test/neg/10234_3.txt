wow, was this version of the racketeer tough to watch! while none of the other reviews have mentioned this, the public domain version i watched was seriously flawed. the sound track was off by about 10 seconds--meaning the dialog and action never came close to matching. so, you'd hear something occur well before you saw it--a very confusing proposition! the worst is where you hear a gun shot and only later doe the guy get hit and slump to his death in a taxi.<br /><br />while this seriously marred the film, it also made concentrating on the dialog easier--and showed the serious shortcomings of it as well. the dialog was simply awful--often delivered with almost no inflection or feeling. as one review said, it was like watching a high school play. part of this is understandable, as sound was a new medium, but this film's dialog was bad even compared to other 1929 films--really bad. and, like many of these early sound films, the film was just too talky--with sappy and overly melodramatic language and just not much action. and you'd think with a title like "the racketeer" that there would be some action!! however, it's really a sappy romance--with very little action.<br /><br />the film finds carol lombard straddled with an alcoholic musician. she herself ends up stealing to try to take care of him--and the crook, robert armstrong, comes to her assistance. when armstrong catches her cheating at cards, he covers for her and then helps the drunk brother to get on his feet--and naturally he falls for her in the process. the problem is that once the drunk sobers up, he, too, wants lombard and she needs to choose between them. wow...a recovering drunk or a mobster...talk about a couple great prospects! overall, it's a bit hard to rate considering the lousy print i saw. however, even if you ignore this, the film has a lot of problems due to its poor use of dialog and excessively talky nature. and...it was sappy too boot.
