you want the worst horror movie of the 21st century? el chupacabra is it. "manos:the hands of fate" is the worst movie of all time, but el chupacabra certainly is the worst movie of this century. it also has to have the distinction of having the absolute worst leading actor ever. eric alegria, the actor in the lead role, has never done another film other than el chupacabra, gee - i wonder why.<br /><br />apparently the monster is attacking people, but everyone that is attacked moves really slowly and is really stupid. and, there are no cops at all in this town just two idiot detectives - hello! cops show up on the scene of homicides first, then the detectives come! and, apparently the monster only attacks in one person's backyard, and some deserted area by the docks. or...thats the only places the filmmakers could get access to film.<br /><br />this 'film' is the reason why imdb must allow us to give negative stars. this easily deserves -10 stars, or at least 0. they should allow a 0 rating.
