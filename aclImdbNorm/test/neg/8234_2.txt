i consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies. the more bizarre and imaginative the film, the more blood and guts, the better, and i really fall in love with cheaply done flicks if they are done right. luther starts out well enough... his origin at the circus, a creepy run at a supermarket, an attack of an old lady, and his disturbing occupation of a woman's farmhouse all set the mood nicely. a hot sex/ shower scene ensues when the woman's daughter and daughter's boyfriend arrives at the house. when luther steals the boyfriends motorbike the movie takes a turn for the worse. <br /><br />the characters are presented with numerous opportunities to: a) save their loved ones, b) get the police to help, c) escape, or (most importantly) d) kill luther!!! i can't feel empathy or fear for characters that are too stupid to help themselves. chareters snub chances to arm themselves with guns and knives while luther is away. a policeman eventually arrives and is equally ineffective in stopping luther, even though at one point he has a rifle squarely aimed at luther while luther clucks and does his rendition of the polish chicken dance. i found myself futilely coaching my television: "make sure he's dead!", "hes gone, get out of there!", or "just kill him already!" <br /><br />luther is a bloodthirsty savage, but he is hardly hannibal lecter. if you can't outsmart this egghead, you deserve what's coming to you. by halfway through the movie you'll be so lethargic to the fates of the half-wits that only morbid curiosity will sustain you to last to the mildly amusing ending. this movie was noted as one of fangoria's 101 greatest movies you've never seen... well fangoria is half-right in the case of luther the geek.
