most critics have written devastating about that michalkov-movie, but i wanted it to see myself. and, unfortunately, they are right. the film had the greatest budget ever in russian movie history, two international stars, colorful mass scenes, apparently shot quite close to the kremlin - but in the end it appears to be a nice, sweet nothing. you would not believe, that this director earlier has made masterpieces like urga and burnt by the sun. the characters in the storyline are not convincing, neither jane nor mccracken nor andrej. only general radlov worth being mentioned. it remains on the surface all the time. politically it is to me a glorification of the army, and especially the russian one with values like honor and duty. and, having lived at least half a year in siberia: my russia is much more than the one that is depicted in michalkovs movie. regarding "burnt by the sun" by the same director as a no-question-10-points-movie, one of the best i ever seen in my entire life, i was totally disappointed by that one. sorry. nevertheless, michalkovs unique talent in delivering amazingly beautiful pictures is still there.
