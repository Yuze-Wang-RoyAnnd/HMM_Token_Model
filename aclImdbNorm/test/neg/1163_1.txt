all of the great horror movies of the 70's, 80's, and even the early 90's from psycho, to texas chainsaw masacre (the original not that warmed over wb crap), to silence of the lambs. the characters in these movies were based upon the crimes of ed gein. the writers and directors tapped into the true story for the inspiration for creating some of the greatest *fictional* movie killers of all time.<br /><br />the old horror films were great because even though the crimes were loosely based upon the facts of the case of ed gein, they were truly fictional and far removed from the true story.<br /><br />in the case of this movie, they've created a fictional horror film in which they tried to capitalize on the true story in order to sell a cheap, poorly acted, love story between two characters that nobody really cares about. in fact, in a *good* horror film these two characters would have been excellent victims.<br /><br />end of lecture...<br /><br />in short, this film was like wearing clammy underwear on a cold afternoon sipping on a nice cup of chilled vomit.
