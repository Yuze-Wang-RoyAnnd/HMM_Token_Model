when i found out there was a christmas vacation 2, i couldn't wait to buy the dvd. i sent off my money and watched it as soon as it came through the letter box. i love all the national lampoons films with chevy chase in it, and i bet he was glad he wasn't in this one!. i couldn't believe how bad this was, you would think it was impossible not to laugh at a national lampoons film, but believe me it is! . this film probably looked like a good idea on paper having cousin eddie as the main character, he started to get on my nerves from early on in the film, and became totally unfunny by the middle of the film, and by the end of the film i had gone brain dead and couldn't remember what had happened! .
