if i had never seen the first road house, then i guess this movie might get one more star, but even then that makes it a 3 star movie. for that matter i was really surprised as to the relatively high rating it currently has.<br /><br />in reality, i was not able to finish this movie, as it was painful. where it went wrong (at least the most obvious way) is that it pretty much parallels the original exactly even though the original plot is still referenced. this doesn't really make sense and doesn't work. also, the acting is weak...i never felt like i was into the movie yet i felt like i was watching people act. even good actors like busey don't work out, probably due to the screenplay or maybe the awkward editing. the strangest thing is that the movie feels like a mid 90's b movie, yet is made in 06. i am not sure as to why, but then again, this often seems to happen with sequels for some reason. the music, the look, and the whole overall feel reminds me of movies you saw 10 years ago on cinemax late at night. the strangest thing of all is that i am also expecting ja rule to come in at some point...often it reminds me of more current movies with rappers as actors.<br /><br />the most irritating thing is love interest girl who's character seems like a total rip off of the lois lane character on smallville which is also quite annoying. and lets not forget the fakest sounding "southern accents" i have heard since walk the line. i realize this is common place in movies, but no accent at all would work better than attempting to sound like you are from that universal hick place on tv where anyone from any southern state (or ky and wv) sound exactly the same. sure, people in desert towns in az sound just like people in southeastern states 2000+ miles away. that was wearing thin 10 years ago in the b movies where technique came from. why do writers / directors make such decisions? <br /><br />bottom line: i would truly not recommend this if you are a fan of road house or if you like good movies. also, if you have not seen it yet, don't spoil it by seeing this version first. the original road house was one of those accidental classics that people love and watch over and over. it was an unexpected success like american graffiti, dazed and confused, and more recently office space, fast and furious (only the first one!), and napolean dynamite. why did they spoil it!!!???<br /><br />they should have never made a sequel to road house other than a high budget version with the right actors / director. sure, you can never top the original (ex: bad news bears, the longest yard, etc.), but at least if you can do it right it will be presentable as is the case with the examples i mentioned. but to make a low budget, off-network, self production of road house is criminal.
