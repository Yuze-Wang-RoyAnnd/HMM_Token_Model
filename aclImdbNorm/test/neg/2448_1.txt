unbelievable. i never saw something like that. everything is bad; really bad. from photography (lots of scenes without focus!) to the acting (the young female is terrible). and what can we say about those helicopters made in paint brush...? really amazing b, i mean, z film.<br /><br />the plot are bad, clich'e and bad wrote. basics conveniences to the screenplay seems to work. i can't even think a young student of cinema making this movie. nothing justify it.<br /><br />i recommend that you don't even think to see this movie. sleep or play solitary are best choices. ;)<br /><br />xxx
