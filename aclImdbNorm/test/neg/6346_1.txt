i'm not sure who should be blamed for this debacle - in truth, the acting isn't too bad and the story isn't as terrible as some made-for-disney movies have been. the story itself is shallow and undeveloped but that isn't surprising in a film of this type. the acting is more than a bit two-dimensional, but i give the actors credit for managing to do anything with the material that they had to work with.<br /><br />however, it's inexcusable, in my book, to base an entire storyline on the theory that they've created a 'perfect' pop star and then cast an actress who can't sing to save her life. if the girl can't sing, have someone who can record the music!<br /><br />this actress is a terrible singer - she was so flat she was usually singing in a totally different key!
