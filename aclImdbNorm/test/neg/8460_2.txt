if this was nominated for a screenwriting award by the wga, a professional association of screenwriters, then it's time to hang up the word processor. astonishingly inept writing, direction, production, at every level, even for a tv movie. no cliche goes unexploited in this jaw-droppingly bad movie. what were they thinking? does anyone really believe kids are stupid enough to watch this?
