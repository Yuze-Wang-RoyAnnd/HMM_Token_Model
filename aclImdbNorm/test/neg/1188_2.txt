as a massive fan of the three tv series, i was very interested to learn that log were moving onto the big screen. in my more honest moments though, i had my doubts about the likely success of the concept, and whether the writers would be able to sustain the high level of wit, comedy and horror that infuse the original series.<br /><br />unfortunately my fears were not unfounded, and the film was a huge disappointment. i struggle to understand the other comments on this site. obviously people are entitled to their opinions, but the guys i watched it with, all agree with me, and they are just as big fans as i am.<br /><br />the acting lacked conviction, but they are so good that even when not at their best, they are still highly watchable. the main problem was the plot - and the script. there were a few laughs, but not enough, a few moments of disgust, but not enough. worst of all was the feeling of emptiness after walking out of the cinema. so rarely have i felt so utterly uninspired by a film and so unmotivated to discuss it with others.<br /><br />i write this comment as a warning to other league fans - get a wide range of opinion on this film before going to see it. if you love league, you might be able to convince yourself that they didn't totally mess up their move to cinema. if you can't convince yourself of this, then you will have tarnished in your mind the otherwise spotless genius that exemplifies the tv series.<br /><br />log at the cinema? more like log. (or little brown fish).
