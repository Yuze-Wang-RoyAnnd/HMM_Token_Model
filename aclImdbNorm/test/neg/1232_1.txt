please do not waste six hours of your life watching this as i did. the fact that i did is not a very good reflection on me. the only redeeming acting job in this clunker was by wes studi. how a 'prequel' with similar roots can not even be in the same universe as lonesome dove is beyond me!! it was a disjointed, rambling, incoherent story. plot lines were not developed, action scenes were almost laughable and the big ending (disappointment) was a fitting ending to this mini-series. val kilmer who i have thought as a reputable actor played one of the strangest roles that i have ever seen him in. his final scene in the show had to have been a filler by the director. i have been reading these reviews for years and this show prompted me to sign up!!!
