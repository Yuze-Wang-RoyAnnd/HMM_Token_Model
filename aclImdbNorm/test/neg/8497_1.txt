this film has made e mad. i believe the original of this film ,'the mask', was an awesome film, worth buying and watching a lot. i strongly believed that they should make a sequel, but when i saw this, i thought again.<br /><br />this film has spoilt the whole idea of 'the mask'. mask mode? a baby flying around in a room? my little brother who is seven didn't even laugh, and he is into these childish movies, but this was worse. a load of crap!! i am telling you now, please do not watch this film, it is a waste of money and a waste of time. instead you could actually be having fun! watch 'the mask', but do not, i repeat do not, watch this hunk of junk. thank you.
