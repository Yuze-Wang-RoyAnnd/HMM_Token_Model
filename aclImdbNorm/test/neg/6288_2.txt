the funniest thing about fortunes is that one of the main characters, lewis (urbaniak) has writer's block and apparently so did the screenplay writer for the film. this is sad, as well, as i guess by large, this is supposed to be a comedy, or dramedy, but that's the funniest thing i can remember from watching this.<br /><br />three friends go out and drink one night. on the way home, two decide to get their fortunes told by a "gypsy," as they call her. those two lives fall apart while the third friend stands by. then, nothing happens.<br /><br />i hope i didn't spoil the movie there, but really, this extremely low-budget, bad quality movie had some kind of idea when it started but quickly snowballed into the depths of hell. yeah, i'm being harsh. honestly, it wasn't that bad, it was just blah.<br /><br />the aforementioned writer was annoying to watch, though he delivered maybe one or two of the only two funny lines. the clich'ed "ladies man," the only one that didn't get his fortune told was just annoying. the only bright spot, was the remaining friend, the married dad whose fortune was told that something big was to happen to his son and he needed to be prepared. he was funny, genuine and clearly the best actor in the movie. unfortunately, that's not saying much.<br /><br />perhaps i'm being too cruel. heck, they got the ambition to make a movie, went and got funding and accomplished something. unfortunately, however, i can't at all recommend the film on the basis, there's hundreds of thousands of other independent movies that have hundreds of thousands better ideas and executions. this one was literally 10 minutes of an idea stretched another 81 boring minutes.
