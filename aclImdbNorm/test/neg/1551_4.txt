1940's cartoon, banned nowadays probably because of the 'black beauty' gag, in which daffy rides a black person as if it were a horse.<br /><br />the whole story takes place in a bookstore, where the characters of the books come to life every evening. so we have, among others, the ugly duck (daffy) and the wolf of wallstreet. they wind up in a chase after the wolf tricked daffy with a phony duck (hence the title).<br /><br />and chase is all there is in this little cartoon, that doesn't have any real appeal nowadays. only fun if you're a true fan of the looney tunes i guess...<br /><br />4/10.
