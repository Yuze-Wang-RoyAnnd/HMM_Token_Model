can anyone give me a reason why only one american dies in this movie, and when he does, it is supposed to be a very emotional scene, yet when the operation delta force team kills hundreds of russians, in slow-motion action scenes, or thousands of arabs, also in slow-motion action scenes, you are supposed to cheer and say "take that, you non-american monsters!". i know i used "slow-motion action scenes" a lot, but that is because every action scene in this movie is in, you guessed it, slow-motion. every last one of them... and this squad should be called "invincible slow-motion bullet-dodging force", since they seem to have supernatural powers that help them to dodge bullets. and if this supernatural power fails, they have some kind of regeneration superpower, which is all they need to kill the complete non-american army that stands between them and victory. by this point, nobody cares since they have been put to sleep by another laughable slow-motion action scene... that is if they are not laughing out loud at the bad acting, cheesy dialogues and incredibly poor story. which is what i did... the cast is made of unknown actors, which will probably remain unknown since they don't even play characters. they are just playing guys with guns(and, lets not forget, superpowers)... the only quality is that the special effects are surprisingly not that bad(although they are in slow-motion) for a tv movie... but it still sucks... and at the same time is so bad it's good... ok, maybe at the end it gets a little too repetitive...<br /><br />25%
