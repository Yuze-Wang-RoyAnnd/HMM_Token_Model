an american family moves to the countryside of spain to live in an isolated house. regina (anna paquin), the teenager daughter of mark (iain glen), who is sick and has some mental problems, and the nurse maria (lena olin), notes that weird things is happening in the house and with her young brother paul (stephan enquist), but her mother does not believe on her. reggie decides to investigate with her boyfriend carlos (fele mart'inez) the origins of the house, and they find that forty years ago, the place was the stage of the death of six children. reggie decides to ask for support to her grandfather albert (giancarlo giannini) to protect her brother against the house and her father.<br /><br />i bought this dvd expecting to see a good horror movie of haunted house mainly because of the names of anna paquin, lena olin, fele mart'inez (from "thesis" and "abre los ojos") and giancarlo giannini. further, i like very much spanish cinema. in spite of, i found a terrible screenplay, an awful direction and a deplorable acting of excellent actors and actresses. the intention of the story is good, slightly recalling "the shinning" in some moments, but unfortunately it is badly developed, never being clear, for example, the reasons and motives why the american family moved to spain or the horrible relationship between the members of the family, mainly the situation between maria and reggie. the direction is confused, poorly trying to use dark and shadows to give scary effects to the story. i love anna paquin, but her expressionless face never works in this flick. lena olin is a caricature of the great actress she is; and stephan enquist is too much weak for such important role. only fele mart'inez has a good performance in his support character. i liked the open end of the story. my vote is four.<br /><br />title (brazil): "a s'etima v'itima" ("the seventh victim")
