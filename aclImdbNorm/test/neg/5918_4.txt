peter yates film from the pen of steve tesich is a relatively low key "thriller" that doesn't really manage to get off the ground. story concerns the mysterious murder of an influential asian business man and the subsequent implication of a pathetic vietnam veteran (james woods) who, the police believe, may have taken revenge on his ex-employer. as the "eyewitness", william hurt never believes his friend is capable of such an act.<br /><br />hurt is well below his usual strength, and one finds it hard to sympathise with him or an uninspired sigourney weaver. james woods and christopher plummer do a little better in their support roles. worth noting is the appearance of morgan freeman as detective black.<br /><br />in retrospect steve tesich's story is only an unlikely romance dressed up as a mystery flick. the plot is far too contrived.<br /><br />friday, october 17, 1997 - video
