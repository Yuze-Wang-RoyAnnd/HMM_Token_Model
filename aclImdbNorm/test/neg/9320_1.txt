i don't know about you but i go to horror films to be scared and this was anything but scary, the movie had several chances to be truly scary and failed miserably every time! several of these supposedly suspenseful moments were haunted by some of the worst cg you will see this year, perhaps decade! i mean when i say the cg looks like daytime tv, i'm giving daytime tv a bad name, i've seen better stuff on the sci-fi channel. who i really feel sorry for is the actors,(that they have their names attached to this film) they did a good job, i cared about most of the characters and i felt that their performances were quite good, but that was not enough to bring this movie out of the gutter. whats really amusing is the reuse of some of the sets, if you have seen "exorcist: the beginning" it will be easy to spot the reuse of some of the buildings. however what i thought was the worst thing about this film, even above the cg problems was the main demon, he was just not scary in anyway, his form, the way he talked, he was extremely bland. all in all this movie was a horrible experience and i would have walked out of the theater if it weren't for my wife wanting to see the end.
