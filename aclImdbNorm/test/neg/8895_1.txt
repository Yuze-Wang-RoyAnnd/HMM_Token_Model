i was a fan of buffy and hoped it would come to a proper end when angel got only one more season. but when the end came closer i was exited to see that. and what did we get? this episode called "not fade away" was the very last one.<br /><br />i was so disappointed by this episode. this is absolutely the worst way to this series. why couldn't it get a happy ending? why did have a few of the main characters to die? why did angel not become a human and was reunited with buffy again? no. angel has to sign this bloddy piece of paper that he'll never become a human. how stupid.<br /><br />and the end is a cliffhanger.<br /><br />what could have been worse? the buffyshow began so great, such as angel, but the hole universe ended so crappy. somebody should put a spell on the man who wrote the screenplay to this episode and make sure he get's lost in hell.<br /><br />so don't bother watching this, it's so bad, it hurts! totally 1 out of 10.
