this movie is a nonsense/spoof comedy, in the lines of the airplane or naked gun, but it doesn't even come close to this two, because it lacks originality and a little more intelligent jokes, rather then just throwing you with the same old easy jokes.<br /><br />you can figure out some references to other movies, from the top of my head i identified dodgeball and rocky, so you can have some fun with that, trying to find out what movies are spoofed.<br /><br />the movie also offers you an occasional laugh, but nothing that can cause you injuries, thus nothing really funny.<br /><br />i liked the character ipod in some ways (even though some of the jokes with him are standard comedy 101).<br /><br />i think this movie (and like most of nonsense/spoof comedy) depends on the mood you are in, so if you think you will laugh to any joke watch this movie. if you are in a serious mood forget about this (re)watch the airplane instead, it will definitely make you laugh
