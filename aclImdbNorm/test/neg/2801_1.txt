this is possibly the worst of the worst. i am a huge fan of the horror movie industry and i can believe this movie was allowed to be made. the acting was juvenile and the story completely idiotic. the camera work was also juvenile. one scene that comes to mind is outside a store. it is nighttime and you can see the moon, yet the characters all have shadows that cast on the wall. there was no street light to be seen. one character gets gutted at one point, yet manages to resurface later after removing herself from a post. come on!!! it felt like i was watching a middle school play. i kept expecting the characters to wave to their family members off camera and mouth "hi mom". i can only give it two positive comments...it ended and it was good for a laugh. please do not rent this movie!!!!
