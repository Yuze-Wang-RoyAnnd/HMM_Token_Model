this is the first time i feel the need to comment on imdb, to write some sort of a review and, as it so often happens, it's not because of a really excellent film, but a truly appalling one.<br /><br />take the narrating style the youngest might relate to the max payne video game series, a cast of virtually unkonwns (which is not a bad thing in itself), poor dialogs, some dark scenes but not many enough, and make a film out of it. don't worry about the bad acting, the length (way too long), the lack of immersion (the lead character has to be one of the lest interesting i've seen in a long time - couldn't care less if he died) or the often ridiculous solutions they find to certain problems the lead character finds himself in.<br /><br />i wouldn't have written anything if it hadn't been for another review here, giving it 10 stars. i gave it four, but maybe three is closer to what i feel about it. not only do i not wish to see it again, but the mere thought of it takes me dangerously close to wanting to kill myself. oh, and a so called noir film is nothing without a good soundtrack - not the case here. the ending song sounds like it was more suitable to a western movie.<br /><br />it's not romance, it's not action, it's not noir, it's not good. that would be my review if it weren't for the minimum of 10 lines.
