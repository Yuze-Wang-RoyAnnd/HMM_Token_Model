when i first saw the previews for this movie on tv i thought that this could be a funny movie. i was wrong. all though i am not totally against movies that make fun of others. some are actually funny such as the first scary movie. this was one of many that have been made as of late that are not. the humor in this film was anything but funny and was rather dull.<br /><br />i feel the one of the biggest problems is that they poked fun at to many movies such as varsity blues, friday night lights, stick it, etc. and if you are anything like me you try to pick out each movie instead of paying attention to whats going on in this one. even the adult humor in this movie was dry. do yourself a favor and save you money and time and rent don't rent this movie
