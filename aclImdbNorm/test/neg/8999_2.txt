what a waste of time. i got about five minutes into it and became *very* antsy, and was soon fast-forwarding a bit, and pretty soon the desire to take my thumb off the fast-forward button was nonexistent. actors mark redfield and barry murphy did very capable jobs, i thought, but no one else i saw gave anything like a good performance. again, take this review with a large grain of salt because the movie was just so unbearable i couldn't make it to the end. heck, i couldn't make it to the middle !!<br /><br />i find myself unable to submit this review because it isn't long enough. maybe this last sentence will put it over the top.
