wakayama tomisaburo's portrayal of fugitive ex-kaishakunin ogami itto felt entirely natural. his demeanor, his voice, his appearance- all of it spoke to dislodgement. when he entered a space i, as well as characters on the screen, could feel he didn't belong there and that his determination to be there spelled trouble.<br /><br />i read somewhere that mr. wakayama actually took kendo (japanese swordsmanship) training and that would explain his comfort with the katana, which showed magnificently in every cutfest. if you watch the movies, from the moment he draws to the moment he sheaths the sword you feel as though you were witnessing something inevitably ugly. he'd even spin the katana quickly to flick off the blood before sheathing it and it would happen in an effortless instant.<br /><br />nakamura kinnosuke's rendition comes across as a rendition. it feels as though he were trying too hard to be someone else or tell someone else's story. as a result, every time i tried to engage i'd lose my grip because he didn't seem to have a firm grip on the role, himself. as though it were awkward for him.<br /><br />the swordsmanship in the tv series was entirely old-school hollyweird, too. camera cuts to disguise mr. nakamura's awkwardness with the katana, slow action, targets sitting still, etc. extremely bad, from a viewer's perspective. there was a moment in the episode the castle wall attack when mr. nakamura drew his sword like a child. it was embarrassing. he handled it as though it were heavy! i almost fell off my chair.<br /><br />and let's be frank: the story is about an excellent swordsman. period. swordsmanship is an issue.<br /><br />realism isn't, however: the swordplay in the movies was excellent and manga-like, as was intended, i'm sure. (the baby cart was outfitted with a cluster of automatic, rapid-fire muskets operated by a 3 year old? yes...manga-style.) it's how the story seamlessly weaves historical cultural accuracy into, basically, superhero fantasy that makes the movies captivating. (read yoshikawa eiji's musashi [%historical legend]%!) i couldn't really sit through the tv series episodes. they just felt cheap. see the movies first and you'll know what i'm talking about.
