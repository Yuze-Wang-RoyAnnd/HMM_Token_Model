two page boys working at a radio network go from trying to solve murders to performing in black-face in between work shifts. jack moran and sidney miller star in this whodunnit from 1945. lots of fast talking, everybody yells at everybody, and the two page boys call the police detective "marty" (played by ralph sanford). it's a real "shortie" at 59 minutes, and it has the feel of being adapted from a play, since it mostly takes place in a radio station soundstage. we don't really care about any of the characters, which is probably why its hardly ever shown. no big deal. this was phil karlson's second film as director. we're not given any clues as to who might be knocking people off, so we just kind of follow the police detective and the page boys as they all try to solve the mystery first. i'll say no more so as not to give away any spoilers.
