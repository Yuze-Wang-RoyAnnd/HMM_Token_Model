this is easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen. there is so much at the house that goes wrong that would not happen it isn't even funny. granted this is a movie meaning things that won't happen in normal life happen here, however this movie is more far fetched than theories that no child left behind is working. all of these people are in the house and nobody has noticed another, not to mention the damn owl that seems to be coming everywhere but in its cage. i could deal with an owl joke the first few times, but after an hour i just can't take it, i would rather kill myself than see that damn owl again. did i laugh during this movie? no. not even once? no. horrible, horrible, horrible. the fact that this pile of garbage is capped off with ashton kutcher bending his boss over and taking his pants off in front of everybody just makes this movie ever worse. but wait, the day is saved because the damn owl can fly. wow amazing! however, i do give this movie some cred, its not as bad as epic movie.....
