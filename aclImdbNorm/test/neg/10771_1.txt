before i start to tear apart this movie, mark you--i love the scarlet pimpernel. that story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written. the movie staring jane grey is very good and the musical on broadway is the hottest thing there. so, i thought when i heard that this film was coming out that it would be great since it was a bbc film.<br /><br />to my surprise, it was a weak, totally stupid story that utterly failed in capturing the gorgeous tale.<br /><br />there were no exciting escapes with daring disguises. there was no deep love that made your heart flutter as percy left the room and marguerite sighed as her husband was leaving her again.<br /><br />all it had was a confusing plot and a lot of out-of-the-blue sex and violence.<br /><br />sink me! what a horrible movie!<br /><br />
