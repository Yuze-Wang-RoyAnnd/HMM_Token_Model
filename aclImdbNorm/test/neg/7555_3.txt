i have never watched a movie that frustrated me more than lord of the dance. frustrated because it could have been fantastic. frustrated because the dancing might have been astounding. frustrated because the women could have been gorgeous. how would i know though?! by the time your eyes have moved to the area of interest on the screen and focused appropriately on the spot to be admired the insane editor has moved the shot! i completely agree with the other comments here about the crappy lighting and terrible camera/editor work. it makes me nauseous just watching ten minutes of this would be spectacular movie.<br /><br />give me an opportunity to get a front seat to the live concert and i would be there in a shot! <br /><br />nicholas t
