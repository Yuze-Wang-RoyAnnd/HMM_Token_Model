i knew five minutes after the monster made his appearance where his was going. but when i saw the beginning credits, i said "oh my god, bruce boxlightner, walter koenig (from star trek). gil gerard (from buck rogers, and he's almost unrecognizable), then i saw john callahan who used to star on my favorite soap, all my childen. put on a few pounds but he can still act. then there was veronica hamill. too bad i didn't sick around to see her in the film. i bailed out 20 minutes into he film. it was that bad. never did see william katt (from perry mason, and the greates american hero).<br /><br />all these stars and one lousy film. i hope hey got their paycheck.<br /><br />bad bad bad
