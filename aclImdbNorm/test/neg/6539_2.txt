i'd love to sit down and write an intelligent, well thought out review however, i feel i'd be spending more time in the writing process than the filmmakers did. i live in los angeles and i'm sorry to say that the characters seemed just so much like underemployed and overly ego inflated actors. there was not one moment in the film when i could escape the feeling i was watching the drivel ridden conversation of unemployed actors at a hipster la coffee shop. one of the worst "indie" films i've ever seem with so little to recommend it that hearing it won at sundance has effectively removed any prior interest i may have had in attending, much less considering a postitive sundance review to be meaningful. watch at your own risk.
