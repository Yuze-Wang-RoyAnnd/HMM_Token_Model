when the legends die is a powerful, moving story of an orphaned ute indian who goes on to become tom black bull, a champion bronc rider. raised in the old ways, tom is given a white man's name and must adopt the language and ways of the white man to live in that world. bitter about the role he has been forced into, tom finds fulfillment doing one thing, busting horses, riding them to death, in the rodeo. the movie has richard widmark in the role of red, the man who befriends tom and acts as his manager. red is a drunk who eventually dies in the story, which is about where the movie ends. the real story is completely ignored, the dark side of tom black bull who develops a reputation as a killer of horses in the rodeo arenas. oh well, you should read the book, this movie doesn't come close to doing the story justice.
