it's hard to comment on this movie. it's one of the few movies dimension actually has not shelved (it's hard to come up with a reason why) and it was rushed into a an unimpressive 500 theaters it's opening day. maybe dimension was afraid of how people would respond to a swamp creature using his tow truck to pull a house apart piece by piece.<br /><br />ray sawyer is just a tow truck driver, until he rescues a voodoo priestess from a bad car accident, and in return, he gets attacked by a bag full of snakes and drowns. at the morgue, ray comes back to life, and stalks a group of teenagers who witnessed the awful crash occur. <br /><br />what brings this movie down is it's paper thin characters. i didn't care for one moment about any of them. also, the dialog was less than ho-hum. also, it was very predictable. characters did the typical stupid horror movie character things, like check creaky noises, call out people's names, and trip on a rock while being chased. i also could immediately pick out who the final girl would be. and why did the camera have those quick white flashes whenever somebody died or whenever the killer was shown?<br /><br />what's good? well, there is an impressive suspense scene where the killer walks underneath swamp waters to get to his victims and a tense sequence where the final girl must camouflage herself with bunch of other dead bodies while the killer looks on.<br /><br />but other than that, it's another august/september disappointment. i was looking forward to it, but i did not get what was expected.
