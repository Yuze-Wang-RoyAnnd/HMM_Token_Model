i'll put it straight to you, this movie is dead boring. it's about a flood, that's it. blah blah a little about family, blah blah blah politics, blah blah blah boring. <br /><br />blame it all on the weatherman, poor sod. the deputy prime minister campbell is a hard-ass that expects everyone to be clairvoyant, a most irritating character. <br /><br />if you are from the united kingdom, or anywhere that it may flood, then you might like this film. it's sort of like earthquake movies are most appreciated where earthquakes happen. <br /><br />this is not really an action film, where the weather is the enemy and you must conquer, or outrun it literally, it is more like a time-bomb that must be disabled. <br /><br />looking at this movie, it is understandable why the uk thinks the world is overpopulated, it isn't, but for them it is. <br /><br />really, the movie is about as exciting as picking scabs and i can't recommend it. it's over 100 minutes, far far too long.<br /><br />the problems with the film; i won't get into them beyond this because the film doesn't deserve such dissection. hint to you londoner's - buy more boats. if you bring children to this movie they'll either fall asleep or become uncontrolled bored screaming demons.
