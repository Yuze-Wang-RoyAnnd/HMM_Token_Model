"the best movie of the 90's" "the welsh trainspotting"....aye, right! i went into this movie with pretty high expectations, and it was all downhill from there.<br /><br />this movie was supposed to be this archetypal movie on the drug culture of the early 90's, and was going to allow us all to see inside this scene, and shatter the media's preconceptions following the moral panic which followed the death of leah betts in 1995. unfortunately it has fallen a long way short. <br /><br />where trainspotting was able to treat you like an adult on the subject, and potential problems that surround drugs, this just provided us with some schmaltzy tale of the wonder of drugs, and how it can like, you know, like totally open your mind. cue some guff about bill hicks, and howard marks ad nausea. it is painfully bad at times. i mean, the scene at the end between lulu and her auntie actually made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />now maybe i am just a cynic, but the way jip leads us through this tale is like listening to that acid frazzled guy you once met at a house party, who talks to you about how "the man" is holding us back, and how acid has released him from the strains of modern society. you just wanna shake some sense into him, and ask him to leave the premises.<br /><br />the script was a real problem for me, because where trainspotting had irvine welsh's excellent book to cite from, this is written and directed by justin kerrigan. the words "jack of all trades, master of none" come to mind. you can see where his inspiration comes from, particularly in the style of narration from main character jip (which sets the main character in a social situation where he speaks directly to the camera, and outlines what is going through his mind as the scenario plays out) the problem with this is that some of the speeches to camera are just painful to watch. mainly this comes down to a lack of empathy for jip, but they are so desperate to sound philosophical that they just end up sounding like your average a-level drama project. the direction is fine, and the intentions are good, but it is so lacking in any integrity that you start to wonder what the hype is about.<br /><br />saying that though, it is not all bad. there are moments which are genuinely very amusing, and entertaining. moff is the highlight of the movie for me. for an independent movie it also managed to attract a high numbers of quality british actors/actresses, which maybe outlines why there was such a buzz about the movie.<br /><br />best movie of the 90's? not by a long shot, but if you're looking for a solid sunday night movie, then this might just be your bag. inevitably though, the movie is flawed by the hype that surrounds it.
