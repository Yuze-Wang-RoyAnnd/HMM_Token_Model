i'd give this film a zero if i could. how anyone could rate it any higher is beyond me. until i saw rollerball, this was my pick for worst film ever from a major studio with a real budget (claiming mangler 2 or leprechaun in the hood as the worst ever isn't really saying much, those are supposed to be bad)<br /><br />tim curry's mom must have needed surgery or something for him to agree to this non-sensical garbage. i'm really not sure what happened here. the novel was great, the director frank marshall had a solid track record with alive and arachnophobia (perhaps they should have changed the title to 'africa'), the cast was good and the budget was there. you'd think someone would have bothered to read the script.<br /><br />you'd be better off watching battlefield: earth again than wasting your time with. congo makes you long for the return of mst3k
