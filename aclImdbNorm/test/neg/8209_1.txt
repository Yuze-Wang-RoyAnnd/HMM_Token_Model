a couple of men are ship-wrecked on a remote island. they are then captured by an insane count who lives there with a small group of servants; while in the castle dungeon lives the count's unfortunate leper wife.<br /><br />the dungeon of harrow is pretty much a hack job of a movie. the amateur actors all sleepwalk through the film while an annoyingly insistent score continually plays in the background. the various bits of action are all filmed in an incredibly unenergetic way; in fact the film in general is completely lethargic. it just seems to drag on and on. and even though the ending isn't too bad you will be hard-pressed to care by that point. as an example of 60's gothic horror, this is strictly a bargain basement example. i sadly can't recommend this one really.
