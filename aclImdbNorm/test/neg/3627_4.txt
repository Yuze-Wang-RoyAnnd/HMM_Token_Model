i actually belong to the demographic zoey 101 specifically is trying to target, so i can see that as much as it tries to be relatable to people my age, the premise is simply too ludicrous for an average person to relate to. the show revolves around the wealthiest boarding school in existence, and the lovely, incredibly tan, attractive gang of one-sided characters who inhabit it. as is the tradition amongst kids networks, the cast is an array of skinny white kids, with the token black guy, of course.<br /><br />the story lines all revolve around zoey and her gang of friends stumbling upon or creating some sort of minor dilemma, such as not wanting to attend gym class, resulting in zoey devising a scheme to save the day for all her friends. there is generally a b-line revolving around either a one- sided guest character, or placing supporting characters in completely unrealistic situations, such as having a hive of wasps in a dorm room and no one noticing. these plots often play off stereotypes, such as any character who pulls good grades in math must by default completely lack social skills. the majority of episodes have the continuous and overused will-they won't-they chase-zoey dynamic.<br /><br />the characters, unfortunately, are all incredibly one-sided; there is zoey, the perfect girl with a solution to literally everything,chase, the constantly lovesick still but rather endearing best friend, michael, the token black guy (kudos to christopher massey for managing some genuinely funny one-liners), lola, the theater chick (meaning she dies her hair and 75% of her dialogue is about her dreams of stardom, despite the fact that she never does anything in the actual theater), logan, the womanizing narcissist, dustin, the spazzy little brother, and quinn, the science geek. the few words i spent on each of these characters sum up each character entirely.<br /><br />zoey 101 does manage to be entertaining at times, but the serious flaws in the system of values it promotes are a major turnoff. zoey, who is set up as the obvious role model and quasi-feminist crusader and who is on the surface portrayed as flawless, still manages major character flaws. for example, when lola was first introduced, she was believed to be a goth girl. zoey tried to use this as an excuse to kick her out of their shared dorm room for being "freaky".<br /><br />as for the acting, it is quite clear that jamie lynn spears landed this role because of her name, not because of talent. although she has definitely improved as time goes by, it is clear she is not a born actress, which greatly affects the quality of the show, as most of the plot lines revolve around her character. the supporting cast is surprisingly good, especially considering the material they have to work with. they deliver quite a few good one-liners for comic relief, if the plot hasn't yet ventured into obscurity.<br /><br />all in all, zoey 101 is a flawed view at high school life, and anyone past their limited too years shouldn't expect much from it.
