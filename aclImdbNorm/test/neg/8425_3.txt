after reading so many glowing reports of 'to serve them all my days' i went out and bought it for christmas. a waste of money, i'm afraid. i was looking forward to something in the same league as 'brideshead revisited' and some of the few other great productions from british television but this is decidedly not among them. <br /><br />the characters are all too good to be true, swathed in a very predictable plot and with the most trite and eye-rolling script i've heard in years. yes, it has its moments, but they are very thin on the ground. the lead actor is interesting, mostly because of his uncanny resemblance to anthony andrews (sebastian in 'brideshead'), only dark. but his undoubted talents are wasted on a character who is insufferably self-important and priggish. his prickliness is attributed to the effects of his experiences in the somme during ww1. he does the early episodes, centered around his nervous condition, better than he does playing the the squeaky clean, socialist do-gooder later on. <br /><br />the women are completely unbelievable, as in un-real. his first wife is annoyingly chipper and chirpy, the girlfriend, the perfect sophisticated slut, and the last lady a hodge-podge of political bosh. the most interesting characters are howarth (alan macnaughton) and one of the other masters, named hobarth, i forget the actor's name.<br /><br />the high-minded preachiness of the script is typical andrew davies, screen-writer, in his early years, and becomes tiresome within the first two episodes (this mini-series is 11 episodes long!). by episode 4 i just wanted to get through the blasted thing. <br /><br />the music is equally tedious, limited mostly to one mawkish piano tune and a chorale sung by boys during the credits. no expense was spared on the location settings which gives some visual relief to an otherwise excruciating viewing experience.<br /><br />i like stories of this sort, as a rule, and am very disappointed at the maudlin nature of this series. if you want to watch something riveting about ww1 and its after-effects there are many other far finer vehicles to rent or buy. one that comes to mind is 'the unknown soldier' from 1998. the characters in that masterpiece theater presentation are real and fascinating and move one, unlike the 2 dimensional puppets in 'to serve them all my days.' as for films on boys' schools stick to 'goodbye mr chips' or 'tom brown's schooldays'. <br /><br />i know this goes against the general favorable view of this mini-series, but i strongly recommend thinking twice before shelling out $80.00 to acorn media for their 4 dvd set, 2 discs of which on my set had insurmountable problems with freezing and skipping.
