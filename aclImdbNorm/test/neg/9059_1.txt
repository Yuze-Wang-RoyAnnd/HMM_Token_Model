john candy and eugene levy star as inept security guards who chase down a big time mobster. inept is truly the right word for this alleged comedy...a few laughs but mostly groans and thoughts to yourself like "why am i watching this c**p?" yes that is meg ryan in this too..which i am sure she doesnt want to be reminded of..a waste of a talented cast..on a scale of one to ten ..0
