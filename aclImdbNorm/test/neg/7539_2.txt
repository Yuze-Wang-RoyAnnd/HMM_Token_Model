contrary to most of the comments in this section, i have to say this film just barely escapes the definition 'rubbish!'. the only readers who seem to be aware of what a catalogue of clich'es it is are those who, like me, live in the north-east and know at first hand what the area is like. i am totally sick of films that are supposed to be 'realistic', yet portray the working class (of wherever) as stupid, criminal low-lifes, but then excuse them because of their social background. and funny? i smiled briefly twice and laughed once, but that was at the incongruity of two boy actors with sunderland accents supposedly trying to hide their newcastle accents from sunderland football fans! there was only one likable character in the whole film, and that was the senile grandfather played quietly but very competently by roy hudd -- the only non-geordie in the cast.<br /><br />as for the writing -- well, i just wonder what university sociology department the author studied at. he certainly had no ear for the local accent. and i too have never heard the expression 'purely belter' -- and not only am i a native, i'm a linguist who's written articles on the local dialect.<br /><br />don't waste your time and eyesight on this garbage. it isn't funny, it isn't realistic, it isn't entertaining, and it is fundamentally dishonest.
