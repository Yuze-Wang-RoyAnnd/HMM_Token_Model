i guess my biggest mistake was to watch this remake of '95 "piranha" back-to-back with joe dante's '78 original. i did the same last week with "the omen". curiously enough, watching the remake right after the '76 original, really made me appreciate the 2006 version quite a bit for various reasons.<br /><br />but this approach sort of backfired on the '95 piranha version. it enhanced the fact that it really is a lesser picture. basically, the '95 version is more or less the exact same film, as it tells the same story and follows it practically scene-by-scene (only barabara steele's character and the military intervention were written out of it). but the cinematography wasn't as good. the acting was worse too. especially alexandra paul (playing heather menzies' character) showed me again what a horrible actress she is. bradford dillman (from the '78 version) had his charlton heston way of acting going, which was amusing, while in the '95 version william katt does a good job at being william katt. so i didn't mind him, really. but the whole cast is pretty much inferior and the only worthwhile event was spotting james karen ("return of the living dead", parts 1 & 2) in a cameo. john carl buechler's make-up effects aren't as neat as rob bottin's. the musical score had some ring to it, but pino donaggio's score was much more memorable in the original. so all these shortcomings really shone through with having just re-watched the original as part of this double bill.<br /><br />since scott p. levy's remake does follow dante's original, i guess it is entertaining enough to sit through, though it's lacking the wit dante's original had. but what really made me not like levy's version very much, is the fact that quite a bit of stock footage from the first film was re-used during the piranha attack scenes. i never like it when filmmakers do this (and i'm not talking about using footage for flashbacks or other valid reasons). i mean, if you don't have the budget (or imagination) to come up with newly shot material, then for pete's sake, don't do a frickin' remake. but roger corman produced this (cheaper) remake, so i guess i shouldn't be all that surprised about the re-use of footage.<br /><br />if you do decide to watch "piranha", then make sure it's been a while since you've seen the original. you might enjoy this remake a little more then. and oh yes, that cool little stop-motion creature from the original is nowhere to be found in this film, as to be expected. but what's worse, there also isn't any female nudity in this one (the original really had quite some titty-shots going for it, and that blonde girl from the opening-scene even accidentally pulled her underwear a bit down too far when removing her jeans!). figures, as this '95 version was made for tv.
