yet again, i appear to be the only person on planet earth who is capable of criticizing japanese films made before 1970. "fires on the plain" (1959) is another in the seemingly endless line of "classics" that get all sorts of praise for no apparently good reason. as much as i love to overgeneralize and psychoanalyze all of these moviegoers who have such horrible taste in film, it's still nearly impossible to rationalize why anyone would ever think that poorly made fluff like this should be proclaimed as some sort of "masterpiece." what i find truly ironic is that fans of derivative "classics" like "fires on the plain" focus so much on "inside the box" movie-making (orthodox grading standards like scriptwriting, acting, camera-work, etc.) yet it always seems like the most highly revered "classics" are most deficient in these very standards. for example, one of the laziest copouts for a filmmaker involves forced verbal exposition where characters basically explain everything for the viewer even when the constructed scenario is totally artificial. most surprisingly, the very first scene in "fires on the plain" uses this indolent tactic to the extreme.<br /><br />after a funny head slap, the following useless dialogue assaults the viewer, "why can't you grasp the situation? we landed to the west under heavy fire to reinforce units at tacloban. we lost two-thirds of our men. our artillery was sunk in transit. we tried to reach burauen airfield by crossing the central mountains but without artillery it was impossible. the enemy's counterattack forced a fanout across the valley. you know that." so why, exactly, is one character telling another character something he already knows? oh yeah, that's right, the makers of this film are too lazy to think of more natural ways to communicate this information. you see, a quality film would actually show these events happening, or at worst it would involve dialogue involving one character who has no knowledge of those events. heck, even an opening summary in paragraph form directed at the viewer would have been better than what transpired here.<br /><br />such instances of poor quality movie-making are littered throughout "fires on the plain" to the point where this film feels like it was written by imbeciles for imbeciles. for example, the lead character stumbles upon some skeletons wrapped in japanese garb. instead of doing the natural thing like
