hana-bi has many quiet moments and fairly slow pacing. unfortunately, during the many thoughtful interludes the viewer is left to ponder about the recent scenes just watched and many questions surface and annoy.<br /><br />for example, why didn't the wheelchair guy drown in the ocean when he was stuck in the sand and the tide came up around him? there was no rescue seen or hinted at.<br /><br />can it be true that japanese police are so inept and unskilled at arrest procedures as to not first remove the suspect's ability to reach for a weapon? these detective-level japanese police seemed to have no experience dealing with a suspect.<br /><br />why doesn't the right eye of the lead character blink? having one eye blinking was distracting and it went unexplained.<br /><br />what exactly was the lead character spending all his money on to have to borrow so much from loan sharks? he was not seen gambling. being a non entry-level government employee his wife must have had full health insurance.<br /><br />what was the single man doing all by himself in the middle of nowhere in the nature park? what was his reason for being there?<br /><br />how in the world could the gangsters find the lead character and his wife up in the far off nature reserve? it made no sense.<br /><br />and again, how could the gangsters later find the lead character and his wife up in the remote mt. fuji resort? there were absolutely no clues available for these gangsters to even know which country the lead character and his wife were in, let alone the correct specific location at the correct specific time!<br /><br />and a third same question, how could the junior detectives know which few feet of the japanese coast line to find the lead character and his wife? the japanese coast line must be vast. were all of these characters supposed to have psychic powers?<br /><br />two final questions: the cute girl trying to fly a kite on the beach -- where did she come from? she seemed to have no transportation or companions with her. and why in the world did she still keep attempting to fly what was left of her kite after it was ripped in pieces?! this was weird. unintentionally python-esque.<br /><br />on the positive side, i loved the background music. it was dramatic and flowing and added much to this movie. the photography, imagery and art were pleasing to the eye.<br /><br />one final point, the wife was overly pleasing to the eye. not once did she ever come close to looking like a dying sick person. she looked very healthy. if anything, these people seemed depressed and mentally ill and not physically sick. the husband treated his wife as perhaps a newly outed gay man would treat a respected wife... a love of friendship, but not close tenderness.<br /><br />a mixed movie for sure.
