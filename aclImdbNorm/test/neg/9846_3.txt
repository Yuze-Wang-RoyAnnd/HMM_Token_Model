this movie was, in one word, terrible. it was boring, predictable, and downright creepy. i kept waiting for it to end and when it did, i was horrified. the ending left a bad taste in my mouth, to say the least. my advice to anyone interested in movies about budding female sexuality: stay away from this movie. movies like this give classics like lolita a bad name.
