k, one day my father picked up a movie with a 'neat' cover. got home with my mom and we were like yay lets watch this new movie we never saw before! .. ok so it started ... interesting start, cool robots and disgusting gore (eek) on a strange planet (actually it was pluto wasn't it?)... blablabla i could tell the whole story but i rather not point, wtf never ever pick up a movie with a lame ass name, and seriously don't ever i mean ever judge a book by its cover (err tape..) it looked like an interesting movie however it was a slap to the face for sci-fi movies, its disgusting. i mean it was so bad i just started laughing (i swear it tryed to be serious) i cant describe the stupidity! it killed more then a million brain cells of mine i can't even write a descent critique. its that bad! argh and i wana prepare you for something "strange' *cough cough* mechanical p3n1$ *cough cough* sorry just had to say it, its so funny, think of it as a commedy or a parody of sorts for sci-fi movies. its classic batman laughs but in a new packaging. what the hell was this director thinking?
