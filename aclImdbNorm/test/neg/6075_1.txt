about your terrible movie copying beethoven. as a professional musician it's my duty to watch every movie made about any composer and beethoven is one of my favorites. when hungarians and americans meet, it's a terrible combination of empty over the top emotions combined with the worst taste possible. you proved it in your terrible b-movie. the only thing that carries the movie is the music. of course you didn't bother to look further than the good but in my taste contrived performances of the tackacs quartet, but ok i have to admit that the performances at least have quality as contrast to the movie you've made. it starts of with the dying deaf beethoven who perfectly understands anna who is merely whispering. beethoven's hearing during the movie get's better by the minute, but that must be because of some vague divine thing. then there is the quite impossible semi-pornographic "eyes wide shut" double-conducting scene which is totally over the top with the luscious anna and the crying nephew in the end (who also cries in the deleted scenes with constant red eyes, my god what a performance). and as culmination the rip-off from amadeus, with beethoven dictating music to anna not in notes but in total nonsense, which she understands perfectly but no-one else in your audience even trained professional musicians will understand. of course your reaction will be that negative response is a response at least, but i can assure you that beethoven himself is turning in his grave because of your worthless creation and with reason. this so called homage is blasphemy and i am so sorry to have rented one of the worst movies ever made even though it's about my favorite subject. ed harris and others, you cannot comprehend the greatness of beethoven in your wildest dreams and certainly not after a couple of lessons in conducting and violin playing. that's the trouble with you americans: you think you can grasp everything even when it takes a lifetime of hard work. yeah we can do it anyway! remember that a good product comes with hard labor, talent, devotion and professionalism. all these you creators of copying beethoven lack. see you in kindergarten.
