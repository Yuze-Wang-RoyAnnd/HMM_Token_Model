i'm a bit spooked by some of these reviews praising a.k.a. not only do they sound as if they were written by the same person, but they contain all kinds of insider information that surely you could only find by reading the press book from cover to cover. please don't tell me that the director is writing his own reviews as that would just be too sad to contemplate.<br /><br /> afraid i'm another one of those who hated the film and was surprised by its unapologetic amateurism. great idea, shame about the execution. and it was most disconcerting to watch so many good actors (as well as some very bad ones including the leaden lead) all apparently thinking that they were appearing in a series of very different films.<br /><br /> i wish that a.k.a. had been audacious, innovative or just simply interesting. sadly it was like watching an unintentionally hysterical home video with arty aspirations. a missed opportunity.
