a woman finds herself caught up in an apparently inexplicable rash of suicides. then again, are these really suicides? it seems as though there's a ghost on the loose. guess what? the ghost has long black hair that hides its face, and it moves about with its head or arms twisted this way or that, making for a very weird looking specter. recurrent theme music plays from unexpected locations to announce the arrival of the ghost, and bizarre sound effects--which resemble the sound of small twigs being snapped--always accompany this hapless spirit. does any of this sound familiar? well, if you've seen a few asian horror movies in the last 10 years, it should. borrowing heavily and unabashedly from "the ring", "one last call" and a few other recent horror hits, this film tries to carry an uninteresting and worn-out plot to a climax, but we've seen it all before. avoid it unless you're desperate or haven't seen any other asian horror movies in the last 10 years.
