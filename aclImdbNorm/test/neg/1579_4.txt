i am a big fan of the abc movies of the week genre. i am only 27, meaning i wasn't even born until after the series ended, but i am trying to collect as many of them on dvd as possible. i have about a dozen or so. i had read such wonderful things about this film, both on here and elsewhere, that i was really excited to see it. i just received my dvd in the mail today and watched it anxiously. i'll admit that the first one or two phone calls did give me the creeps - that boy's voice would give anyone the creeps! but it began to ware off fast and the entire divorce subplot was stupid. i also figured out that michael douglas was the antagonist about a half an hour before the movie ended. as soon as that story was told about how elizabeth ashley's character had locked up his mother, i knew something was fishy. plus, didn't anyone ever think to ask him why he happened to suddenly appear that night when the fire occurred in the barn? i'll admit that i thought he was coaching a boy at the school to make the phone calls. i didn't guess the mute boy part or the pre-recorded tapes (did they ever say whose voice that actually was? i doubt douglas could ever get his voice that high?).<br /><br />i am only giving this movie a four out of ten because i actually liked most of the acting in it. ashley especially is great.<br /><br />it's a shame, because this movie has such a great premise, but oh well, thats what happens sometimes when one gets his or her hopes up for a movie too much.
