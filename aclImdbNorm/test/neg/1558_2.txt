zarkorr is one bad movie. this doesn't even rate in the so bad its good category. it's just bad. from the (lack of) set design to the acting to the special effects, everything about this movie stinks. for starters, the film looks like it was filmed in just empty rooms with a couple of props thrown in to make it look good. then we get acting that is so bad that it makes a high school play look like it was an oscar candidate. and to top it all off, there's the special effects that are so bad that they look like an amateur pulled them off in their garage. the towns that the monster is supposedly crushing look like my nephew's train set. so obviously fake that they scream out at the viewer. the only good thing about the movie is the monster suit. its just too bad that they spent all their budget on that and left nothing for the rest of the film. and maybe a decent script would have helped too.
