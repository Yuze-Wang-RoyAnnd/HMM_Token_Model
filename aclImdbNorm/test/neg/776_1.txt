i'm mike sedlak. i co-wrote the score for this movie. and proud of it. <br /><br />and i love all of the comments. some have not gone far enough.<br /><br />the movie premiered in san francisco in the summer of 1973. the theater was packed with friends and family. we all clapped.<br /><br />five days latter, it was pulled from all of the screens in the bay area.<br /><br />if anyone is interested hearing some of scene by scene details, which might make the movie even more enjoyable, please let me know.<br /><br />we could start with the shot where gideon blake throws the toilet plunger to distract one of the evil henchmen guarding the radio transmitter on the deck of bud's house. <br /><br />or how gideon diffused the bomb in the original version.<br /><br />didn't help. it still bombed.<br /><br />bring it on.
