kubrick may have been the greatest director of all times. he may have made more classics than anyone else. he may have been a perfectionist. but man, was his first attempt ever bad!<br /><br />kubrick had good reason to try to make this film dissappear from the map: it looks like an ed wood film. it has strange narration, cheap shots, bad dialogue, ominous music reminiscent of your 50s sci-fi/horror flick, and what looks like relatives of the cast of "reefer madness" going insane for no reason.<br /><br />sure, you can see an undeveloped kubrick in there. it is a psychological/horror study of war. the characters became dehumanized and insane. there are people playing more than one role. there are constant shots of the faces and particular facial expressions of different people. and there are a few interesting shots around there. but really, this is a mess.<br /><br />of course, i am not discouraging you from watching it. if you get a hold of it, you are joining a select group of myself and a few thousand people world wide who have had access to it.
