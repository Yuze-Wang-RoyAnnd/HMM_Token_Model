edge vs. michaels-boring in general (loved the sweet chin music into the chair) 4/10 taker vs. heidenreich-one of the worst matches i've seen, predictable as hell 1/10 tripe threat wwe match-why do i watch them, nobody ever wins a championship at the rumble, its not the main event. liked it when show drove jbl through the wall. 3/10 world heavyweight championship-pretty ok match, kind of more a beat-down by tripe h than a match, but i was happy to see it after watching crap. 5/10 royal rumble-good rumble,liked the brand showdown,the hassan thing, and the end. 7/10 overall still crap. why does anyone watch the rumble???
