honestly, this movie is weak. very weak. only capital character can something. she's work like supercharger on bad engine...so, if you like red-haired valkyries - see that. but better find picture of brigitte as sonja and put it on desktop. it will save of disappointments. well, arnold also do his deal...but it definitely not best his role. other characters - bad is not that word. sword fights? monsters? ridiculous. plot is really shame. why was necessary rape she? especially, we don't see it.<br /><br />anyway movie is weak. though worse movies exist...without main characters it would be just ******. and if somebody even discusses it, maybe...
