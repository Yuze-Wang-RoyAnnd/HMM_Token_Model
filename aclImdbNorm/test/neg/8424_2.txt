forget any angst-ridden documentary! this film is really an out and out comedy about a 40-yer-old porn star whose goal in life is to sing junky circuit party songs. the only problem? colton ford can't sing! and the film cuts away whenever he appears to be ready to burst into song. yet ford and equally vapid boyfriend blake harper whine and primp and run around in their tank tops, determined to make dreams come true. even funnier is "manager" kyle who appears to have the i.q. of a turnip and whose collagen-injected lips look like a bee stung him. how can grown men be so self-delusional? bwa ha ha! as for the documentary, the filmmakers don't appear to have any pov and the film is poorly structured and wildly uneven. very little background information is provided about the three leads. such an inclusion might have made the three seem like something other than aging west hollywood stereotypes.
