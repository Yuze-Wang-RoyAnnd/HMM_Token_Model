ah yes, it's yet another retelling of the classic, "sociopathic murderous doctor creates female frankenstein and falls in love".<br /><br />from the same director who brought you such timeless classics as "10,000 maniacs" (no, not the group) and "blood feast", this "unfinished" film virtually cries out for the mst3k treatment. the doctor's assistant even has overtones of torgo from the classic "manos: the hands of fate". i don't know if the graphic, if fake-looking violence or the frequent stretches of dialogue-free tedium could have scared the crew off, though.<br /><br />the main reasons to bother sitting through this movie are for the hysterical 'hypnosis' scene, the laughably serious ending and the rock-bottom production values. i actually watched all of the credits after this movie, for the same reasons you're inclined to slow down your car when you pass a serious traffic accident. that and the sheer genius of the end theme that sounds like a watered down "my favorite things" played on a toy piano. goblin this ain't.
