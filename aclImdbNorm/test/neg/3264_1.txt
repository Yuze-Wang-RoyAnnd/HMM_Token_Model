why was this movie ever made?they have tarnished the original caddyshack with this crap.i was only able to watch half of it and i didn't laugh once.at least i didn't pay to see it because it was on t.v. but i won't get back that hour of my life that i spent watching this dreadful mess.there wasn't one original star from the first except for chevy chase and he probably regrets doing this film.jackie mason was supposed to be the outrageous,funny buffoon like rodney dangerfield was in the first but jackie mason wasn't funny at all.jackie mason is no rodney dangerfield.if you want laugh,watch the first caddyshack.if you like terrible movie's,then this you're movie.this movie stinks like a barnyard in july.avoid at all cost.
