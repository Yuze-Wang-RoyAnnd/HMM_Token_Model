dr. krellman wants to save his son julio who's dying of heart disease. he decides a heart transplant with an ape will cure his son (no--i'm not kidding). he does the transplant and (somehow) his son changes from a frail guy into a muscle-bound man with a dime store mask that (sort of) resembles an ape! naturally he gets out, kills men, tears the clothes of women and wreaks havoc. this is all inter cut with the boring romance of police lt. arturo martinez and lady wrestler lucy ossorio. we also get pointless female wrestling sequences that add nothing to the plot. it all ends by copying the end of "king kong"! this is (obviously) a pretty stupid movie. the plot makes little sense, there's the gratuitous female nudity (a staple of any exploitation film) and very graphic gore that looks laughably fake (except for the open heart transplant). still this does have merit. the whole cast takes everything dead serious and actually aren't too bad as actors. also the dubbed in dialogue was (for a film like this) well done and interesting with surprisingly good dubbing. also i saw an excellent dvd print with bright strong color (which helps). we're not talking a classic here but an ok exploitation movie.
