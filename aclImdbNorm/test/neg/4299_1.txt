i found this movie at the flea market for cheap. i was so psyched because i thought it was a skateboarding movie. i got home put it on, the previews rules and the opening scene with the old guy rolling down the street on the skateboard was awesome. at that moment i realized it was a post-apocalyptic movie but i still had high hopes for it. this movie was awful. a friend of mine was stoned out of his mind when we watched it and even he thought it was horrible and a waste of being high. i kept falling asleep during the movie because it was so boring and the music was utterly awful. i don't know if during the apocalypse all the good music, and all the music that is only kind of crappy is destroyed and everyones memory of how to play it is wiped clean but i think i would rather die than have to endure that crap. also what the hell was up with the tv studio? i can only assume that this movie was adapted from an old greek play, with the names and title, but some plays are not meant to be adapted into a futuristic sci-fi setting. or at least not by the people who were involved with this movie. if you are forced to watch this movie, i can only suggest bringing a hand gun and finishing yourself off before the end. it would be a good movie to kill yourself too, everyone will understand why.
