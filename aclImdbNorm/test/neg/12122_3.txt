low budget mystery. a shot rattles out of the dark and a woman is seen running from that direction. a young architect jimmy mcmillan(chick chandler)discovers a dead body that goes missing. the woman in a hurry, mary(june clyde), is linked to the death scene; but it is mcmillan that has to try and solve the case to avoid serious suspicion. suspects are six shop owners in the vicinity of the crime scene. all the atmosphere of film-noir; but not quite the real thing. this flick musters just enough to be a decent low budget mystery/drama and is a nice little escape. other players include: george meeker, michael raffetto, milton wallace and rebel randall.
