this is one for the golden turkey book. it's another of those "putting on a show" flicks. the dialogue is turgid. the music is terrible. the costumes may be the worst ever. and the nick castle choreography is hilariously dreadful. check it out, oh ye who love bad flicks. only perry como is tolerable.
