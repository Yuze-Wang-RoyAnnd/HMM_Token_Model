the film is a pathetic attempt to remake ingmar bergman's "autumn sonata"(1978) starring ingrid bergman,liv ullman and erland josephson.it did not take me more than 5 minutes to figure that out.<br /><br />it is time film journalists like khalid mohammad took out time to do some creative thinking. it makes me sad when potentially good film-makers waste their talents by making substandard remakes of hollywood and european films.<br /><br />you've got to give the film-maker something though. the film he picked for copying is one of bergman's classics, and easily one of the finest instances of the portrayal of a strained human relationship in european cinema.
