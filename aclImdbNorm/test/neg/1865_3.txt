this is quite a bad movie but oh well, this movie is at least not as lame as the third ghoulies movie.<br /><br />yes, this is a bad movie in terms of its writing, directing, acting and basically everything in between. it has such a weak, simple and ridicules story, that besides has little to do with the previous ghoulies movie entries. it tries to connect the movie with the first movie "ghoulies", from 1985 but then on the other hand, if they really wanted to connect this movie with its predecessors, then were are the ghoulies in this movie? instead now we are having some small people, played by tony cox and arturo gil, dressed up as demons. not that the ghoulies from the previous movies were any classic characters but they were nevertheless the heart and soul of the movie and also provided the movies with a certain amount of fun. it's like having a gremlins movie without the gremlins.<br /><br />the movie is not really interesting to watch because it lacks any tension, good humor, intriguing characters and basically everything else you can think off because it got put together by persons who obviously aren't the most talented ones within their business. just like at director's jim wynorski resume, with movies such as "the witches of breastwick" and its sequel, "alabama jones and the busty crusade", "house on hooter hill", "scream queen hot tub party", "the bare wench project" and the sequels "the bare wench project 2: scared topless" and "the bare wench project 3: nymphs of mystery mountain" and "the da vinci coed" on it. <br /><br />yeah the movie is quite silly and campy but this is not really enough to boost this movie and gives it some more entertainment value. you know, it's the kind of cheap looking movie with some lame special effects, costumes, make-up and actors nobody has heard of ever since.<br /><br />still it isn't the worst movie out of the series because of the reason that "ghoulies iii: ghoulies go to college" is by far a more worse movie, since that one had some horrible lame attempts at humor. this movie at least still does some attempts to be serious and professional one, even though the end result is far from perfect.<br /><br />bad movie making and perhaps only watchable for those who have seen the previous ghoulies entries.<br /><br />3/10
