<br /><br />a few years ago i bought a movie called the cellar. i had heard that it was supposed to be a great movie, but it turned out that it was a flop and a b-movie.<br /><br />the story is good, but there are no good effects in the movie. (maybe they didn't have enough money for that on the budget???).<br /><br />if you choose to watch this movie be sure to watch it three times. the first, only and last time!!!
