sdiner82 had clearly not seen the film in decades, and his memory is appalling. his attempts to paint the mark lester shaving scene as suspect are utterly erroneous, as are his incorrect comments about the bad guy "sneaking peeks at the kid's body". lester is clothed for the entire time the man is in the room, and the man barely gives him a glance.<br /><br />the scene is a crude attempt to show lester's innocent curiosity about the man's body.<br /><br />like everything in this film, it's badly done, but nothing more.<br /><br />even sdiner82's comments about savalas' character who "casually sent a german family to their deaths by nudging their trailer off a cliff" is nonsense (it was a single woman, she was already dead, and she was in a car).<br /><br />i suggest that sdiner82's review says far, far more about his own, far from liberal mindset, than it does about this valueless film.<br /><br />the only reason i even bothered to look it up, was out of curiosity to see if it was made before or after kojak.<br /><br />the film is a worthless piece of 70's trash, but sdiner82's review of it is the worst kind of slander. he wraps up his review in pseudo-intellectual "facts", but the only fact is that he is plain wrong on almost every "factual" matter he discusses.<br /><br />i can only assume that sdiner82 saw exactly what he looked for, which is disturbing. now he can return to burning copies of catcher in the rye.
