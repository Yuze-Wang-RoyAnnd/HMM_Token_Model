i am a chess player and i wanted to like this film. trouble is, the content could have been fitted in a 30-minute documentary.<br /><br />there were lots of shots of corridors being walked down and kasparov gazing out in the hall where he won the world championship. there were other shots of kasparov being walked round the site of the 1997 match and being told where he sat and where deep blue was located. this just looked like filler.<br /><br />also, i didn't find it interesting to see in detail where deep blue was now and seeing an ibm techie trying, unsuccessfully to 'open' it. what would we have seen of interest inside anyway - a little grandmaster?<br /><br />also, the recent match against karpov. i no longer follow professional chess enough to know when and where this was. it would have been nice to have been told: was this a one-off 'just for the money'? was it part of the world championship cycle? what was the final score? the nub of the film was the play in game two. could/would ibm let kasparov see 'inside' the machine? that's where the focus should have been.
