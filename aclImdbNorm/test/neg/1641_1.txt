(spoilers) horrifyingly enough, i have actually seen the film that this horrid film was a sequel to. it was called ator the fighting eagle, and i saw it when i was just 8 years old. it made such an awful impression on me that i never forgot it. i've been an mst3k fan for a long time, so when cavedwellers came out on tape i bought it. i was horrified to realize that it was a sequel to the wretched ator movie that i'd seen so long ago! ator's costume has, somehow, gotten ever skimpier than the last time i saw him. how can he wear that tiny little bikini? doesn't he care that it shows off the fact that he has no...errr...package? and poor thong...he gets no lines and no girl, and has to follow that frizzy haired girly doofus ator around all the time. has anyone else noticed that miles o'keefe walks like a woman? no wonder he's not interested in the pretty if somewhat lackluster meela. the evil but prancy bad guy zor is more to his taste, i'm sure. i loved zor's cardboard spray painted swan helmet, and the way he spent all his time trying to touch some part of ator. the fight scenes are so badly choreographed that its a wonder that the swords ever manage to connect. the dull old guy spends all of his time standing around looking depressed. ator drinks from a cup given to him by a guy who hates him, and then looks surprised that they drugged him. he must be pretty smart though-he invented a hang glider in the space pf five minutes ,then flew it into a rift in the space/time continuum so that he travelled briefly into 17th century bulgaria. that was after he stabbed the giant snake puppet, of course, and saved the post coital meela while she sat around doing absolutely nothing. the real hero of the movie was thong, who saved ator several times from his boundless stupiditiy, and killed the evil zor in the bargain. kudos to thong, the only competent person in the whole film.
