this movie is based on the series street fighter alpha (or zero)! it is placed in an other setting than streetfighter the animated movie! this movie is all about ryu who is accompanied by ken and chun li. i recognized rose,zanghief and birdie! there weren't any other characters used from the video game (that i could discover)! the fighting scenes were ok but nothing really spectacular! and there were not many of them! to me this is odd! isn't streetfighter about fighting! streetfighter the animated movie (1994) is far superior to this movie. it tries to be more than it really is! the use of the "hada power" and other supernatural elemnents have nothing to do with skills the characters have in the video game! and in this case that is a bad thing! the story is so boring that you don't really care what is happening! the action is toned down considerably! why? and what happened to the other characters from the video game! surely they are more interesting than the villain in this story! the main attraction of the video game are the characters with their own special skills! in this movie it is all about ryu! that is why this anime fails!
