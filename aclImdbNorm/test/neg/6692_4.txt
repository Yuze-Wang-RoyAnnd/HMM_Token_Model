the strawberry blond has a great script, but i just wish errol flynn was in it instead of james cagney, he's not the person for the part. i do think olivia did a great job. this movie is also a day dream wrap around, so it's hard to follow. i don't like the male character attitude; the way cagney presented it was just off. i give it a 3 for poor acting by main male character. ( if you like tough ruff men that like to fight all the time and argue then this is your movie). the strawberry blond would have been better if the main character had more of a positve attitude, and change the script so he is happy he's with oliva.<br /><br />this movie points out money does not bring happiness, women right jokes. plain and simple not the best movie, but every one must decide for themselves.
