i only wish that i had the good sense to turn this movie off in the beginning when i knew it was terrible. <br /><br />instead i gave it the benefit of the doubt and waited for it to get better. <br /><br />don't make the same mistake i did. <br /><br />the title has nothing to do with the movie. the movie has nothing to do with the real world. the plot has nothing to do with a plot. the acting consists of a guy who wants to be john cusack, but can't pull it off. the lead is a girl who tries to be claire daines. sadly, she can't pull that off either. they are in love, although god only knows why. and by the end i was hoping that they would all kill each other off just so i could believe none of these kids would ever taint the world again.
