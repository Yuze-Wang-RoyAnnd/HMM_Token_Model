when i started watching this, i instantly noticed that i couldn't understand what anyone was saying. i turned up the volume. with background noises now booming out, i could hear the voices. just what are the actors saying? is the movie not dubbed? are they speaking spanish? after some confusion, i realize that it was english. at least, i think so... the amazing jess franco has placed the microphones too far away from the actors. as a result, we cannot completely hear what they are saying. he's done this before. but maybe this is mr. franco's intention? by not knowing what people are saying, we are thrown into some mystery about what is going on, and are left with more visual clues... maybe it's just me, but i would have liked to know what was going on! how about a few hints? the basic premise (i refuse to call it a "plot") concerns a young american exotic dancer named paula (played by amber newman) who has a boyfriend who gets her invited to a small island owned by some sleazy rich people. it is somewhere off the coast of spain. for this visit, a large cash payment is promised to paula, which the boyfriend gets. he then escapes from the island, only to return later. why? pay close attention to the scene where the boyfriend opens paula's us passport. though his hand tried to cover it up, you can see the actress' real name, amber newman, printed below the photo on the bottom of the passport!! anyway, back to the "story": there are some other sleazy, rich, beautiful characters visiting the island, all with ambiguous motives. we witness sadistic games (are they real or fake?) and unappealing dining scenes. but the food must be good, as a phony french chef prepared it! there is a young woman servant who runs around naked and never speaks. is she really mute? and do we care? of course all the women are mostly naked throughout this film... oh well, we can at least be thankful that the (50+ and overweight) men remain clothed! in addition to the abysmal sound quality, what i have always marveled at about jess franco is his amazing ability to film beautiful naked women in such a way that leaves the viewer completely turned off. this film is no exception
