well, i thought the movie was blah 1/10.<br /><br />anyways the best part is the first 5 minutes of the film with the nerd's or whatever girlfriend, this is the part u guys watch out for tho she had big hooters, i thought is that really a random actor? heck no, it wasn't it was actually a model by the name of larissa mccomas but u already knew that<br /><br />so, that made sense but that was about it rest of the film (that i saw anyway) didn't care 4, and didn't bother watching the rest of it that's<br /><br />all i needed to c to be satisfied so 2 those of u that just care for that well there u go enjoy
