meek and mild edward g. robinson (as wilbert winkle) decides to quit his bank job and do what he wants, open a "fix-it" repair shop behind his house. mr. robinson is married, but childless; he has befriended local orphanage resident ted donaldson (as barry). young donaldson is an eager workshop assistant, and sees robinson as a father figure. robinson's nagging wife ruth warwick (as amy) is unhappy with robinson's job choice, and conspires to return matters to her idea of normalcy. their lives are further disrupted when robinson is drafted.<br /><br />the war also disrupts what might have been an interesting story, as robinson's character struggles against a domineering, unsympathetic wife. possibly, filmmakers are showing how war can save marriages and positively redirect lives. robinson and donaldson are a likable team. robert mitchum has an inauspicious bit part. the ending "trick" played by ms. warwick and donaldson is predictably staged.
