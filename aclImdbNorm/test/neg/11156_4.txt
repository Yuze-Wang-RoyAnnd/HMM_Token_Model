end of days, starts off pretty well, arnie plays a down and out cop (a very similar character to riggs in lethal weapon) and the story looks like a kind of serial killer action thriller that will be good entertainment.<br /><br />sadly it fails to deliver, arnie is as good as we we have come to expect, but as for gabriel byrne i expect him to chose his roles more carefully than this. cast as the devil; this is probably the weakest portrayal of the lord of darkness ever.<br /><br />this movie gets a little too daft for me, and the end sequence, aside from being very weak, is visually one of the worst i've seen in recent years, cgi is have been better than this since the early nineties.<br /><br />quite simply not good enough. 4/10 (watch it if you have too, but don't expect too much, cause it won't deliver)
