don't get me wrong, i assumed this movie would be stupid, i honestly did, i gave it an incredibly low standard to meet. the only reason i even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going (different story for a different time). as i began watching i noticed something, this film was terrible. now there are two types of terrible, there's freddy vs. jason terrible, where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is, and then there is a movie like this. the cat in the hat failed to create even a momentary interest in me. as i watched the first bit of it not only was i bored senseless, but i felt as though i had in some way been violated by the horrendousness of said movie. mike myers is usually brilliant, i love the majority of his work, but something in this movie didn't click. one of the things that the director/producers/writers/whatevers changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book (red, black, white) on any character but the cat. coincidentally or not, they also refused to capture any of the original (and i hate to use this word, but it fits) zaniness of the original. the book was like an ice cream sunday, colorful and delicious, and the movie was about as bland and hard to swallow as sawdust.<br /><br />avoid this like a leprous prostitute.
