this ranks up there as the worst movies of all time. no research or thought at all went into this movie. action scenes were thrown in at random intervals which made no sense in the context of the movie. items appeared and disappeared at random, etc. it's obvious that this was directed by a "stunt coordinator", who should go back to his old job. the skeleton man rode a horse throughout the movie, which amazingly, could change color at will. either that, or someone thought the audience would all be colorblind and not notice. blood would be on the actors in 1 scene and the very next, miraculously disappear and then reappear. seems that everyone connected with this movie forgot to check for inconsistencies.
