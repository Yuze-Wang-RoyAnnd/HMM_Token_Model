the basic plot is good and can be engaging. the music is so great that it became the theme music for the tv show iron chef (though it is way overused and too intrusive in the movie). so, how did this movie end up so poor?!?! well, the plot was about 95% predictable and the characters were about as 1-dimensional as possible. and the dialog?! what person would actually allow themselves to receive credit for coming up with the stupid macho bull-crap that purports to be dialog? you get much greater realism from most cartoons! the bottom line is that this movie has some good points but is so marred by hackneyed clich'es and rotten dialog that it quickly becomes tiresome. and, this is a shame, because firemen deserve a better tribute than this mess! if you don't believe me, look at the number of goofs listed on imdb for this movie--way in excess of what you'd expect to find. they just didn't care enough to work out all the kinks and problems. so, as a result the movie seems rushed and in need of a re-write and re-editing.
