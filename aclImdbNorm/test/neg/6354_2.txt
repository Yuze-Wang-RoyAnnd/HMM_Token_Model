they must be. i'll list them so that you can check them off one-by-one:<br /><br />- police regularly leave tens of millions of dollars of cash and drugs just lying around, because they don't have evidence facilities.<br /><br />- when you get shot, you always grunt the same way, and fly back the same way, even though there's never a mark on your body.<br /><br />- police are not able to identify the sound of gun shots, and don't think anything is suspicious when an undercover policewoman's phone call during a high-level drug-and-money deal is cut shot by that gun shot.<br /><br />- bad guy gunmen can hit mannequins with one shot, but can't hit a big, bulky martial artist with 100.<br /><br />- if you rocket launcher a car in a car park, the next three cars in a line will blow up evenly in 15 second intervals.<br /><br />- further to the last point, all the cheap cars are always parked next to each other.<br /><br />- the smoke that is caused from the firing of the rocket launcher is much greater than the amount of smoke caused by four cars blowing up.<br /><br />- virtual reality games that are a long, long way ahead of anything any other gaming company can produce fit on five floppy disks.<br /><br />- virtual reality games that are a long, long way ahead of anything any other gaming company can produce have graphics that look like windows 3.1 screen-savers.<br /><br />- floppy disks can be read even after they've been shot up.<br /><br />- semi-drunk guys in bars attentively watch the news when they're at the pub, and have a deep understanding of american modern military history, agent orange, and the family trees of high-ranking military officials. however, they're only able to articulate their points using dialogue that sounds silly coming from anyone over the age of seven.<br /><br />- even though fights appear to break out almost hourly in a bar, that bar has only one staff worker, who both pours the beers and handles security. of course he knows martial arts.<br /><br />- gold medal olympians regularly make the simple transition to corporate ceos of software companies in a matter of years.<br /><br />- a woman who works for a computer game company knows everything about how to beat a game she's never played, raves constantly about her competitor's great games, and can rattle off facts and figures regarding her company's rivals - but she didn't know that they overtook almost all the other companies in the field in large corporate mergers.<br /><br />- bad guys always die in slow motion. always.<br /><br />- wives tell their husbands that they're pregnant by raving about their man's bravery in killing bad guys.<br /><br />- wives do large amounts of their husband's police work; this might explain why she whines and complains so much every time he has to go to work. although, it doesn't explain why she adores him so much every time he gets up in the morning and she can read about his murderous escapades.<br /><br />- it's fairly typical for a police officer to be involved in kidnappings, kill tons of people on three separate occasions and stop a variety of multi-million dollar illegal deals in a week.<br /><br />- when trying to lose a car that's following you, it's wise to continue driving under the speed limit. and if you're following a cop, subtlety is not important - you can tailgate him for miles, then park right next to him. he won't notice.<br /><br />- all cops are experienced martial artists.<br /><br />- it is possible to kick a guy four metres in distance.<br /><br />- people scream or grunt in pain when they are punched or kick, yet when they have their arm broken, they don't make a sound.<br /><br />- bad guys clean their bloodied axes with their handkerchiefs, and then leave them in their pocket for many days.<br /><br />- pieces of wood, when swung with one sharp blow, shatter sturdy ladders in six or more places simultaneously.<br /><br />- the photo, and listed special features on the back of the dvd case don't necessarily have to be on the dvd. the advertised interactive menus? why not no menu at all! the advertised scene index? why not have the whole thing as one scene/chapter, and not need an index! likewise, it's ok to use the matrix's font and title in the tag-line, and not be a rip-off in any way.<br /><br />with all of this, i'm in shock that 12 out of the 15 top credited actors never acted again.
