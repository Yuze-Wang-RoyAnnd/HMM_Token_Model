first and foremost i am a gay man, although do not live my life within the so called "community", and it's because of films like this that gay themed movies are not my favorite genre because 90% of them are crap. like this one. f i could give this a zero i would. (i do not understand all the positive comments, unless they were all made by people who made this film) i actually stopped this at the 24 minute mark when the so called straight "anthony" kissed adam outside the restaurant for no reason at all. and how is the son stealing from the diner if he doesn't even live in the town? wire transfers? the acting was horrendous! the sound editing? (listen to "anthony" and adam when they are sitting on the fence eating their lunch. every time the camera switched between the two so called actors the sound changes, like there was not a filter on the microphone)seriously do not rent, or god forbid, buy this movie.horrible horrible horrible acting and just a stupid storyline.
