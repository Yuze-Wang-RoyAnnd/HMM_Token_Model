this is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers, if garbage could ruin motion picture careers these days.<br /><br />melanie griffith took off her shirt, and in her pre-enhancement surgery days, she really should have stayed dressed.<br /><br />jeff daniels was completely wasted, but fortunately for him and for us, he has gone on to much better things since this ... this ... this ... well, heck, piece of garbage.<br /><br />strangely, all of its major players have gone on to bigger and better things, including director jonathan demme. his work here was also wasted but deserving of a grudging admiration. i mean, anything not worth doing is not worth doing well. but he did it well, anyway.<br /><br />still, there was one bright, shining aspect: ray liotta, who is named way down the credit list, just absolutely stole everything. liotta was magnificently mesmerizing! hypnotic! enthralling.<br /><br />i saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new, in a friend's private theater. for some strange reason, my friend loved it. i sort of think it's because melanie griffith took off her shirt (and, really, honest, she shouldn't have), though he tried to claim it was other, more artistic, reasons.<br /><br />anyway, i thought even then, after his first scene, that ray liotta would become a major star, or at least a major, highly-respected actor.<br /><br />despite the garbagey aspects of the garbagey script, the sheer ugliness of the whole story, liotta made it almost worth watching. in fact, it is worth seeing, once, just to see how far ray liotta has come. i mean, for one thing, his name is now usually listed at or near the top.<br /><br />even then, even in a pile of garbage, ray liotta shone like a diamond.<br /><br />just, if you do see this trash, be prepared to hold your nose. every major character is either amoral or immoral. terrible movie. terrible movie idea.<br /><br />added comment: too many people answer "was this comment helpful?" with a "no" because they disagree with the expressed opinion. maybe imdb should ask that question instead: "do you agree with these opinions?"
