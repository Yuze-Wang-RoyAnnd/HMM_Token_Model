i just recently watched ed wood jr.'s autobiographical movie glen or glenda for the first time after having heard so much about it for so many years. nothing i had read or heard about this film could prepare me for what i saw. this has to be the most bizarre movie ever made. stampeding buffalo, women in bondage, satan prancing around and bela lugosi, rambling only as he can, "bevare, bevare....pull the string, pull the string...", it was totally insane. the acting was atrocious and the dialog was unintentionally hilarious, exactly what one would expect from an ed wood film. having said all that, as horrible as this movie was, i have to give wood credit...he was way ahead of his time. you have to remember that when this movie was made transvestites were not even discussed in public, much less the subject for a movie. i have read that wood was a transvestite in real life, and i'm sure this movie was based on his own experiences. it was sad to see bela lugosi having to say the ridiculous lines he had to say for this film, but it was kind of ed wood jr. to at least give mr. lugosi an acting job at a time in bela's life when he was penniless and a drug addict and no one else in hollywood would hire him. if you have never seen this film then you have to see it, especially if you are a fan of ed wood jr.
