this representation of the popular children's story on film is pretty pathetic to watch. i know it is one of the earliest efforts at moviemaking, but this 15-minute picture is unimaginative and poorly shot. "the great train robbery" (1903), which i also commented on, is much more creative and exciting to watch.<br /><br />we see little long-haired jack trade a cow (2 men in a cow-suit) for a hatful of beans from a merchant and later a beanstalk grows from where his mom throws them in the yard (i guess poor jack attained the wrong kind). jack dreams of a goose (actually it seems to be a chicken) and golden egg and the next day climbs the stalk into heaven.<br /><br />there is no effort made to be creative in this film. the stalk looks like a rope with leaves on it, the giant is just a tall bearded guy in a home with nothing abnormally large in comparison to jack and the climax to the film where jack makes his escape with the goose-chicken and its golden egg is miserable as a stuffed dummy falls from out of screenshot in place of the giant and then the actor takes its place - rising up on his feet in a exaggerated death dance like in most early films. the beanstalk (leaf-covered rope) comes trailing down from above and coils neatly on the giants forehead.<br /><br />watch something else.
