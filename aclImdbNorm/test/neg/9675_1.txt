i was so excited to see the cast in this movie that i was completely surprised at how completely wrong this movie was. i love john voight but i have no idea what possessed him to be a part of this travesty. the biblical accuracy was completely non-existent and i honestly could not stomach watching the movie with my children. my kids stood astonished because even they know that lot was not even thought of when noah was building the ark. i think that nbc should be ashamed of themselves for allowing producers to make a mockery of the word and cause even more confusion in a world that barely knows the truth as it is... please do not buy this movie!!! i have considered burning my copy but i have every intentions on writing the producers and sending them the scripture references that they should have read before making this movie!!!
