for the first fifteen minutes the story of naked fame is interesting: two late thirties male porn stars in a seemingly healthy relationship decide to leave the porn industry and try for the world of singing and acting. the two very buff and preening men are colton ford and blake harper. with the aid of kevin aviance and marc berkely, colton makes a dance track that is then marketed in new york with the hopes that colton ford will become an instant star - a unique disco singer touting his background as a porn star for pr.<br /><br />the remainder of the film is grumbling and in-fighting and commentary by porn producer chichi larue and the film slowly sinks into repetition and doldrums. not a bad idea for a film if there were a bit more depth revealed in each character's drive to move away form a successful career (though one greatly influenced by the youth both characters have lost) into an alternative one. it is just that a one-note song wears thin quickly. grady harp, november 05
