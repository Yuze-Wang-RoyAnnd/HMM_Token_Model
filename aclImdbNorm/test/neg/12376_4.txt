i saw this movie when i was about 12 when it came out. i recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air. the horror. the horror.<br /><br />as a young kid going to these cheesy b films on saturday afternoons, i still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero, a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end. i didn't care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots. i love them now for the unintentional humor.<br /><br />but, about a year or so later, i saw psycho when it came out and i loved that the star, janet leigh, was bumped off early in the film. i sat up and took notice at that point. since screenwriters are making up the story, make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well-worn formula. there are no rules.
