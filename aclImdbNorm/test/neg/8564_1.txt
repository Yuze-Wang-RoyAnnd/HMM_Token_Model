movies like this make me wonder what modern horror would be like if someone had (mercifully, for movie fans) put an end to m. night shyamalan inside the womb. this garbage is a prime example of what kind of lame, random, uninspired, last minute, generic plot twists have become the norm since movies like "the sixth sense" and "the others" were released. this was an okay movie until the writers took a dump all over whatever of the mediocre script they had written, and decided, "hey, here's an interesting idea: lets throw in a wacky twist at the end and make the main character the murderer! that'll throw the audience for a loop!" what an original idea.
