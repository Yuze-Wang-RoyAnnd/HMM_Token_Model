i really should give this stinker more credit that 1 star, because the film has so many eye-rolling lines that it's almost worth the price of the rental. <br /><br />the acting, if you want to call it that, is so stilted and contrived that it makes ed wood's actors appear life like. "sammy," the lone black character, must be mimi's husband in real life because he appears in her other films, but he has zero acting ability. his lines are priceless due to his absurd delivery, though i suspect the intention was to create a sympathetic character. his old man make up in her other turkey ("pushed to the limit") is no-budget, junior high school quality, with cotton ball eyebrows and white spray painted hair.<br /><br />i cannot fathom anyone actually buying this video, unless people like to throw their own mystery science theater parties and need a copy of something like this on hand. it really is beyond fear-- it's actually beyond funny.
