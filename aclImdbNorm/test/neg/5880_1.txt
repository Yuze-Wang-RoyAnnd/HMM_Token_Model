i saw the *star* of this movie on the daily show, and thought i might tune in (the movie premiered on comedy central, then went into theaters). oh vey!<br /><br />this makes "shakes the clown" look like "citizen kane"! avoid, avoid, avoid at all costs. not one laugh, not even a grin. this movie will make your face come out in pimples and your eyes burst like the last remants of "raiders". i can't even think of a worse movie, be it "manos" or "ishtar". as the pythons beckoned, run away, run away! why did anyone green light this unless they used their own money? the horror is that there is not one good line, not one good joke, and only one bad thing...the making of this movie.<br /><br />i feel that, if made properly, this would have been hilarious. as it is, i need a new pancreas for retching so loud. damn anyone involved in this travesty.
