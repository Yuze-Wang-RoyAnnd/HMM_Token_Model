what has rajiv rai done to himself? once a hit director of films like tridev and vishwatama is now making one bad film after another. i was initially excited at the thought of rajiv rai returning to the action genre but that soon fizzled out. as a rajiv rai fan i thought i should at least give it a go but i left after an hour. one reason for me leaving the film so early so the amount of paki- bashing in the film, this was not in rai's previous venture.<br /><br />a lot of directors have tried paki- bashing but i did not expect it from rajiv rai another letdown was the music. rajiv rai's have always had good music until now. there is only one good song and that is tere dekh dekh ladgayan. the performances are not upto scratch, not even from rai loyalist naseer-uddin- shah. avoidable fare from once my favourite director.
