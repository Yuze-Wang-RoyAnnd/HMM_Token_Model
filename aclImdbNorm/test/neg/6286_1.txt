wow...<br /><br />reading through these comments, i see a remarkable socio-cultural clash theme emerging between the us and ... the dutch! the us p.o.v. appears to be that this is quite a good little movie, parker being a likable hero, the story a light-hearted rendition of what could be a glorified form of reality.<br /><br />all three dutch reviewers view the world through a totally different pair of glasses it seems. they categorically and in surprisingly similar terms agree the movie is a disaster.<br /><br />far be it from me to take sides in what appears to be a dispute between cultures, on this item as wide apart as the ocean that separates them geographically. still, based on factual observation - i saw the movie with my very own eyes - i suspect the dutch are not too far off the mark: <br /><br />"parker kane" is poorly made, utterly boring, and really not worth the celluloid that was no doubt wasted in its creation.
