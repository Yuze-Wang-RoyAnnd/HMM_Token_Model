the grudge 2 is one of the films that makes me wish there were more synonyms for "terrible" in the english language. with a plot replete with more holes than a trawlers net, this film fails to make compulsive viewing for a fan of even the most inane films, which i am. i felt compelled to remain in the cinema until i had extracted lb5.70p worth of entertainment from it, though i feared that i would be there for some years. a better film could be made from the out takes of the first installment of the grudge, though i am not altogether sure this isn't the result of such an exercise. as expected, what passes for a plot in this dire example of wasted celluloid, finishes with no resolution whatsoever, thereby leaving the producers with the option of inflicting 'the grudge 3' upon the public when the time comes that they feel yet another pang of true hatred for civilisation.
