i suffered the watching of this movie at sitges festival last month. if there would be a possibility of "unfilm" a movie to avoid its existence, this should be the first in the list. mar'ia lid'on isn't a director, she is just a dumb woman that pretends that holding a camera with the hand and shout "action" makes her a professional film maker. what a mistake! the movie itself is pointless and a total waste of good actors that could be doing something better in another project. val kilmer does nothing but place his face in front of the camera. his character don't have specific weight in the movie. the same thing can tell about joss ackland, vincent gallo or joaquim de almeida. it's a shame the way rade serbedzija's character has been written. warning spoilers<br /><br />he spends most of the time alone in the tunnels talking with himself in the way (now i'm doing this, now i'm low of bats, i'll search in my bag, now i'm turning left, now i'm turning right...) only to bring the audience a clear idea about his actions. it's simply nonsense and proves the lack of talent of the director. end of spoilers<br /><br />the usual joke about this piece of garbage among the audience was that the title of the movie itself brought the clue about the rating everyone should give it: zero
