this show is awesome and we have been enjoying it thoroughly. set in alaska, i don't agree with the homosexual content on tonight's show. i feel that you are pushing too hard to bring new york to alaska. its one thing to have a new yorker struggling in the alaska wild, but to try to turn the alaska town into new york? this is a nice show about dainty women and true alaska men and to bring a same sex couple into the mix is throwing the balance way off. alaska should be portrayed as a man and new york as the woman. i think the first 9 shows have the perfect balance with what you all are doing. can't we have a nice show without the imbalance of nature.
