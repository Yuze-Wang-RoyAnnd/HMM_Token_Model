boston blackie movies have some strengths -- mostly in that the pacing is swift and the hero is cheerfully unfazed in even the worst circumstances. but the plotting is frequently atrocious, and the unrelenting comic bits often kill the pacing (if the plot happens to be atypically good) or are just unfunny and inappropriate.<br /><br />this one involves blackie chasing an escapee from the asylum (steve cochran in a really poor performance) who has become fixated on beautiful nina foch (who puts in a nice, rather subtle acting job). inspector farraday, of course, believes blackie has gone homicidal maniac (he at least has some evidence in this one for that), and is incompetently trying to jail him as blackie goes after the real killer. the plot has possibilities, but any time any real tension gets going, we a get a not funny comedy routine. it doesn't seem like anyone at columbia understood that, in a movie about a pursuit of a really dangerous maniac, cute little comedy scenes about hiding an inconvenient body from the inspector disrupt any willing suspension of disbelief. (one just concludes our clever hero is an idiot -- deadly for a film like this.) <br /><br />this one is not worth the time. for a well plotted episode of this series, see alias boston blackie.
