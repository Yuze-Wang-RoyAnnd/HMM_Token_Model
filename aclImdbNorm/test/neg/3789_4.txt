this opens with the company credits informing us it`s by world international network . i knew i`d seen this company credit before but couldn`t remember where , but knew it was at the start of a really bad movie i`d seen so i seriously thought about changing channels , only thing was i`d seen every film on the other channels which is one of the problems of being an imdb reviewer . what the hell i thought it won`t really matter if wanted is good or bad because i`ll still be able to review it for this site.<br /><br />as i expected wanted wasn`t all that good . it`s a plot i`d seen so many times ( too many times ) before involving a fugitive on the run , a bit like the incredible hulk tv series without the shirt ripping . jimmy crosses the mob in an entirely contrived way and goes on the run and in an entirely contrived manner finds himself working at a catholic reform school . have you noticed an oft used description in the last sentence ? " entirely contrived " is the answer . let me repeat for the hard of thinking that this is an entirely contrived film where everything relies on coincidence . another problem i had was the reform school run by the church - it`s far too compassionate and kind , i`m led to believe these type of establishments make alcatraz look like a country club , i`m saying this is a fact but when the head priest looks like the spitting image of donald rumsfeld you do feel there`s a large amount of sugar coating going on .<br /><br />to be honest despite the ridiculous plot twists etc wanted isn`t really a bad thriller though it`s a terribly good one either . i never really had the urge to switch it off no matter how contrived it became which is an under hand compliment to the movie
