whereas the movie was beautifully shot and reasonably well acted, the script was dull. plodding and nothing we have not seen before. not once in this film did i ever get the feeling that these people were really in danger. no noticeable climax and a very standard resolution. i believe these type of movies have been overdone and should be given a rest. after all, didn't everyone on the planet see "schindler's list"?
