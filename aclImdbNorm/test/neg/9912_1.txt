i expected this movie was originally supposed to show before the election. cbs's last shot at throwing a dig at bush. this movie was just awful yet i'm still watching it. **minor spoiler** i think cbs got the same people who "provided" the memo's to do the semi cut in half sequence. what is with the bad boyfriend storyline? can the acting be more contrived or the dialog more like a ed wood movie. who ever came up with this script please do us a favor stop writing. if you want to see decent b grade disaster movies then see earthquake, flood etc. avoid this mess of a movie. hint to cbs avoid showing us this crap. give us re-runs of csi instead. better acting and more believable.
