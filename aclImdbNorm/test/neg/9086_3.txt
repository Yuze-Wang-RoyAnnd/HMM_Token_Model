originally, the spiders was planned as a four-part serial, and it shows. i dislike serials; they're typically ridiculous, convoluted and banal. this one is no exception. in the first part of the spiders, 'the golden lake,' a rich adventurer thwarts the plans of a gang of criminals--the spiders--to steal gold from incas. a silly love triangle ensues, with some cowboys and indians action. the sensationalism and exotica of it didn't entertain me.<br /><br />one can legitimately trace themes from this two-part series to lang's later, far superior work. and, the film-making is better than in other serials i've seen from this time, including 'les vampires' (1915). in the spiders, the camera isn't as static, and this film is fast paced, thankfully. the tinting and lighting are adequate, too. none of that's remarkable, though. it's nearly unseemly, however, in how closely this series resembles louis feuillade's serials; the criminal gang dresses and behaves like those in 'les vampires'--only the names, and to a lesser extent, the situations have changed.<br /><br />for the further comments on the spiders series, see the web pages for it.
