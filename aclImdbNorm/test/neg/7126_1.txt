i went into this movie with very little in terms of expectations. i went with my girlfriend and two friends, and none of them could explain the story of the grudge 1 to me. well, if the first one couldn't leave an impression on them to explain the plot, then i doubted this one would be any better.<br /><br />let me summarize what the trailers let you know: the asian lady is back and so is sarah michelle gellar. luckily for her, she isn't around very long. that decision may have saved her career.<br /><br />the movie has three story lines, and none of them make sense. and even worse, none of them are developed. you almost start to understand, and then someone dies and the story gets left behind. okay, killing people could be scary, but i was left more confused over the attempted plot development than i was frightened. they jump back and forth between all three story lines, which aren't related... or are they?!?! *sound effecttt*~~~ the timing of the three stories are displaced, and you can tell right at the start that the movie is going to have a twist at the end. be prepareddd. oh wait. sorry, this isn't a fight club or vertigo quality twist, you could see this one coming from miles away. and probably envisioned a much better twist in your head... they should've hired me. instead of the girl making her "surprising" appearance, maybe it could've been michael jackson instead? that part of scary movie 4 scared the crap out of me.<br /><br />the killing sequences were terribly done. unlike horror movies of the past, where a killer pops out of nowhere, a closet or behind a door for example, and everyone in the theatre jumps (and subsequently the fat guy behind you spills popcorn down your neck)- this lacked any frightening pop ups. they zoomed in on where the random asian woman or kid would show up, and you knew exactly what was coming. instead of having the music get really loud, then quiet, then a pop out to psyche you out, the music actually gave you timing for the scary scene. if i know it's coming, it won't scare me.<br /><br />the movie began with explaining what the "grudge" is; when a person is killed during a fit of rage, a curse is placed on the location where she was killed. so why does the asian lady being cursed by her mother have any significance to the story? and why is the grudge now moving countries? this movie was absolutely terrible.<br /><br />all it did was leave me begrudging my friends for making me go- we should've seen one of those animated pixar movies. it would've been scarier.
