i normally finish every movie or book i start, even if they're poor, just 'cause i hate giving up on them. this was so poorly made, i was in disbelief.<br /><br />i'm not just looking for spielberg magic - i rent foreign films, and i rent really old sci-fi's (most recently soylent green - worth the rent). i like both hollywood action and slower moving character development. different films need to be approached differently to be appreciated. i could find no redeeming element to this one... the action was so wooden i wasn't the least bit on edge. the character development was virtually absent - you're not left feeling sorry for anyone, or even identifying with them. finally, there were so many pieces that just didn't add up.<br /><br />don't waste your time - better to watch paint dry...
