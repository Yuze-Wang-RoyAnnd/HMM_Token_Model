george zucco was a fine actor, often playing gimlet-eyed villains with a lascivious intensity. however even he couldn't save this dull and flat-footed b flick.<br /><br />zucco plays the usual mad scientist, dr. lorenzo cameron, who believes that wolf's blood, injected into humans, can create an invincible army of wolf men who can win the world war ii (go figure!) experimenting on pedro the handyman(glenn strange) zucco creates a werewolf that looks rather like the ones dave allen used to play in his comedy sketches! pedro is obviously based on lennie from of mice and men, and you almost keep expecting him to say "duh, okay, george!" there's one startling moment when the werewolf kills a child by reaching in through the window and grabbing it, but for the most part this is a routine and pedestrian - very pedestrian - 77 minute tread through all the old clich'es that are done far better in other movies.we also get the revenge motif from the devil bat worked in, in itself a borrowing from son of frankenstein!<br /><br />zucco is wasted, and you only have to see him in films such as adventures of sherlock holmes, the mummy's hand and dr. renault's secret to see how wasted. a few atmospheric swamp scenes are all it has to offer, really. and the scene where zucco demonstrates his wolf-man technique to those who doubted him (again shades of dr. jekyll and mr hyde) is unintentionally hilarious.<br /><br />not one of the better 40s b movies.
