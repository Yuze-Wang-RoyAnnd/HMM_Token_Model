okay, i admit i like brigitte neilsen in an unhealthy way, i just have a thing for 6' tall women with swords. there i said it.<br /><br />what's wrong with the movie? just about every mistake you can make was made. you take a successful movie series (conan) and you drag it through the mud with a bad script, bad casting, bad effects, and the worst thing of all...you put a cute kid in there for comic relief. this kind of thing almost killed the indiana jones series ya know. cute kids are for disney movies, not real movies. neilsen at least took the movie seriously, even though it seems nobody else did. the plot had schwarzenegger repeatedly pulling red sonja's fat out of the fire and that undercut her character considerably. a warrior woman doesn't need a dude to get her out of a mess, thats her job! to not re-use the conan character in this movie was a crime. kalidor? sheesh. the movie never set the proper mood and its pacing was rather disjointed and sloppy, unlike conan the barbarian which had multiple story lines that flowed gracefully. when it comes to fantasy movies, its okay to have cheesy costumes, its okay to have harryhausen style animation, its okay to have silly exorbitant sets that make no sense, but to have a horrible script is unforgivable.<br /><br />this movie could have been a classic, but the script felt like it was written by a 12 year old.
