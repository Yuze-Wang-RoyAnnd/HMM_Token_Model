strangers with candy overacts in all the wrong context, the situations are just not funny with the cheesy voices and bad low brow comedy timing, the clear attempt at dry/black/dark humour is obvious and it fails to deliver on all elements of a good joke.<br /><br />with a high cringe factor and low laugh ratio i was shocked this show went pass the first season, i personally like scrubs, the office, 30 rock, trailer park boys, pulling, peep show, simpsons, family guy and i know what your thinking, these shows aren't weird at all, so some other good shows i've seen are jam, garth marenghi's darkplace, the book group, asylum and snuff box which are original with dry/black/dark humour/satire and are all at least 5/10.<br /><br />garth marenghi's darkplace especially is cheap looking, overacted and weird, however the context is thought out and works to make it really out there and entertaining too.
