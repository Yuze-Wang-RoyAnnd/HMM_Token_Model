i like this movie and have watched my copy twice since acquiring it a few weeks ago. but you have to view it in the right context.<br /><br />i haven't checked on the dates, but i bet this movie came out after and certainly around the same time as the collier and walt disney popularisations of the vision of spaceflight being promoted by w.von braun. this is reflected in the attempt to seem factually correct and scientific. however, whilst certain ideas are put across ( step boosters, for example ) roughly correctly, other things are hilariously wrong.<br /><br />for example, we are told that a rocket ascends to an altitude and then turns ninety degrees to enter space...like reaching the top of a flight of stairs and turning onto the landing! then we are told that by turning in the direction of the earths rotation the total velocity of the ship is increased accordingly.<br /><br />this is an hilarious misunderstanding of what really happens. most space launch centres are located as near the equator as possible where the earth and anything on its surface is rotating at roughly a thousand miles per hour, including any rocket departing to space, in an eastward direction ( the same as the rotation of the planet ). of course, if the ship turned to travel westwards once in space, its speed in relation to the surface of the earth would be greater, but it would add nothing to the actual velocity of the vehicle. decsribed in this movie as "air speed"! <br /><br />similarly, we are told that the travellers only feel free-fall, or "weightlessness" when they reach some thousands of miles from the earth, outside of the planets gravitational field. again, comically incorrect. most crewed spacecraft travel no higher than a couple of hundred miles up, but as long as they ( and, their contents, including crew ) are travelling at an adequate velocity that their momentum in an outward direction balances the pull of gravity inwards, they will orbit in free-fall. of course, travel far enough from earth and even a slow object will coast outside the earths gravity well, but in order to leave earth orbit, outwards ( towards the moon for example ) requires the attainment of "escape velocity", around twenty one thousand miles per hour. so the vehicle will have already attained "orbital velocity" ( and "weightlessness" ) by definition.<br /><br />but the movie has vastly more hilarious stuff than this. someone decided it would be more fun if they missed the moon due to a technical problem, fell asleep for a few days and then woke up to find they had accidentally gone to mars! the captain then ruminates to the effect that this must have been divine intervention! at which point, any pretence to being scientific is torn into little pieces like confetti and thrown upon the wind amid the merry dance of an increasingly barmy plot.<br /><br />the strength of a film like this in fact is in illustrating "how far we've come". not least in attitudes to women. the patronising drivel heaped upon the female crew-member is both hilarious and also shocking.to think that such attitudes were so recently "normal".<br /><br />as i said at the start, i find this film very entertaining, as a late night, lights out romp through the romance of travel in outer space, from the perspective of the days before it had actually happened. an antidote to the cold routine of spaceflight as it has now become in the twenty first century.<br /><br />i won't reveal the ending. it is both brave and shocking for a movie of this vintage and character.
