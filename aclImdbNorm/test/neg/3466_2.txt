i thought this movie was going to be good. it absolutely wasn't, despite the oscar-winning lead actors. i may have laughed once, and i never heard anybody else in the theater laughing. renee zellweger's pancake make-up was very unbecoming. everybody seems to be trying so hard in this movie, running around in imitation of slapstick but not pulling it off. i think perhaps the movie must've sounded good in development, but something got lost in translation. were the roaring 20's really like this? i think not. everything seems a tad artificial. randy newman's score was annoying. the film is in sepia tones, just like every other movie that takes place in the 20's or 30's. there's just not that much originality here.
