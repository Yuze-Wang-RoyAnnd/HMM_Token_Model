1st watched 6/24/2007 - 4 out of 10(dir-stefan rujowitzky): ok thriller, but a little too predictable. this story is based in germany, which is also where the movie is made. it is about a young medical student who gets a shot to go to a premiere school in heidelberg and arrives seeing some strange things occurring. someone she met on the train there and saved, shows up on the school's experimentation table and she's suspecting foul play right away. she does some investigation and the disappearance of her friend leads her to a secret society called aaa(and no it's not alcoholics anonymous) that has something to do with the anti-hippocratic oath and is used to perform experimentations on live people that doctor's wouldn't normally be able to do. she finds out her grandfather(who was a dean at the school) was a big part of establishing it and it's pretty readily filled by members of the school. it's an interesting story but the problem with this movie is how quickly the audience is told what's going on and then it's kind of a horror movie with the heroine fighting off the bad boy of the group that's taking things to the next psychotic level. although this movie was made in europe, it plays to a young american audience with it's focus on gore, sex and the horror film premise(which is really it's big downfall) and explains why it probably made good money and spawned a sequel but doesn't necessarily make for a good movie.
