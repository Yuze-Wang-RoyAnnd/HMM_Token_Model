seagal fans beware- he does no action scenes until almost an hour into this mess. instead, seagal runs away from numerous fights, letting ja rule convincingly lose every battle. actually, ja rule could be an up and coming action star, but hollywood needs to let him at least hit puberty (which should happen in a few more years...) also, what sort of commando/terrorist wears a bare-midriff outfit? the chick in this atrocity looks like a backup singer for christina aguilera.back to seagal- when he finally does cut loose, it's his stunt double (heavily padded to resemble the bloated seagal) doing a lot of the work & taking the falls. i don't remember any aikido, either. it's just your standard kicks & punches you'd see in any straight-to-video martial arts turkey. not even "so-bad-it's-funny", either. just plain dull...
