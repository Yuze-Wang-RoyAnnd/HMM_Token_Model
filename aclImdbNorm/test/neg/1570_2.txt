let me start by saying how much i love the tv series. the nature of class war was always going to be a subject worthy of poking fun at, but this tv series exploits it better than most. the chemistry between yootha joyce and brian murphy was always electrifying and the writers wrote almost entirely flawless episodes every time. in my opinion, it is the best british sitcom of the mid to late-1970s, surpassing the likes of rising damp, robin's nest, are you being served? and so on. with the on the buses series having finished a few years earlier, george and mildred became the next pride and joy of itv (or itv 1 as it's now known), enjoying a four-year run on the channel.<br /><br />the movie however is absolutely terrible in almost every respect. the general essence of the tv series has almost entirely been stripped by the writers of this abysmal movie (who anyone will immediately notice are not the same ones who worked on the series). as one commenter has already pointed out, mildred lacks the sharpness she had on the tv series and does not come across as anywhere near as overbearing.<br /><br />the plot, instead of focusing on the class war with the fourmiles that was the very foundation of the tv series, actually writes out the fourmiles almost entirely after the first half-hour. the plot, if you can call it that, consists of george and mildred going on holiday to some hotel and getting mixed up with gangsters. first rate talent in the form of stratford johns, kenneth cope, david barry and sue bond are all wasted here. most of these are well past their heyday and all of them look very embarrassed as if they very well know that the only thing worth hanging around for is a paycheck (which probably won't be much).<br /><br />the jokes and gags in the movie (if you can call them that) rely heavily upon traditional british farce, including mistaken identities, embarrassing situations, poorly-timed slapstick, characters losing control of what is happening to them and general confusion. and it all fails miserably. as another commenter has pointed out, it seems as though the writers of this movie have never seen an episode of the tv series and instead crafted out a something resembling a carry on romp. the scene where george is stripped down by sue bond's character is particularly out of context.<br /><br />a mystery surrounding this movie is the bbfc certification provided - 15. just why is it rated 15 when all there is to see is harmless, non-vulgar entertainment?<br /><br />not surprisingly the era of sitcom spin-of came to an end not long after this movie was released (shortly after the sad death of yootha joyce). and the company behind this movie, hammer, well known for producing first rate horror movies back in the 1950s to mid 1970s, soon disappeared into total obscurity.<br /><br />all in all, the movie is a near total washout. my advice - skip this and stick to the tv series. you won't be missing anything, i assure you.
