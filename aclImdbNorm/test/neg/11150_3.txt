to sum it all up, skip end of days and watch rent roman polanski's the ninth gate instead. this movie is the perfect stereotypical american movie vs ninth gate being the perfect stereotypical european movie.<br /><br />ninth gate: noir-ish, intelligent, nicely scored, atmospheric, excellent acting (johnny depp, esp), beautiful scenery, good cinematography, funny one-liners, intellectual, minimal foul language, thought-provoking. the only fault is it that a few people didn't understand the open-ended ending and said the movie was "crappy" because of that and there were a couple of questionable scenes.<br /><br />end of days: overly violent, liberal use of foul language, no musical score except for a poor attempt at a commercial soundtrack that was only heard when gabriel byrne stalked around nyc as satan (but all you could pick out was korn's jonathan davis unintelligible screaming), sex that had nothing to do with the plot, violence, incredibly predictable, violence, and did i mention lots more violence? i guess some of the special effects were good but that's about it.<br /><br />well, maybe i'm wrong but i thought ninth gate was far more interesting, quirky, original, and intelligent. but maybe americans don't need need that. *dripping with cynicism* even though i am an american, sometimes i wonder.
