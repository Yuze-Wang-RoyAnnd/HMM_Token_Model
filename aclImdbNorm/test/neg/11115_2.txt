"chupacabra terror" is saved from a '1" by the presence of canadian cutie chelan simmons as the heroine. she is a delight to watch, from the front, back and side. otherwise, what you have here is your standard monster movie, playing like a low-budget, shipboard version of the relic. john rhys-davies plays the captain of the ship on which the monster is being transported. and the very nonscary monster is simply a man in a suit. he does commit about 100 senseless, gory killings, at least, so the body count in this one is pretty awesome. formulaic, to say the least. i love the moment when simmons ominously tells someone what chupacabra stands for: goat eater! oooohhh...scary!
