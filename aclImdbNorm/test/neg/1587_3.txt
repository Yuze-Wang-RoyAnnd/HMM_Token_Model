(spoilers) "cash crop" goes something like this. down-on-their-luck farmers grow pot to make ends meet. dea agent blows into town. farmers hide the pot. dea agent leaves town. end of story.<br /><br />this flick features solid performances by some second tier actors, mediocre direction, and a so-so screenplay...but it ain't got no story. and since the story is the foundation of every drama, "cash crop" is an utter failure. too boring to recommend.
