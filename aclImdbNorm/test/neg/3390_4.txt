fans of horror comedy will like this one. others might get quickly annoyed and shut it off. it's sort of a buddy film, with over-the-top violence and gore, deliberately stereotyped characters, and a lot of craziness.<br /><br />it looks to have been made on a budget of about $100, by a bunch of fraternity guys after a big beer keg party. there's a lead who's a frustrated nerd, and his loudmouth prank-pulling friend who mocks him about 30 times per second. there's a cool monster truck chasing them for hundreds of miles, which is the highlight of the film. whenever this thing and its gnarly-mask wearing driver appear, it's a great scene. there's a mysterious girl who randomly appears in their back seat, and plenty of giant guys in overalls hanging out in red neck bars. the nerd's friend never shuts his yap, and gets them in one mess after another. their arguing got on my nerves, but other aspects of the film make up for it.<br /><br />sight gags poking fun at several "psycho tormenting and trying to croak somebody" films are everywhere. take your pick which one is riffed the most: hills have eyes, saw, and jeepers creepers were some that i recognized.<br /><br />it's enjoyable insanity, if you're in the right frame of mind. sensory-dulling brewskies with your friends can make viewing this more fun; it's a good bet that's the condition of the movie makers when they put this thing together.
