a bunch of medical student yuppies get together in their spare time to hook each other to the electrical cables and die. then they stand around counting the time before brain death, and then start cpr and heart-massage and bring each other back to life. the fact that julia roberts was in this movie should say it all. flatliners is like group ghost. everyone wants to see their dead relatives and visit their old dead buddies, so what better way to do it than have a bunch of medical students kill you for five minutes and then bring you back to life. the rest of the movie has the predictable relationship issues, plus the predictable "gee maybe if we keep killing each other, one of these days one of us will stay dead?" d'oh!!! this movie should have been called brain dead. the fact that the characters were depicted as being medical students made me wonder if they had gone to a foreign correspondence school to get their degrees. the only thing that kept this film from being a total laugh was that they did not just stick their fingers into electrical outlets in order to "die." this film would have been a great three stooges comedy movie.
