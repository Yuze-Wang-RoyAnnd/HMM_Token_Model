i had heard good things about "states of grace" and came in with an open mind. i thought that "god's army" was okay, and i thought that maybe dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. the film began with some shaky acting, and i thought, "well, maybe it will get better." unfortunately, it never did. the picture starts out by introducing two elders -- mormon missionaries -- and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them. instead, the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries (something that undeniably exists, but rarely on the level that dutcher portrays) and it becomes almost laughable.<br /><br />dutcher's only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience. by unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of mormon missionaries, dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly mormon audience. the film in no way reflects reality. missions are nothing like what dutcher shows (having served a mormon mission myself i can attest to this fact) and gang life in california certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity.<br /><br />the conclusion, which i'm assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all, was both unbelievable (c'mon, the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home -- and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other!) and cheesy. next time, dutcher, try making a movie that someone can identify with.
