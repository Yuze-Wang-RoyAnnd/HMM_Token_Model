according to the blurb on the back of the dvd case; jonothan ross 'laughed until a little bit of wee came out'. i suspect that that has more to do with his being full of it.<br /><br />i never watched the series for one reason or another, so maybe i'm missing some essential cues. as to this movie; i watched the first 45 minutes or so. i laughed once, smiled once, then reached for the newspaper whilst waiting for something else entertaining to happen. nothing did.<br /><br />evidently intended to be a surreal spoof upon life in the post-python, gross-humour style, this one falls absolutely flat. there's been a host of comedy series on television in the last few years, not the least of which were 'bottom', 'the fast show' 'the vicar of dibley' and 'father ted', each one engaging a group of bizarre but hilarious characters and sketches. any one of these could knock this crap into a cocked hat.<br /><br />if the series was anything like this movie; i'm surprised they got the funding. happily it was one of those lb2 tesco bran-tub purchases and is now in the local charity shop.<br /><br />the moral of the story is; don't believe the pundits, never pay top dollar.
