i have recently seen a string of caving movies and this film managed to cobble together all the worst aspects of this kind of film. you get very little appreciation for the caving surrounds or the monster that they face, while the characters are clich'ed (spiritual guy, leader with tragedy in recent past etc) and the ending was just weak. it really annoyed me that the director kept shaking the camera or showing almost total darkness to create atmosphere. i have read that this movie gave a real representation of caving and yeah, i imagine that caves are dark. showing near total blackness for half the film really brought that home. i quite enjoyed "the descent" which, for my money had better acting, showed more tight caving situations, better monsters and had a good ending.<br /><br />****spoiler******<br /><br />the monster turns out to be some guy whose plane crashed and parents were killed, leaving him to grow up in the caves. he seems to have developed super strength and speed, but why is never addressed - maybe the same force that drained their torch batteries caused this but during the film whenever someone is killed you get the impression of something large with claws that tears up each victim (see how much blood splatters the walls!) but in the end its just some dude with a fur draped over him and a mask? i would be willing to overlook this if great heights of suspense were reached but this was hardly the case. then he starts raping the last remaining caver and roll credits... almost absurdly bad i thought. sometimes a film is soo bad you can appreciate it and maybe have a laugh, but this films fails to take itself lightly as well. <br /><br />you watched it, you can't unwatch it!
