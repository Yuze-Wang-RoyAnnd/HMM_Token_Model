wow, this was a real stinker. this early sci-fi flick has nothing going for it than pure camp. there's so much scientific mambo-jumbo in the dialog it's laughable. the female character played by osa massen is just a plot device for the male characters to serve sexist remarks during the entire length of the film. watch this one with your girlfriend i guarantee it will make her blood boil.the only good thing is the musical score which expertly build the moods of the film. the special-effects are rather crude but not bad considering the vintage of the movie. with some good b-stars in the lead roles,the acting isn't too bad. but the lines they are given must have given them quite a challenge. the challenge of not laughing their heads off.
