worthless movie. a complete waste of time and nothing what i expected it to be. the packaging makes it seem as if it is of the american pie genre (it isn't). rather it is a ridiculous stringing together of coincidences that makes the movie seem more like a writing exercise (let's try to see how many mix ups we can write in to make what should have been a bad snl skit into a full length feature presentation). what is remarkable is that the director's (based on their commentary on the dvd) take themselves completely seriously. i have been a huge fan of the movies that national lampoon lends its name to, up to and including van wilder. with this one, i feel completely cheated. in fact, i feel duped. i was expecting a van wilder like farce to relive my college days but instead was served an hour and a half of garbage. what lead to my ultimately unmet expectations? well, for starters, the fact that the cast all appear naked (with an enormous sausage covering what must be covered) on the cover of the dvd. add to that the imagery on the back of the case as well as the description and you mislead people into thinking this is a movie that it is not. to make matters worse, the movie starts off as one might expect it too with half-naked drunk college students feebly trying a photo stunt, but ultimately this has nothing whatsoever to do with the movie. in fact, i didn't even realize that the people in that opening sequence where supposed to be the characters in the movie until i was told so by the directors in the commentary. don't get me wrong, i love plot twists and being surprised by movies, but i hate the fact that this movie tries to pawn itself off as something it is not. ultimately, it does itself a huge disservice (artistically, though most likely not financially) because it sets its audience up for confusion and disappointment simply because it neglects to deliver what it advertises. <br /><br />in short, do not rent this movie based on what you see on the case. it is not your usual national lampoon movie. the only thing funny about it is the fact that many of the actors have appeared in other movies and tv shows that make their involvement here entertaining.
