ok, the very idea is ludicrous.<br /><br />1. kids don't own planes 2. kids don't race planes with dirtbikes 3. it made the air force look like total idiots 4. the kids father would not jeopardize his entire career to allow his boy to joyride with him 5. neither would a reserve colonel<br /><br />the sequels, i am sure were worse than this tripe. the soundtrack is about the only redeeming quality of this waste of celluloid. i am sorry but i just don't understand why in the world anyone would write direct and produce such unbelevable junk. the iranian air force is lucky to filtch a couple parts for an ageing f-14, and this kid wrangles not 1 but 2 fully loaded and fueled f-16s? gimme a break.
