this is a god awful norris film, with one of the most annoying performances ever in calvin levels and a weak script. the characters were terrible, and it has hardly any action,plus even chuck norris stinks in this!. christopher neame is very weak as the main villain, and the story was not very interesting plus norris seemed bored with the whole thing and i don't blame him as i was too!. calvin levels gives one of the most annoying performances in a movie ever, i couldn't stand as i was tempted to rip the tape out of my vcr, plus norris and levels had no chemistry together!. if your looking for some great martial art moves from norris don't go near this, however if you want a movie with an uninteresting story, hardly any action and bad acting look further!. this is a god awful norris film, with one of the most annoying performances ever from calvin levels, avoid it like the plague!. the direction is incredibly bad. aaron norris does an incredibly bad job here, with no suspense or thrills bland camera work, and keeping the film at a dull pace!. there is a little bit of blood and violence. we get 2 gory impaling's,ripped out heart, exploding body and a few gunshot wounds. the acting is really bad. chuck norris is not amazing as he usually is here and seemed very bored here, his one liners are flat, and his acting wasn't that great and i am a huge norris fan, this is his absolute worst! (norris still rules!).calvin levels is incredibly annoying here, his whiny wimpy performance severely grated me, i was so hoping for him to get it good!, but sadly he didn't. christopher neame is pretty weak as the main villain, his voice was cool, but he over acted big time!. sheree j. wilson is beautiful and did okay with what she had to do. rest of the cast are terrible. overall please avoid this it's not worth the torture, even if you are a huge norris fan (like me). bomb out of 5
