... breaker morant and romper stomper . it has also given us watchable films such as bootmen and the odd angry shot . unfortunately for everyone involved in this debacle the wog boy won't be joining appearing in either list .<br /><br />i was looking forward to seeing this movie simply because of the politically incorrect title , so politically incorrect that when it was broadcast on bbc 2 late at night the announcer didn't even mention the movie's name so i was expecting something so offensively anachronistic that my jaw was going to drop in disbelief . it did drop in disbelief , i found myself not being able to believe that the financiers thought this was going to be a major international hit <br /><br />the problem lies with the cast and the script . i do know that australia with its small population doesn't have a large pool of actors so i'll be forgiving for the most part , but this doesn't stop my criticism of nick giannopoulos as steve . for this type of comedy to work you must be impressed with the comic skills of the lead actor and i'm sorry to say but nick g just doesn't have the skills . i'd never heard of him and seen nothing else he's been in so perhaps he's much better at other performances . here however he's just plain irritating , unconvincing and i lost count at the number of times he mugged for the camera . the jokes themselves are very flat and predictable and getting back to the script it seems very under developed , i mean who thought a running gag about a female minster of work who's having it off in the back of a limousine was funny to begin with ? you do get the feeling that someone in the production should have been more honest and said " look mate , this screenplay's not nearly good enough . go and make it more subtle and structured "<br /><br />i've been harsh and harshness has been called for in this review . i gave the movie four out of ten and it would have only got three if it wasn't for the one genuinely funny sequence where steve is watching a current affairs show only for himself flashing up on screen and labelled a " dole blodger " . this shows that the screenwriters were aware of comic timing and social comment . such a pity that they didn't come with a much better written movie
