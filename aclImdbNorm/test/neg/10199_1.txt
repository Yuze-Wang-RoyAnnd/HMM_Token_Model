one of the worst films i have ever seen! after watching it i walk out like, what happened? i am confused to this day, can someone explain that movie to me please? both the acting and picture quality are so bad ,you'll think you're watching someone's school project made with a home camcorder. first,i can not believe that how some people could give 10 star to this movie.because,.it's unbelievably bad movie! this movie isn't scary at all! there is even no typical horror clich'es,too. the plot and acting of this movie was terrible. it's not,fantastic,surrealistic or horror,it's just hideously bad turkish feature film.and finally there were a lot of unnecessary scenes and unnecessary characters. when i watch 'gomeda' i fell into so hopeless,so sad for young turkish movie maker.please,please don't make 'cinema' like this!
