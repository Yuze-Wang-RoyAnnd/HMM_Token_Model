let's summarize how dumb this movie is with two details : arnold to antichrist : "let's see who is meanest" said with a straight face. and you can tell they were not trying to be funny.<br /><br />how do you think arnold will battle the evil of all evils?<br /><br />blessed water, a crucifix, a priest..nooo! with a bazooka, yes not even satan expected it they're so clever.<br /><br />after an engaging beginning (which reminds you of devil's advocate) it goes nowhere. somebody get me those two hours of my life back. don't ever watch it, rent it, lest buy it.<br /><br />
