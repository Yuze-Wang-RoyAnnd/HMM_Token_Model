robert downey jr. in a 17th century wig and dress was enough to make me shudder, but i couldn't believe a great actor like sam neill actually took a part in this movie. the whole thing was unbelievable. i especially like merivel's "cure" for the crazies. they dance...and hey presto! everyone's happy and they're all better! i guess i just didn't like the character merivel too much. therefore, watching a whole movie about his supposed transition from a whoring buffoon into a great physician was grueling. <br /><br />also, i'm not entirely sure, but i didn't think the plague as well as the famous fire of london took place simultaneously.
