in 1989 here in nz wrestling was somewhat of a mega-hype phenom, and who was steering starship at the pinnacle was the orange goblin himself, hulk hogan (one of my uber-heroes at this time), so it seems obvious to me now why i adored this movie in 1989-90 when it came out here. hulk hogan a.k.a terry bollea is a shockingly bad actor and zeus a.k.a tiny lister is worse!!! the story line follows a standard wwe (then wwf) circa 88-91 story line culminating in the standard good guy beat down, hulk up and then get beaten down again story line only to follow that the good guy calls on all his inner strength( gained from eating vitamins, saying prayers etc etc ) to mount the epic come back..... pretty standard formula here. worth watching if only for reminiscing your youth!!!!
