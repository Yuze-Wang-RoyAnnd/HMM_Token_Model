... why watch a tv drama (billed as a comedy) in which none of the characters are likable or even interesting people ? i can sort of see what the writer david renwick was trying to achieve: the misdirections and bad-taste surprises that he put into "one foot in the grave", etc. i admit that the script made a bit more of an effort than most on british tv at the moment. but really ... who cares about these people ? they are cold bores.<br /><br />another poster mentioned the scene in which the woman sits down to watch a video of herself and her deceased ex-boyfriend shagging. that was the moment when i switched off this programme, never to return.<br /><br />p.s. it's interesting to note that the posters who didn't like this series are all british, whereas those who praise it are mostly in other countries. this reflects the fact that when the bbc broadcast this series it was ignored by viewers and sank like a stone.<br /><br />p.p.s. good news for those who liked it ! there will be a second series in autumn 2007 - though without the male lead. it sounds like the bbc have decided to turn it into a more conventional 30 minute sitcom.
