i really wanted to love this movie, and not only cause it had aaron eckhart in it but i thought the premise would be cool cause i enjoy movies and shows that revolves around chefs. the cinematography was good but besides it being revolved around chefs everything else is just very clich'e. oh and little miss sunshine was very irritating in this movie although abigail breslin seems to be a bit irritating in every movie she is in cause she plays a lot of roles where she is whinny. it has some decent flashes of cooking, but food really didn't play a big part in the movie than i expected which was a big disappointment for me. this film had some good potential, the cast was great but they just had very little to work with. i like a good light hearted romantic comedy but this was just bland. and longer than it should be cause it felt way longer than it is. it's not a terrible movie, you just won't miss anything by not watching this movie.<br /><br />4.5/10
