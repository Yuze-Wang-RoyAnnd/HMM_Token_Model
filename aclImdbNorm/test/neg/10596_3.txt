the dvd sleeve explains the premise: "three problem teens are headed for jail," and are "set to do time until captain greer offers them a deal to work for him - undercover." the film opens with definitions of the words "mod" and "squad", so you won't have to look them up in the dictionary. for a visual definition of "cool", search for photographs of the original threesome: michael cole (as pete cochran), clarence williams iii (as linc hayes), and peggy lipton (as julie barnes). <br /><br />one black. one white. one blonde. once they defined cool.<br /><br />the three who make up scott silver's version of aaron spelling's "the mod squad" are twentysomethings: claire danes (as julie barnes), giovanni ribisi (as pete cochran), and omar epps (as linc hayes). they aren't able to do much with the material given. mr. ribisi's portrayal is the most "far out", meaning he digresses most from the original characterization. ms. danes romances josh brolin (as billy waites), who looks like he could be in a re-make of "marcus welby, md". you won't believe hefty michael lerner dancing with mr. epps' "linc". he explains, "i'm not a fairy, i just like to dance!" and requests, "spin me!" <br /><br />*** the mod squad (1999) scott silver ~ claire danes, giovanni ribisi, omar epps
