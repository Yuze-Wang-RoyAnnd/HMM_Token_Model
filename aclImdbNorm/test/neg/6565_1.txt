i'm aware that there are some fans who might like this movie. i'm aware that the idea of 'searching for god' might appear interesting to some, to me, however, it's really boring.<br /><br />the movie is simply boring. when it does get a little bit interesting, it gets stupid. come on... kirk fights against god and wins? how low can we possibly get? the only good part in the film is the camping scene at the first 5 minutes, which is truly great, but after that, the movie becomes boring, irritating, with nothing more than a good music.<br /><br />thank god we have star trek vi. (oops, kirk beat him).
