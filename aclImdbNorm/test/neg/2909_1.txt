and i may be being generous. the overwhelming majority of the movie consists of looped footage...the shambling monster, two women exercising, the shambling monster again, a bunch of people in the pool, the shambling monster again, none the worse for wear despite having been injured...you get the picture. i restrained myself from yelling "get on with it already" on several occasions.<br /><br />and it doesn't help that the footage they used was poorly produced. the sound is disconcertingly out of sync with the image. and in the one scene where they tried to get "artistic" with the lighting and camera techniques, the lighting guy, holding the flashlight that provides the scene's only illumination, is clearly visible in the shot.<br /><br />my hope is that the production was the victim of some horrible disaster in which the original audio track and most of the footage was destroyed, but they decided to release it anyways, cobbled together from the editing room floor, in memory of the heroic crew members who gave their lives trying to save the *real* film - the one with the plot and the interesting dialog. sadly, there's no evidence of this, and i'm forced to conclude that, in the immortal words of joel and the bots, they just didn't care.<br /><br />
