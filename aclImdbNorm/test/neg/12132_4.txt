1st watched 4/30/2009 - 4 out of 10 (dir-john waters): corny waters-like comedy musical with some funny scenes and good parts but it didn't make a whole worthwhile experience. john waters directed this music-filled spoof of the fifties scene with johnny depp playing the title role. this movie is very similar with what he did with the 60's spoof entitled "hairspray" but this one is not as effective. some of the tunes are catchy, some of the characters are interesting in their quirky waters-like way, and the portrayals are fine although sometimes overdone. the storyline is similar to the movie "grease", where there is a good group and a bad group. the guy from the bad group, cry baby, wow's a girl from the good group. the good girl then joins the bad group but once cry baby hurts her -- she falls back to the good group. this just sets up the ending where cry baby tries to win her back. now, one difference that is expected in water's movies is that the bad group doesn't appear all that bad all the time and the good group acts like they have a pole up their you-know-what. i definitely saw this in hairspray, as well. the wacky and goofiness isn't really all that much fun in this movie, though and it just leaves us with a feeling like the movie could have been much better. the prime appeal of the johnny depp character is that he's able to make one tear roll down his cheek(thus his namesake) at various times and makes the women fall all over the place for him. this is overused and the basic bottom line is that the movie is ok, but not that great.
