man, the '90's really were an horrible decade for movies. the movies are lacking in a good style and also the storytelling is often lacking.<br /><br />this 6th entry into the long running halloween-series is certainly a bad one. you just never really get into the story because it isn't a very well constructed and build-up movie.<br /><br />it's simply a poorly done film, that also suffers from its imagine-less writing and non-compelling characters that are in it. dr. loomis seems to be in it just for the sake of being in it. it's a real shame that this had to be donald pleasence last film-role. it's nice and also sort of suiting that his last role is in an halloween movie but he definitely deserved to be in a better one.<br /><br />there is never a sense of real danger in the movie and the character of michael myers just never comes across as threatening or scary. perhaps it's because he's featured too prominently throughout the movie, from pretty early on already. he does his usual stuff again but without too much class or originality. also the attempts to uncover myer's past don't really work out, for the main reason that it just doesn't get explained very well. it's obvious that the script went through various re-writes before- and also very possibly during filming. several scenes even got re-shot or added after the first cut turned out to be far from pleasing. <br /><br />the movie more often looks and feels like a made for tv one. this is also due to the lack of some real good gore. as an horror movie it really is lacking in basically everything to make this a good or even original one to watch.<br /><br />so far the worst out of the series!<br /><br />3/10
