i'm a dance teacher and was looking forward to some good dance routines in this film. how sad to have been subjected to such a painful experience. <br /><br />i had major problems with jennifer beals and her character. i found alex extremely repellent. beals' face is so young, sweet and innocent, and this very incongruous with alex's very disturbing lewdness, especially in that disgusting restaurant scene. she also has the temper tantrums of a toddler. it is very difficult to believe that nick would keep coming back to such a moody teenager after her frequent rantings and ravings, especially after she opens the door of a moving car and chucks a stiletto at him, opting rather to walk home - in the middle of the road - with only one shoe!!!. and what about after her idiotic behaviour after the night at the ballet. in fact, the whole romance was very disturbing - the 30 something year old man going after a girl who looks about 16. yuck. <br /><br />as for the dancing, i'm afraid this 80s style is totally dated. what on earth was that tv dance sequence about in the club? who was supposed to be dancing? i wasn't even sure if it was a woman or a man in drag! and even that famous final sequence is pretty disappointing, especially given the context of an audition for a ballet company. the camera shots of her leap actually ruin it's effect because you can't see what she's doing. and what on earth was she doing when she went past each of the panel pointing at them? and as many other comments have pointed out, she would never get into a ballet company on the strength of that audition - perhaps that's why they don't actually say at the end whether she was successful or not, the closure is the fact that she overcame her fear in the end. of the 'flashdancers', i actually thought the best sequence belonged to cynthia rhodes (penny in dirty dancing). you could see that she was a real dancer, and her acrobatics were very impressive. this is of course if you can get past her appalling costume and makeup. <br /><br />there were two good bits in this film - the ballet dancers stretching when alex goes for the first time to apply for an audition - they look so lovely and classy, and at least this helps to underline the difference between her current dance career and the one she aspires to. the other good scene was the break dancing in the street. i also liked the ice skater's parents, they were funny.<br /><br />some other random points - who was hanna and how did alex get to know her? what was an 18 year old doing living in a converted warehouse all alone? how did she afford that lovely barre and all the furniture?where were her family? was that scene in the 'nude' club really necessary? the person who wrote in their comment that it was something like a disney film needs their head examined. and anyway, what happened to the ice skater? <br /><br />many people said the film was poor but they liked the message - don't give up hope, keep on trying, and your dreams will come true. watch "the little mermaid" instead.
