i have done some research on ed gien, and i have found a few interesting things. like the fact that ed gien, was quiet and a loner, not some buff over bearing jerk as in this movie. i will say that i didn't finish this movie but i will. i will cringe through the fact that all of us, wisconsinites, talk like we are from kentucy. you know the funny, but oh so sad factor in this movie, is wisconsin isn't as hot as they made it look.<br /><br />this movie is not only an insult to wisconsin people, being a wisconsite myself, but it is a complete insult to a man that was proved to be an insane, lonely man. he killed two people and the movie couldn't even get that right. ed didn't get that close and personal and scare people, he shot the two and only people, he killed. so, why do these movies lie and say "based on a true story"? this is not based on nothing but the lies the director came up with in his foul head.<br /><br />a joke and nothing more!<br /><br />ok, i would like to add on to this. i did finish this oh so sad movie, and i personal would like to laugh at the director. do your homework when making a movie. i would like to inform you that there are no mountains (for those who have never been in wisconsin) and oh there is no desert! what the hell, there was more pine trees and snow in ravenous and that was suppose to be shot in californa. <br /><br />ok, for those who know nothing about ed gein, i would like to give you, your history lesson. ed gein was thought to have killed his family, but it was never proved. he killed a bartender, she was shot at bar close when no one was around. he took the dead bartender back to his house. 10 years later he shot and killed the store clerk, he stoled the cash register and the store truck. he was caught because of this murder, he came in the day before when her son was there and asked about antifreeze. the day he killed her, he was in there buying the antifreeze, and the reciept that only had antif..... was the only evidence they had to start a world wide man hunt. he robbed graves, in fact in robbed 56 graves. he hate the people he dug up and he made furinture; lamp shades, couches, chairs, and other things. <br /><br />he had a family that he had dinner with once and awhile and they threw all the meat he ever gave them out when he was caught, considering he was caught at their house. he was arrested and hid in the back of a cop car, in fear of what may happen to him. how do i know all of this? i read the book the judge that tried him wrote. <br /><br />after this movie was over, after watching the whole horrific thing, not only am i offended by the directors horriable view on what wisconsin women look like. i mean it was hard to tell who this guy had on the slab half the time, you know cause wisconsin women are all blondes. please! i am overly offended by the lack of homework this guy did and the poor job he did making this movie. i have no idea who this kane guy is and i think he may be ok in something else, but he did a horrible job playing ed gein. <br /><br />after all of this i am so sad i wasted the 3.99 on the movie. <br /><br />movie after finished was completely untrue, this movie is like me saying that the world is flat and george washington wasn't our first president. come on people, that is your history, and this is wisconsin's history. to end this rant, how would all of you feel if i made a movie and george washington looked like brad pitt (some of you may think that is fine, but it would be not true) and he lived and wasn't the president and whatever. you can't rewrite history.
