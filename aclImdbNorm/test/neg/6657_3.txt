this plot had more holes in it than an oj simpson alibi! <br /><br />i noticed two star trek references in the movie and, yet,<br /><br />ironically we have a lead character played by andy garcia<br /><br />who is the antithesis of the vulcan philosophy of, "the<br /><br />needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or one." <br /><br />let's just say that while trying to save his son from cancer he puts most of the rest of san francisco at incredible risk. michael keaton's character is almost as<br /><br />unrealistic as well. he neglects to kill at numerous opportunities and yet is angered when garcia foils his<br /><br />attempt to kill a bunch of cops at once. the child's doctor remains in charge of her faculties even after been<br /><br />held hostage several times in a short expanse of time but<br /><br />put her on a wide walkway 5 stories up and she loses it. <br /><br />andy garcia's child is something of an anathema in this<br /><br />movie. he is the most sympathetic and real character, one of the movie's bright spots. he furthermore utters a line, that must have been the result of serendipity, regarding fighting cancer that parallels keaton's motivation to escape. all in all, the movie was not a<br /><br />complete waste (see from dusk to dawn 2: texas blood money<br /><br />for that) but disappointing considering the talent on hand.
