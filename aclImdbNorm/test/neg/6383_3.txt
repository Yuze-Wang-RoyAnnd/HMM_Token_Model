i know terry gilliam is considered as a good director but claiming that this movie is good is just foolish. what was the movie about? what is it a spoof? fantasy? comedy? satire? no answer there from gilliam's screenplay. totally confused and pointlessly hurtling from one historical age to another. i find it amusing that some people actually call this movie magical. is it because they have to praise any movie which is vague and indecisive on what it is about?? 3 stars for special effects considering it is 1981. roger ebert has it right in his review. the movie is ambiguous and looks like gilliam's romp with money just to make a vague children's move masquerading as a historical revue. the movie also tries to confuse the would-be viewer by giving john cleese and sean connery top billing.
