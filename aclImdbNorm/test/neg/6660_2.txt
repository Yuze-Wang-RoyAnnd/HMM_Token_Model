words can scarcely describe this movie. loaded with ridiculous stereotypes, a silly plot, and poor music, this movie lacks in just about every category.<br /><br />don't be fooled by the imdb credits. this is not a michael dorn movie. he's a secondary character in the grand scheme.<br /><br />also listed in the credit's is an actor named "prince" - which makes me wonder if it's the same artist formerly known as.... then again, i'm not sure this movie is worth watching just for that.<br /><br />big summary... bunch of teams... one has kidneys... one has $35,000.... one has an "illegal substance".... and one has $350,000. add some confusion and mixups as to who needs to meet who, revenge on being taken, and such, and you end up with this mess of a movie.<br /><br />given a choice, i'd pass on this movie.
