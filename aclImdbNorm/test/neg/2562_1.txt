seems sensei seagal is getting more and more moralising and less "action packed". to date this has to be his worse movie... no action, a poor story line, an impossible plot and to make things worse, one of the cheeziest endings i have ever seen.<br /><br />seagal films are like seeing a dirty-harry, you do not go see it for the great social causes or impeccable acting... you want a good action flick.<br /><br />on a scale of 1 to 10, this one gets a 1...
