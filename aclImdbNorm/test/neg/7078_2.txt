i saw the film yesterday and stopped it at half time because i felt it was a waste of time. the idea to make a film through the eyes of a headsman - one of the "evil guys" throughout most fantasy and medieval films - is great and offers plenty of possibilities but... the film couldn't catch one of them. i was not feeling for any of the characters, the plot was all too predictable (to the point that i followed it)and the second leap of time in the storyline made me quit. those who expect a deep insight into the emotional situation of a headsman in the middle ages, a social outcast to that time, might be disappointed.
