jesus franco is pretty hit or miss on his films & i'd say this was a miss, that is, unless you're into total sleaze. i will say that the man has an eye for a good shot, even if it involves topless women with machine guns silhouetted against the ocean. this is overall pretty ridiculous and the acting is horrible, but the acting is the least of what this is about. and what is it about? well, it's about 102 minutes of lesbianism, women picking and shoveling in the hot sun for no apparent reason, and just about as much sleaze as you can stand and maybe then some. most notable (?) is a scene involving one young woman who is tied to a chair and an apparently amorous german shepherd, and while what's going on is merely implied (thankfully) it is probably a scenario that i could have done without. i'd rank this up there with tender flesh as one of the franco films i'd rather not have in my collection, although the music is jazzy and fun. 4 out of 10, yecch.
