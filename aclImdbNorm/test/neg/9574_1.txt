old bat transforms to younger ok looking girl after drinking a potion. this movie was dreadful. the acting atrocious. the camera work made me head spin. and it features the longest, most excruciatingly boring strip-tease ever put to film. piero vivarelli should be ashamed for directing this. eduardo manzanos brochero should'voe been blacklisted just for writing something so awful.don't rent this movie, the only exception i can this of is maybe if you're dying and only have less then 90 minutes to live, watch this film cause it will feel like an eternity and you'll be begging the grip reaper come a little early.<br /><br />my grade: f
