during my struggle to stay awake during this borefest, i fought through my near-dosing off to discover some silly plot regarding fraternity schmucks, quite incredibly obnoxiously annoying, running into trouble with a psychotic , radioactively damaged half-human/half cyborg named splatter who sends his soldiers after them for the murder of their prestigious, politically vocal leader(..for whom splatter killed himself, setting them up to take the blame so he could become the leader). these face-painted freaks form a group who express their feelings anarchically, though non-violently, living on dilapidated streets abandoned by the "civilized world" voicing their concerns regarding nuclear disarmament. anyways, most of the film has these five frat goons running throughout darkened streets with graffiti walls, as splatter and his punks pursue them. thankfully for these guys, they find a punk chic to assist them on their journey out of this rather ugly terrain with which they're unfamiliarized. this territory the frat guys are immersed is a veritable labyrinth of streets and alleys with the idea of an exit out most difficult particularly when crazies and splatter's bunch occupy nearly every turn.<br /><br />yeah, i was duped like others thanks to the hr giger poster which is most excellent. if only he had been the designer of this dreck..this is not the case and we, the viewer, are left a film modeled after, of all movies it seems, walter hill's the warriors, except this film doesn't have the style or grit that film has. the film has a plethora of unfunny bits and lame confrontations between the frats and the punks with hand to hand combats often laughable. the setting is rather interesting, and there are some atmospheric uses of neon light, but it's not the environment that's the problem..it's the plot and characters within the environment that grow tiresome. the saddlebags under my eyes weighed heavier every minute this movie continued. yes, texas chainsaw stars edwin neal(..quite a funny voice-man, who has an entertaining interview on the dvd i rented for this flaming turd of a film)and marilyn burns have "key" roles as opposing members of their faction against the government resulting in the final conclusion within a building complex at the end. neal's character splatter uses these metal spikes which emerge from his metal arm to kill his victims.
