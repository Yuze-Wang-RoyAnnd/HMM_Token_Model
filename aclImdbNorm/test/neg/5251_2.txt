what. uh...<br /><br />this movie is so dissociative and messed up that i literally lost a bit of my sanity after it was over. i will never be the same person again. i'm trying to put my finger on what, exactly, is so completely insane about it... it's not just the hilarious techno music, or the "outside of time" medieval/blade runner/wild west/highlander setting, or the weird cgi "grendel" monster that looks like a man made out of animated sausages, or even the "grendel's mother" monster, which looks like some alabama table-dancer who grew claws and tentacles when she stayed in the tanning bed too long. all of those things are weird, but what's really the strangest thing in this movie is the acting. i simply can't explain. this script is obviously, hellishly silly, but the actors exude deadly seriousness through it all. lambert is always weird, and usually kind of boring, but for this one he's gone into dolph lundgrin territory: i can't help but just start laughing every time he talks.<br /><br />i will give this movie some credit for being completely scatter-brained and crazy as opposed to conservative and boring. i'll always take a bizarre disaster of a film over an utterly mediocre one.<br /><br />warning: if you are planning on watching christopher lambert as beowulf, be prepared to spend several hours thereafter wandering the streets in some kind of nightmarish, hyperactive-catatonic daze. it's true. when i was done with my beowulf spirit journey, i woke up in the middle of the siberian tundra in a puddle of blood and milk. there was a dead wolf lying next to me, and i later found i had a handful of human teeth in my shirt pocket. my vhs copy of beowulf was sitting on a hastily-constructed stone altar nearby, enshrined with candles and wilted flowers. the tape told me to walk. i rose and i walked.
