as an avid fan of christian film, and a person trying to maintain a keen eye for improvements in the realm of christian film-making, i was excited to get a chance to see this film. i was ready to see something that would make a new mark in quality movies. i was left disappointed.<br /><br />the beginning scene is excellent, though a slight rip-off of leon - the professional on the angle, it showcases some great cinematography in the early goings... everything after that was pretty much downhill.<br /><br />i was barely able to sit through this one, i was tempted multiple times just to shut it off.<br /><br />the acting, while quite possibly sincere, was incredibly awful. but then again, the heart of the problem was the screenplay itself. the dialog was worse than anything i have ever seen, and even my amateurish screenplay "the awakening" (soon to be an independent film) looked like a hitchcock-thriller next to this. (which isn't saying much.) the bright side of this film is that it was filmed on sony's brand new high-definition 900 cameras shooting in 24p. this film and star wars: attack of the clones were the first movies ever to use these new technology cameras that year. unfortunately, the camera's performance seemed to be wasted with bad lighting, poor angles, and awkward handling.<br /><br />the only good feeling i got coming out of watching this movie was how good my rookie indie film is going to look next to it. ; ) 4/10
