i've heard many things about beowulf, maybe because i'm from romania and a good part of the movie was filmed here, in my country. and i expected a lot from this film. at the end, i was disappointed. it is not as horrible as other users said, but it's definetely bad. it's all about a monster killing people in a 6th century castle and lambert the one who comes to kill him. lambert is good, as he is in all his roles, but the rest of the characters suck, and the action isn't too good either. plus maybe the only thing that could've saved this film, the special effects, are also very bad, the monster looks awful (not scary, but awful). oh and another bad thing: the music. the movie tries, and manages to create the 6th century atmosphere. but all the action sequences are presented on rock music, which is very very bad. i mean action on rock works perfectly on a movie like charlie's angels - where that's the perfect way to shoot your action. but here, that was a very bad idea.<br /><br />vote: 4 out of 10.
