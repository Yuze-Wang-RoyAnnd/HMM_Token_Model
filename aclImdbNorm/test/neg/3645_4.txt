i was looking forward to watching this movie, and it does contain very interesting perspectives from iraqis all over the country, not just in major areas.<br /><br />however, as the film went on, and as it seemed to become increasingly more one-sided, i started wondering who had edited the film. to get several hundreds of hours down to just 80 minutes, obviously decisions had to be made.<br /><br />i would have really enjoyed a film that showed how everyday iraqis felt on all sides of the issues, but with the newspaper headlines in contrast to what people were saying, and with everyone in the movie having the same opinion at the end, i thought it was obvious that the editing was done with a pre-conceived bias.<br /><br />it could have been such a great film.
