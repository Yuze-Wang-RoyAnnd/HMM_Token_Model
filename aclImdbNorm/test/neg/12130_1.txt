this movie was pure genius. john waters is brilliant. it is hilarious and i am not sick of it even after seeing it about 20 times since i bought it a few months ago. the acting is great, although ricki lake could have been better. and johnny depp is magnificent. he is such a beautiful man and a very talented actor. and seeing most of johnny's movies, this is probably my favorite. i give it 9.5/10. rent it today!
