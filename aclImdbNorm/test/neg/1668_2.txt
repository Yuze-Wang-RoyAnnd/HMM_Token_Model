i should have known better..the clues were all over imdb.com. this flick was written and directed by the same guy who has no track record. the cast is a bunch of unknowns with the possible exception of joe estevez who seems to specialize in bad movies. etc. suffice it to say, i can't see any reason why anyone would want to see this awful, amateurish attempt at film making. turn on any broadcast channel at 3am and you'll see better movies. nuff said.
