terence stamp can carry off anything, but this is still a shallow one-dimensional movie. it's nice to look at - so are the actors - and if you're into drag queens, i guess you might like it a lot, but the plot and characters are as thin as cardboard. it's one of those politically correct movies that warps everything else in order to make a 'minority lifestyle' seem warm and cuddly. it gets a lot of mileage out of bitchy dialogue, which is amusing in this sanitized form, i guess. <br /><br />ninety percent of the action is parading around in gaudy costumes in incongruous situations. the dramatic content is a token appendage - they hardly try to get you to take it seriously.
