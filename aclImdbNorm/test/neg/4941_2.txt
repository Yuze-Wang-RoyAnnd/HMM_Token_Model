don't pick this one. ****spoiler alert***** the plot of this aggravatingly bad movie is four friends are talked into taking the shuttle from the airport by a very zealous driver. on the shuttle with them is a rather milquetoast looking business type. <br /><br />shortly into their trip the driver of the shuttle takes an off-ramp and some lunatic driver tries to run them off the road. the end result is they get a flat tire. the driver gets one of the people on the shuttle to help change the tire and the jack slips and the guys fingers are crushed between the tire and the shuttle. it's at this point that the driver reveals himself to be a kidnapper and he has taken all the people hostage. <br /><br />now the movie gets extremely slow and tedious, as the characters do one lame thing after another. one of the men is killed trying to escape -- even that lacks any suspense. finally it is revealed that the milquetoast business guy is in cahoots with the driver when milquetoast guy kills the other male friend by slitting his throat. <br /><br />there are a couple of attempts to escape by the women. milquetoast is beaten over the head with a tire iron -- yet he survives. <br /><br />the driver is also beaten and somehow survived a head on collision with a fence at high speed while kneeling next to the steering wheel. somehow he didn't go through the window or even get seriously injured with a collision with windshield. yet the woman driving the shuttle is knocked unconscious -- yet she had a steering wheel to protect her and he had nothing between him and the windshield.<br /><br />he is eventually able to subdue the women and get them to an underground garage that is a front for human trafficking. one of the women is killed. the other one stabs the driver in the leg with a good sized piece of broken mirror and shoots/grazes him in the head, yet he is able (in what should be a severely weakened state -- severe blood loss, two head injuries and a large leg gash) to drag her out of the shuttle, drag her to a large crate, throw her in and get it locked, all the while with her fiercely fighting him.<br /><br />now some people admire the message of the movie about human trafficking and how it is going on today. this is a serious problem. but, making an extremely boring movie about the topic does not entitle it to a higher rating.
