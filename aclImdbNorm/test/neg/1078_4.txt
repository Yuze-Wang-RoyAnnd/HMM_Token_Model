i was really disappointed by this movie. great actors in it, and potentially a great plot, but it just seemed to limp along.<br /><br />charlize theron was masterful in her role and beautiful, but it seemed like 90% of her on-screen work was in car chases done with austin minis. product placement gone wrong, so very wrong.<br /><br />the direction seemed off, too. edward norton is the bad guy, and it was so obvious right from the start. every time the camera would pass over him, it would linger too long and norton would grimace or something. c'mon, hollywood, give us a little credit! it's okay to surprise us with a plot twist without having to telegraph it.<br /><br />sorry, but this movie was just below average. i have always been one to appreciate the work and talent that goes into a movie, but this one just didn't have it.
