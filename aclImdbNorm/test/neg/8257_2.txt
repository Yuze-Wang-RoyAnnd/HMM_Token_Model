it's a shame, really, that the script of this film had more holes than you could shake a stick at (mixed metaphor intentional), because kinski and coyote - both supremely talented performers who are capable of great subtlety and nuance - have wonderful chemistry together, and the always-provocative fairuza balk didn't hurt the mix either. jeremy piven would have been great here too, if his character (and all the other supporting characters) hadn't been written as a plot device. as for the main proceedings, the writers just didn't know how to create the suitable guilty-or-innocent tension for kinski's character -- instead they gave us confusion, contradiction and, by the finale, downright let's-hope-the-viewers-don't-notice claptrap.
