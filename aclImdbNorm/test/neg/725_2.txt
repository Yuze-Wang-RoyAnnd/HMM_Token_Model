it's been mentioned by others the inane dialogue in this series and i agree.<br /><br />if mom and daughter were really that sharp-witted they should be queen and princess of the universe, not kicking around in some little town.<br /><br />i've really tried to watch a few episodes but when the witty staccato mumbling pop culture drivel starts i flip the channel.<br /><br />i watched a bit of a new episode to see if anything had changed (for the better i'd hoped) but nope, same old "we're so clever with our references to pop culture" that i nearly barfed.<br /><br />long time fans who aren't happy with the newer seasons might just be wising up and getting sick of the regurgitated pablum that never stops.
