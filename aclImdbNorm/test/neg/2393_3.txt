oddball black-comedy romance featuring a great cast and a less than stellar script. brenda blethyn ("lovely & amazing") is the title character 'betty', a woman trapped in a loveless marriage with a man who is obviously having an affair with his beautiful, blonde secretary. guess who's playing this minor role, yup! naomi watts ("mulholland drive") must of sandwiched this project in before her superstar status was insured with the blockbuster thriller "the ring."<br /><br />on the male side of the cast list there's the woefully miscast alfred molina ("frida") an old-fashioned undertaker who suddenly decides to reveal his desires for 'betty' which have lain dormant for decades. perhaps miramax is hoping molina's turn in the upcoming "spider-man 2" might generate some interest in this little trinket which belongs on the dvd rental shelf.<br /><br />but the award for wildest thankless performance goes to christopher walken ("catch me if you can") who goes completely over the top as 'modern' undertaker with his vegas-style funerals in a small provincial town. his character must have parachuted into the village because there's little reason for him to exist in this script.<br /><br />that said, if you'd like to see some top-notch actors engage in some low-brow humor then this one's for you, and if this isn't your cup-of-tea then try renting "harold and maude," the ultimate funeral movie that's still funny to this day.
