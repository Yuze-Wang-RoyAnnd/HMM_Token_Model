okay, first the good thing : if you saw the trailer then you know about 100% of the "scary/jumpy" moment of the movie. and yes, it's a good thing because you should just stick to the trailer and not go see the movie.<br /><br />i now understand why sarah michelle gellar did not stay alive in that movie for very long, she did not want to associate her name with this production. i wish her the best for "the return".<br /><br />you have to follow 3 different story in this movie, and they are all disconnected (in time and meaning) until the very end. and even then it's a very bad climax. and god forbid even open the door to another sequel.<br /><br />yes, in this movie, "the rage and fury" is on the move. no need to visit the house anymore, just be close to someone who when inside and you're done. it's not a curse anymore it's kinda like a virus. go inside the house, get scared, return back to usa and spread the joy in your apartment building.<br /><br />it's not that difficult to follow, but you just don't really care about anyone. the plot line is slim to none and you have many scene in this movie where you just laugh and shake your head... milk anyone?? i saw ju-on 2 at the fantasia movie festival last summer, different story completely but much better than this dud. it's not a remake, but this time, maybe they should have simply done a remake....<br /><br />if you must see it, wait for the dvd.
