drifting around on bootlegs, sometimes thought an urban comic book legend, the first ff movie is pretty much as bad as everyone fears. i guess marvel comics now pretends it doesn't exist, what with the 2005 version out in theaters earlier this year. but it's out there, a reminder and the last of the first wave of bad, low budget marvel super-hero adaptations (captain america, punisher, most of the tv movies). 'low budget' is too easy a description for this ff pic. due to basically no funds, showing the powers of the super foursome was limited to very quick shots (mr.fantastic), quasi-animation (torch), and fades (invisible girl-the easiest to do). the thing suit was not bad and probably half the budget; the face part was especially almost convincing. the acting? alex hyde-white as reed is pretty good; the other 3 are ok, tho jay as johnny acts like a spaz at times to sort of show off his 'fiery' temper. the dialog is comic-book style, and it's the supporting cast which ends up floundering trying to make it work. dr.doom is way over melodramatic and unintentionally comical, and his two main henchmen are a case study of how not to act or write dialog.<br /><br />the plot? not too good. it was quite faithful to the origin story of the ff (more so than the later big budget version), and even though the non-budget, again, restricted showing, for example, the actual crash landing, it kept the essential ingredients of how they discovered their powers in an isolated area - it's the best part of the picture, tho you have to wait a full half-hour for it. i also found the music odd in places; when the 4 are bathed in those cosmic rays, a kind of church choir is heard, as if it's a religious experience. the rest of it, however, is hopeless. even with no budget, the story could have done without the jeweler character (resembling the mole man villain of the books); it spends way too much time with him and his underground gang, as well as the blind alicia. these sections are a waste of celluloid and very boring. the climactic struggle with doom & his men starts fine, but degenerates into an awful mess as the torch races a laser beam (cool animation but belonging in a cartoon). fans can have a laugh at the bad ff fx and witless storyline, if they don't get depressed & outraged first.
