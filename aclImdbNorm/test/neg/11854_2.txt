i am a huge eric roberts fan, i collect his movies and so far has get to 60. but i'm honest to say that sometimes he really makes awful movies. but hey that's why i like him - he is entertaining.<br /><br />but this one has to take the price, i can't stop wonder why. somehow they managed to get eric and also corbin bernsen to the picture.<br /><br />while bernsen is plain awful (i really don't like him), roberts manage to be the best thing in the movie (and that doesn't mean much). he practically do it on routine basis.<br /><br />the female lead (brasselle) looks like a plastic doll and acts like one to. and tim abell and his crew looks like action-man plastic dolls and acts like those to.<br /><br />the plot is really embarrasing. i haven't seen any of the carnosaur movies so i can't recall on the footage that has been added from there, but it explains some things. but still there are holes huge as craters in the plot.<br /><br />spoilers alert<br /><br />the first attacks are located outside the laboratory in the woods nearby. but at the end they blow the whole laboratory in pieces and just relax that everything is over, but they forgot about the ones outside??????<br /><br />when the helicopter pilot is eaten alive i wonder how she couldn't notice a t-rex climbing into the chopper????<br /><br />the guys in orange overalls is my favourite - what are they doing, out for a jogging round or what??<br /><br />of course there are a b-movie standard sex-scene with silicon titties involved too. this time it's lorissa mccomas that greets us. i don't have any problem with that (she looks awful) but to look at a guy squeezing tits and being on the verge of climax for 8!!!! minutes is just tooo long.<br /><br />shame on you all (including eric roberts) - now i look forward to watch con games (i wonder???)
