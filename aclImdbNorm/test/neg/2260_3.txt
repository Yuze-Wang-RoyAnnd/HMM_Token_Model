margaret mitchell spins in her grave every time somebody watches this mess! fine costuming and sets can't even begin to overwhelm lackluster performances by joanne whalley (as the title character) and the ever-bland timothy dalton (as rhett). even worse than the acting--and perhaps partially explaining it--is the script, which is astoundingly cliched and predictable. add to that hellishly bad script a score that'll have you cringing, and you've got a disaster i wouldn't wish on any viewer. scarlett is just amazingly lousy, and i can't imagine how it ever got made, much less made it to video.
