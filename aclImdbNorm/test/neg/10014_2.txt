at the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called 'the final executioner'.. at least where i come from. a bloke is trained by an ex-cop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood.. and that's about it. lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue. has one of the weirdest array of costumes i've seen in a film for a while, and a massive fortress which is apparently only run by 7 people. great job on the dubbing too guys(!) best moment: when our hero loses a swordfight and is about to be skewered through the neck, he just gets out his gun and bang! why not do that earlier? it's a mystery. as is why anyone would want to sit through this in the first place. i'm still puzzling over that one myself now.. 2/10
