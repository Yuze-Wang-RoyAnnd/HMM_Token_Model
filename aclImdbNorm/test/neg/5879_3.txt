i picked up this movie because it caught my eye as movie with a jewish comedy focus - something i had not seen before. <br /><br />i approached this film with an open mind, and was interested in the way it began. the opening is well put together, and the first half of the film gave me many reasons to laugh, and this is good.<br /><br />however, the humor soon became repetitive, the plot became confused and strained, and i realized i was no longer enjoying the film. i have tried to avoid saying this, but the movie became rather "cheap" - not a bad thing for a comedy if the humor holds up, but it didn't. i confess that i may have missed some of the humour, not being jewish myself, and having little experience with jewish culture. however, considering how heavily telegraphed the bulk of the humour was in this film, it's unlikely i missed much.<br /><br />the idea is a good one, and perhaps if a little more thought was put into it the film would have been watchable all the way through. i wish i could give the movie a higher rating, but strictly speaking it would have been better as a tv series or as a series of skits. there was just not enough worthwhile fresh material for a full-length movie.<br /><br />one thing to say about the casting - the lead role looked as if it had been designed with ben stiller in mind, but i don't think the movie would have been any more worthwhile if he had been in it.
